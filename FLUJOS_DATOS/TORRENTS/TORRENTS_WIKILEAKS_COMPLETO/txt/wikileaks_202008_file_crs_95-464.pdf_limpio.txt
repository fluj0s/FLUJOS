or selfimposed statutory restriction upon its authority congress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel information needed to discharge its legislative function from executive agencies private persons and organizations and within certain constraints the information so obtained may be made public more particularly although there is express provision of the constitution which

court have firmly established that the investigatory power of congress is so essential to the legislative function as to be implicit in the general vesting of legislative power in congress2 thus in eastland v united states servicemen s fund the court explained that the scope of its power of inquiry is as penetrating and farreaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the constitution3 in watkins v united states the court further described the breadth of the power of inquiry the power of the congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process that power is broad it encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statues4 the court went on to emphasize that congress investigative power is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government department the investigative power it stated comprehends probes into departments of the federal government to expose corruption inefficiency or waste 5 the first congresses it continued held inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement of government officials6 and subsequently in series of decisions the court recognized the danger to effective and honest conduct of the government if the legislative power to probe corruption in the executive branch were unduly hampered7 accordingly the court stated it recognizes the power of the congress to inquire into and publicize corruption maladministration or inefficiencies in the agencies of government8 but while the congressional power of inquiry is broad it is not unlimited the supreme court has admonished that the power to investigate may be exercised only in aid of the legislative function9 and cannot be used to expose for the sake of exposure alone the watkins court underlined these limitations there is general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of the congress nor is the congress law enforcement or trial agency these are functions of the executive and judicial departments of government inquiry is an end in itself it must be related to and in furtherance of legitimate task of the congress 10 moreover an investigating committee has only the power to inquire into matters within the scope of the authority delegated to it by its parent body11 but once having established its jurisdiction and authority and the pertinence of the matter under inquiry to its area of authority committees investigative purview is substantial and wideranging 12 the foundation cases establishing congress broad power to probe are illustrative and illuminating they arose out of the teapot dome investigations the 1920s scandal regarding oil

daughertys justice department to prosecute the alleged government malefactors when congressional committees attempting to investigate came up against refusals by subpoenaed witnesses to provide information the issue went to the supreme court and provided it with the opportunity to issue seminal decision describing the constitutional basis and reach of congressional oversight in mcgrain v daugherty13 the supreme court focused specifical ly on congress authority to study charges of misfeasance and nonfeasance in the department of justice the court noted with approval that the subject to be investigated by the congressional committee was the administration of the department of justicewhether its functions were being properly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected and particularly whether the attorney general and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings to punish crimes 14 in its decision the court sustained the contempt arrest of the attorney generals brother for withholding information from congress since congress would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit15 thus the supreme court unequivocally precluded any blanket claim by the executive that oversight could be barred regarding whether the attorney general and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings16 in another teapot dome case that reached the supreme court sinclair v united states17 different witness at the congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of congress the witness had noted th at lawsuit had been commenced between the government and the mammoth oil company and declared i shall reserve any evidence i may be able to give for those courts and shall respectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee 18 the supreme court upheld the witnesss conviction for contempt of congress the court considered nd rejected in unequivocal terms the witnesss contention that the pendency of lawsuits gave an excuse for withholding information neither the laws directing that such lawsuits be instituted nor the lawsuits themselves operated to divest the senate or the committee of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws 19 the court further explained it may be conceded that congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecut ion of pending suits but the authority of that body directly or through its committees to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits 20 in other words those persons having evidence in their possession including officers and employees of executive agencies can not lawfully assert that because lawsuits are pending involving the government the authority of the congress directly or through its committees to require pertinent disclosures is somehow abridged 13 273 us 135 151 1927 14 id

the clearest manner the independence of congress power to probe the coincidental focus on the justice department and the ability of committees to look deeply into all aspects of its sensitive law

accompanying process to enforce it has been deemed an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function21 properly authorized subpoena issued by committee or subcommittee has the some force or effect as subpoena issued by the parent house itself22 to validly issue subpoena individual committees or subcommittees must be delegated this authority both senate23 and house24 rules presently empower all standing committees and subcommittee to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents special or select committees must be specifically delegated that authority by senate or house resolution25 the rules or practices of standing committees may restrict the issuance of subpoenas only to full committees or in certain instances allow issuance by committee chairman alone with or without the concurrence of the ranking minority member as previously indicated committees may issue subpoenas in furtherance of an investigation within their subject matter jurisdiction as defined by senate 26 and house27 rules which confer both legislative and oversight jurisdiction subpoenas may be issued on the basis of either source of authority

committees authority alleged constitutional rights violations subpoena breadth has only limited remedies available to raise such objections the supreme court has ruled that courts may not enjoin the issuance of congressional subpoena holding that the speech or debate clause of the constitution30 provides an absolute bar to judicial interference with such compulsory process31 as consequence witness sole remedy generally is to refuse to comply risk being cited for contempt and then raise objections as defense in contempt prosecution challenges to the legal sufficiency of subpoenas must overcome formidable judicial obstacles the standard to be applied in determining wh ether the congressional investigating power has been properly asserted was articulated in wilkinson v united states 1 the committees investigation of the broad subject matter area must be authorized by congress 2 the investigation must be pursuant to valid legislative purpose and 3 the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the broad subject matter areas which have been authorized by the congress 32 with respect to authorization committees author ity derives from the enabling rule or resolution of its parent body in construing the scope of such authorizations the supreme court has adopted mode of analysis not unlike that ordinarily foll owed in determining the meaning of statute it looks first to the words of the authorizing rule or resolution itself and then if necessary to the usual sources of legislative history including floor statements reports and past committee practice 33 as to the requirement of valid legislative purpose the supreme court has made it clear that congress does not have to state explicitly what it intends to do as result of an investigation34 when the purpose asserted is supported by reference to specific problems which in the past have been or in the future may be the subject of appropriate legislation it has been held that court cannot say that committee of congress exceeds its power when it seeks information in such areas 35 finally in determining the pertinency of questions to the subject matter under investigation the courts have required only that the specific inquiries be reasonably related to the subject matter under investigation36 an argument that pertinence must be shown with the degree of explicitness and clarity required by the due process clause has been held to confuse the standard applicable in those rare cases when the constitutional rights of individuals are implicated by congressional investigations with the far more common situation of the exercise of legislative oversight over the administration of the law whic h does not involve an individual constitutional right or prerogative it is of course well established that the courts will intervene to protect constitutional rights from infringement by congress including its committees and members 37 30 us const art i sec 6 cl 1 31 eastland v united states

information preparatory to investigatory hearings however with more frequency in recent years congressional committees have utilized staff conducted depositions as tool in exercising the investigatory power39 staff depositions afford number of advantages for committees engaged in complex investigations staff depositions may assist committees in obtaining sworn testimony quickly and confidentially without the necessity of members devoting time to lengthy hearings which may be unproductive because witnesses do not have the facts needed by the committee or refuse to cooperate depositions are conducted in private and may be more conducive to candid responses than would be the case at public hearing statements made by witnesses that might defame or even tend to incriminate third parties can be verified before they are repeated in an open hearing depositions can enable committee to prepare for the questioning of witnesses at hearing or provide screening process which can obviate the need to call some witnesses the deposition process also allows questioning of witnesses outside of wa shington thereby avoiding the inconvenience of conducting field hearings requiring the presence of members certain disadvantages may also inhere unrestrained staff may be tempted to engage in tangential inquiries also depositions present cold record of witnesss testimony and may not be as useful for members as in person presentations finally in the current absence of any definitive case law precedent legal questions may be raised concerning the ability to enforce subpoena for staff deposition by means of contempt sanctions and to the applicability to such deposition of various statutes that proscribe false material statements 40 at present neither house has rules that expressly authorize staff depositions on number of occasions such specific authority has been granted pursuant to senate and house resolutions41 when granted committee will normally adopt procedures for taking depositions including provisions for notice with or without subpoena transcription of the deposition the right to be accompanied by counsel and the manner in which objections to questions are to be

part that person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself the privilege against selfincrimination is available to witness in congressional investigation43 when witness before committee asserts his constitutional privilege the committee may obtain court order which compels him to testify and grants him immunity against the use of his testimony and information derived from that testimony in subsequent criminal prosecution he may still be prosecuted on the basis of other evidence the privilege against selfincrimination is an exception to the publics right to every persons evidence however witness fifth amendment privilege can be restricted if the government chooses to grant him immunity immunity is considered to provide the witness with the constitutional equivalent of his fifth amendment privilege 44 immunity grants may be required in the course of an investigation because many offenses are of such character that the only persons capable of giving useful testimony are those implicated in the crime45 such grants may be militated when committee is convinced that the testimony elicited will produce new or vital facts that would otherwise be unavailable or to allow witness to implicate persons of greater rank or authority grants of immunity have figured prominently in number of major congressional investigations including watergate john dean and jeb magruder and irancontra oliver north and john poindexter the scope of the immunity which is granted and the procedure to be employed are outlined in 18 usc 6002 6005 if witness before the house or senate or committee or subcommittee of either body asserts his privilege or if witness who has not yet been called is expected to assert his privilege an authorized representative of the house or of the committee may apply to federal district court for an order directing the i ndividual to testify or provide other information sought by the congress 46 if the testimony is to be before the full house or senate the request for the court order must be approved by an affirmative vote of majority of the members present of the house or senate if the testimony is to be given before committee or subcommittee the request for the order must be approved by an affirmative vote of twothirds of the members of the full committee 47 at least ten days prior to applying to the court for the order the attorney general48 must be notified of the congress intent to seek the order49 and issuance of the order will be delayed by the court for as much as twenty additional days at the request

information under seal neither the attorney general nor an independent counsel would have right to veto committees application for immunity51 the role of the court in issuing the order is ministerial and therefore if the procedural requirements under the statutes are met the court may not refuse to issue the order or impose conditions on the grant of immunity52 however although the court lacks power to review the advisability of granti ng immunity it might be able to consider the jurisdiction of congress and the committee over the subject area and the relevance of the information that is sought to the committees inquiry53 after an immunity order has been issued by the court and communicated to the witness by the chairman the witness can longer decline to testify on the basis of his privilege but testimony or other information compelled under the order or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information may be used against the witness in any criminal case except prosecution for perjury giving false statement or otherwise failing to comply with the order 54 the immunity that is granted is use immunity not transactional immunity55 that is neither the immunized testimony that the witness gives to the committee nor information derived from that testimony may be used against him in subsequent criminal prosecution except one for falsely testifying to the committee or for contempt however he may be convicted of the crime the transaction on the basis of evidence independently obtained by the prosecution and sealed before his congressional testimony andor on the basis of information obtained after his congressional appearance but which was not derived either directly or indirectly from his congressional testimony in determining whether to grant immunity to witness committee may consider on the one hand its need for his testimony in order to perform its legislative oversight and informing functions and on the other the possibility that the witness immunized congressional testimony could jeopardize successful criminal prosecution against him if witness is prosecuted after giving immunized testimony the burden is on the prosecutor to establish that the case was not based on the witness previous testimony or evidence derived therefrom 56 recent appellate court decisions reversing the convictions of key irancontra figures lt colonel oliver north57 and rear admiral john poindexter58 appear to make the prosecutorial burden substantially more difficult if not insurmountable in high profile cases despite extraordinary efforts by the independent counsel and his staff to avoid being exposed to any of norths or poindexters immunized congressional testimony and the submission of sealed packets of evidence to the district court to show that the material was obtained independently of any immunized testimony to congress the appeals court in both cases remanded the cases for 51 see hr rept 911549

indirectly used immunized testimony the court of appeals in north emphasized that the insulation of the prosecution from exposure to the immunized congressional testimony does not automatically prove that this testimony was not used against the defendant59 the court held that kastigar is instead violated whenever the prosecution puts on witness whose testimony is shaped directly or indirectly by compelled testimony regardless of how or by whom he was exposed to that compelled testimony 60 from this the court reasoned that the use of immunized testimony to augment or refresh recollection is an evidentiary use and must therefore be strictly scrutinized under the kastigar standard61 thus the court of appeals held that the presentation of testimony of grand jury or trial witnesses that has been derived from or influenced by the defendants immunized testimony was forbidden use of the compelled testimony under both the fifth amendment and kastigar 62 upon remanding the case to the district court the court of appeals insisted that strict application of the kastigar test be applied to the governments evidence if the prosecution of north was to continue the lower court was required to hold full kastigar hearing that would inquire into the content as well as the sources of the grand jury and trial witnesses testimony that inquiry must proceed witnessbywitness if necessary it will proceed line byline and itembyitem for each grand jury and trial witness the prosecution must show by preponderance of the evidence that use whatsoever was made of any of the immunized testimony either by the witness or by the office of independent counsel in questioning the witness this burden may be met by establishing that the witness was never exposed to norths immunized testimony or that the allegedly tainted testimony contains evidence not canned by the prosecution before such exposure occurred 63 similarly in poindexter the dc circuit court of appeals reversed all five of poindexters convictions because the independent counsel failed to show that poindexters compelled testimony was not used against him at his trial in violation of 18 usc 6002 and the fifth amendment 64 relying on the north standards outlined above the appeals court held that the testimony of many of the prosecutions key witnesse s including that of oliver north himself was impermissibly influenced by the witnesses exposure to poindexters immunized testimony for purposes of refreshment65 upon remand in both cases the independent counsel moved to 59 united states v north 920 f2d at 942 60 id emphasis in original 61 united states v north 910 f2d at 860 because several years passed between the events at issue and the trial of north the independent counsel had allowed potential witnesses to refresh their recollection with norths immunized testimony before they testified at the grand jury and at trial id 62 id at 865 see also id at 869 where immunity testimony is used before grand jury the prohibited act is simultaneous and coterminous with the presentation indeed they are one and the same the court of appeals criticized the district court for failing to inquire into the extent to which the substantive content of the witnesses testimony may have been shaped altered or affected by the defendants immunized testimony id at 863 the court further noted that it was legally irrelevant under kastigar if the witnesses themselves rather than the government presented the immunized testimony id at 871 63 id at 872 64 united states v poindexter supra 951

meet the strict standards set by the appeals court in its decisions while the north and poindexter rulings in way diminish committees authority to immunize testimony or the manner in which it secures imm unity pursuant to the statute it does alter the calculus as to whether to seek such immunity independent counsel lawrence walsh observed that the legislative branch has the power to decide whether it is more important perhaps even to destroy prosecution than to hold back testimony they need they make that decision it is not judicial decision or legal decision but political decision of the highest importance 66 it has been argued that the constitutional dimensions of the crisis created by the irancontra affair required the type of quick decisive disclosures that could result from congressional investigation but not from the slower more delib erate criminal investigation and prosecution process67 under this view the demands of national crisis may justify sacrificing the criminal prosecution of those involved in order to allow congress to uncover and make public the truth of the matter at issue the role of congress as overseer informer and legislator arguably warrants this sacrifice the question becomes more difficult as the sense of national crisis in particular circumstance is less acute and the object is for example to tradeoff lesser figure in order to reach someone higher up in matter involving simple fraud abuse or maladministration at an agency in the end casebycase assessments by congressional investigators will be needed guided by the sensitivity that these are political judgments g11g24g495g561g7g16g8g17g20g5g7g15g7g16g22g561g17g8g561g22g10g7g561g11g16g24g7g21g22g11g9g3g22g11g24g7g561 g18g17g25g7g20g561

investigative information demands it is through the contempt power that congress may act with ultimate force in response to actions which obstruct the legislative process in order to punish the contemnor andor to remove the obstruction the supreme court early recognized the power as an inherent attribute of c ongress legislative authority reasoning that if it did not possess this power it would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it 68 there are three different kinds of contempt proc eedings available both the house and senate may cite witness for contempt under their inherent contempt power or under statutory criminal contempt procedure the senate also has third option enforcement by means of statutory

individual is brought before the house or senate by the sergeantatarms tried at the bar of the body and can be imprisoned in the capitol jail the purpose of the imprisonment or other sanction may be either punitive or coercive thus the witness can be imprisoned for specified period of time as punishment or for an indefinite period but not at least in the case of the house beyond the end of the congress until he agrees to comply when witness is cited for contempt under the inherent contempt process prompt judicial review is available by means of petition for writ of habeas corpus in an inherent contempt proceeding although congress would not have to afford the contemnor the whole panoply of procedural rights available to defendant in criminal case notice and an opportunity to be heard would have to be granted also some of the requirements imposed by the courts under the statutory criminal contempt procedure might be mandated by the due process clause in the case of inherent contempt proceedings 70 the inherent contempt power has not been exerci sed by either house in over sixty years because it has been considered to be too cumbersome and time consuming for modern congress with heavy legislative workload that would be interrupted by trial at the bar 2 statutory contempt recognizing the problems with use of the inhere nt contempt process statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted in 1857 which with only minor amendments is codified today at 2 usc 192 and 194 under 2 usc 192 person who has been subpoenaed to testify or produce documents before the house or senate or committee and who fails to do so or who appears but refuses to respond to questions is guilty of misdemeanor punishable by fine of up to 1000 and imprisonment for up to one year section 194 establishes the procedure to be followed if the house or senate refers witness to the courts for criminal prosecution contempt citation must be approved by the subcommittee the full committee and the full house or senate or by the presiding officer if congress is not in session the criminal procedure is punitive in nature it is not coercive because witness generally will not be able to purge himself by testifying or supplying subpoenaed documents after he has been voted in contempt by the committee and the house or the senate under the statute after contempt has been certified by the president of the senate or the speaker of the house it is the duty of the us attorney to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action it remains unclear whether the duty of the us attorney to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary since the sparse case law that is relevant to the question provides conflicting guidance 71 this potential conflict between the statutory language of 194 and the us attorneys prosecutorial discretion was highlighted by the inability of the house of representatives in 1982 to secure contempt prosecution against the administrator of the environmental protection agency ann burford burford at the direction of president reagan had asserted executive privilege as grounds for refusing to respond to subpoena demand for documents she was cited for contempt by the full house and the contempt resolution was certified by the speaker and 70 see groppi v leslie 404 us 496 1972 71 see todd d peterson

presentment to the grand jury relying on his prosecutorial discretion he deferred doing so the burford controversy may be seen as unusual involving highly sensitive political issues of the time in the vast majority of cases there is likely to be conflict between the interests of the two political branches and the us attorney can be expected to initiate prosecution in accordance with 194 3 civil contempt as an alternative to both the inherent contem pt power of each house and criminal contempt congress enacted civil contempt procedure which is applicable only to the senate72 upon application of the senate73 the federal district court is to issue an order to person refusing or threatening to refuse to comply with senate bpoena if the individual still refuses to comply he may be tried by the court in summary proceedings for contempt of court with sanctions being imposed to coerce his compliance civil contempt might be employed when the senate is more concerned with securing compliance with the subpoena or with clarifying legal issues than with punishing the contemnor civil contempt can be more expeditious than criminal proceeding and it also provides an element of flexibility allowing the subpoenaed party to test his legal defenses in court without necessarily risking criminal prosecution civil contempt is not authorized for use against executive branch officials refusing to comply with subpoena 4 alternatives to contempt when an executive branch official refuses to comply with congressional subpoena and the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation and compromise none of the three types of contempt proceedings may be completely satisfactory the statutory civil contempt procedure in the senate is inapplicable in the case of subpoena to an executive branch official inherent contempt has been described as unseemly and cumbersome and if the criminal contempt method is utilized the us attorney who is an executive branch ap pointee may as occurred in the burford case rely on the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion as grounds for deferring seeking an indictment there are however various alternatives to the three modes of contempt in the case of an executive branch official 1 the contemnor could be cited for criminal contempt and be prosecuted by an independent counsel rather than by the us attorney if the standards under the law governing the appointment of such counsels are satisfied 2 the committee can seek declaratory or other relief in the courts 3 the appropriations for the agency or department involved can be cut off or reduced when requested information has not been supplied and 4 in an exceptional case the official might be impeached

willfully made 3 before competent tribunal 4 involving material matter the requirement of competent tribunal is important to note because it is an element of the offense within the particular control of committees for legislative committee to be competent for perjury purposes quorum must be present74 the problem has been ameliorated in recent years with the adoption of rules establishing less than majority of members as quorum for taking testimony normally two members for house committees 75 and one member for senate committees76 the requisite quorum must be present at the time the alleged perjurious statement is made not merely at the time the session convenes prosecution for perjury will lie for statements made only in the presence of committee staff unless the committee has deposition authority and has taken formal action to allow it 2 unsworn statements most statements made before congress at both the investigatory and hearing phases of oversight are unsworn the practice of swearing in all witnesses at hearings is rare practice but prosecutions may be brought to punish congre ssional witnesses for giving willfully false testimony not under oath under 18 usc 1001 false statements before department or agency of the united states are punishable by fine of up to 10000 or imprisonment up to five years or both the courts have held that section 1001 is applicable to false statements made to congressional committees 77 until recently it was thought that 18 usc 1505 which proscribes attempts to obstruct congressional proceedings was applicable to unsworn false statements however the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled in 1991 that section 1505 applies only to corrupt efforts to obstruct congressional inquiries by subverting witnesses not to false statements by the defendant himself in such proceedings 78

and at times at the white house itself such probes have often become contentious provoking the executive to assert rights to shield from disclosure information congress deems essential to carry out its oversight functions the variety of grounds proffered are often lumped in an undifferentiated manner under the rubric executive privilege however in order to evaluate and assess the weight of such withholding claims it is more useful and accurate to distinguish between claims that have constitutional basis and those that do not and then to separate out amongst the nonconstitutional claims those based on law from those resting on executive policy preferences 74 christoffel v united states 378 us 89 1949 75 house rule xi 2 h 1 76 senate rule xxvi 7 2 77 united states v bramlett 348 us 503 509

rare instances the executive response to congressional demand to produce information may be an assertion of presidential executive privilege doctrine which like congress powers to investigate and cite for contempt has constitutional roots decision of the supreme court has yet resolved the question whether there are any circumstances in which the executive branch can refuse to provide information sought by the congress on the basis of executive privilege indeed most such disputes are settled short of litigation through employment of the political process and negotiations 79 and the few that reach judicial forum find the courts highly reluctant to rule on the merits80 however in united states v nixon 81 involving judicial subpoena issued to the president at the request of the watergate special prosecutor82 the supreme court found constitutional basis for the doctrine of executive privilege in the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constituti onal duties and in the separation of powers 83 and although it considered presidential communications with close advisors to be presumptively privileged the court rejected the presidents contention that the privilege was absolute precluding judicial review whenever it is asserted84 having concluded that in the case before it the claim of privilege was not absolute the court resolved the competing interests the presidents need for confidentiality vs the judiciarys need for the materials in criminal proceeding in manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch 85 and held that the judicial need for the tapes outweighed the presidents generalized interest in confidentiality 86 the court was careful to limit the scope of its decision noting that we are not here conc erned with the balance

of executive privilege in response to congressional subpoena in senate select committee on presidential campaign activities v nixon88 the court of appeals prior to the nixon ruling reviewed the presidents assertion of executive privilege as grounds for not complying with senate committee subpoena for tape recordings89 the appeals court found that the presumption that the public interest favors confidentiality in presidential communications can be defeated only by strong showing of need by another institution of governmenta showing that the responsibilities of that institution cannot responsibly be fulfilled without access to records of the presidents deliberations according to the court the showing requi red to overcome the presumption favoring confidentiality rests on the nature and appropriateness of the function in the performance of which the material is sought and the degree to which the material is necessary to its fulfillment the sufficiency of the committees showing must depend solely on whether the subpoenaed evidence is demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the committees functions 90 the court found that in the circumstances of that case the need for the tapes was merely cumulative in light of the fact that the house judiciary committee had begun an inquiry with express constitutional authority into impeachment of the president and the fact that the judiciary committee already had copies of the tapes subpoenaed by the senate committee91 since the kennedy administration it has been established by executive policy directives that presidential executive privilege may be asserted only by the president personally the latest such directive issued by president reagan in november 198292 and still in effect requires that when an agency head believes that congressional information request raises substantial questions of executive privilege he is to notify and consult with the attorney general and the counsel to the president if the matter is deemed to justify in vocation of the privilege it is reported to the president who makes his decision if the president invokes the privilege the agency head advises the requesting committee there has been only one instance in which the full house or senate has voted contempt citation against the head of an executive department or agency that of anne gorsuch burford

courts have held they must presume that the committees of congress will exercise their powers responsibly and with due regard for the rights of affected parties100 nor may court block congressional disclosure of information obtained from an agency or private party at least when disclosure would serve valid legislative purpose101 finally the legal obligation to surrender requested documents has

process exemption incorporated by exemption 5 of the freedom of information act foia103 but the courts have made it plain that the agency privileges made applicable to public requesters by exemption 5 as well as all the other exemptions of the foia are expressly inappl icable to the legislature this section is not authority to withhold information from congress104 in murphy v department of the army an appeals court explained that foia exemptions were basis for withholding from congress because of the obvious purpose of the congress to carve out for itself special right of access to privileged information not shared by others congress whether as body through committees or otherwise must have the widest possible access to executive branch information if it is to perform its manifold responsibilities effectively if one consequence of the facilitation of such access is that some information will be disclosed to congressional authorities but not to private persons that is but an incidental consequence of the need for informed and effective lawmakers 105 similar provision in the privacy act also prevents its use as withholding vehicle against congress106 frequently cited statute used to justify nondisclosure is the trade secrets act 18 usc 1905 criminal provision which generally proscribes the disclosure of trade secrets and confidential business information by federal officer or employee unless otherwise authorized by law there is indication in the legislative history of its revision and codification that it was intended to prevent agency disclosures to committees or to have it apply to congress and its employees or any other legislative branch support agency or its employees 107 and as matter of statutory construction it would have been unusual for congress to have subjected sub silento its staff to criminal sanctions for such disclosures particularly in light of its wellestablished oversight and investigative prerogatives and its speech or debate privilege in any event there appears little doubt that disclosure to congress of proprietary information covered by 1905 would be deemed to be authorized by law the supreme court in chrysler v brown 108 held that disclosure authorization can stem from both congressional enactments and agency regulations in this instance there are at least two potential sources of disclosure authorization the first is 2 usc 190d which directs all standing committees of the c ongress to engage in continuous legislative oversight of the administration and application of laws within their respective jurisdictions and may require government agency to assist in doing so in 1955 the attorney general of the united states opined that the authorization required by the trade secrets act was reasonably implied under 190d109 second source is the rules of each house authorizing committee oversight 103 5 usc 552b5 104 5 usc 552d 105 612 f2d 1151 115558 dc cir 1979 106 5 usc 552a b9 107 see discussion

congressional oversight of the conduct of civil and criminal enforcement matters by agencies and most particularly the department of justice doj has raised sensitive questions respecting the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by the executive and interference with protected rights of individuals who may be the subject of such enforcement actions however review of congressional investigations that have implicated doj or doj investigations over the past 70 years from the palmer raids and teapot dome to watergate and through irancontra and rocky flats110 demonstrates that doj has been consistently obliged to submit to congressional oversight regardless of whether litigation is pending so that congress is not delayed unduly in investigating misfeasance malfeasance or maladministration in doj or elsewhere number of these inquiries spawned seminal supreme court rulings that today provide the legal foundation for the broad congressional power of inquiry 111 all were contentious and involved executive claims that committee demands for agency documents and testimony were precluded on the basis of constitutional or common law privilege or policy in the majority of instances reviewed the testimony of subordinate doj employees such as line attorneys and fbi field agents was taken formally or informally and included detailed testimony about specific instances of the departments failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases in all instances investigating committees were provided with documents respecting open or closed cases that included prosecutorial memoranda fbi investigative reports summaries of fbi interviews memoranda and correspondence prepared during the pendency of cases confidential instructions outlining the procedures or guidelines to be followed for undercover operations and the surveillance and arrests of suspects and documents presented to grand juries not protected from disclosure by rule 6e of the federal rules of criminal procedure among other similar sensitive materials the reasons advanced by the executive for declining to provide information to congress about civil proceedings have included avoiding prejudicial pretrial publicity protecting the rights of innocent third parties protecting the identity of confidential informants preventing disclosure of the governments strategy in anticipated or pending judicial proceedings the potentially chilling effect on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by doj attorneys and precluding interference with the presidents constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws 112 as has been recounted previously the supreme court has repeatedly reaffirmed the breadth of congress right to investigate the governments conduct of criminal and civil

congress access to agency documents even in situations where the inquiry may result in the exposure of criminal corruption or maladministration of agency officials the supreme court has noted but surely congressional committee which is engaged in legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to halt whenever responses to its inquiries might potentially be harmful to witness in some distinct proceeding or when crime or wrongdoing is exposed114 nor does the actual pendency of litigation disable congress from the investigation of facts which have bearing on that litigation where the information sought is needed to determine what if any legislation should be enacted to prevent further ills115 although several lower court decisions have recognized that congressional hearings may have the result of generating prejudicial pretrial publicity they have not suggested that there are any constitutional or legal limitations on congress right to conduct an investigation during the pendency of judicial proceedings instead the case s have suggested approaches such as granting continuance or change of venue to deal with the publicity problem 116 for example the court in one of the leading cases delaney v united states entertained doubt that the committee acted lawfully within the constitutional powers of congress duly delegated to it but went on to describe the possible consequences of concurrent executive and congressional investigations we think that the united states is put to choice in this matter if the united states through its legislative department acting conscientiously pursuant to its conception of the public interest chooses to hold public hearing inevitably resulting in such damaging publicity prejudicial to person awaiting trial on pending indictment then the united states must accept the consequences that the judicial depart ment charged with the duty of assuring the defendant fair trial before an impartial jury may find it necessary to postpone the trial until by lapse of time the danger of the prejudice may reasonably be thought to have been substantially removed 117 the delaney court distinguished the case of congressional hearing generating publicity relating to an individual not under indictment at the time as was delaney such situation may present important differences from the instant case in such situation the investigative function of congress has its greatest utility congress it is informing itself so that it may take appropriate legislative action it is informing the executive so that existing laws may be enforced and it is informing the public so that democratic processes 114 hutcheson v united states 369 us 599 617 1962 115 sinclair v united states 279 us 263 294 1929 116 see eg delaney v united

also if as result of such legislative hearing an indictment is eventually procured against the public official then in the normal case there would be much greater lapse of time between the publicity accompanying the public hearing and the trial of the subsequently indicted official than would be the case if the legislative hearing were held while the accused is awaiting trial on pending indictment 118 the absence of indictment and the length of time between congressional hearing and criminal trial have been factors in courts rejecting claims that congressionally generated publicity prejudiced defendants119 finally in the context of adjudicatory administrative proceedings courts on occasion have held that pressures emanating from questioning of agency decisionmakers by members of congress may be sufficient to undermine the impartiality of the proceeding 120 but the courts have also made clear that mere inquiry and oversight of agency actions including agency proceedings that are quasiadjudicatory in nature will not be held to rise to the level of political pressure designed to influence particular proceedings that would require judicial condemnation121 thus the courts have recognized the potentially prejudicial effect congressional hearings can have on pending cases while not questioning the prerogatives of congress with respect to oversight and investigation the cases pose choice for the congress congressionally generated publicity may result in harming the prosecutorial effort of the executive but access to information under secure conditions can fulfill the congressional power of investigation and at the same time need not be inconsistent with the authority of the executive to pursue its case nonetheless it remains choice that is solely within congress discretion to make irrespective of the consequences 122 in the past the executive frequently has made broader claim that prosecution is an inherently executive function and that congressional access to information related to the exercise of that function is thereby limited prosecutorial discretion is seen as offlimits to congressional inquiry and access demands are viewed as interfering with the discretion traditionally enjoyed by the prosecutor with respect to pursuing criminal cases initially it must be noted that the supreme court has rejected the notion that prosecutorial discretion in criminal matters is an inherent or core executive function rather the court noted in 118 199 f2d at 115 119 see silverthorne v united states 400 f2d 627 9th cir 1968 cert denied 400 us 102 1971claim

removal conditions for independent counsels under the ethics in government act that the independent counsels prosecutorial powers are executive in that they have typically been performed by executive branch officials but held that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is in way central to the functioning of the executive branch124 the court therefore rejected claim that insulating the independent counsel from atwill presidential removal interfered with the presidents duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed interestingly the morrison court took the occasion to reiterate the fundamental nature of congress oversight function receiving reports or other information and oversight of the independent counsels activities are functions that we have recognized as generally incidental to the legislative function of congress citing mcgrain v daugherty 125 the breadth of morrison s ruling that the prosecutorial function is not an exclusive function of the executive was made clear in recent decision of the ninth circuit court of appeals in united states ex rel kelly v the boeing co126 which upheld against broad based separation of powers attack the constitutionality of the qui tam provisions of the false claims act vesting enforcement functions against agencies by private parties127 prosecution not being core or exclusive function of the executive cannot claim the constitutional stature of congress oversight prerogative in the absence of credible claim of encroachment or aggrandizement by the legislature of essential executive powers the supreme court has held the appropriate judicial test is one that determines whether the challenged legislative action prevents the executive branch from accomplishing its assigned functions and if so whether that impact is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of congress 128 123 487 us 654 1988 124 id at 69192 125 id at 694 126 9 f3d 743 9th cir 1993 127 boeing argued inter alia that congress could not vest enforcement functions outside the executive branch in private parties applying morrison the appeals court emphatically rejected the contention before comparing the qui tam provisions of the fca to the independent counsel provisions of the ethics in government act we must address boeings contention that only the executive branch has the power to enforce laws and therefore to prosecute violations of law it is clear to us that such absolute rule exists morrison itself indicates otherwise because that decision validated the independent counsel provisions of the ethics in government act even though it recognized that it is undeniable that the act reduces the amount of control or supervision that the attorney general and through him the president exercises over the investigation and prosecution of certain class of alleged criminal activity 487 us at 695 the court also stated in morrison that there is real dispute that the functions performed by the independent counsel are executive in the sense that they are law enforcement functions that typically have been undertaken by officials within the executive branch 487 us at 692 emphasis added use of the world typically in that sentence considered in light of the courts ultim ate conclusion upholding the independent counsel provisions must mean that prosecutorial functions need not always be undertaken by executive branch officials see stephanie aj dangel note is prosecution core executive function morrison v olson and the framers intent 99 yale lj 1069 1070 1990framers intended that prosecution would be undertaken by but not constitutionally assigned to executive officials and that such officials would typically but not always prosecute thus we reject boeings assertion that all prosecutorial power of any kind belongs to the executive branch 9 f3d at 751 emphasis supplied 128 nixon v administration of general services 433 us 425433 1977 commodity

unlike the action of court cannot stop prosecution or set limits on the management of particular case access to information by itself would not seem to distur b the authority and discretion of the executive branch to decide whether to prosecute case the assertion of prosecutorial discretion in the face of congressional demand for information is arguably akin to the generalized claim of confidentiality made in the watergate executive privilege cases that general claimlacking in specific demonstration of disruption of executive functionswas held to be overcome by the more focused demonstration of need for information by coordinate branch of government 129 given the legitimacy of congressional oversight and investigation of the law enforcement agencies of government and the need for access to information pursuant to such activities claim of prosecutorial discretion by itself would not seem to be sufficient to defeat congressional need for information the congressional action itself does not and cannot dictate prosecutorial policy or decisions in particular cases congress may enact statutes that influence prosecutorial policy and information relating to enforcement of the laws would seem necessary to perform that legislative function thus under the standard enunciated in morrison v olson and nixon v administrator of general services the fact that information is sought on the executives enforcement of criminal laws would not in itself seem to preclude congressional inquiry in light of the supreme courts consistent support of the power of legislative inquiry and in the absence of countervailing constitutional prerogative of the executive it is likely that court will be sensitive to the legislative importance of congressional committees on oversight and investigations and recognize that their interest in the objective and efficient operation of agencies serves legitimate and wholesome function with which we should not lightly interfere 130

secrecy rule thus when testimony or data is sought for its own sake for its intrinsic value in the furtherance of lawful investigation rather than to learn what took place before the grand jury it is not valid defense to disclosure that the same information was revealed to grand jury or that the same documents had been or were presently being examined by grand jury135 congressional committees have gained access to documents under this theory the courts ruling that the committees interest was in the documents themselves and not in the events that transpired before the grand jury136 however with respect to matters that reflect exactly what transpired in the grand jury such as transcripts of witness testimony rule 6e has been held to be bar to congressional access137 the case law would appear to indicate that ru 6e would not preclude disclosure of the following types of documents 1 documents within the possession of the departme nt of justice concerning particular case or investigation other than transcripts of grand jury proceedings and material indicating the identities of witnesses or jurors the substance of testimony the strategy or direction of the investigation the

evidence178 however where compliance with subpoena duces tecum would constitute an implicit testimonial authentication of the documents produced the privilege may apply179 there is particular formulation of words necessary to invoke the privilege all that is required is that the witness objection be stated in manner that the committee may be reasonably expected to understand as an attempt

answers would in themselves support conviction but also to those questions which if answered would serve as link in the chain of evidence that would tend to incriminate him183 the committee can review the assertion of the privilege by witness to determine its validity but the witness is not required to prove the precise hazard that he fears in regard to the assertion of the privilege in judicial proceedings the supreme court has advised to sustain the privilege it need only be evident from the implications of the question in the setting in which it is asked that responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result to reject claim it should be perfectly cl ear from careful consideration of all the circumstances of the case that the witness is mistaken and that the answers cannot possibly have tendency to incriminate 184 the basis for asserting the privilege was elaborated upon in lower court decision the privilege may only be asserted when there is reasonable apprehension on the part of the witness that his answer would furnish some evidence upon which he could be convicted of criminal offense or which would reveal sources from which evidence could be obtained that would lead to such conviction or to prosecution therefor once it has become apparent that the answers to question would expose witness to the danger of conviction or prosecution wider latitude is permitted the witness in refusing to answer other questions 185 the privilege against selfincrimination may be waived by declining to assert it specifically disclaiming it or testifying on the same matters as to which the privilege is later asserted however because of the importance of the privilege court will not construe an ambiguous statement of witness before committee as waiver186 finally it should be noted that the due process clause of the fifth amendment requires that the pertinency of the interrogation to the topic unde r the committees inquiry must be brought home to the witness at the time the questions are put to him187 unless the subject matter has been made to appear with undisputable clarity it is the duty of the investigative body upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency to state for the record the subject under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto 188 additionally to satisfy both the requirement of due process as well as the statutory requirement that refusal to 183 hoffman v united states 341 us 479 486 1951

speech press or assembly the court has held that the amendment also restricts congress in conducting investigations190 in the leading case involving the application of first amendment rights in congressional investigation barenblatt v united states 191 the court held that where first amendment rights are asse rted to bar government interrogation resolution of the issue always involves balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown thus unlike the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination the first amendment does not give witness an absolute right to refuse to respond to congressional demands for information 192 the court has held that in balancing the personal interest in privacy against the congressional need for information the critical element is the existence of and the weight to be ascribed to the interest of the congress in demanding disclosure from an unwilling witness193 in order to protect the rights of witnesses in cases involving the first amendment the courts have emphasized the requirements discussed above concerning authorization for the investigation delegation of power to investigate to the committee involved and the existence of legislative purpose 194 the supreme court has recognized the application of the first amendment to congressional investigations and although the amendment has frequently been asserted by witnesses as grounds for not complying with congressional demands for information the court has never relied on the first amendment as grounds for reversing criminal contempt of congress conviction 195 however the court has narrowly construed the scope of committees authority so 189 id deutch v united states 367 us 456 1961 190 watkins v

reasonably be sought was necessarily equally broad it was not reasonable to suppose that the subcommittee knew precisely what books and records were kept by the civil rights congress and therefore the

must give the grounds for his noncompliance upon the return of the subpoena as court of appeals stated in one case if the witness felt he could refuse complian ce because he considered the subpoena so broad as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure within the prohibition of the fourth amendment then to avoid contempt for complete noncompliance he was under an obligation to inform the subcommittee of his position the subcommittee would then have had the choice of adhering to the subpoena as formulated or of meeting the objection in light of any pertinent representations made by the witness 202 similarly if subpoenaed party is in doubt as to what records are required by subpoena or believes that it calls for documents not related to the investigation he must inform the committee where witness is unable to produce documents he will not be held in contempt unless he is responsible for their unavailability or is impeding justice by not explaining what happened to them 203 the application of the exclusionary rule to congressional committees is in some doubt and will depend on the precise facts of the situation it seems that documents which were unlawfully seized at the direction of congressional investigating committee may not be admitted into evidence in subsequent unrelated criminal prosecution because of the command of the exclusionary rule 204 in the absence of

precedents of the senate and the house of representatives which are founded on congress inherent constitutional prerogative to investigate establish that the acceptance of claim of attorneyclient or work product privilege rests in the sound discretion of congressional committee regardless of whether court would uphold the claim in the context of litigation in practice committee resolutions of claims of these privileges have involved pragmatic assessment of the needs of the individual committee to accomplish its legislative mission and the potential burdens and harms that may be imposed on claimant of the privilege if it is denied thus the exercise of committee discretion whether to accept claim of attorneyclient work product privilege has turned on weighing of the legislative need for disclosure against any possible resulting injury 206 more particularly the process of committee resolution of claims of privilege has traditionally been informed by weighing considerations of legislative need public policy and the statutory duty of congressional co mmittees to engage in continuous oversight of the application administration and execution of laws that fall within its jurisdiction207 against any possible injury to the witness in the par ticular circumstances of any situation committee may consider and evaluate the strength of claimants assertion in light of the pertinency of the documents or information sought to the subject of the investigation the practical unavailability of the documents or information from any other source the possible unavailability of the privilege to the claimant if it were to be raised in judicial forum and the committees assessment of the cooperation of the witness in the matter among other considerations valid claim of privilege free of any taint of waiver exception or other mitigating circumstance would merit substantial weight but any serious doubt as to the validity of the asserted claim would diminish its compelling character the discussion will begin with brief overview of the constitutional origins and basis for congress discretionary control over such claims of privilege and recent examples of

witness claims of privilege as with the legislatures inherent authority to investigate208 the discretion to entertain claims of privilege traces back to the model of the english parliament erskine mays treatise on the law privileges proceedings and usage of parliament the definitive authority on english parliamentary procedure specifically notes witness is however bound to answer all questions which the committee sees fit to put to him and cannot excuse himself for example on the ground that he may thereby subject himself to civil action or because he has taken an oath not to disclose the matter about which he is required to testify or because the matter was privileged communication to him as where solicitor is called upon to disclose the secrets of his client some of which would be sufficient grounds of excuse in court of law 209 the rare instances of the exercise of the prerogative to deny use of the privileges have been consistent in the rejection of the applicability of the privileges in the nineteenth century charles w woolley an attorney was found in contempt of the house and imprisoned for refusal to answer questions about scheme for bribing nators during andrew johnsons impeachment proceeding despite claim of attorneyclient privilege210 also in the notable investigation into the financing of the union pacific railroad and the activities of the credit mobilier house committee held joseph b stewart in contempt notwithstanding his assertion of attorneyclient privilege 211 more recently subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee has on number of occasions rejected claims of attorneyclient privilege212 court has ever questioned the assertion of the prerogative and both houses of congress have rejected opportunities to impose the attorneyclient privilege as binding rule for committee investigations 213 contemporary congressional practice has in fact evolved delicate balancing process to ensure its fair application thus the exercise of committee discretion has been held to turn on weighing of the legislative need against any possible injury to one asserting the privilege and the application of this test has involved painstaking examinations of potential detriment and relevant judicial precedents214 208 mcgrain v daugherty 273 us 135 174 1927 watkins v united states 354 us 178 187 1957 barenblatt v united states

committee prerogative in this area is the 1986 house action holding ralph and joseph bernstein in contempt for refusal to give the subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs of the house committee on foreign affairs requested information pertaining to their relations with ferdinand and imelda marcos their refusal rested primarily on the assertion of attorneyclient privilege215 the subcommittee rejected these claims on two grounds that the claim of privilege would not be upheld even in court and that congressional committee was obliged to decide whether to accept such claims of privilege apart from whether court would uphold the claim 216 the full committee bowing to the concerns and preferences of some members that it was not necessary under the circumstances of the matter to rely equally on the broader second ground recommended that the us attorney in presenting this matter proceed primarily and strongly with emphasis on the primary ground relied on by the subcommittee that this claim of privilege would not have been upheld even in court 217 thus it is clear that the recommendation to the full house which was adopted by an overwhelming vote of 35234218 encompassed full recognition of the prerogative to deny assertions of attorneyclient privilege senate practice and precedent are in strong and complementary accord with that of the house two denials by senate committees of claims of privilege serve to illustrate in march of 1989 the subcommittee on nuclear regulation of the senate committee on environment and public works commenced investigating claims that settlement agreements were being entered between employers and employees of nuclear facilities which placed restrictions on an employees ability to testify in nuclear regulatory commission proceedings relating to licensing and safety matters with respect to such facilities the subcommittee was seeking to determine the nature and extent of such restrictive agreements at particular facility and the prevalence and potential impact of such agreements in the industry generally subpoen as were issued and several were not complied with on the grounds of the attorneyclient and work

possesses the authority to determine the validity of any attorneyclient privilege that is asserted before the subcommittee committees or subcommittees authority to receive or compel testimony derives from the constitutional authority of the congress to conduct investigation and take testimony as necessary to carry out its legislative powers as an independent branch of government with such constit utional authority the congress must necessarily have the independent authority to determine the validity of nonconstitutional evidentiary privileges that are asserted before the congress 219 the opinion continued by observing that while it recognized its independent authority to rule on an assertion of the attorneyclient privilege the subcommittee will nonetheless look to judicial and other rulings in this area to guide the subcommittees determination220 finding that the holder of the privilege the employee in question has made extensive disclosures concerning 215 132 cong rec 30283062

the privilege regarding the agreement and has called the competence of his former attorneys into question the subcommittee ruled that the privilege would have been deemed waived by court denied the claim and ordered the attorneys to testify221 more recently the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations of the governmental affairs committee denied claim of attorneyclient privilege under unusual circumstances the subcommittee was investigating allegations that under the medicare secondary payer msp program insurance companies including provident life and accident company provident had failed to comply with their obligations to pay ce rtain claims as the primary payer with medicare being the secondary payer which resulted in sizeable overpayments by medicare the subcommittee subpoenaed many documents including one from provident which it refused to give upon the ground that it was cloaked by the attorneyclient privilege provident also argued that the subcommittee was bound by ruling to that effect made by federal district court in pending civil suit in order to prevent the author of the document from testifying before the subcommittee provident sought an injunction from the district court to prevent her testimony the court denied the injunction ruling that provident had failed to allege case or controversy that the issue was not ripe for judicial determination and that provident had failed to fulfill the equitable requirements for preliminary injunctive relief the court also noted that its earlier ruling on the attorneyclient privilege which is not of constitutional dimensions is certainly not binding on the congress of the united states 222 subsequently the chairman heard testimony and arguments on the claim in executive session he noted that the burden then as i see it is on you as the party claiming the privilege to demonstrate that the privilege exists and to tell us why on june 15 1990 the chairman ruled that provident had waived any privilege that might have attached to the document in question when it pr ovided the document to the department of justice 223 this historic congressional practice appears reflective of the widely divergent nature of the judicial and legislative forums the attorneyclient privilege is product of judicially developed public policy designed to foster an effective and fair adversary system the courts view the privilege as means to foster client confidence and encourage full disclosure to an attorney it is argued that free communication facilitates justice by promoting proper case preparation 224 it is also suggested that frivolous litigation is disc ouraged when based on full factual disclosure an attorney finds that his clients case is not strong one225 of critical importance here is the understanding that the role of attorneyclient privilege is designed for and properly confined to the adversary process the adjudicatory resolution of conflicting claims of individual obligations in civil or criminal proceeding but the necessity to protect the individual interest in the adversary process is less compelling in an inves tigative setting where legislative committee is not empowered to adjudicate the liberty or property interests of witness this is the import of those cases which have recognized that only infrequently have witnesses in congressional 221 id at 15

an adjudicative proceeding226 indeed the suggestion that the investigatory author ity of the legislative branch of government is subject to nonconstitutional common law rules developed by the judicial branch to govern its proceedings is arguably contrary to the concept of separation of powers it would in effect permit the judiciary to determine congressional procedures and is therefore difficult to reconcile with the constitutional authority granted each house of congress to determine its own rules 227 moreover importation of the privileges and procedures of the judicial forum is likely to have paralyzing effect on the investigatory process of the legislature such judicialization is antithetical to the consensus interest oriented approach to policy development of the legislative process finally an assertion that the denial of the privil ege in the congressional setting would destroy the privilege elsewhere appears neither supported by experience nor reason parliaments rule has not impaired the practice of law in england nor has its limited use here inflicted any apparent damage on the practice of the profession congressional investigations in the face of claims of executive privilege or the revelations of trade secrets have not diminished the general utility of these privileges nor undermined the reasons they continue to be recognized by the courts moreover the assertion implies that current law is an impregnable barrier to disclosure of confidential communications when in fact the privilege is of course an exception to the general rule of disclosure and is riddled with qualifications and exceptions and has been subject as well as to the significant current development of the waiver doctrine thus there can be absolute certainty that communications with an attorney will not be revealed 228 moreover with respect to the workproduct privile ge it has always been recognized that it is qualified privilege which may be overcome by sufficient showing of need the supreme court indicated in the very case in which it created the doctrine that we do not mean to say that all materials obtained or prepared with an eye toward litigation are necessarily free from discovery in all cases 229 thus the courts have repeatedly held that the work product privilege is not absolute but rather is only qualified protection against disclosure230 as one court has indicated its immunity retreats as necessity and good cause is shown for its production in balance of competing interests 231 in fact because the work product doctrine is so readily overcome when production of material is important to the discovery of needed information some courts have refused to call the doctrine 226 hannah v larche 363 us 420 425 1960 see also united states v fort 443 f2d 670 dc cir 1970

corp232 the court stated that the work product principle is not privilege at all it is merely requirement that very good cause be shown if the disclosure is made in the course of lawyers preparation of case b requirements for assertion of the attorneyclient privilege in making the assessment whether to accept claim of attorneyclient privilege committees often have reference to whether court would accept the claim had it been in that forum this section and those that follow detail the judicial requirements for proper assertion of the claim how the privilege may be waived and circumstances under which it may not be claimed at all although the attorneyclient privilege today is seen to rest on the theory that encouraging clients to make the fullest disclosure to their attorneys enables them to act more effectively justly and expeditiously and that these benefits outweigh the risks posed by not allowing full disclosure in court 233 even its leading proponent dean wigmore concedes the unverifiability of the assumption and advises that its use be strictly limited its benefits are all indirect and speculative its obstruction is plain and concreteit is worth preserving for the sake of general policy but it is nonetheless an obstacle to the investigation of truth it ought to be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle234 the courts have heeded wigmores admonition235 one important manifestation of the judicial policy of strict confinement is the universal recognition that the burden of establishing the existence of the privilege rests with the party asserting the privilege236 moreover blanket assertions of the privilege have been deemed unacceptable237 and are strongly disfavored238 the proponent must conclusively prove each element of the privilege thus claimant must reveal specific facts which would establish that the 232 210 fsupp 483 485 ed pa 1962 cert denied sub nom general electric co v kirkpatrick 372

are insufficient and it must demonstrate that the privilege has not expressly or impliedly waived finally it should be noted that the assertion that the disclosure of privileged material to congressional committee would waive the privilege in any future litigation was specifically considered and rejected by the dc circuit court of appeals in murphy v department of the army 239 indeed there appears to be case holding otherwise and several which have followed murphy 240 c waiver of the attorneyclient privilege because of the privileges inhibitory effect on the truthfinding process and its impairment of the publics right to every mans evidence241 modern liberal discovery rules have taken narrow view of the privilege242 this tendency toward limiting the privilege is most clearly manifested in the strict standard of waiver243 thus the voluntary disclosure of privileged information whether by the client or the attorney with the clients consent waives the privilege244 because it destroys the confidentiality of communication and thereby undermines the justification for preventing compelled disclosures245 waiver need not be express246 nor is it necessary that the client waive the privilege knowingly247 waiver may be evidenced by word or act248 but may be inferred from failure to speak or act when words or action would be necessary to preserve confidentiality249 courts regularly hold that the privilege is waived as to the material disclosed when the client or his attorney deliberately discloses the contents of privileged communication such as when answering interrogatories testifying in court or at examination before trial submitting affidavits or pleadings to the court or in transacting business with third party 250 furthermore the courts have held that less than full disclosure will often cause waiver not only as to disclosed communications but also as to communications relating to the same subject matter that were not themselves disclosed 251 by partial disclosure the client may be voluntarily waiving the privilege as to that which he considers favorable to his position but attempting to 239 613 f2d 1151 1155 dc cir 1979 240 see in re sunrise

considers unfavorable252 selective assertion or disclosure usually involves material issue in the proceeding and there is great likelihood that the information disclosed is false or intended to mislead the other party253 thus pleading an advice of counsel defense which puts the attorneys advice in issue254 has been held to waive the privilege as to all communications relating to that advice the rationale for the subject matter waiver rule is one of fairness professor wigmore has stated the principle as follows when the clients conduct touches certain point of disclosure fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not he cannot be allowed after disclosing as much as he pleases to withhold the remainder it is therefore designed to prevent the client from using the attorneyclient privilege offensively as an additional weapon the courts also have severely limited the attorneyclient privilege through the development of an implied waiver doctrine thus where client shares his attorneyclient communications with third party the communications between attorney and client are longer strictly confidential and the client has waived his privilege over them 255 even if the client attempts to keep communications confidential by having the third party agree not to disclose the communications to anyone else the courts will still consider confidentiality between attorney and client breached and the communication longer privileged256 courts have applied this concept of confidentiality narrowly to prevent corporatio ns from sharing an attorneyclient communication with an ally and then shielding the communication from grand jury or adversary257 as general rule courts also apply the waiver rule to disclosures made to government agencies258 thus person or corporation who voluntarily discloses confidential attorneyclient communications to government agency loses the right to later assert privilege for those communications while some lower courts have adopted limited waiver rule which allows corporations to share their confidential attorneyclient communications with agencies such as the sec without having to waive the privileged status of these documents against other parties259 it is distinctly 252 perrigrion v bergen brunswick corp 77 frd 455 461 nd calif 1978 hercules inc v exxon corp 434 f supp 136 156 d eel

information as well as the details underlying the data which was to be published will not enjoy the privilege263 the facts and circumstances of in re martin marietta corporation264 illustrate the strict manner in which the courts have applied the waiver doctrine in that case mail fraud defendant sought documents and the underlying factual details for statements made in them submitted by his former employer to the united states attorney and the department of defense in its efforts to settle criminal and administrative proceedings then pending against it the court noted that in position paper to the us attorney describing why the company should not be indicted it was asserted of those consulted within the company all will testify that any qualms they had about the arrangement had nothing to do with worries about fraud and there is evidence testimonial or documentary that any company officials in the meeting of november 17 1983 except mr pollard and his maxim employees understood that maxim had departed from the strict procedures of its ivi contract 265 the appeals court held that these and similar disclosures made to the defense department in an administrative settlement agreement waived whatever privilege it had with respect to the submitted documents and their underlying details d exceptions to the attorneyclient privilege absent waiver the attorneyclient privilege generally protects from disclosure communications from client to his lawyer or his lawyers agent relating to the lawyers rendering of legal advice which was made with the expectation of confidentiality but not in furtherance of future crime fraud or tort however the courts have strictly confined the privilege and developed number of important qualifications and exceptions first the case law has consistently emphasized that one of the essential elements of the attorney client privilege is that the attorney be acting as an attorney and that the communication be made for the purpose of securing legal services the privilege therefore does not attach to incidental legal advice given by an attorney acting outside the scope of his role as attorney acting as lawyer encompasses the whole orbit of legal functions when he acts as an advisor the attorney must give predominantly legal advice to retain his clients privilege of nondisclosure not solely or even largely business advice 266 in order to ascertain whether an attorney is acting in legal or business advisory capacity the courts have held it proper to question either the client or the attorney regarding the general nature of the attorneys services to his client the scope of his authority as agent and the substance of 260 in re john doe corporation 675 f2d 482 2d cir 1982 261 in re martin marietta corp 856 f2d

third parties267 indeed invocation of the privilege may be predicated on revealing facts tending to establish the existence of an attorneyclient relation further manifestation of the judicial proclivity to confine the scope of the privilege is the general rule requiring disclosure of the fact of employment the identity of the person employing him or the name of the real party in interest the terms of the employment and such related facts as the clients address occupation or business and the amount of the fee and who paid it 268 the courts have reasoned that the existence of the relation of attorney and client is not privileged communication the privilege pertains to the subject matter and not to the fact of the employment as attorney another significant exception to the privilege occurs when communication between client and attorney is for the purpose of committing crime or perpetuating fraud at some future time269 the policy reasons for this exception are obvious society has an interest in protecting the confidences of client to his lawyer even concerning already committed crimes frauds and torts the harm from nondisclosure is limited because the past event can longer be prevented society also has an interest in protecting the confidence of client who seeks legal advice about neutral acts but society has interest in facilitating the commission of contemplated but not yet committed crimes torts or frauds on the contrary society has every interest in forestalling such acts therefore the attorneyclient privilege has been held not to attach to such acts g24g11g11g495g561g20g11g9g10g22g21g561g17g8g561g15g11g16g17g20g11g22g27g561g18g3g20g22g27g561g15g7g15g4g7g20g21g561g11g16g561

its committees while minority members are specifically accorded some rights eg whenever hearing is conducted on any measure or matter the minority may upon the written request of majority of the minority members to the chairman before the completion of the hearing call witnesses selected by the minority and presumably request documents270 house or committee rules authorize ranking minority members or individual members on their own to institute official committee investigations hold hearings or to issue subpoenas individual members may seek the voluntary cooperation of agency officials or private persons but judicial precedent has recognized right in an individual member other than the 267 colton v us 306 f2d 633 636 638 2d cir 1962 us v tellier 255 f2d 441 2d cir 1958 jp foley co

context of oversight without the permission of majority of the committee or its chair the question of the nature and scope of the rights of minority party members in the investigatory process came into sharp focus in the 103d congress then for the first time in over decade both houses and the white house were in the control of one party while at the same time the whitewater matter began to emerge as matter of serious political importance principal jurisdiction over many of the areas of concern fell within mandates of the house and senate banking committees the ranking minority member of the house banking committee was particularly aggressive in seeking to obtain documents and testimony from the office of thrift supervision ots and the resolution trust corporation rtc the agencies handling the investigation of the failure of the madison guarantee savings loan association and related matters the agencies refused to turn over what were claimed by the ranking minority member to be key documents and were supported by the chairman of the banking committee who directed the agencies not to cooperate on the grounds that investigation had been authorized by the committee nor were hearings on the matter contemplated the ranking minority memb er brought suit to compel disclosure of the documents 272 an obstacle to the suit was 1983 court ruling in lee v kelley 273 there court held inter alia that an attempt by senator jesse helms to intervene in the case in order to unseal fbi tapes and transcripts concerning martin luther king to enable him to utilize the information as part of the debate on legislation proposing to establish national holiday commemorating kings birth would be dismissed as an exercise of the courts equitable discretion because senator helms action was an effort to enlist the court in his dispute with fellow legislators helms had argued that because committee hearings were being conducted to inform senators of facts to justify or defeat the passage of the legislation he was seeking to fill that void by performing the investigative function the senate leadership had decided to forego 274 the district court ruled that it is not for this court to review the adequacy of the deliberative process of the senate leadership to conclude otherwise would represent an obvious intrusion by the judiciary into the legislative arena in any event the proper forum for this dispute is the senate for it would be unwise to permit the federal courts to become higher legislature where congressman who has failed to persuade his colleagues can always

minority member sought to compel disclosure of the documents under the freedom of information act foia276 which explicitly exempts congress from its withholding provisions 277 and under the administrative procedure act apa278 alleging that the documents were arbitrarily and capriciously withheld it was not successful while finding the claims technically justiciable279 the district court held that it had to invoke the district of columbia circuits doctrine of equitable or remedial discretion and dismiss the claims since this was case in which congressional plaintiffs dispute is primarily with his or her fellow legislators th court concluded that it is clear that representative leachs complaint derives solely from his failure to persuade his colleagues to authorize his request for the documents in question and that plaintiff thus has clear collegial remedy capable of affording him substantial relief 280 despite the apparent difficulty in obtaining judicial redress some measure of practical success was achieved as result of intense public pressure brought to bear by the minority and its supporters on the majority party and the white house justice department investigation into the handling of the rtc recommendation to the united states attorneys office for further criminal investigation was commenced in november 1993 the white house in december 1993 authorized turning over whitewater documents to the justice department team investigating the handling of the matter in january 1994 the white house agreed to the appointment by the attorney general of an independent counsel w ith broad authority to investigate whitewater matters both houses agreed in principle in march 1994 to hold hearings and in july and august 1994 hearings were held by the house and senate banking committees the legal challenge thus may be viewed as part the overall strategy to fo rce public hearings by congress although in the long run the precedent established may have virtually foreclosed future resort to the courts under analogous circumstances the leach court also suggested that the possibility of collegial remedy for the minority exists pointing to 5 usc 2954 under which small groups of members of the house government reform and oversight and senate governmental affairs committees can request information from executive agencies without the need of formal committee action 281 however the precise scope and efficacy of this provision is uncertain 5 usc 2954 is derived from section 2 of the act of may 29 1928282 which originally referred not to the current committees generally overseeing government agency operations but their predecessors the house and senate committees on expenditures in the executive departments the principal purpose of the 1928 act embodied in its first section was to repeal legislation which required the submission to the congress of some 128 reports many of which had become 276 5 usc 552 1988 277 see 5 usc 552d

purpose and were not printed by the house of representatives283 section 2 of the 1928 act contains the language which has been codified in 5 usc 2954 the legislative history however indicates that the purpose of the 1928 act was not to assert sweeping right of congress to obtain any information it might desire from the executive branch rather the aim of the section was far more limited thus the senate report stated that its purpose was to make it possible to require any report discontinued by the language of this bill to be resubmitted to either house upon its necessity becoming evident to the membership of either body 284 or in the words of the house report to save any question as to the right of the house of representatives to have furnished any of the information contained in the reports proposed to be abolished provision has been added to the bill requiring such information to be furnished to the committee on expenditures in the executive departments or upon the request of any seven members thereof 285 it would appear then that the scope of 5 usc 2954 is closely tied to the 128 reports abolished by section 1 of the 1928 legislation286 moreover the provision lacks compulsory component agency refusals to comply would not be subject to existing contempt processes and the outcome of civil suit to compel production on the basis of the provision is problematic despite the leach courts suggestion further the provision applies only to the named committees thus members of all other committees would still face the leach problem finally even members of the named committees are still likely to have to persuade court that their claim is more than an intramural dispute the rules of the senate provide substantially more effective means for individual minority party members to engage in selfhelp to support oversight objectives than their house counterparts senate rules emphasize the rights and prerogative of individual senators and therefore minority groups of senators 287 the most important of these rules are those that effectively allow unlimited debate on bill or amendment unless an extraordinary majority vote to invoke cloture288 senators can use their right to filibuster or simply the threat of filibuster to delay or prevent the senate from engaging in legislative business the senates rules also are source of other minority rights that can directly or indirectly aid the minority in gaining investigatory rights for example the right of extended debate applies in committee as well as on the floor with one crucial difference the senates cloture rule may not be invoked in committee each senate committee decides for itself how it will control debate and therefore filibuster opportunity in committee may be even greater than on the floor also senate rule xxvi prohibits the reporting of any measure or matter from committee unless majority of the committee are present another point of possible tactical leverage even beyond the potent power to delay senators can promote their goals by 283 hr rep 1757 70th cong 1st sess pp 2 3 1928 study of the bureau of efficiency had recommended their elimination hr rep 1757 at p 2 s rep 1320 70th

subpoenas of the senate could be enforced only through the cumbersome method of contempt proceeding before the bar of the senate or by certification to the united states attorney and prosecution for

columbia 297 the house chose not to avail itself of this procedure and this enforcement method applies only to senate subpoenas senate subpoenas have been enforced in several civil actions see for example proceedings to hold in contempt recalcitrant witness in the impeachment proceedings against judge alcee l hastings298 and proceedings to enforce subpoena duces tecum for the production of diaries of senator bob packwood299 the statute details the procedure for directing the senate legal counsel to bring civil action to enforce subpoena in contrast to an application for an immunity order which may be authorized by committee only the full senate by resolution may authorize an action to enforce subpoena300 the senate may not consider resolution to direct the counsel to bring an action unless the investigating committee reports the resolution by majority vote the statute specifies the required contents of the committee report among other matters the committee must report on the extent to which the subpoenaed party has complied with the subpoena the objections or privileges asserted by the witness and the comparative effectiveness of criminal and civil proceeding 301 significant limitation on the civil enforcement remedy is that it excludes from its coverage actions against officers or employees of the federal government acting within their official capacities its

activities306 the impeachment proceedings of judge harry claiborne307 judge walter l nixon jr308 and judge alcee l hastings jr 309 and the confirmation hearings of justice clarence thomas in addition the counsels office provides information and advice to members officers and employees on wide range of legal and administrative matters relating to senate business unlike the house practice the senate legal counsel plays formal role in the review and issuance of subpoenas however since it may become involved civil enforcement proceedings it has welcomed the opportunity to review proposed subpoenas

the clerks office to that of lawyer for the institution at the beginning of the 103d congress it was made separate house office reporting directly to the speaker charged with the responsibility of providing legal assistance and representation to the house310 however as consequence of administrative restructuring at the start of the 104th congress the office was again placed in the clerks office while the function and role of the house general counsel and the senate legal counsel with respect to oversight assistance to committees and protection of institutional prerogatives are similar311 there are significant differences that need be noted the general counsel and the deputy general counsel are appointed by the speaker and serve at his pleasure traditionally the general counsel has tendered his resignation to new incoming speaker authorization for actions by the general counsel to represent the interests of the house 303 2 usc 288ga5 and 6 304 2 us 288gc 305 see srep 1015 96th

the speaker majority leader majority whip minority leader and minority whip312 on other occasions the office will act pursuant to the direction of the majority leadership or the speaker alone313 unlike the senate subpoenas may only be issued over the seal of the clerk of the house in practice committees work closely with the gene ral counsel in drafting subpoenas and every subpoena issued by committee or officer is reviewed by the office for substance and form similarly in the absence of civil enforcement authority committees often seek the assistance of the general counsel in navigating the statutory contempt process in instances of witness non compliance with subpoena which may culminate in floor proceeding to authorize contempt citation for example during committee investigation into the real estate holdings in the united states of the philippines president ferdinand marcos and his wife two brothers who allegedly assisted the marcoss in their dealings were called to testify they declined to answer numerous questions claiming attorneyclient privilege the general counsel was called in to evaluate the claims and to render an opinion whether cont empt proceedings would be appropriate his findings served as the basis for the resoluti on passed by the house holding the brothers in contempt 314 like the senate legal counsels office the house general counsels office devotes large portion of its time rendering informal advice to individual members and committees unlike its senate counterpart however the general counsel will often provide formal advice in the form of memorandum opinions 315 and at times testimony at hearings316 finally the office also takes on special tasks as for example when the deputy general counsel served as special counsel to the joint committee investigation the irancontra affair and played an active role in establishing procedures for the investigation selected readings beck carl contempt of congress study of the prosecutions
