and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342oversight of dualuse biological research the national science advisory board for biosecurity summary policymakers have addresse d the threat of biologi cal weapons and biosecurity issues for many years an issue garnering increased attention is the potential for life sciences research intended to enhance sc ientific understanding and public health to generate results that could be misused to advance biol ogical weapon effectiveness such research has been called dualuse re search because of its applicability to both biological countermeasures and biological weapons the federal government is major source of life sciences research funding tension over the need to maintain homela nd security and support scientific endeavor has led to renewed considera tion of federal scientific oversight policies balancing effective support of the research enterpri and security risks generated by such research is complex challenge policie s addressing science and security generate tensions between federal funding agenci and federal funding recipients to minimize these tensions while maximizing effective oversight of research insight and advice from disparate stakeholders is generally considered essential the national science advisory board for biosecurity nsabb was established as one tool to aid policymakers and resear chers in assessing the risks of federally funded lifesciences research it aims to provide the s ecretary of health and human services and researchers source for advice on dualuse research and other biosecurity issues advice rendered by th nsabb may shape res earch activities and standards practiced by researchers in life science research fields the nsabb is composed of experts in bi ological sciences law security and other areas and federal offici als representing agencies that fund life sciences research its responsibilities include identifying and fining dualuse research advising the secretary of health and human servi ces on biosecurity issues and providing recommendations on an ethical code for life scientists the issues the nsabb addresses are also being explored by prof essional societies non profit organizations and other groups guidance and activities unde rtaken by the nsabb are likely to be closely scrutinized and challe nged by stakeholder groups the success of the nsabb in addressing federal concerns re lated to biodefense and biosecurity may influence congressional action absent an existing effective mechanism to address potentia lly controversial issues ra ised by federally funded dualuse research policymakers could act to establish an oversight mechanism through legislation should the nsabb be successful in linking the scientific and security communities and developing guidelines for effective scientific self oversight the board could evolve into fo rum that policymakers may use to consider the intersections of science and security whether the tools available to the federal government are adequate to assess and control security risks from federally funded research or if additional authorities may ultimately need to be developed is yet to be

nsabb many stakeholders participated in debates over the mechanisms for controlling or overseeing the products of dualuse research in general consensus has been reached on the best approach this section will briefly describe some of the stakeholder activities undertaken in areas relate d to the nsabbs mandate investigating pathogen genomes pathogen genomes are considered critical to understanding pathogen characteristics such as virulence and an tibiotic resistance genomic information could be key to developing effective countermeasures to those pathogens as well as providing insight into basic science broadly applicable to other bacteria and viruses on the other hand it may be that such ge nomic information could also be put to malicious use to enhance the dangerous asp ects of particular pathogen or induce virulence in nonvirulent species14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs6 14 continued need for preventive action by the biomedical community nature genetics vol 29

because of the dualuse nature of pathogen genomes and continued federal research efforts towards identifying these genomes the national academies convened panel and issued report in 2004 addressi ng pathogen genome data restrictions15 the panel recommended that information on pathogen genomes not be restricted but instead that scientists be allowed open access to genomic information the related area of synthetic genomics by which existing or novel pathogens might be constructed from their constituent nucleic acids has also drawn attention from the research and policy community while generally viewed as scientific field still under development community members scientists and polic experts have all advocated proactive stance with respect to ensuring safety security and scientific productivity16 consensus regarding the manner that these goals can be achieved has not yet been reached defining dual use research defining dualuse research has been an area of much discussion and several competing approaches have been put fort h one is based on identifying particular pathogens of concern for example some institutions identify dualuse research as research involving specific pathogens often relying on the select agent list17 an alternate approach is to identify extrinsic factors that raise particular concern some biosecurity experts focus on whether such research could have immediate weapons implications rather than fo cusing on specific pathogens18 others suggest the use of uniform criteria for comparison of pathogen research to identify those experiments of concern19 the national academies have sugge sted seven classe s of experimentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs7 19 continued december 2005 20 the seven classes of experiments include t hose that would demonstrate how to render vaccine ineffective would confer resistance to therapeutically useful antibiotics or antiviral agents would enhance the virulence of pat hogen or render nonpathogen

code of conduct professional groups in the life sciences have adopted or are exploring the potential for codes of conduct21 for instance in 2005 th american society for microbiology revised and appr oved its code of ethics wh ich requires its members to report misuses of microbiology information to appropriate authorities22 t h american medical association guidelines require physician researchers to lend their expertise to the development of sa feguards and oversight mechanisms23 development of such codes has been an international ongoing endeavor for example in 2005 the meeting of states parties to the biological weapons convention held discu ssions on methods of developing and establishing ethical codes for scientists the interacademy panel on international issues an organization of the national science academies s identified key components to be considered in code of conduct or ethics24 other organizations have attempted to facilitate best practices development including ethical codes to increase biosecurity policy concerns relating to the nsabb the establishment of the nsabb has raised several issues of potential congressional interest these include th mechanism and appr opriateness of nsabb review of scientific res earch the scope of nsabb r ecommendations with respect to publication of scientific research the domes tic and international adoption of practices or codes developed by the nsabb the implementation of nsabb guidelines at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs8 local level and applicability of nsabb recommendations to federal agencies other than hhs oversight of federally funded dualuse biological research the nsabb draft criteria for identifying dualuse research guidelines for the local oversight of dualuse research nd advice on policies governing local review and approval processes are contentious among stakeholders the scope and applicability of these definitions and guidelines are balanced against the practicality of oversight activities tradeoff between the scope of research activities falling under the dualuse definition and the degree of scrutiny performed by local oversight may exist if dualuse research is broadly define d so as to capture the maximum number of potentially dangerous research activities significant burden may be placed on local oversight when attempting to apply nsabbrecommended policies and guidelines to minimize delaying research activities local oversight on the conduct of each research proposal may become curs ory in order to process the large proposal volume conversely if dualuse research is narrowly defined so as to limit potential adverse effects from overseeing large vol ume of research contentious dualuse research may not be captured under this finition this might lead to the conduct of research later d eemed inappropriate the draft framework report attempts to bridge this gap by using relatively broad definition but placing the dualuse assessment at the local level on the researcher performing the dualuse resear ch and on the research institution the nsabb draft report would have the federal government develop guidelines based on the nsabbrecommended criteria that w ould be used to frame dualuse research of concern using tools recommended by the nsabb local entities may assess the dualuse implications of research results nd judge whether furthe r review is needed by taking this approach the nsa bb spreads an administrative burden reviewing the research activities among many persons rather than creating general burden localized at particular agency thus the potential for increased costs and delays in the review process are limited as the strain on federal resources is minimized critics on the other hand doubt the efficacy of such local review they assert that researchers and to some extent the research institutions are vested in the success of their research programs as such they are less likely to perceive potential misuse or dangers of their research activities and may thus err on the side of permissiveness local review of dualuse research under guideline paradigm rather than regulatory paradigm has been criticized by arms contro l advocates these advocates state that compliance with existing guidelines has not been uniform even among those entities receiving federa l funds absent clear pe nalties from violating these guidelines it is not apparent how successful voluntary local review will be inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs9 25 for example the select agent rule is consid ered by many scientists to be burdensome and restrictive to research activities see sandia national laboratories international biosecurity symposium secu ring high consequence pathoge ns and toxins symposium summary sand20042109 june 2004 26 such an example might be the case where th public health benefits greatly outweigh the risk of enhanced weapon potential see th earlier discussion of the 1918 flu publication 27 office of inspector

all dualuse research of c oncern on the other hand regulatory framework may be considered unwieldy and burdensome to the research enterprise25 the nsabb draft framework suggests several layers in the local review of dual use research activities to determine if dualuse research is of concern to determine the risk it may pose and to determine what risk management techniques might best mitigate this risk as such publication and dissemination of dualuse research of concern may be appr opriate when such publication and dissemination best manages the risk of such research results26 the need for federal agencies to address and coordinate oversig ht of intramural potentially dualuse research has been highlighted by reports from agency inspectors general27 some federal agencies taking part in the nsabb are developing interim guidelines to identify dualuse intramural research other agencies await output from the nsabb before attempting such analysis absent clear recommendation from the nsabb regarding dualuse research federal agencies will likely continue to establish independent interim guidelines for their own use proliferation of different guidelines and standards between f unding agencies may complicate future compliance with uniform sta ndard recommended by the nsabb mechanism and appropriateness of nsabb review the use of the nsabb in vetting the pub lication of the 1918 flu research paper has been identified by some as successful exercise of the nsabb advisory mission the hhs secretary soug ht input from the nsabb regarding the proposed publication of research results that have dualuse aspects once that recommendation was received it was acted upon and the re search paper was published with an accompanying editorial nevertheless the timing and mechanism of this process have been questioned the editorinchief of science dr donald kennedy desc ribed the involvement of the nsabb as an 11thhour intervention from the secretarys office28 he wrote that prior to the intercession of the hhs secretarys office both the director of the centers for disease control and prevention and the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease had re viewed the research article before thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs10 29 donald kennedy ibid 30 department of health and human services national science advisory board for biosecurity charter march 4 2004 nsabb was consulted and bot h felt the public health benefits outweighed the public health risks while the nsabb supported the decision to publish the 1918 flu research article dr kennedy wrote that even if the nsabb had not approved he would have published the research ar ticle unless it had been classified the late inclusion of the nsabb review raises questions regarding the role the board plays in advising policymakers on publication of potentially contentious research results the editorinchief of science argued that the nsabbs role is not to provide advice on specific re search papers but instead to develop broader guiding principles29 however the nsabbs charter explicitly requires the nsabb to review and provide guidance on specific experiments insofar as they exemplify significant or particularly complex permutation of an existing category of dualuse research or represent novel category of dualuse research that requires additional guidance from the nsabb30 an apparent point of dissension is whether the 1918 flu publication qualifies under the nsabb charter as specific experiment requi ring additional guidance and if so whether such review extends to publication depending on what threshold is used for such determination the nsabb may be placed in the position of providing additional guidance on many s ubmitted publications or relatively few further concern relates to the mechanism by which the federal government is informed of potential dualuse articles if such notification occurs late in the publication process then the business of publishing could be disrupted it may be argued that in the case of the 1918 flu pub lication since several of the authors were federal employees the government should ve been selfinfor med and involved the nsabb earlier so as to avoid possible pr ivate sector disruption when federally funded research is performed outside the federal government however it seems less likely that the government will be informed before the results are submitted for publication an area of potential congressiona l interest may be how federal research agencies are informed of federally funded research results before their publication and what mechanisms may exist to assess any dualuse nature finally the advice of the nsabb in th case of th 1918 fl u publication was unanimous all nsabb members reco mmended publication augmented by an accompanying editorial in future cases the nsabb voting members may not all agree in that case what is the appropriate mechanism and threshold for action should the advice given by the nsabb be based on consensus approach majority vote or some other mechanism restricting publication another concern is whether the federa l government or by extension the nsabb

describing the potential impact of cont aminating the milk supply with botulinum toxin was to be published in proceedings of the nati onal academy of sciences 31 the articles publication was layed but eventually published over the objections of hhs32 unlike the 1918 flu publication the author s of this article were not federal employees and the research was not funded by the federal government congress may be asked to provide oversight of government activities related to publication of dualuse research results to determine what statutory authorities if any may need to be enacted to meet homeland security requirements international cooperation one of the recommendations of the fink re port was to develop an international forum to develop and harmonize international approaches towards biosecurity issues while the nsabb has been charged with developing policies for publication communication and dissemina tion of dualuse research results it is us government body the extent to which these policies will be adopted by or harmonized with other nations is yet to be determined the publication of the 1918 flu research ma again serve as case study for this potential difficulty the article on recons tructing the influenza virus was published in science us journal but the ge netic sequence was published in nature uk journal even if the nsabb had recomme nded that the research not be published and science had followed this recommendation the companion article might still have been published in nature the extent to which the nsabb incor porates other countries norms into its guidance may influence harmonization of nor ms with other nations development of guidance that is not adopted by other na tions may cause us journals to be at competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign journals because of potential restrictions on publication if publicati on in foreign journal bypasses nsabb guidance procedures the increase in biosecurity expected from the nsabb guidelines may not be realized on the other hand adoption of other nati ons norms and guidance in an attempt to maximize efforts at harmonization may have drawbacks if harmonization makes us policy less stringent it may make the nsabb guidance less effective alternately if other nations have more stringent norms and guidanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs12 33 nih guidelines for research invo

institutional biosafety committees ibcs ibcs were established under the nih guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules to provide local review and oversight research with recombinant

expansion of oversight is done on the institutional rath er than the federal level critics have claimed that the ibc system is highly flawed and in many cases does not provide rigorous oversight of current research activities34 in addition clear enforcement mechanis m has been enunciated for the event that an ibc concludes that research should not be conducted or disseminated on biosecurity grounds but the researcher disagrees th is raises questions regarding the actual impact of nsabb guidance currently potential penalties for violating recombinant dna guidelines which are implemented by ibcs include possible revocation of federal funding35 an alternate mechanism for implementing nsabb guidelines might be through consulting researchers at nih regional centers of excellence for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases research36 advocates of such plan suggest that scientists at these regiona l centers of excellence might draw on large pool of participating institutions nd institutional knowledge and may consider the broader biodefense implications of specific research experiments researchers may resist submitting research plans and results to another potentially competing institution preferring their research to be reviewed either at their own institution or by the federal government another possibility would be to establish another new institutional review committee to solely address dualuse research concerns creating parallel review committee for dualuse research may remove strain from existing review boards but tax the resources of individual

support and the potential for barring vi olators from future federal support code of conduct or ethics promulgated by scientif ic body or community may reach more scientists including those not engaged in federally funded research therefore greater number of scientist mig ht take part and th overall effectiveness of the code may be greater the greater the number of scientists participating in such code the more likely scientists will be aware of the potential security risks posed by their dualuse research code prom ulgated by scientific body though would generally lack substantive sanctions except in those research areas where accreditation by the scien tific body is necessary some advocates for the establishment of codes recommend that code implementation be selfdirected by the scientific community rather than by government oversight some scientists claim that code developed by the scientific community is more likely to be adopted and applied than one developed by an external body they assert that code developed by scientis ts through consensus may become incorporated into scientific practice even if unanimous support is not initially found within the scientific community38 the nsabbs proposal for code of ethi cs or conduct for life scientists has drawn some criticism some experts question the value of such code absent

wh ere ethical concerns have been raised see crs report rl33554 stem cell research ethical issues by erin d williams and judith johnsonrequirements and an enforcement framework to ensure its effectiveness39 they posit that developing and implementing ethical codes along with other efforts such as intelligence activities and export controls might better prevent misuse of biological information40 other scientists have challenged the external imposition of code as restricting the role and independence of the scientif ic community asserting that scientific research is most productive when minimally fettered these scientis ts express concern that restrictive codes of conduct will limit research activ ities such limitations may occur through active measures such as determining research area to be inappropriate for further res earch or through passive m easures such as additional administrative burdens or increased peer pressure with respect to the scope of research activities41 the practical imp act of code of ethics ma be somewhat limited should the code be contingent on federa l funding rather than arising through an educational mechanism for example state and private universities and federal laboratories both of which rely on federal fundi ng would likely implement et hical training if federal funding was contingent on ethics or conduc t training private sector life science research for example that found in pharm aceutical companies that lack federal research funding would not be required to develop equivale nt training this difference might lead to gaps in adherence of the code of conduct because of the many different types of potential codes the level of detail developed in any code for dualuse resear ch whether it from an outside body or from the scientific community is yet undetermined some c odes are quite detailed while other codes are aspirational in nature stating highlevel aims and goals in developing code of ethics or conduct tension exists between describing overly specific behaviors or activities and stating sufficiently actionable items code that is too vague or generally stated may be viewed as unenforceable and lacking effect while code that enumerates many prohibited activities may be viewed as overly restrictive and unable to adapt to scientific progress applicability to other research fields while dualuse activities in the biolog ical sciences have received much attention other research fields may also yield research results that raise security concerns members of the nsabb have been appointed for their ability to advise on biosecurity issues but not necessarily for their ability to advise on other research areas one possible issue facing policymakers is the extent to which nsabb advicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33342crs15 42 andrew j hawkins national biosecurity advisory board members stress balance international implications research policy alert july 1 2005will be applicable to interdisciplinary research results where research from other disciplines intersects with life sciences research for example mechanical engineering and aerosol science research re sults that could increase the effectiveness of biological weapons through more eff ective delivery or disse mination might not be captured in nsabb advice regarding life sciences the nsabb though established by the secretary of hhs and managed by nih appears to be expected to advise and provide guidance to all federal agencies and departments performing life sciences researc h as rajiv venkayya special assistant to the president for health and biodefense told the nsabb every cabinet secretary is going to be listening to what you have to say and theyre going to be taking your recommendations seriously as they decide what to do about experiments that raise biosecurity concerns42 members of agencies performing life sciences research have been appointed to the nsabb in an ex officio capacity but it is unclear if more formal mechanism exists for these agencies to request the aid of the nsabb whether advice requested by an outside agency must flow through the hhs secretarys office or whether another agency can request advice directly from the nsabb is not described in the nsabb charter the ability of other agencies to dr aw upon the nsabb ma relate to how broadly nsabb guidance is applied outsi of research funded by hhs each agency represented by ex officio members has agreed to consider any recommendations developed by the nsabb wh establishing oversight for dualuse research these federal funding agencies may be more inclined to directly use nsabb guidance if they have previously drawn on the advice of the nsabb conversely if it is difficult for agenci other than hhs to use the advisory capability of the nsabb other fede ral funding agencies may choose to independently generate dualuse guidelines for research results such proliferation of dualuse guidelines might complicate oversight and decrease compliance
