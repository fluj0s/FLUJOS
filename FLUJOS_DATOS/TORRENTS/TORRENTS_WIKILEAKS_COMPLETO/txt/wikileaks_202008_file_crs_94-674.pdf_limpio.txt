an independent agency and the current commissions authority would expire the commissions membership would be enlarged from three to five fulltime members more than 3 of whom may be members of the same political party one of whom must be certified public accountant and one must have experience in law enforcement all would be presidentially appointed with senate confirmat ion currently associate members are appointed by the secretary members could be removed from office during their 5year terms only for cause conflictofinterest provisions would be expanded member may pursue any other business engage in any gaming activities have pecuniary interest in gaming business or contract or have been convicted of felony the bill treats the commission under seven categories general powers regulatory authority licensing hearings commission staffing commission access to information and investigations and actions it states that the commission is to have law enforcement powers necessary to fulfill

closing gaming operations and authority to issue and restrict gaming licenses and to fine persons licensed it also will have authority to inspect gaming premises demand access to gaming books and records serve process conduct hearings collect fees and assessments assess penalties and provide training for indian tribal governments the commission is to approve all gamingrelated contracts under current law it must approve all management contracts for class ii and class iii gaming its power to regulate indian gaming is likewise expanded current law speaks of monitoring and inspecting class ii gaming this legislation would make it clear that the commission is to regulate such gaming issue licenses conduct background checks and promulgate standards among the matters to be regulated are background investigations any gaming licensing internal control requirements for the operation of indian gaming security personnel and systems rules for play of games credit and debit collection controls gaming device controls and accounting and auditing the commission is to inspect and examine premises monitor background investigations and licensing conducted by tribal governments monitor and regulate tribal gaming systems internal controlshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94674crs3 the commission is to establish hearing procedures for issuance of licenses for gaming operations key employees persons materially involved in gaming operations gaming related contractors gaming service industries and other entities final agency action is subject to review in the circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia the commission is authorized to staff the agency without regard to the provisions of title 5 united states code relating to the competitive civil service except that appointee may receive pay in excess of the annual rate of basic pay payable for es5 of the senior executive service temporary and intermittent appointees would be limited to the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay payable for es6 the legislation would also authorize detail of employees from other federal agencies the commission is authorized access to other agencies information not otherwise prohibited by law the legislation would authorize the commission to investigate violations or potential violations of igra to conduct investigations in support of its rulemaking authority to issue subpoenas and to enforce them in federal district court and to seek injunctive action in federal district court the legislation specifically addresses the type of systems that must be regulated and the persons who must be licensed it prescribes requirements that each applicant for license must establish by clear and convincing evidence including the supplying of information consent to inspections and continuing cooperation it imposes duty to inform the commission of actions that violate igra the legislation would specify the requirements for any corporation that is licensed to manage gaming operation including that it be incorporated in the united states various detailed safeguards regarding management ownership production of documentation regarding financial stability and integrity and other disclosures relating to the applicant with respect to licensing key employees of class iii gaming operation the legislation specifies that each applicant produce such documentation as to establish by clear and convincing evidence financial stability and integrity including various specific types of information relating to finances family and civil and criminal record the legislation also makes the keyemployee licensing criteria applicable to gamingrelated contractors and service industries but permits the commiss ion to permit their operating prior to the grant of license it also permits the commission to exempt regulated entities from the licensing requirement upon finding that licensing is not necessary to protect the public interest the commissions approval is required for any indian gaming management contracts and gamingrelated contract requirements statutory standards are provided for it to use in evaluating such contracts it is also required to review existing tribalstate compacts and determine whether they meet the new regulatory and licensing requirements and directly regulate and license gaming under any compacts that do not meet such standards similar review of existing contracts is required conduct of class ii gaming on indian lands one major departure from the igra is that although s 2230 uses the term indian lands to describe the geographical area on which indian gaming may occur it does not define it possibly opening the way for the commission or the federal courts to elaborate on its meaning httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94674crs4 like the igra s2230 would allocate jurisdiction over class i gaming to indian tribes whether class ii gaming may occur would remain unchanged from the regimen established under igra if the gaming is permitted by the state for any purposes and if the gaming is not otherwise specifically prohibited on indian lands by federal law it may occur on indian lands provided licenses are obtained and statutory criteria regarding tribal proprietorship and allocation of revenues are met and annual outside audits conducted contracts in excess of 10000 annually are audited the facilities are constructed in manner protecting the environment and health and safety and there are adequate tribal systems to insure background investigations and tribal licenses meeting commission criteria class iii gaming and the compacting process in addition to not defining indian lands and providing for commission monitoring and oversight of licensing and operations s 2230 departs from the igra scheme of tribalstate compacting in several ways providing for compact with the secretary of the interior if state chooses not to negotiate providing for an initial determination whether particular activity is subject to the compacting process waiving states immunity from suit and providing for compulsory mediation in instances where the negotiation process reaches impasse under s 2230 class iii gaming may occur unless there is compact adopted by the governing body of the tribe and approved by the secretary and the gaming activity is determined to be eligible for inclusion in compact any tribal ordinance approving gaming activity may be revoked and shall be effective when published in the federal register except that gaming operations under valid compact may continue for one year and the revocation is to be construed not to affect any civil action arising or crime committed before the close of the oneyear period the compacting process under s 2230 requires tribe to request the secretary to enter into negotiations for compact for any gaming activity if after 30 days the secretary determines that an activity should not be included in the compact by virtue of not meeting the requirements of the statute the tribe is to be informed at the same time the tribe requests the secretary to enter into negotiations the tribe is to notify the state if within specified period the state requests negotiations it shall be deemed to have waived its sovereign immunity any compact negotiated by the state and the tribe is to include provisions regarding the application of civil laws and regulations of the tribe or the state allocation of criminal and civil jurisdiction between the state and the tribe assessment by the state of amounts necessary to defray the costs of regulating gaming activities taxation by the tribe of gaming activity in amounts comparable to amounts assessed by the state for comparable activities remedies for breach of contract standards for operation of gaming activities and other subjects reasonably related to the operation of gaming activities the legislation provides schedule for negotiations between the state and tribe authority for the federal courts to issue declaratory judgments when there is dispute between the state and the tribe as to whether particular activity may be included in compact and procedures for mediating disputes and selecting mediators by stating standards for the courts in deciding which activities are permissible the legislation differs from igra it therefore contains savings clause attempting to preserve as legal anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94674crs5 activities that are as matter of federal law lawful in any jurisdiction on the date of enactment it would direct the courts to find that gaming activity is permissible if it is not prohibited as matter of state criminal law if the activity is prohibited it is to be permitted if its principal characteristics are not distinguishable from gaming activity not so prohibited the activity may also be permitted if it is prohibited but allowed subject to regulation or permitted to any person or entity within the state the legislation would also state that the following types of activities are distinguishable gaming devices lottery games banking games parimutuel wagering and other games of chance as in current law approval of the compact is relegated to the secretary but reasons for disapproval are limited gaming on afteracquired lands under current law the secretary of the interior may take land into trust pursuant to other statutory authority but gaming may not occur on such lands unless land is contiguous to reservation or is for tribe that has reservation there is also an exception by which the secretary may take land into trust for gaming after having consulted with state local and officials of other tribes and having determined that the gaming would be in the best interest of the tribe and not detrimental to the surrounding community provided the governor of the state in which the gaming activity is to be conducted occurs this proposal would alter the process by which the secretary may authorize gaming on subsequently acquired lands under the general exception by longer requiring concurrence of the governor but requiring that the secretary review recommendations of the governor of the state in which the lands are located and any other officials and determine that the gaming would be in the best interest of the tribe and not detrimental to the surrounding communityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94674crs6 525 cfr 5027b the proposal also differs by requiring that the device not be gambling device or slot machinemiscellaneous definitions are given for terms not currently defined by statute and thus now possibly subject to differing interpretations by the federal courts there are also some definitions that vary with those promulgated by the commission under igra among the new definitions are banking games electronic computer or other technologic aid which differs from the commissions current definition by distinguishing slot machines and games of chance from such aids5 gambling device gaming activity gamingrelated contract gaming related contractor gaming service industry key employee lottery game principal characteristics prohibited as matter of state criminal law and slot machine civil penalties would be extended to include violations of regulations as well as statutory violations and by anyone as distinguished from the current laws applicability to tribal operators fines would be increased to maximum of 50000 per day the commission would be directed to establish schedule of fees for both class ii and class iii gaming activities of less than 05 percent nor more than 2 percent of gross revenues with adjustments downward for tribal regulatory functions and credits toward next years fees granted on pro rata basis should any years collections exceed expenditures of the commission the commission is to submit its annual budget request including any request for appropriation s directly to the congress 5000000 authorization of appropriations is to be provided for fiscal years 19961998 there is also provision that makes it clear that indian gaming establishments have to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 to the internal revenue service and defining indian gaming establishments as financial institutions for purposes of the currency and foreign transactions reporting act under current treasury regulations although other gambling casinos have been required to file ctrs indian gaming casinos have not
