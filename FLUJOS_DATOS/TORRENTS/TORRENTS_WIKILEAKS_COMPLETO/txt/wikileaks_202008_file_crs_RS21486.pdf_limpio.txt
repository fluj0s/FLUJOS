to grant gun industry immunity from suits new york times apr 4 2003 p a10 4 id for background information see crs report rs20126 gun industry liability lawsuits and legislation updated mar 30 1999 5 the words or injunctive relief are not in s 659the bills findings state that it is an abuse of the legal system to hold defendants liable for harm caused by those who crimin ally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that f unction as designed and intende d cosponsor of the bill said were trying to stop making public po licy through the courts with these nuisance suits3 opponents of hr 1036 have denounced the proposed legislation as an unfair favor to an industry and fede ral usurpation of states rights and have said that it would bring progress toward safer guns to screaming halt and make it more difficult for gun violence victims to recover damages it would prevent cities from collecting damages against gun manufactur ers who maintain distribution system which they know ensures the continual supply of guns to the illegal market4 hr 1036 would prohibit qualified civ il liability action fro m being brought in any federal or state court and would require the dismissal of any such action that is pending on the date of enactment of the bill the bill defines qualified civil liability action as with five exceptions civ il action brought by any person against manufacturer or seller of qualified product or trade association for damages or injunctive relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of qualified product by the person or third party5 it defines qualified produc t as firearm as defined in 18 usc 921a3a or b an an tique firearm as defined in 18 usc 921a16 ammunition as defined in 18 usc 921a 17 or component part of firearm or ammunition hr 1036 defines trade association used in the definition of qualified civil liability action quoted above as any associ ation or business orga nization whether or not incorporated under federal or state law th at is not operated for profit and 2 or more members of which are manufacturers or sellers of qualified product hr 1036 defines manufacturer to limit it to manufacturers who are licensed under chapter 44 of title 18 us code it defines s eller to include an importer as defined in 18 usc 921a9 dealer as define d in 18 usc 921a11 and person engaged in the business of selling ammuniti on as defined in 18 usc 921a17 an importer and dealer would have to be licensed under chapter 44 of title 18 us code to be seller under the bill the first of the five types of lawsuits that would not be qualified civil liability action and that therefore would not be ba rred by the bill would be i an action brought against transferor convicted unde r section 924h of title 18 united states code or comparable or identical state felony law by party directly harmed by the conduct of wh ich the transferee is so convicted section 924h makes it crime to knowingly transfer firearm knowing th at such firearm will be used to commit crime of violence or drug trafficking crime the transfero r who may be sued ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21486crs3 6 is transferee actually meant to be transfe ror this seems unlikely because exception i speaks of the plaintiffs having been directly rmed by the conduct of the transferee and the plaintiff would be directly harmed by the conduct of th transferee he w ould be only indirectly harmed by the conduct of the transferor 7 the words in fact are not in s 659 8 johnson v bulls eye shooter supply 032039328 2003 wl 21639244 wash super ct june 27 2003a person who has been convicted of violating section 924h or comparable or identical law the phrase is so convicted appears unclear does it require that the transferee ie the person who bought the firearm from the tr ansferor and who shoots the plaintiff with it be convicted if s of what it would not be of section 924h b ecause section 924h makes it crime to transfer firearm not to receive one or to fire one in addition there would be apparent reason for congress to create an exception to exception i and prohibit lawsuits against transferors who violate section 924h merely because the transferee had not been convicted the transf eree after all may not have been convicted because he had been killed in selfdefense by the plaintiff whom he shot and this would not seem relevant to the transferors culpability for the harm he indirectly caused by violating section 924h6 the second type of lawsuit that would not be qualified civil liability action and therefore would not be barred by the bill would be ii an action brought against seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per the bill defines negligent entrustment as the supplying of qualif ied product by seller for use by another person when the seller knows or should know the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to use the product and in fact does use the product in manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person and others7 this would seem to cover supplying firearm or ammunition to person who because of age mental disability intoxication or violent propensity seems likely to use th product in dangerous manner recent case in the state of washington held that negligent entrustment also occurs when firearms manufacturer lls firearms to retail stor that it knew or should have known was operating its store in reckless or incompetent manner8 this suit was by victims of the dcarea snipers against among others the manufacturer of the assault rifle the snipers used to commit their crimes the plaintiff alleged that the manufacturer knew or should have known that the retailer had history of large number of weapons for which it could not account the court f ound that if the plaintiff could prove this then the defendant may be lia ble for plaintiffs injuries under the theory of negligent entrustment the court ther efore denied the defendants motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state claim upon which relief can be granted and ruled that the case may go to trial it appears however that the bill could preclude an action for negligent entrustment against manufacturer in the state of washington this is b ecause the bill defines negligent entrustment as the supplying of qualified product by seller not by manufacturer the bill defines seller to include dealer as defined in section 921a11 of title 18 w ho is licensed to engage in business as such dealerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21486crs4 9 27 cfr 47841 10 jd lee and barry lyndahl 4 modern tort law liability and

10341035 emphasis in original section 921a11 defines dealer to incl ude any person engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail manufacturer generally sells its products at wholesale and therefore apparently is d ealer under section 921a11 but this does not mean that manufacturer would be seller under the bill because though manufacturer is dealer it need not be licensed as dealer and under the bill it must be both dealer and licensed to be selle r atf regulations provide that firearms manufacturer is not required to obtain dealers license in order to engage in business as dealer9 apparently confirming that manufact urer is technically dealer under section 921a11 manufacturer who is not licensed as dealer would not seller under the bill and therefore under the b ill apparently would be immune from suits for negligent entrustment manuf acturer who is licensed as dealer even though it is not required to be would be seller under the bill and th erefore apparently would be subject to suits for negligent entrustment although negligent entrustment is reco gnized in almost every jurisdiction10 and manufacturers selling potentially danger ous product to reta iler it knows or should know to be reckless may constitu negligence in almost ev ery jurisdiction this does not mean that jurisdictions besides washington necessarily label this sort of negligence negligent entrustment because it appears that manufacturers who are licensed as dealers would be subject to suits for neg ligent entrustment under the bill it might be advisable for congress to add to the bills definition of negligent entrustment statement that negligent entrustment does or does not include manufacturers selling firearm to dealer that the manufacturer knew or should have know n was be likely to be reckless the bill does not define negligence per the term means negligence established as matter of law so that breach of the duty is not jury question11 this means that once defendants c onduct is determined to have violated rele vant statute the defendant is automatically deemed negligent and the jury is not asked to determine whether the defendant acted in reasonable manner this is apparently the rule in probably majority of the courts12 some courts appear to have limited the per rule to situations where there has been violation of specific requirement of law etc legislation that expresses rules of conduct in specific nd concrete terms as opposed to general or abstract principles in some few states at least in older cases not apparently disapproved distinction has been drawn as to ordinances and violation of an ordinance rather than violation of statute has been ruled to constitute at most evidence of negligence13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21486crs5 14 note that this exception unlike the first excep tion which requires that the defendant have been convicted under 18 usc 924h requires that the defendant merely have violated state or federal statute which the plaintiff would have to prove by preponderance of the evidence 15 it is difficult to predict when defendants violation of statute would be deemed the proximate cause of third partys criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm or ammunitionthus whether violation of statute constitutes negligence per is question of state law unless federal stat ute provides that one who violat it shall be strictly liable in civil action one could therefore interp ret this provision of hr 1036 to mean that if plaintiff alleges that the defendant violated statute and the statute is federal statute that provides that one who violates it shall be strictly liable in civil action or the applicable state law provides that one who violates stat ute or ordinance of the sort violated shall be strictly liable then the plaintiff may proceed if however applicable state law allows the question of negligence to go to the jury even when the defendant has violated statute ie if there is negligence per rule then hr 1036 would preclude lawsuit unless one of its other five exceptions in the definition of qualified civil liability action applied the other three exceptions in the definition of qualified civil liability action ie the other three types of actions th at hr 1036 would not bar are iii an action in which manufacturer or seller of qualified product knowingly and willfully violated state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product14 and the violation was proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought15 iv an action for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the product or v an action for physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from defect in design or manufacture of the product when used as intended in sum with the five exceptions noted hr 1036 would prohibit civil actions for damages or injunctive relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm or ammunition as defined in the bill s 1805 108th congress s 1805 and s 1806 108th congress were introduced october 31 2003 and placed on the senate legislative ca lendar on november 3 2003 s 1806 is identical to s 659 s 1805 is different and we now examine its differences in s 659 the third exception in the definition of qua lified civil liability action ie the third type of action that s 659 would not bar is iii an action in which manufacturer or seller of qualified product knowingly and willfully violated state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product and the violation was proximate cause of the harm for which relief is soughthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21486crs6 s 1805 would drop the words knowingly and willfully from the provision this would enlarge the exception and theref ore could increase the likelihood that defendant would be found liable s 1805 would also add list of three specific types of cases that would be included under exception iii in s 659 the fifth exception in the definition of qua lified civil liability action is v an action for physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from defect in design or manufacture of the product when used as intended s 1805 would add at the end or in manner that is reasonably foreseeable thereby expanding this exception as we ll s 1805 however would also define reasonably foreseeable so as to exclude any criminal or unlawful misuse of qualified product other th an possessory offenses s 1805 would make two pparently technical changes to the definition of negligent entrustment s 1805 would add rule of constructi on that would appear to prescribe what courts would do anyway in the absence of the rule s 659 would define seller to in clude seller of ammunition in manner consistent with federal state and local law s 1805 would change consistent with to in compliance with s 659 would define trade association as any association or business organization that is not operate d for profit and 2 or more members of which are manufacturers or sellers of qualified product s 1805 would adds another prer equisite to being trade association an association or business organization mu st also be involved in promoting the interests of its members in cluding organizing advising or representing its members with respect to their business legislative or legal activities in relati on to the manufacture im portation or sale of qualified product this new language would thus limit the definition of trade association to groups that actually do what trade associations typically do s 1805 would add definition of unl awful misuse term that is used in the definition of qualified civil liability acti on and in the second item in this list unlawful misus would be defined as conduct that violates statute ordina nce or regulation as it relates to the use of qualified product
