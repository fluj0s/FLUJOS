policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22914 order code rs22914 updated july 24 2008 the future role of us trade policy an overview wayne m morrison and william h cooper foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the united states has become increasingly integrated with the rest of the world economy this integration has offered be nefits and presented challenges to us business agriculture labor and consumer s those who can compete in the more integrated economy have enjoyed opportunitie s to broaden their success while those who are challenged by increased foreign competition have been forced to adjust and some have exited the market or relocated overseas some observers contend that in order to remain globally competitive the ited states must continue to support trade liberalization policies while assisting those hurt by tr ade others have raised doubts over whether free trade policies benefit the us economy eg some blame such policies for the large us trade deficit declining wages and growing income disparity many contend that trade liberalization works only when everyone plays by the rules and have urged the aggressive enforcement of us trade laws to address unfair trade practices still others maintain that such issues as labor rights the environment and climate change should be linked to trade po licies these competing views are often reflected in the struggle between congress and the executive branch in shaping us trade policy this report provides an ove rview and background on the debate over the future course of us trade policy and will be updated as events warrant us integration with the world economy over the past several years the united states has become increasingly integrated with the world economy in 2007 the united st ates was the worlds largest exporter at 16 trillion and largest importe r of goods and services at 24 trillion from 1960 to 2007 us exports of goods and services as share of gross domestic product gdp rose from 49 to 122 while imports rose from 43 to 170 the economist intelligence unit eiu projects that by the year 2037 us exports and imports as percent of gdp will total 395 and 338 respectively see figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22914crs2 1 from 1960 to 2007 services exports as shar of gdp rose from 12 to 36 while services imports rose from 15 to 27 of gdp 2 in many cases the product is simply assembled from imported parts and then exported the value added of that assembly is often quite sma ll us import data records only the final value of the product that is imported and does not dis tinguish between the value added in the country where the product is made and the value added c ontributed by us and other foreign firms source us census bureau and economist intelligence unit note longterm projections of the us economy should be viewed with caution us economic integration with the world has greatly changed the nature and complexity of us trade flows for exam ple many us firms have shifted production abroad to take advantage of lower costs with some production so ld locally and some exported including to the united states in addition many firms in the united states import inputs such as auto parts to produ ce finished goods such as cars trade in services while much smaller than merchandise trade is becoming an increasingly important component of us trade1 many commercial activities in the united states that impact trade are not always reflected in us trade data for example many us companies design and develop products that are manufactured overseas such as in china frequently significant share of the valu added to these products and profits accrue to us firms and workers while only sma ll part of the value added accrues to where the products are made2 finally over the past several years significant level of us trade especially imports has shifted away from developed countries such as western europe and japan to developi ng countries especially thos in asia such as china from 1985 to 2007 the share of us merchandi exports to developing countries rose1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2007 2017 2027 20370510152025303540 exports importsas of gdpfigure 1 us

investment in us securities benefits the us economy in the short run many economists have raised concerns over the longter m impact and risks of high us debt and us overdependence on foreign savings 5 see where ricardo and mill rebut and confirm arguments of mainstream economists supporting globalization by paul samuelson journal of economic perspectives summer 2005 pages 135146 samuelson argues that outsour cing of certain jobs to china and india could lower per capita income in the united states over the long runfrom 33 to 49 while the share of us rchandise imports from these countries rose from 35 to 57 financial flows play critical role in th us global economic integration in 2007 the united states was the largest cumulative source of foreign direct investment fdi around the world at 26 trillion and was the larg est cumulative destination of fdi at 18 trillion3 fdi plays critical role for many us firms attempting to sell their goods and services in foreign markets many companies set up subsidiaries abroad in order to tailor products and services to suit each c ountrys specific tastes or standards or b ecause of lower costs these overseas s ubsidiaries often import machin ery parts and other inputs from the parent company in the united states and thus help generate us exports fdi in the united states helps create empl oyment about 51 million jobs in 2005 by majorityowned nonbank us ffiliates of foreign companie s according to the bureau of economic analysis us ffiliates of foreign firms account ed for 20 of us exports and 25 of us imports in 2005 in additi on foreign investment has gone into us securities such as us treasury securities wh ich is used to finance us budget deficits this investment helps to fund the shortfa ll in us domestic savings relative to its investment needs and enables the united states to enjoy healthier economic growth and relatively lower interest rates as of march 2008 foreign i nvestors owned 514 of privatelyheld us debt at 24 trillion4 major concern for many us policymakers and economists is the size and growth of the us trade deficit the current account balance the broadest measurement of trad flows because it includes merchandise trade services trade investment income and unilateral transfers went from 29 billion surplus in 1991 to 7386 billion deficit in 2007 the deficit reflects the high level of foreign savings the united states must obtain to fund its investment needs the debate over the impact of trade many mainstream economists contend that free trade is winwin situation because it enables countries to focus on producing g oods they are relatively more efficient at comparative advantage and trading for thos goods they are less relatively efficient at producing this enables countries to consum more goods than they could if they were selfsufficient however so observers of trade contend that this simple explanation of trade does not always apply in todays global economy where the factors of production including capital and technology are internationally mobile they argue that us trade with some countries especially those with low wages but high pr oductivity levels such as india and china may not always produce net benefits for the united states if such countries are able to gain comparative dvantage in more advanced goods and services over the united states5 another argument is that in some cases the benefits of trade in the united states may mainly accrue to upper income groups while mainly hurtinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22914crs4 6 worker productivity is major factor defining countrys comparative advantage if us workers are more productive than overseas workers they can produce more at lower cost offsetting the advantage that low wage countries might have generally jobs in us export sectors pay better than those industries that do not export 7 for example if tariffs were increased on steel imports in order to provide relief to the steel industry and its workers prices for steel in the us would likely rise us users of steel such as the auto industry would likely pay more for steel cars would cost more hurting us consumers and making us auto firms less competitive in the us domestic market and abroad 8 the fundamental problem with free trade from politi cal perspective is that the benefits of trade are widely spread such as lower prices for c onsumers however the costs of free trade tend to be more concentrated such as workers who lose jobs because of lower priced importsincomecompeting firms and lower income groups through job losses and depressed wages for example factory in the united states may be closed and workers laid off because it is longer competitive the us company might relocate pr oduction to another country such as or mexico prof its from this venture would accrue mainly to company officials and stockholders of the company the laid off factory workers may find new jobs but they may not always pa as well as the previous ones other economists c ounter that raisi ng productivity i nnovation and education and training levels are keys to ensuring us global competitiveness and high paying jobs6 they further contend that the united states cannot isol ate itself from the global economy and that protectionist measures to try to restrict imports that negatively affect certain domestic industries will adversely affect other industries and have net negative impact on the us economy7 most trade analysts on both sides of the free trade argument contend that some sort of assistance andor retr aining should be afforded to workers that are displaced by trade although opinions differ as to what extent that assistance should be given8 trade policy and trade policy tools us postworld war ii trade policy under va rious presidential administrations has had several interrelated objectives one has been to secure open markets for us exports second has been to protect domestic produ cers from foreign unfair trade practices and from rapid surges in fairly traded imports third has been to control trade for foreign policy and national security r easons fourth objective has been to help foster global trade to promote world economic growth in fulfilling these objectives us policymakers have employed an array of policy tools trade negotiations and trade agreements one set of tools are multilateral and bilateralregional negotiations and agreements the united states has been major player in establishing multilateral system of rules on trade it was leader in nine rounds of negotiations of th general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt including the current doha development agenda dda round that have expanded the coverage of multilateral trade rules and that led to the establishment in 1995 of the world trade organization wto however progress in the dda has been slow at best as wto members have found it difficult to reach consen on some basic issues such as reducing tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade in ag riculture manufactured goods and services these difficulties have generated debate over the future role of multilateral negotiations and the wto itself as tool of trade policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22914crs5 9 if the section 301 or special 301 cases involve wto member us trade law and wto rules require the united states to bring trad dispute case to the wto for resolutionus trade negotiations have become increasingly dominated by bilateral and regional negotiations to establish free trade agreements ftas to date the united states has ftas in effect with 14 countries and ftas with three other countries pending some experts and other observers view the ftas as building block to broader multilateral negotiations others consider them an unhelpful roadblock that undermines the multilateral system because they may lead to trading blocs and trade diversion in general support for ftas in the united states and elsewhere may be waning in part due to growing uncertainty and skepticism regarding the benefits of trade liberalization among some policymakers and various segments of the population trade remedies second group of trade policy tools are trade remedies measures applied primarily against imports to alleviate or remedy the price impact of unfairly traded imports and of some fairly traded imports trade remedies include antidumping ad measures and countervailin g cv measures applied in the form of extra duties on imports that are respectively sold at less than fair market value or have benefitted from foreign government subsidies as determined by the us department of commerce doc and that cause or threaten to cause material injury to the us industry as determined by the us international tr ade commission usitc these measures are the most frequently used trade remedies more powerful yet less frequently used trade remedy is the escape clause or safeguard measure safegu ards sometimes called section 201 measures are applied in the form of higher duties or quotas on imports th at are trade fairly but enter at such rapid rates as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry they are applied to the imports of th product from all countries as result safeguards have potentially powerful impact the cause and injury thresholds that petitioners must meet before receiving trade remedy relief are much higher than for ad and cv measures in addition they require presidentia l approval as result sa feguards are not as frequently applied as other trade remedies and even less so than in the past section 301 and its derivatives ar another set of trade remedies that are part of trade policy toolbox but infrequently used section 301 of the trade act of 1974 authorizes the ustr to apply sanctions against trading partner that uses unfair trade practices against us exports relate d provision called special 301 requires the ustr to identify countries that fail to protect the rights of us owners of intellectual property and to apply sanctions if the trading partner doe s not improve ipr protection9 some us trading partners have criticized the aggressive us use of trade remedies particularly ad and cv measures which some cl aim are protectionist the european union and japan for example successfully challenged the us practice of zeroing when calculating fair value in ad cases many wto members have also argued that trade remedy practices should be reviewed and revised as part of the doha development agenda round c ongress has mandated as part of the trade promotion authority tpa that the president shall not enter into any trade agreement that weakens us trade remedy lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22914crs6 10 taa for workers also includes assistance when production is relocated overseas 11 tpa establishes method by which congress authorizes the president to negotiate and sign free trade agreements based on objectives and goals laid out by congress and establishes fast track procedure by which congress votes on the fta such as amendments specific timetables for consideration and limited debate timeother trade policy tools besides trade agreements and trade remedies us policymakers use other tools to achieve va rious policy objectives for example the department of commerce the department of agriculture the us exportimport bank and other agencies operate programs to prom ote us exports of manufactured goods and agricultural products the commerce depar tment and labor depa rtment administer trade adjustment assistance taa progra ms for firms commerce and workers labor that are negatively affected by trade in order to help them adjust10 in addition us trade preference progra ms including the generalized system of preferences gsp allow certa in products imported from elig ible developing countries to enter the united states duty free these programs are designed to encourage economic development in those countries furthermore sometimes trad is used to achieve overtly foreign policy goals for example the us government controls exports of some high technology to prevent it from getting into the hands of adversaries it also restricts trade with states deemed to be detrimental to us national interests such as burma cuba and north korea the future of us trade policy the direction of us trade policy is likel to be hotly contested issue among us policymakers over the next several years challenges include reaching consensus on how to lower the us trade deficit without slowing the economy the design and funding of programs to assist displaced workers the extent us trade remedy laws should be used to respond to unfair trade practices without becoming protectionist policies the federal government can initiate to help the us economy become more globally competitive strategies the united states can take to indu ce other countries to wer their trade barriers multilaterally in the wto andor bilaterally through ftas and the extent that trade policy should be used to promote environm ent eg global climate change and worker rights reaching consensus on these issues within congress as well as between congress and the administration will likely prove difficult since the stakeholders of trade are widespread and diverse eg in terms of whether free trade benefits them or hurts them and because there are differing opinions over the effects trade has on the us economy as well as different views over whic h trade policies are effective in promoting us trade goals one of the biggest challenges for the next president and congress will be whether tpa which expired in july 2007 should be renewed thus enabling the president to pursue additional bilateral regional and multilateral trade agreements11 some policymakers oppose extending tpa contendi ng that trade liber alization has had little positive impact on the us economy and has hurt some us workers while others have argued that failure to renew tpa will under mine us leadership on free trade and will enable other countries such as china to fo rm trade blocs that ex clude the united states thus putting us exporting firms at disadvantage
