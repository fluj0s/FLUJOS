given on 27 june 1961 thank you okay well this is the 27th of june or was the last time i looked it might have slipped youre apparently doing all right in mild sort of way the biggest difficulty people are having right now although they dont know it is cchs how they are done what was that way back there in the dim historical past you know that sort of thing big conferences about it all the monitoring and regulating factors which lie back of the cchs should be placed in your hands there are some monitoring factors that answer all of these questions if you want to get down and figure them out and that is simply the cchs are physical activity they are not mental activity that tells you at once that they are not verbal so if you go ahead and whistle yankee doodle and give the lincolns gettysburg address compounded with william pitts lecture on the protection of colonies whats this got to do with the cchs got the idea i mean you could give the cchs totally mum and they would work look at what this answers as stable datum see therefore do you ever ask the pc and take his data the following question how is it going and then do you take his data do you then use the data to determine whether or not the process is flat i will say you dont now why do you say then occasionally to the pc how are you doing why do you say this at all well i call to your attention i think its clause 16 isnt it of the auditors code which has to do with remaining in twoway communication with the pc and that is all that has to do with and it wouldnt matter if the pc said i have eighteen bayonets protruding in my stomach the pc has not visually been observed to have single change of comm lag or physical twitch jitters screams fusses yammerings theres been change in anything the pc is doing for twenty minutes and you say to the pc well how are you doing and the pc says well my stomach is full of all these bayonets and ive had this somatic turning on and off in my left zorch and so forth and you say well thats just fine well thank you very much all right were now going to do the next cch that sounds weird doesnt it now twoway comm with the pc now in cch 3 and cch 4 why do you say to the pc then are you satisfied that you did it that restrains you fellow scientologist from pulling gag ive seen happen too often we dont care if the pc said he did it or didnt do it or couldnt do it or hadnt been able to do it or was satisfied that he had done it or thought he had halfway done it or if he answered you in arabic we would say thats fine and we would give him the next command you got the idea now to keep the pc in twoway communication we do the same thing only we talk to the pc but talking to the pc in the cchs you might as well be talking to the birds it has nothing to do with your running the process just make up your mind to it because ill tell you what i do and the cchs work for very well and i tell you what i do never with an invalidative statement or frame of mind or anything of the sort i move book from the left to the right see my left to my right you know and the pc i hand him the book and the pc picks up the book and the pc scratches the back of his neck with it and then i say well are you satisfied that you did that and the pc will say oh yes i did that and so i take the book and maybe not the exact motion i turn the book on edge and i move it from my left to my right and i turn the book upsidedown the next time he thought he did it that time too except he stepped on it and ill turn it upsidedown but i will keep moving this book from the left to the right until the pc does it otherwise its flub it is flub its delicate balance between invalidating the pc you see and making sure that you duplicate the auditing command that isnt flat because the one from the left to the right is not flat couldnt be he hadnt clue you got the idea he just didnt have clue you moved the book from the left to the right and the pc picked up the book and scratched under his armpit with it and you say well did you do that and the pc says oh yes yes i did that and you take the book back and to keep from invalidating him you turn it around the other way and you move it from the left to the right and you faintly differ it in the position of the book or something of the sort or your hand or whether you extend your little finger or something but its still motion from the left to the right at the same rate of speed got that all right and i keep duplicating that type of motion until the pc is flat on it hand motions same way same way i asked him if he contributed to the motion and shucks he was running halfway across the room you know and he says yes yes oh yes yes yes i contributed to the motion all right thats good he gets almost the same one again and he gets it until i think he did it too you understand thats delicate balance if pc starts feeling invalidated because you were repeating the same motion well lot of things could be wrong but i did that he says ah yes but pc can say well i did that if you moved the book from the left to the right and then on the next motion of the book you moved it in circle behind your own head and the pc says but i did that what did you do pc yes he just did that he moved the book from the left to the right by scratching the back of his head with it you got the idea youll run into these well so why plunge in that deep before it becomes idiotic dont you see the pc did it he did it and if he didnt do it he didnt do it but you mustnt be pedantic because instead of an acknowledgment you give an invalidation and as soon as you start giving an invalidation instead of an acknowledgment why the pc starts going downhill not uphill because youre giving him lose lose lose lose lose and youve got to give him win win win win win all right he thinks he did the same one by scratching the back of his head with book when you moved it from the left to the right well that gave him win you said thats fine now i go ahead and move books from the left to the right dont you see i keep going on moving books from the left to the right but not accusatively its very delicate point physical motion is all that counts in any of the cchs and it doesnt matter what the pc says youre trying to keep in communication with the pc and that is all there is to it follow thats all there is to it youd feel awfully strange if robot clanked into the room sat down in the auditing chair and began to pump your hand as matter of fact youd feel little queasy and in view of the fact that this has probably happened quite often on the track that robot walked in and started to dismantle you or something of the sort because youd just had your doll body revoked you react very badly to something that doesnt communicate you probably wouldnt even object to the robot dismantling your doll body if he came in and said well i got an order here from the general council that you having been guilty of mopery and dopery in high space are herewith deprived of one doll body and were going to take it apart and leave it on the bench for seventytwo hours thats what i used to do this is different one and you probably would have gone along with it it wouldnt have been quite so bad but some inhuman unspeaking unthinking unfeeling set of cranes suddenly move in and start pulling the doll body apart some uncertainty has entered into the situation so therefore i keep the uncertainty out of the situation in doing cchs i say well this is what were going to do and i do it now you can make all kinds of mistakes in running the cchs but that stable datum will set you right on most of them its physical action its physical observation and those are where the cchs live now theres another one theres another one command in the cchs is left understood you dont clear command and then insist that the pc do it from there on out in other words you dont say now youre always going to turn counterclockwise and then we never thereafter give him an order to turn counterclockwise that violates the rules of auditing commands and the principal rule of an auditing command is it is given now in this unit of time and nothing has any validity except this unit of time and the command that is just given you know that as an old standby from way back when well dont violate it with the cchs dont say well now hereinafter as aforestated youre going to turn counterclockwise and then correct the pc if he turns clockwise oh the pc has orders to turn clockwise you say you give that hand if there were designation of any kind it would be perfectly proper for the pc to give you either hand if you say you turn around in cch 2 and theres designation of any kind which way to turn around then any way that the pc turns around is right right theres designation now if you want the pc to turn in certain way then before you give the auditing command put your hand on his shoulder and start to turn him and say turn around you got that thats designation isnt it and you give that hand you nod at the hand pointing at the hand you will find if you practice it is not feasible you cant point at the hand and then pick up the hand and then do this with the hand it is just too much but you can nod at his right hand and say you give that hand its physical thing anyhow you see the thing is all actually done by theta communication and physical motion the two things are combined and the english language has nothing to do with it but we just stay in communication with the pc you got the idea so thats why we have the commands now putting the hand back in the pcs lap causes great deal of difficulty to one and all now what do you do do you put it in his lap or something well now if the pcs hand were to be very limp as he extended you the hand if the hands very limp you see youve actually had to take it by the wrist and its out there in an acute state of catatonia right now and you drop his hand if by some accident it were to strike his knee or strike the edge of the chair you would have been in violation of primary function of an auditor which is to safeguard the pc from harm during session if anything makes pc scream its you preventing somebody from coming in the room you preventing him from lousing himself up you get the idea because its your responsibility that the pc can be audited in that session particularly at that moment of the auditing command and you go ahead and drop his hand in thin air and he knocks his wristbone or something like this against the edge of his chair and so forth well thats silly thing for you to do dont you see the same time it is equally silly to take pcs hand when the pc is putting it decently back in his lap every time to call out couple of destroyer escorts and have it escorted back there you got the idea that again is silly so the things that are silly in the cchs or that seem silly to you are probably wrong youve probably got them wrong you got the idea there really is onetwothreefourfivesix drill this was invented later while trying to teach the people you see there really is such drill the pc is giving you his hand quite nicely well all right so you take his hand and hes removing his hand from yours quite nicely on an acknowledgment and putting it in his lap or on the arm of the chair well what else is called for at this point nothing else is called for you simply sit there give him the command and take his hand thank him but then all of sudden hes getting coy and he doesnt want to give you his hand so you pick his wrist up and move his hand over and put it in your hand right all right now at this time you notice that the hand as it touches yours is in complete state of inertia well you certainly are not going to drop it any more than youd drop your watch youve got to put it someplace so you put it back in his lap you got the idea so reason governs these things all right now lets take this fact which has got some auditors bit loused up because lot of auditors knew 8c and 8c is not tone 40 8c 8c is not cch we only carelessly refer to cch 2 as 8c its not 8c it never was 8c goes something like this you say to the pc look at that wall not 8c not the first 8c the first 8c is walk over to that wall touch that wall see walk over to that wall thank you touch that wall thank you walk over to that wall touch that wall thank you thats it walk over to that wall thank you touch that wall thank you walk over to that wall thank you touch that wall thank you that was old 8c in i think in its most virgin original form before it got raped by misunderstandings the next evolution on this line is unimportant because it evolved pretty far but frankly tone 40 8c unlike cch 1 give that hand improved through complication it is better in the final form that it was in but the final form of development i dont think was ever printed and it was you preceded each part of its commands you look at that wall and the auditor would point to the wall you walk over to that wall now there was further point of complication is you walk that body over to that wall skip it thats getting too complicated but you walk over to that wall thank you you touch that wall thank you turn around thank you you look at that wall thank you you walk over to that wall thank you you touch that wall thank you turn around now that was high point of complication from old 8c now this point of complication went further its you look at that wall you walk that body over to that wall or you make that body walk over to that wall with your right hand you touch that wall you turn that body around clockwise now you see thats going just little far it is what works it is what works and that earlier one that i gave you you look at that wall all right the pc looks at the floor clank straighten your hand out on his jaw and wham he looks at the wall see thats it you grab him actually by the back of the neck and his jaw and he looks at that wall if he squinches his eyes that sort of thing youve still got this hand ready and you pull his eyelids open thats correct thats perfectly correct action got it all right and hes looked at the wall and now you walk over to that wall and he walks over to that wall or he gets carried over to that wall but theres some kind of action takes place where he transports himself from where he is to where you want him to be now when you say you touch that wall you therefore dont pick out spot for him to touch and you dont pick out hand for him to touch with because it is not an understood proposition at all you havent said it in the auditing command so therefore his putting his right knee against the wall is an adequate response to the auditing command correct all right now in view of the fact that you actually intended him to touch it with his hand after while if the right knee seems to be just little bit too insouciant or something of the sort i have been known to add in with your right hand touch that wall not as correction of my own auditing command but on subsequent commands but thats change of the command and so it isnt so good and youll find out that if he will touch the wall even with his knee it takes little longer but it will run out his resistance to performing the maneuver do you understand so theres sense in being pedantic about it now ill straighten you out quite clearly about this it is you look at that wall he does you say thank you tone 40 and you say you walk over to that wall and he does and you say thank you and then you say you touch that wall and he does and you say thank you and then you say turn around thank you and that is about all there are to it that is very simple evolution now as i say you can get too pedantic and so forth but that factually that factually is more operable command line than complicated command line and it is more effective than old 8c by considerable now when youve got this fellow whizzing and dealing you could hand yourself some loses if you said to yourself now i intended for him to touch the wall with the heel of his left foot by tone 40 intention unspoken and he didnt do it he touched it with his hand therefore ive had lose yes you could fix yourself up to have some loses that way but thats nonsense it exceeds the process it has nothing to do with the process you want this fellow under control and you want him to get the communication and you want him to gain havingness and this is very fine process with which to do it all right as far as cch 3 is concerned this is old hand space mimicry and it just doesnt matter much what you say there are set of commands they havent become unduly complicated or anything of the sort except you dont even tell him you dont dispose of the hands you dont do anything like that you give it onehanded with an unwilling pc you only use one paw and with the other paw you steer him through the motions okay and the book same way you make onepaw motions with the book and if the pc doesnt do it of course you tuck the book in his paw and you move the book in the motion and you thank him for it and take the book back all right now cch 1 now has as its additional ramifications had the left hand both hands all kinds of hands you understand well why call it another process why call it another process you dont have to do these things you dont have to not do these things but you do the process that isnt flat that is to say if youre saying you give that hand pardon you dont have to say you give that hand just say give that hand the pc has been giving his right hand for about twelve fifteen hours of auditing and this is getting dull even to you because hes been flat on it for some time every time you went by it and so forth start nodding at the other hand see bust down his automaticities now i use these things that every time i come back through the cchs i will break down an automaticity on this proposition i bust up the installed machinery and thats the only reason you flip over to the other hand or start saying give those hands or anything of that sort now theres another point here it has value in other words it has value and that is the only thing that regulates an auditing command or process does it have value well it does it has value another thing i do consistently in running the cchs you might be interested in is that i change my pace every now and then its give that hand thank you give that hand thank you pause give that hand pause thank you shorter pause give that hand short pause thank you now originally when this was being done in london they were studying actually to give the same auditing command newly in the same unit of command and they were actually building up machinery this way and the guy could build up machinery against this thing faster than you could tear it down and the way to bust up machinery on cch 1 is by occasionally varying the pace and the pc will jump it i just sit there and look at him you just never heard of his hand you know you havent said give that hand yet you see and heres his hand out there practically busting your chest open you know hes jumped the command jumped the command one way or the other its good control factor and i will actually pick up persons hand put it back in his lap gently something like that and then give the auditing command you got the idea ill refuse his hand if i didnt ask for it but thats only when its too pointed and theres particular reason to communicate it because the communication is usually enough the person is made aware of the fact that theyve jumped the auditing command and they havent been aware of the fact theyve been jumping the auditing command you see the last five or ten that you gave them theyve been jumping the auditing command their hand is halfway over at the time you say the auditing command of course it doesnt have too much to do with the verbalization of the thing but you havent even laid the intention into him yet see so youre not auditing the pc hes gone on some kind of machine well the way to bust that down is put comm lags in your auditing speed it up or slow it down slightly you dont even have to do it extremely and the pc is giving his hand at this rate give that hand thank you give that hand thank you give that hand thank you hes giving his hand at this rate you see thatd be pretty fast all right so you say short pause give that hand thank you short pause give that hand thank you give that hand thank you give that hand thank you give that hand thank you rapidly give that hand thank you pause give that hand pause thank you got the idea you can practically see the cogwheels on the machinery fly off you know the guywhat whats this whats whatwhats going on here oh theres an auditor here oh oh oh something new has been added to this room i hadnt noticed this auditor before now of course the original of the cchs was that the individual was given an auditor by the cchs and we found out the main thing that happened we found some auditors by the way who were never found by the pc for some peculiar reason the pc just never found these auditors and itd sometimes happen factually happen that pc after pc wouldnt find the auditor and yet we found when we taught this auditor to run the cchs that he normally could get away with this and he called attention of himself to the pc but this wasnt when we had the cchs this was afterwards this first mechanism was given to pc i think it is trait well its actually traits b and c i think are the main traits see female voice b and c ron well its yes but its c that i keep my eagle eye on and if c doesnt rise during an intensive well i just conclude he never found the auditor thats all and if he never found the auditor theres reason to blame the auditor its just the pc has rather poor power of observation and you should have been running the cchs thats all because they were the remedy for this sort of thing when wed see graphs of this character we knew something else was indicated and so on and developed some drills by which this could be done there were great many of these drills and they finally peeled down to the most effective of these drills which became cch 1 cch 2 cch 3 cch 4 those are the most effective of these drills these are the ones that seem to have an effect on almost any case now the purpose of those was to find the auditor and therefore if the pc goes on automatic he hasnt got an auditor has he well pc can go on automatic now you neednt worry about it too much it doesnt put any strain on the situation you just run the cchs right and this automaticity takes care of itself but i will call to your attention the fact that it is silly to continue to pace your auditing commands on an automaticity if you dont expect one to occur in the pc see if you want one to occur in the pc always keep your auditing commands exactly the same pace on doing cch 2 youll find this pc is halfway across the room and you havent said word and i am rather fond of making him look little silly you know somebodys been jumping the gun ill just stand there you know whats this all about whats this see they normally come back to where they were i dont even tell them to come back they will usually they come back and stand there contrite it brings it home it brings it home but of course these points make them find the auditor dont they without invalidating them terrifically because actually you are not invalidating them theyre doing something weird that has nothing to do with the process this makes them very aware of the fact too busts it up quick now running the cchs are then based upon what is doable and making every auditing command newly and based as well on the fact that they are physical process they have to do with thetamest its direct thetamest process your command is theta command that is to say youre laying it into the guy if you were real good you could probably do the cchs without opening your mouth if you dont believe if youre running real hot someday think the auditing command to the pc you know in other words transmit it to the pc im calling this to your attention because an auditor could really muck up pc this way you see puts the intention into the pcs head and then comm lags and then gives the verbal auditing command and then criticizes the pc because the pc has jumped the gun this would be wonderful way of invalidating pc you get the idea you actually could do it because in running pc it happens all too often i mean ill be coaching or something like that i dont play fair on upper indoc coaching and that sort of thing i start doing it tone 40 and theyll eventually go straight into the process bang what you can observe however is think the auditing command at the pc you know i mean put the intention there independent of your verbalization put the intention in the pcs head and watch his hand jump to touch the wall its quite interesting if youre good at it you can make him do it but that you cant do it is particular reason for anything because one of the things that can make you fail to do it the pc might be rigged wrong and you put the intention in his head to touch the wall and he stamps his foot you see doesnt mean anything except hes got his switchboards crossed for instance i was very much invalidated one time there was fellow came to call and i didnt particularly want to see anybody that particular day i had lot of work to do or lot of loafing to do or something of the sort i was trying to figure out something so i thought an intention into the living room you see that he would leave and by gosh he didnt and you know i thought this is very upsetting you know i mean whats the matter with im slipping my cogwheels and i have failed utterly and so on i went about my work and eventually the nattering and snarling and so forth kept on coming didnt have anything much to do with what we were doing you know had some acquaintance with this particular individual couple of years afterwards and i found out something very interesting the individual was on an intentional reverse see he was totally inverted on intentions and thinking the thought into his head that he should leave would glue him in the chair you know just stuck i never did run the reverse experiment on him of thinking he should stay glued in the chair particularly but i have on others and actually seen them practically be catapulted out of their chair fantastic thing you know stick in the chair and wham theyre going well we got to go now and they just came for the evening you know terrible terrible situation so youre actually actually unless you were doing wholebody control of the pc you could think like you can think at mest object and make an ashtray sometimes move or do something weird people running upper indoc sometimes have funny things happen with ashtrays and so on they get quite upset about it and they think theyd better not do it and things like this but the best thing to think at an ashtray is you have gravity you have gravity you know that kind of thing if you want something funny to happen with ashtrays anyway if youre just thinking an intention at the pc youre just as likely to activate one of these crisscrossed it looks like the janitor relieving the switchboard girl during noon hour in which an emergency occurred you know and every wire is out of its socket and theyre all in crisscrossed across the boards and all phones are plugged to all phones and all of them wrong so of course you call up the presidents office or something like this and you get the electricalmaintenance shop you know and its just all crosswired and you run into that in running the cchs so it actually isnt all the pcs fault the pc is not necessarily being recalcitrant when he doesnt follow your auditing intention or starts to blow up or wogs or does something like this what youre actually doing is youre giving him the intention and the guidance to carry out that intention not the intention then called upon by the switchboard if you want to have some fun sometime with an emeter start talking to the entities in body theres all kinds of screwball phenomena that weve run into we probably have more phenomena and nonsense that we have discovered about life and so forth in scientology than theyve accumulated in the whole of the last fifty thousand years infinitely more its really really goofy but if you you could sit down and start talking to somebodys circuit and just get the pc to relay what the circuit said and for some peculiar reason you hook in the circuit harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and of course the oddity is that circuit hooks in on drop of havingness and that youre making communication line talk across to circuit you are 1 validating the circuit and 2 you are running down its havingness because circuit has livingness in it it is simply motivated mass and if theres anything running it at all it is mass so you get circuit to communicate very much and mass goes if you want to pull somebodys circuits in on him run his havingness down theres funny experiment that goes with this by the way it takes rather special conditions to operate and you have to be pretty sharp to get this thing theres two or three of these one of them is problem thats the commonest one and the easiest one to do is the individual tells you he has present time problem so you say think of solution and he gives you solution you say good think of another solution to this problem good good think of another solution to this problem and you wonder why this pc is starting to go wog man and he does he starts to go wog because youre doing something to the stable core of an area of motion and youre leaving all the motion on automatic you see and i got the mechanism on this few weeks ago and its in my notes somewhere but what happens is actually the person is not confronting the actuality of that thing at all hes not confronting what is actually going on hes confronting solution to it which means hes trying to notis what it is and the problem mass moves in on him and its quite interesting to watch you can ask pc do you have present time problem youre fortunate yes hes got present time problem all right you say now do you have any masses anywhere in the vicinity of your body and he says yes as matter of fact there is one out there about four or five feet you say all right now heres the exact mechanics of this you say all right now what is this present time problem of yours and he says uh well urn actually uh joe and bill and pete uh have all ganged up on and they wont speak to and you say where is this black mass now he says well its eight or nine feet out there and you say well describe this problem you have to and the individual says well its uh its joe and bill and pete actually and uh the problem is is i dont seem to be able to get along with them i dont talk their language well and you say well now all right you say well where is this mass now and he says well its fifteen or twenty feet out there youre liable to get this type of response you see all right you say well good good think of solution to that problem and he does you say where is this black mass now and he says well its out there eight or nine feet good you say well think of another solution to this problem and he does and you say where is this black mass and he says well its out there about four or five feet and you say well thats good you say think of another solution to this problem and so he does and you say wheres the black mass well as matter of fact what black mass things have gone black all right now you say all right now think of problem of comparable magnitude to that problem he does you say wheres this black mass now well its out there about foot from my face good you say think of another problem of comparable magnitude to that problem all right now where is that mass now well thats its five or six feet out in front of you say good think of problem of comparable magnitude to that problem where is it now well he says its out there about twelve feet good you say well think of problem of comparable magnitude to that problem where is it now and he says well he says its way out there you say well think of problem of comparable magnitude to that problem and he does you know and so forth where is it now he says it disappeared you say well thats good good think of solution to that problem all right wheres that black mass well its over there on the horizon good now think of solution to that problem all right where is it now oh he says its out there about twenty feet all right think of solution to that problem where is it now well its out here about four feet in front of my face and good now think of solution to that problem well its gone black and you can run that silly problem for some reason or other people who have problems who are capable of seeing at all visually will always tell you that there is black mass connected in the vicinity and solving the problem brings it in and getting problems of comparable magnitude pushes it out its matter of confrontingness is the clue to this if theyre not confronting the problem theyre avoiding it you see it of course on any vacuum arrangement at all thats bringing it in of course it just moves in closer and then if they are looking at it it tends to move out dont you see now you can do the same thing with havingness you say well what problem have you got well he says joe and bill and pete and they wont talk to anymore you say good all right now look around the room and find something you can have thank you look around the room and find something you can have thank you where is that black mass now and he says well its out there about nine feet and you say good look around the room and find something you can have look around the room and find something you can have look around the room where is that black mass now and he says its out there about twenty feet and you say well look around the room and find something you can have and look around the room and find something you can have where is it now he says well its disappeared you say good think of solution to that problem back it comes and you can just play hurdygurdy with this problem you see out it goes in it comes and its within your control to move this black mass in on the pc or move it off of him just on whether or not you have him gaze at the stable datum in the middle of it solutions you see that stability alone is being held there by the motion the unapparent motion in the mass thats all confusion you see youre getting him not to look at the confusion when you ask him to get solution you see and youve got that mechanism then youve said the same thing as when you think of problem of comparable magnitude to that problem youve said the same thing as confront it its similar statement in other words what is the problem you see well youve said confront it you get the idea invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem what if you had him doing that well youve taken the automaticity over of his bank creation of that black mass except people dont for some reason or other do well on this i do all right on it and lot of pcs do but enough people dont that we dont use it anymore creates that is to say we dont run create loosely if it turns up in the prehav scale run it so it halfkills the pc hell run out of it heres the crux of the matter however that you can move around by the regulation of problems and solutions or mass and mass which is havingness and havingness you can move around black masses in the bank now that is simple one and anybody can do that particular set of experiments and achieve those results more or less of course the pc has to be able to see black mass sometimes they see only invisibilities and this and that and sometimes theyre so snarled into problems that nothing can move off but on the average pc you could probably run this experiment now lets take the next experiment that proceeds from here i said the more difficult one the pc has circuit you say do you ever have voices ever have any voices talking to you the psychiatrists have been worried about voices ever since theres been psychiatry its practically synonymous with insanity if somebody has voices talking to him well gee whiz they ought to look at my collection man they ought to really look at my collection because it isnt so much voices but i usually compose piano music by listening to it and i will set up circuit that plays piano music and then forget to take it down and half an hour later all of sudden heres some piano music you know im never startled about what it is and then i say well thats it and thats the end of that piano music and will take it down you get the idea i wonder for instance how wind will sound in certain rigging rig you know is this going to be real noisy rig you know and ill set up ship and some wind and let her howl you know and thats the way it sounds too and then say well ive found that out now and i will set the whole thing aside and skip it you see i just cease to create it and its longer there i can set up moments of force moments of force tension compression and that sort of thing and check something out visually rather than set it up mathematically just set it up and well give you problem in derrick something like this now when the derrick is stayed at certain points and the stress is added at certain other points which way is the derrick going to bend and actually will build the derrick up and push the points to give it the stress dont you see and see which way its going to bend and that sort of thing and it works like that and it sure saves an awful lot of woodcarving and string tying and all of that sort of thing and these things are usually right and this is just methods of setting up situations synthetically to find out how they will operate in the real universe and that is not uncommon the weirdest one i ever heard about it was nikola tesla when he invented alternating current set up an alternatingcurrent motor he had set it up so it would work you see and weve had the same motor ever since nobodys even changed bolt in it and its too bad he didnt set up better cooling system in it and he let it run for two years to find out his problem was will it last you see so he set this thing up in mental imagery you know he set it up in the bank and let it run for two years and at the end of two years he decided that it was pretty well designed so he built it thats nikola tesla that was the way that boy invented everything now im not above doing mathematical problem on an abacus you know put an abacus up out there and shuffle the beads on the abacus back and forth carrying over decimals of one character or another and keep carrying these decimal setups and finally add it over on the left and right side of the scale an abacus is very interesting piece of machinery its almost an adding machine or multiplying calculator they give it to little kids in school and i see these little kids in school going wingwing with the beads you know and theyre counting one two three four five learn how to count on it or something or add that isnt the way you use one you use them on complicated septisigmal systems or decimal systems or something like this and you keep carrying them over from one side to the other i suppose you could write book four feet thick on the use of an abacus anyway set one of those things up well of course thats very easy thing to set up its very easy thing to set up column of figures and find out whether or not the figures are right it is actually much more fun to simply set up computer that after youve done the problem will verify the result this is tradition people like lecky and so forth i think it was lecky the guy that wrote probably the basic text on navigation for guys that didnt like pedanticism he said navigator is good unless when he calculates the position he doesnt have sixth sense to tell him that the answer is right or wrong he said navigator is good who cant do this actually very few people can do this but the best navigators can all do it theyll add up columns of figures and so forth suzies seen do this go down the line on not navigation go down on the line and get about halfway through problem and say well thats wrong thats wrong you see you got six columns of figures or something of the sort but the answer is wrong and just throw it out and do the problem all over again sure enough when i get down to that point something was off see all right this simply is an establishment of rightness or wrongness and its also done by circuitry all right im talking now about useful circuitry lets go little bit further over into useful circuitry common circuitry this is not obsessive circuitry this is just ordinary runofthemill voices in the head you see but this is the way they are really set up we get into situation where we want to know what its going to be like tomorrow weather we call the weather bureau and they give us lot of calculations all based on the rudimagoojits and the wingdings that are going whizzlewhizzle on top of the muttwutt and this all calculates with the diceotherms and the catabars you see man there have been more aviators plowed into fog banks and so forth by these diceotherms all twisted around the catabars i wouldnt be seen dead with one of them myself they finally got practical method of investigating hurricanes they fly an aircraft patrol over the area all the time and when they see one they take its latitude and longitude on loran bearings and report it and then they plot its course and speed and they say where it is going and even then they predict its destinations wrong weather is not something that is trustworthy actually do you realize that if you plotted out for england tomorrow will be fair that you would be 50 percent right did you know that and you know the weather bureau only hits 38 percent its interesting isnt it so if they just took it at random and told us every day tomorrow would be fair at least theyd be giving us hope but the science of weather prediction is well lets be kind its in its infancy and they figure out what the dew point is on the rye up in north manchester and that gives us the sussex coast you know i mean its real nice ive studied with these boys and they have very serious approach to life lets say that but what i used to twit them about was their tremendous overweening confidence in the things that were going hurglegurgle and their total avoidance of ever reading yesterdays prediction the only way they could keep their morale up is the way they used to inform well you can set up circuit that will give you tomorrows weather very easily i wouldnt go to sea without one now some people do this and then blame it on the rheumatism because they hook it into the rheumatic circuit you see and then they say twinge bad weather tomorrow you see but you neednt get that drastic theres reason to set up an alarm system just because its going to be foggy you know the facts of the matter is is what you set it up is out here and you say what is the weather going to be tomorrow so you take the increment of time known as tomorrow and you observe it and that tells you what the weather is of course because you look around the scenery having looked at the increment of time which is tomorrow having looked around and found whether or not it is raining windy foggy cold or hot you are then pretty safe providing you can with equanimity look at tomorrow thats how simple circuit is compare it now to all these substitute calculations if you could simply say all right lets take look at the weather tomorrow in view of the fact that the weather hasnt got very much consequence to it almost all of you have lived through rainstorms without melting this is an element of tomorrow which almost anybody could mock up or almost anybody is willing to observe theres great danger in it oh quite something else we are in tremendous emergency with regard to court actions or something of this sort and we want to know man because our whole life is hanging on the rim of the precipice what is the judge going to say tomorrow see or what is who is going to win is greasy knees going to win the third at pimlico see weve got the family jewels on it and we havent bothered to tell anybody that we put the family jewels on it you see now theres lots of pressure connected with this sort of thing so we say lets see well now look with what confidence are we regarding tomorrow you see were regarding it with confront because theres tremendous numbers of confronts mixed up in tomorrow that we dont want to have anything to do with we wont look at the bad decision the judge is going to make or the fact that greasy knees is going to live up to his name and see we wont look at those consequences so we get onesided view of the increment of time known as tomorrow and then that becomes very untrustworthy because we are postulating at the same time that greasy knees is going to win the race and the judge is going to put down favorable decision so we wind up looking at our own postulates not looking at tomorrows weather and then of course we get wrong predict about 90 percent of the time get the idea so you can predict to the degree that you can confront and if persons confrontingness is very bad off never trust their prediction wanda the psychic reader all of sudden i was going down boulevard in phoenix arizona driving along minding my own business i must have had some kind of an overt that day probably thinking bad thoughts about purcell or something and i got halfway down through the middle of the block and wanda the psychic reader suddenly diverges from stream of traffic on fourlane highway and drives casually not even rapidly this way across the street and runs into male voice she wandaed you said it and her father got out and gave her professional card i dont think i would have had any confidence in that girl now her confront was thing to be horrified about you see nobody got hurt nothing happened but this is pretty weird but her confront was terrible we found out she was trying to turn corner but that was half of one of these fivehundred or sixhundredfoot blocks behind her she was turning corner where there wasnt any now wouldnt you think her confront was rather poor all right now were going to base lot of reliance on her prediction ah but her prediction is directly related to her ability to confront now people who cant or wont confront anything dont even confront present time much less tomorrow but they will try to confront obsessively tomorrow or yesterday in the hopes that they wont have to confront today and of course there isnt any tomorrow that theyre confronting that is totally goof tomorrow you see and the yesterday probably isnt right either ask them what they had for breakfast and theyll give you the awfulest ramifications which is just total notis substitute of what they really ate you know now heres the situation if youre in fairly good shape on the subject of confrontingness you could rise well above weather but lets supposing that hiking up into tomorrow was of great consequence to us you know we didnt particularly want to go through the ritual you see of saying lets see what is the date all right what is the hour at what time will we be doing something tomorrow all right now lets confront the area in which were going to do that thing all right now lets see are they cirrus cumulus altocastalatus nimbus you know and do complete catalog of the situation take out our wetanddrybulb reading you see and so forth and get the whole thing straight and write it down seems little bit arduous so what you do is set up secondary circuit not because you cant confront tomorrow but because you dont take time to confront tomorrow you set up secondary circuit and make it look at tomorrow its prediction circuit now it looks at tomorrow and you set it up to look at tomorrow instantly and give you only one result yea or nay you can set up these instantaneous circuits with the greatest of ease so long as theyre just yeaornay circuits or something like this theyre not going to give you any complex result you know you know you could even set it up for tomorrow and if its going to be nice weather wave green flag you know and if its going to be bad weather why wave red one i dont care what see its just boom you know and you eventually find yourself possessed of some kind of circuit that tells you the weather tomorrow and one day youre scrambling around doing something else and you suddenly look up and something is waving you know brilliant red flag now where you go nuts on circuits is when you say who put that there who else put that there and what does it mean and we can get quite game out of this its big game of mystery and so forth well all you got to do is find out the purpose of the circuit and itll ordinarily blow up or you can set it up now pcs that havent got control of their circuits or havent taken over their circuits for many many years havent inspected them i say many years im talking about many billions of years theyve just let this bricabrac accumulate and theyve not done anything about it and so forth you start auditing them and something waves red flag they say whats this whats this thing you know or little train goes by on the track with sign in each car you know little sign in each car and it says it will be bad and the next three signs are blurred and the pc says im going round the bend you know or you ask pc how did you know the answer to that question he said well this little train went by and it had word in each car thats the answers to the question youll find some people go around on circuitry auditing dont you see only their circuits are so old so forgotten so neglected and were put up in such an anxiety of nottoconfront that of course they cant confront anything about them now and any time they get in the vicinity of them then the circuit tells them what to say and do and youre running into this in auditing all the time thats the anatomy of the circuit its just noconfront of any kind whatsoever therefore running havingness and confront along with processes actually improves the circuit how does it improve the circuit it improves confront naturally that improves the status of circuits because circuits only go bad when an individual refuses to confront an area and puts circuit in it instead he first did it to save time later on he began to believe that he couldnt confront that area there was something very unconfrontable there why is it unconfrontable well he has circuit doing it doesnt he so therefore it couldnt be possibly its like the fact that they put television camera in the atomic blast furnace you know because they cant put nuclear physicist in there they know that theyve tried it you know and they just cant make it i dont know why not anyway anyway thats remote viewing or remote knowing now its this other thing i was telling you about you hear bird chirping outside ask the pc to make picture out there and then bring it in here and look at it to find out what kind of bird it is and my god you get anything from rhinoceros to threetailed whoosis you know hasnt anything to do with this cuckoo that is out there nothing to do with cuckoo and you very often ask an individual this this is an interesting diagnostic question you talk about bricabrac that we know in scientology we know so darn much that its i tell you the boys if we were handling this as scientific activity which cataloged everything we knew you see in relationship to it and then took paper down on everything there was there when you realize that preclear is capable of an infinity of differences you just multiply infinity times the number of preclears there are and you got that many papers wed have to file and i dont like to file papers somebody will curse someday for not having written everything down that we ever knew and put it in library file but let call to their attention that people have been doing this for long time and they still didnt know anything there might be something suspect about the method all right you tell this pc all right now your primary aberration and the exact terminal we want to run now all right thats what were interested in were interested in your primary aberration the exact terminal we want to run all right now over there where it is or wherever it is make picture of it good thank you very much now look at the picture now tell what it is and you know they will tell you some of the most remarkable things it may or may not be the right answer but they certainly are remarkable theyre certainly remarkable theyll get some pictures of childhood influences psychoanalyst would go absolutely drooling mad the absolute deliciousness of this particular modus operandi would have thrown him into tizzy you know like tigers get when you put perfume on them man that would be marvelous hed just have an unlimited data he wouldnt have to depend on dreams anymore he wouldnt have to depend on anything anymore anyplace all hed have to do is tell this person now make picture of whats wrong with you now look at the picture and tell what it is and the fellow says well its picture of my grandfather sitting in front of the stove and i seem to be in the stove i did that myself one timesurprised myself half to death now whats this whats this yeah well thats what it is whats this in the first place you told him to make picture of the bird that he heard and you heard outside the window and then bring it in the house and take look at it and he didnt get picture of bird he got picture of rhinoceros or it was different kind of bird is the usualest thing its an alteris well naturally its an alteris because this action of taking the picture of the object and then looking at the picture is of course an alteris of confront you didnt tell him to take look at the bird and say what it was you told him to take picture of the thing and say what it was you got it so youve removed it that much so therefore hes just that far from being able to confront it okay all right our next point then as were looking at this is is very simple one is that youre trying to get individuals to look directly at things and their circuitry encourages them not to look at things because its normally set up to spare them the trouble of confronting or to avoid having to confront something so they confront it on via and as you audit the pc these things go live two things make them go live his havingness drops so therefore he becomes little anxious so therefore he starts relying on circuitry to predict and that sort of thing or his confront drops or his confront improves or his havingness improves and either way these things can go live in other words his havingness or confront drop they go live on deteriorated basis his havingness and confront is improved they go live because hes coming up through it dont you see and all of them are observation on via so everything hes trying to do basically is characterized by alterisness or observation on via auditing on via everything on via its just on via that is the motto of the thetan its not direct its on via and your methods of getting him there are to walk him up rapidly so he has less and less vias less and less vias less and less vias which means less and less circuits less and less circuits less and less barriers you get the idea more and more confidence more and more assurance more and more ability to confront actually isnt it thats why you dont have confront on your main list because itself is result and an end product it itself isnt doingness its an ability all right that explains to you then some of the oddities that occur particularly in running in the cchs and these oddities are considerable because youre activating circuits and youre knocking out circuits because the direct control and communication brings about continuous shift of circuitry in terms of havingness and then because youve got him in pt and he is confronting another body another being his own body and the physical universe of course his havingness is also coming up on that particular basis and you shift through lots of circuitry and its way of plowing straight through circuitry and you get all kinds of things going live and shutting off and so forth now if you were to turn around and talk to these circuits and said well how do you think the pcs doing now oh you think its going to rain tomorrow oh i see i get it hm i understand hmhm if youre plowing somebody rapidly through circuits what are you trying to do youre trying to plow him through circuits and raise his havingness and his confront basically with the cchs which is communication and control improve his havingness well whats your end result if you suddenly go into communication with these circuits because circuits are coming live and circuits are going out and circuits are coming in and circuits are going out your pcs liable to say anything this is beefy process you see your cchs and your pc at any given moment is liable to tell you anything hes liable to predict anything anything is liable to happen so the less attention you pay to what the pc is saying or what the pc thinks or what the pc feels while youre running the cchs the better off youre going to be and thats why you never end process just because the pc thinks its flat and as youre plowing somebody through circuitry of one kind or another as he is moving up the line he gets somatics he gets comm lags he dopes off he does this he does that whats dopeoff its just noconfront of magnitude you see and it means that something is happening to the confrontingness of this pc its good indicator comm lag means something is happening to the confrontingness of the pc dopeoff also means something is happening to the havingness of the pc dopeoff also means that something is happening to the confronting of the pc there we go i mean it means all those things also there are many other manifestations all of sudden circuit that was set up in cave days in order to remove him from the path of snakes that when he saw snake he was supposed to leap violently eight feet to the left and all of sudden he starts moving and this old circuit goes into action and hell try to explain it to you in fifty dozen different ways but he hasnt even confronted the circuit the trouble is hes moved eight feet to the left or hes tried to or he feels he should and therefore he doesnt look that he should move eight feet to the left what he thinks is theres something dangerous under his feet you got the idea so hes getting all kinds of quote survival mechanisms unquote which are coming in and out and prediction mechanisms are coming in and out and series of forebodings and that sort of thing will all operate why because its all on this basic circuitry now you as you sit right there use circuitry of one kind or another as long as the circuitry isnt out from underneath your control and you havent parked it on the basis that i will never be able to confront this i will never be able to cope with this sort of thing so ill set up this machine to cope with it because i myself am an incompetent and when that is totally the basis of circuitry from that time on that circuit gets hidden when youre running the cchs that circuit is liable to spring out but what end of it springs out its liable to be it cant be confronted or i will never be able to confront this or it is impossible to confront this and the pc thinks its the circuit that is impossible to confront when as matter of fact its the fact that elephants spray water all over you in circuses and that mustnt be confronted because your mother gets mad at you and spanks you this kid goes out and he says ill get even with my mother ill set up this circuit and or any kind of computation dont you see and these circuits are absolutely infinite in their purposes theyre as infinite as pc can make postulates and they run out and pc is liable to tell you anything in any kind of auditing and therefore its only up to you to tell whether or not any of these cchs or anything else is flat i dont think ive ever talked about this at any great length circuits but they appear actually in book one ive never said this much about circuits before it isnt matter that circuits are all bad what gets bad about circuits is somebody sets up circuits because he himself is unable he says and when circuits have this type of postulate mixed up in them why they get very haywire indeed as you get on up the line you all of sudden find out that you will set up and knock out circuits just for the hell of it you wonder what you should eat for lunch well you do this right now undoubtedly you wonder what should you eat for lunch well set it up set it up in front of you and taste some of it you know thats quite common action and dont however go through this oddity of having finished lunch at howard johnsons or something of the sort and their pickled pigs knuckles that day happen to be sour and rancid or something and dont then take your eating circuit and set it up so that itll be impossible after that ever to set up pigs knuckles because then something infinitely bad is evidently wrong with pigs knuckles so you even smell pigs knuckles and you feel bad you see where as matter of fact the pigs knuckles were long way back you put them in the bank so that youd never confront them again which seems to to be an odd rationale but thetan is very capable of it and does it consistently my apologies for making this an overtime lecture but i thought you might be interested audience thank you very much okay thank you
