from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to kevin trenberth trenbertcgducaredu subject quick question date tue dec 21 113909 2004 kevin idea how chris folland got this presumably david parker forwarded it anyway it doesnt matter the questions are when will you be sending your signedoff draft will this be the complete doc file of text will you be modifying any of the figures on the latter just want to know if im keeping track of figs as well as refs ive got the two you sent last night ill be off from 5pm on dec 23 ill begin reading the draft from dec 29 will likely be in at least once on dec 2931 but will be checking email from dec 29 cheers phil all as someone who dealt with these matters in the past decision about the climate normals period was regarded as so important that all of wg1 debated it and agreed the outcome so that should be the route again i believe if change is wanted from personal perspective i tend to agree with phil that this time we should stick in general to 196190 normals and that ipcc 2013 should perhaps change to 19812010 having said that we may produce 19812000 normals in the next year for sst if we can solve adequately remaining problems for climate change monitoring with satellite ssts key goal is monitoring changes in the southern ocean solutions are likely to include use of some corrected to bulk sst data atsr data this depends on work elsewhere in the met office however some less well corrected avhrr data is needed as well to extend normals adequately back to 1981 in much of the southern oceanthis may give new perspectives on the southern ocean sst changes are likely to be significantly different in the southern half of the southern ocean from the global average this is suggested by the lack of reduction of antarctic sea ice in contrast to the arctic which still persists such work may or may not get into ipcc far but if it did it could be special case but it would need careful handling for conversion to advice to policy makers chris prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
