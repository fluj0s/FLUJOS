specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31993nuclear warhead pit production background and issues for congress summary pit is the fissile core of nuclear warhead in modern warheads it creates nuclear explosion that tri ggers substantially larger thermonuclear explosion all pits currently in the us nuclear stockpile were made at the rocky flats plant near denver co which opened in 1952 the partment of energy doe halted pit manufacturing operations there in 1989 the united states has been unable to make stockpilequality pits and therefore complete nuclear warheads since then inability to make pits may have adverse consequences for example 1 the united states cannot replace pits for the w 88 warhead for the trident ii missile that are destroyed during evaluation currently only one w88 evaluation pit remains so use of more w88 pits would reduce deployab warheads 2 pits deteriorate over time though the rate at which that happens is under study if pits of given type deteriorate so much as to be longer relia ble or if an unanticipated defect arises then hundreds to thousands of deployed warheads might have to be withdrawn the national nuclear security administration nnsa which manages the us nuclear weapons program has fi vepart plan to restore pit production capability 1 establish small facility pf4 at alamos national laboratory nm to fabricate pits initially for the w 88 alamos manufactured the first pit to stockpile standards in april 2003 2 develop procedures to certify w88 pits to provide high confidence without nuclear sting that the pits will work as intended nnsa expects that in 2007 alamos will be able to certify w88 pits that it makes only certified pits can enter th stockpile 3 c onduct experiments not nuclear tests in support of w88 pit certification at the ne vada test site 4 conduct pit manufacturing and certification for other pits 5 plan modern pit facility mpf with higher capacity than pf 4 to reach full operational capability in fy2021 nnsa estimates total cost at 146 b illion for items 1 and 2 smaller amounts for items 3 and 4 and 2 billion to 4 billion for item 5 congress has long shown interest in the program it generally supports lowrate production at alamos it raised concern over budgeting and the pace of pit certification but now praises nnsa for tur ning around the w88 pit program on mpf the fy2004 defense aut horization act supported the administrations schedule the appropriations act reduced funding conf erees stated that until congress reviews nuclear stockpile plans it is premature to pursue furthe r decisions on mpf mpfs schedule to reach full operational capab ility slipped year between 2003 and 2004 congress faces several issues as it cons iders the pit program is nnsas plan for certification reasonable does the united states need new pits beyond limited quantities for the w88 if so what capacity is needed can pf4 be expanded to build enough pits to avoid the need for mpf could mpfs schedule be accelerated should its schedule be delayed this report is intended for those interest ed in the us nuclear weapons program it will

issues for congress background us policy since the mid1950s has been to maintain stockpile of at least several thousand nuclear weapons active and inactive fo r the indefinite future the bush administration reaffirmed this policy in its nuclear posture review briefed to congress in early 20021 this report deals with an element the administration views as necessary for continued maintenan ce of the stockpile resuming production of pits key component of nuclear warheads2 us nuclear warheads include primary and secondary stage the primary stage has layer of chemical explosive surrounding shell of fissile metal all warheads in the stockpile use plutonium and other components detonating the explosive compresses the fissile metal so much that it can sustain fission chain reaction the resulting nuclear explosion tr iggers secondary stage which through fission and fusion produces most of the warh eads explosive yield in the primary the components inside the explosive make up what is called the pit of these components the plutonium shell is by far the hardest to make when completed the pit is sealed to protect it from air and moisture from 1952 to 1989 rocky flats plant unde r the supervision of the department of energy doe and its predecessor agen cies used industrialscale processes to manufacture many thousands of pits for ployed weapons all weapons now in the us stockpile use pits made there l alamos and lawrence livermore national laboratories fabricated hundreds of oneofak ind pits for nuclear tests following 1989 raid by agents of the federal bureau of investigation and ot hers to investigate suspected environmental safe ty and health violations3 doe suspended rocky flats pit manufacturing operations in 1989 and pe rmanently closed these operations in 1992 thus since 1989 the united states has had capability to build pits of the quality and quantity that doe deems necessary for use in the stockpile doe stated in february 2004 today the united stat is the only nuclear weapons powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31993crs2 4 us department of ergy secretary of energy national nuclear security administration report to congressional fense committees on an

stockpilecertif ied plutonium pits required to sustain its nuclear arsenal4 the national nuclear security ad ministration nnsa semiautonomous agency within doe that congress estab lished in 1999 manages the nuclear weapons complex the labs plants and test s ite for nuclear warhead rd production maintenance etc it is thus re sponsible for restoring pit production nnsa holds that the inability to build pits could impair the nuclear stockpile for reasons such as the following each year nnsa monitors some warheads for defects most of these warheads can be put back in to the stockpile but few undergo more extensive tests that preclude their reuse these latter tests include destruction of pits therefore when doe built pits for stockpile weapons it built some spares to replace pits expected to be destroyed over warheads design life now warheads are expected to remain in the stockpile far be yond their design lives unless new pits are made by the time spares are used up tests that consume pits would force the removal of depl oyed warheads from the stockpile based on current data nnsa anticipates that pits will last for decades but will eventually deteriorat if that proves to be the case nnsa would ultimately have to repl ace all pits that remain in the stockpile beyond that time without replacement pits if type of pit develops certain kinds of defects nnsa might have to withdraw from service all warheads using that pit if nnsa designs new nuclear warheads in the future it would probably need new pits for them nnsa now stores thousands of pits from retired warheads in theory new warhead designs might incorporate stored pits howeve r any aging problems would affect stored pits as well as deployed pits so that nnsa cannot count on using existing pits in future warheads the nuclear posture review presents the administrations general policy guidance for nuclear weapons and related defense elements including infrastructure while it is classified nnsa said that the review

basis for the pit manufacturing and certification campaign was record of decision on stockpile stewardshi p published december 26 1996 in which doe decided to reestablish pit fabrication capability with small capacity at the alamos national laboratory7 doe estimated requirements at 20 pits per year to replace pits destroyed in surveillance testin g but also claimed that with the capability to produce all types of pits in the stoc kpile it could produce about 50 pits per year in single shift operations it judged the latter rate would be sufficient for the next 10 years or more rejected larger capacity because of small current demand and the long period before added capac ity might be needed and raised the prospect of greater capacity in the future8 shortterm goal w88 pits rocky flats plant ceased production abruptly when it was only partway through the planned production run of pits for the w88 nuclear warhead used on the trident ii submarinelaunched ballistic missile only one w88 pit remains for destructive evaluation9 accordingly the most urgent shortterm need of the current pit program is to produce and certify w88 pits to accomplish these tasks the w88 pit effort has two main elements within the pit manufacturing and certification campaign w88 pit manufacturing and w 88 pit certification third element pit campaign support activities at nts ma inly involves

the tran sition from manufacturing that supported certification to interim pr oduction of w88 pits pit campaign support activities at nts is not budgeted in fy2007 because subc ritical experiments to support the w88 are planned to be completed in fy2006 s imilarly w88 pit cer tification budgets are planned to end after fy2008 as resu lt of expected certification in fy2007 by way of background the term certifiable and the fouryear gap between delivery of certifiable pit and certified or war reserve pit have caused much confusion certifiable pits meet quality control and pro cess standards certified pits meet product performance standards certifiable pit is manufactured using processes meeting standards set by the laboratory that designed the weapon and approved by nnsa war reserve pit is one that nnsa has determined to meet engineering and physics standards to be accepted for use in deployed nuclear weapons nnsa has launched major effort to establish that certifiable pits meet these product standards it holds that it needs this effort because alamos manufactures pits using different methods and equipment than did rocky flats rocky flats pits were proven to work in underground nuclear tests at the nevada test site the us nuclear test moratorium which started in 1992 nd continues to the present bars similar tests on pits manufactured at alamos nnsa plans to provide the basis for certifying pits without nuclear tests by monstrating through computer models subc ritical experiments10 smallscale laboratory experiments experiments using multimilliondollar nuclear physics facilities and archived data from past nuclear tests that alamos pits are equivalent to rocky flats pits in many key characteristics and by resolving uncertainties conservatively such as by insisting on tighter specifications and great er manufacturing precision in these ways nnsa seeks to provide confidence that alamos pits will work as designed to meet the need for w88 pits nnsa decided to create at alamos facility that could pr oduce pits at low rate the facility is housed in pf4 plutonium facility 4 whic h opened in 1978 for plutonium rd it occupies about 30 of the space in pf4 available for plutonium operations another 25 is reserved for plutonium metal preparation alam manufactured the first certifiable w88 pit in april 2003 nnsa expects alam to produce six or more

certification was on track and that production of certifiable pits was proceedin g extremely well with five such pits produced as of early march 200413 the nearterm goal is to produce those pits needed to support certification experiments each early pit has specific physics and engineering certification test purpose and will exercise the processes required to confirm that production is relia ble and efficient accord ingly there is reason now to produce pits faster than the schedule calls for once certification activities are complete nnsa may choose to increase the production rate in theory nuclear testing could acceler ate pit certification successful test would demonstrate promptly that pit work ed and that the processes used to make it were acceptable in practice however nnsa would probably conduct series of tests because single test would not likely provide sufficient confidence and the first test might indicate the need for changes that would require subsequent tests to validate further it would take 2 or 3 ears from presidential decision to test until the conduct of first test while the administration plans to reduce that time perhaps to 18 months it would take some time to make that change compared to the current program if it proceeds as anticipated then testing might accelerate certification by year or so pf4s capacity and schedule and th schedule for pit certification have changed over time and statements have been contradictory in the december 1996 record of decision cited above doe appeared to need capacity of 20 pits per year would wind up with capacity of 50 year and found the latter sufficient for some time doe foresees only the replacement of pits destroyed in routine surveillance testing unless n earterm lifelimiting phenomenon is

performance one report finds that plutonium undergoe s benign aging and exhibits good crystalline order even after decades of aging31 it may also be argued that any decision on future pit production can be put off until there is reasonable evidence on the shelf life of pits nnsa on the other hand believes that p its will ultimately fa il to function if one type of pit used in deployed warhead s goes bad then depending on the specifics of the problem there might be confiden ce in any of the hundreds to thousands of warheads using that pit or in spare pits of that type which would age at the same rate as pits in deployed warheads nnsas view is that maintaining the stockpile indefinitely therefore requires in the l onger term higher pit fabrication capacity than pf4 can offer in order to replace pits removed due to aging or destructive testing similarly the panel to assess the reliability safety and security of the united states nuclear stockpile the foster panel observed wh ile it is desirable to attempt to forecast the life spans of plutonium and other weapon components we must be able to replace such parts if our predictions are incorrect or our needs for deterrence change and recommended that nnsa establish with urgency pit production capability adequate for national needs32 responding to the argument that plutonium aging will not impair weapon performance for long time nnsa asserts that based on research at the w eapons labs increased deltaphase stability of plutonium with aging cannot be assumed33 because of or depending on ones point of view despite uncertainty

fy2004 as reflected in the increased request from 21 million in fy2003 to 228 million in fy2004 as discussed under the fy2004 re quest below however the fy2004 energy and water development

schedule are modest fraction of the total project cost planning activities before construction starts are expected to account for more than half the total project time at about fifth of the estimated

drawbacks nnsa states that it requires the agility to simultaneously manufacture different types of pits and that ta55 cannot provide such agility for stockpile sized in the 1000s of warheads because of inadequate floor space nnsa says it could make do with ta 55 if the longterm stockpile is at level in the 100s of weapons with reduced number of pit types and if modifications to ta55 to manufacture 50 pits per year could be made without constructing an additional building it recommended against this upgrade for such reasons as high risk that it could not do the upgrade within ta55 the upgrade might be completed around 2015 at which point the facility would be about 40 years ol d and it would be problematic to operate it another 50 years and the layout designed for rd is not optimal for producti on operations 1314 nnsa plans to take various steps to preserve expertise in pit production these include mainta ining an interim production capability at alamos drawing on us experts in plutonium manufacturing and nuclear facility operations for planning mpf and starting to hire and train staff for mpf at least 5 years before operations start 18 nnsa staff stated that there are too many uncertainties to establish an annual requirement for numbers and types of pits to be produced when mpf is operational44 instead nnsa arrived at range of capacities by examining the range of variance of such factors as size and composition of the stockpile in the future pit lifetime and whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31993crs14 fullscale production might start nnsa will continue to revalidate mpf capacity 21 in particular 125 pits per year is reasonable estimate for the minimum capacity minimum set of pit manufacturing equipment would result in manufacturing facility with capacity of approxima tely 125 pitsyear 19 challenges to does report on mpf acceleration the case for accelerating or even building mpf might be challenged in the following ways if pf4 began production at rate of 50 pits per year in 2015 and the stockpile many years from now d 2000 pits both deployed and nondeployed pf4 could produce 1750 of these pits by 2050 future stockpile in this range is possible the strategic offensive reductions treaty calls for 17002200 deployed strategic warheads by 2012 and there are additional stockpiled pits that are not deployed on the other hand the num ber of deployed nuclear forces has been declining for 20 years or more if mpfs capacity is 125 pits per ear and the stockpile many years from now included 2000 pits then nnsa could rebuild these pits in 16 years if the rebuild had to be finished by 2050 then in theory mpf could begin operations in 2034 it might be well to advance this date by few years to provide margin in case unanticipated problems required an earlier rebuild of some warheads even in that case it could be argued that there is need to complete mpf by 2021 let alone to accelerate it accordingly while mpf might be accelerated by few years at fraction of the projected cost it might arguably be better use of funds to wait on mpf until pit life nd future stockpile size became clearer if it appears some years from now that the future stockpile will drop sharply then pf4 might suffice yielding net savings largescale production at mpf is scheduled to begin three decades after rocky flats shut mpf w ould involve different people than rocky flats at different locati on in new facility with different equipment and processes despite ongoing efforts for certification it could be argued that uncertain ties would be likely to arise about the performance of mpf pits th uncertainties could generate pressure to conduct nuc lear tests keeping the production line open at ta55 might reduce these uncertainties despite explicit direction by the senate armed services committee that the report base mpf capacity on specific requirements nnsa based capacity on parametric analysis it may be that there was other reasonable approach and cap acity of 125 pits per year may turn out to be needed if it is found that substantially smaller capacity is needed once mpf is well along however the united states would be committed to mpf even though it would in this case have been less costly to use pf4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31993crs15 45 us congress committee of conference national defense authorization act for

pits are needed what is the required capacity how might that capacity be obtained and how quickly could or should that be done is nnsas plan for certification reasonable yes to certify pits without nuclear testing nnsa believes it must use much more sophisticated techniques than were used to certify rocky flats pits in order to rule out each plausible source of failure in one view only nuclear testing can assure that pits will work as intended on grounds that pits ar sensitive to minor variations in process and materials many potential unknowns exis t and computer models may not capture what we do not know others see the certif ication plan as excessive claiming pits will work despite minor pr oduction variations for decades alamos and livermore technicians made ma ny oneofakind pits for testing these pits did not meet war reserve standards but as evidenced by the nuclear test record great many of them worked64 prospects absent nuclear testing the united states seems sure to use

unsuitable for these warheads because of design or aging some believe pits will deteriorate so slowly that decisi on on mpf can be deferred for decades some see new types of warheads as undesirable because these warheads would imply that the united states was preparing to test bu ild deploy and threaten the use of nuclear weapons so these critics reject the neww eapons argument as rationale for new pits those who favor abolishing nucl ear weapons would not produce these weapons or their components prospects one can be certain that nnsa will not need to manufacture pits at some future date and at any rate nnsa will have limited capacity to produce pits at pf4 accordingly the need for some new pits is less at issue than are capacity schedule and the need for mpf if so what capacity is needed low it is not clear that pits will fail for many decades if ever in the critics view pf4 could replace the few pits without spares that are destroyed during surveillance if newdesign warheads are needed small numbers might suffice or nnsa might use spare pits for those warheads or it might convert existing warheads for ne w missions without changing the nuclear explosive package multipleshift operations at pf4 would increase output somewhat if needed further critics argue proceeding with mpf would reduce funds for other stockpile stewardship programs higher one study stated paramount concern is the need to begin work now on an adequate plutonium pit production manufacturing capability in order to hedge against the uncertainties in useful pit life and in the time require d to establish new production facility65 mpf in this view would guard against the failure of one or more type s of pits and would enable ongoing replacement of pits to forestall problems from aging it would permit fabrication of large numbers of newdesign warheads while smaller stockpile might permit lower pit produc tion capacity there can be assurance on future stockpile size prospects the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations conference report required doe and dod to submit report to congress with the fy2005 budget request providing details on stockpile plan supporting the nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum and stated it would be premature to pursue further decisions on mpf pending congressi onal review of the report in hearing before the h ouse armed services

other nnsa projects by drawing funds or manage rial attention from them it is not clear that the tradeoff would be worthwhile prospects the nnsa report arguably moves the debate away from the
