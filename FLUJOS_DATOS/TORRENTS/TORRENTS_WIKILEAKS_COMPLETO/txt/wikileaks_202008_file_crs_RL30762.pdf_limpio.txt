summary an issue of continuing concern to congress is the number of americans who lack health insurance coverage in 2001 an estimated 412 million americans were uninsured for the entire year 99 of whom were under age 65 the number of non elderly uninsured rose each year from 1987 to 1998 and then declined in both 1999 and 2000 before increasing again in 2001 in response to the increase in the uninsur ed population policymakers at the state and federal levels of government have been searching for effective affordable and politically feasible ways to expand access t health insurance coverage while variety of proposed solutions have been examined and debated recent congresses have shown growing interest in taxbased approaches in the 107thcongress the trade act of 2002 established refundabl and advanceable tax credit for the purchase of qualified health insurance by individuals who lose their jobs because of foreign trade number of proposals to create tax subsidies for the expansion of health insurance coverage have surfaced in the 108thcongress including measures to create two new taxpreferred health sa vings accounts hr 2596 as incorporated into hr 1 and tax credits for small empl oyers that provide health insurance coverage for eligible employees hr 450 s 10 s 53 s 86 and s 414 this report summarizes what is known abut the factors shaping the cost effectiveness of tax subsidies for expandi ng health insurance coverage in doing so it reviews the principal findings of recent studies assessing the costeffectiveness of variety of proposed subsidies many of which have been considered in recent congresses the report will be updated or rev ised to reflect important legislative activity or to incorporate significant new research findings on the use of tax policy to improve health insurance coverage tax policycan influence the demand for health insurance byaltering its aftertax cost and terms of coverage if the principal aim of policymakers is to expand health insurance coverage at politically acceptable cost through the use of new tax subsidies then certain factors would be critical in designing such subsidies one is the type of subsidy being offered tax ductions are more valuable to individuals in higher tax brackets than those in lower tax brackets but the vast majority of uninsured households fall in the lower brackets moreover nonrefundable tax credits for the purchase of health insura nce may have little impact because nearlyhalf of uninsured households have federa l income tax liability another factor to consider is who would be eligible for the tax subsidy the cost per newly insured appears to depend critically on how narrowly subsidy is targeted likely targets include lowwage firms lowincome workers whose employers do not offer health insurance and all individuals who are ine ligible for public or employerprovided insurance other important factors sha ping the efficacy of proposed tax incentives to expand health insurance coverage include the type of health insurance policies eligible for the incentives the shares of individual and family premiums they cover and their ultimate policy

issues for the 108thcongress an issue of continuing concern to congress is the number of americans who lack health insurance coverage in 2001 the most recent year for which estimates are available 412 million persons were uninsured1 409 million or 99 of whom were under age 65 among the nonelderly popula tion this is the highest total ever reported by the us census bureau and it marks the first time since 1998 that the number of uninsured under age 65 exceeded 40 million the number of nonelderly uninsured rose each year from 1987 to 1998 and then declined in both 1999 and 2000 before rising again in 2001 much of the expansion since the mid1980s has been due to sustained increases in the cost of health care which in turn drive up private health insurance premiums2 congressional concern about the size of the uninsured population has multiple roots one is the adverse health effects associated with lack of health insurance coverage compared to insured individuals individuals with or inadequate health insurance are more likely to postpone or do without needed health care incur burdensome personal debts for care they receive be denied access to health care be hospitalized for preventable health probl ems and have greater likelihood of being diagnosed with latestage breast prostate colorectal or skin cancer3another source of congressional concern is the economic costs arising from being uninsured according to recent study of the tradeoffs in using tax credits to expand health insurance coverage the uninsured pay only 30 of the actual cost of their care4the cost of uncompensated medical care received by uninsured individuals is passed on to the insured in the form of higher health insurance premiums to local state andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs2 5there is some uncertainty over the am ount of uncompensated care received by the uninsured major difficulty with many available estimates is that the data used to generate them are flawed the latest attempt to avoid th is difficulty is study by two senior analysts from the urban institute according to the study uninsured individuals received an estimated 35 billion in uncompensated care in 2001 or about 3 of total personal health care spending federal state and local governments covered an estimated 87 of that amount through combination of grants direct provision of care appropriated funds and special

is merit good according t this view all individuals regardless of ability to pay ought to have access to ade quate health care exponents also argue that if choices must be made they should b done so on the basis not of patients income or wealth but of factors related to the costeffectiveness of recommended medical care such as the age and sex of patient or the appropriateness and cost of prescribed treatments these concerns have led policymakers at the state and federal levels of government to search for effective affordable and politically feasible ways to expand access to adequate health insuranc coverage while variety of proposed solutions have been analyzed and debated including the creation of unrestricted medical savings accounts and singlepa yer health care system recent congresses have shown growing interest in taxbas ed approaches to increase this coverage6 in the 107thcongress the trade act of 2002 p l 107210 established new refundable tax credit for the purchase

the bush administration w ants to establish refundable tax credit for the purchase of health insurance by individuals under age 65 who are not covered under public or employer health plans the credit would subsidize up to 90 of the health insurance premium and would be capped at 1000 per adult and 500 per child for up to two children single filers with dependents and modified adjusted gross income magi of up to 15000 would be eligible for the maximum credit the credit phases out continuedjune the house passed bill hr 2596 as incorporated into the version of hr 1 passed by the house that among

plans through the nongroup market private purchasing groups statesponsored purch asing pools or state highrisk poolsthe use of tax policy to shrink the uninsured population appeals to some for variety of reasons although proponents of tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage do not necessarily agree on whi ch reasons are paramount foremost among them are preference for tax incentives to government spending in achieving important social goals recognition that existing federal tax subsidies for health insurance coverage are inequitable in tha t they exclude the nonelderly who are unemployed or drop out of the workforce and the belief that private insurance companies would be more efficient and effective than government agencies in providing americans with range of desi rable health insurance plans others however doubt that tax subsidies are an efficient or effective way to achieve substantial reductions in the size of t he uninsured population they tend to favor more direct solutions such as public health insurance programs targeted at the uninsured this report summarizes what is known bout the key factors shaping the cost effectiveness of tax subsidies for expandi ng health insurance c overage it opens with an examination of the economic justification for government intervention in the market for health insurance the re port then moves on to discuss important considerations in designing tax subsidie s for expanding health insurance coverage and concludes with review of the principal findings of recent studies assessing the costeffectiveness of variety of propos ed tax subsidies many of which mirror proposals considered in recent congresses the report will be updated or revised to reflect legislation to expand federal tax incentives for

appears riddled with imperfections in addition to the three problems discussed here consumers and h ealth insurance companies face imperfect information relating to the skills of doctors h ealth profiles of patients and the benefits of treatments and procedures competition in the provision of health care services is limited and providers whose principal objective goes beyond the minimization of costs or maximization of profits play large role in the delivery of health care for more details on these market failures see joseph stiglitz economics of the public sector 3rdedition new york ww norton 2000 pp 308311rationale for government intervention in the market for health insurance mainstream economic theory holds that markets are most likely to achieve their best possible outcomes when government s refrain from intervening in their operations yet one of the defining character istics of the us health insurance market is the dominant role played by state and federal health insurance programs and tax subsidies for health insurance11in 2001 for example spending on medicare and medicaid which provide health insuranc for the elderly and large number of the poor and disabled and the state children s health insurance program totaled 4548 billion and the federal government lost an estimated 657 billion in tax revenues because of the tax exclusion for employerprovided health insurance according to the joint committee on taxation on what economic grounds can such involvement be justified conventional economic analysis suggests two possible grounds on the one hand mainstream economic theory holds that social welfare is enhanced by the widespread availabilityof actuariallyfair insurance most individuals are riskaverse to some degree and riskaverse individuals are thought to be better off when they can reduce their financial risks by transferring them to entities with comparative advantage in risk bearing because of their capacity for risk pooling and diversification eg private insuranc companies thus most individuals would want to buy enough health insurance provide d the cost reflects their expected annual losses from health problems health economists seem to agree that health insurance is likely to yield maximum social welfare gains when coverage is widespread among all risk groups the potential losses from health problems are large and the probabilities of suffering such problems cannot be known for specific individuals on the other hand if the market for health insurance were left to its own devices there would be certainty that health insurance cove rage would produce net welfare gain instead of the emergence of broad actuarially fair insurance coverage one might find that available c overage would be excessive in many cases and too few individuals would have adequa and affordable insurance coverage undesirable outcomes such as these may arise because the provision of health care is vulnerable to four market failures adverse selection moral hazard incompleteness and the existence of free riders in the utilization of medical care12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs6 13in 1992 for example 10 of americans accounted for 72 of personal health expendituresadverse selection refers to process which is likely to emerge in the health insurance market when buyers of particular policies have greater risks of illness and injury than the average potential buyer it is most likely to materialize when participation in health in surance coverage is voluntary risk pools are small and dominated by experience rating and multitude of insurers vie for market share by offering consumers range of plans with varying benefits in general the average buyer of health insurance plan has an boveaverage risk of developing serious health problems such tendency is rooted in the fact that very small share of the us population accounts for large share of spending on health care in given year13this disparity if uncorrected by polic intervention can touch off an upward spiral in insurance premiums driven by efforts by insurers to raise rates to cover losses from unanticipated claims in respons individuals with relatively low risks eg young healthy adults may choose to become uninsured or switch to cheaper policies offering less coverage while individuals with relatively high risks eg middleaged adults who smoke do not exercise regularly and are overweight face the choice of paying premiums far above th eir expected losses switching to cheaper policies offering inadequate coverage or becoming uninsured and relying on charity care as needed the prevalence of advers selection in nongroup markets gives insurance companies an incentive to engag in practice known as cherry picking where they focus on selling health insurance to those with relatively low risks among health economists moral hazard refers not to character defect but to the excessive utilization of health care fostered by having health insurance and the associated efficiency losses health insurance can have this effect mainly because insured individuals bear only fraction of the actual cost of the health care they receive weakening their incentive to avoid behaviors that are known to contribute to health problems and dulling their awareness of the relationship between the marginal costs and benefits of the care they receive in theory insured individuals will consume health care until the marginal benefits match the marginal outof pocket costs which under most policies re equivalent to deductibles and co payments generous health insurance c overage can push these costs far below the actual marginal costs of the medical services of course insurance companies are well aware of the damage moral hazard can inflict on their financial viability so they tryto contain or limit it through the imposition of deductibles copayments coverage limits and exclusions managed care plans mandatory prior approvals of certain treatments and procedures and financia l incentives for healthcare providers to restrict the use of costly procedures moreover it appears that the health insurance market fails to satisfy necessary condition of economic efficiency the exis tence of what economists call complete markets when market fails to provid good or service even though individuals would be willing to pay more than the average cost of providing it economists consider the market to be incomplete and they regard the lack of completeness as market failure some argue that the priva health insurance market is incomplete because it usually does not provide guaran teed renewability or insurance againsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs7 14see leonard burman and amelia gruber first do harm designing tax incentives for health insurance national tax journal vol 59 3 sept 2001 p 480future health risks only current ones14most individuals cannot purchase health insurance at fixed rates and under fixed rms for more than one year in advance yet it is thought that many individuals would be willing to purchase insurance against future health risks at reasonable cost if it were provided finally in every state certain health car providers mainly public hospitals have legal obligation to provide treatment to someone suffering from life threatening or serious health problem irrespective of his or her ability to pay although these mandatorycare laws can nhance social welfare by ensuring that everyone receives at least modicum of health care when it is urgently needed they can also undermine welfare by diluting the incentive to purchase actuarially fair health insurance especially for lowincome individuals with few financial assets to protect as result mandatorycare laws h ave the unintended effect of laying the foundation for classic market failure know n as the free rider problem in general this problem can be seen as byproduct of the existence of public goods one of whose defining traits is the impossibility of excluding anybody from consuming them laws granting everyone the right to receive emergency care regardless of ability to pay effectively endow health care with this trait thereby giving rise to freerider problem it is not clear how the welfare gains from these laws compare with the welfare losses for most health economists the presence of these market failures provides ample justification for government intervention in the health insurance market in their view central issue for policymakers is not whether to intervene rather it is to devise politically acceptable policy m easures that attempt to strike balance between the welfare losses arising from mor hazard and the welfare gains inherent in the risk spreading provided by actuarially fair health insurance coverage important considerations in designing tax incentives to expand health insurance coverage if the policy objective is to achieve sizable reduction in the uninsured population and the preferred policy instrum ent is tax policy then critical task for policymakers is to devise tax subsidie s that accomplish the goal at an acceptable budgetary cost recent research into the p robable effects of tax policy on health insurance coverage sheds lig ht on several factors that shoul d be carefully considered in designing such subsidies each is examined in some detail below current federal tax subsidies for health insurance this may seem obvious but one important factor to weigh in devising tax based approach to expanding health insura nce coverage is the cu rrent mix of federal tax subsidies for health insurance covera ge any such approach cannot avoid being constructed around decision about whet her to jettison modify or retain thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs8 15for an overview of current federal tax benefits for health insurance see crs issue brief ib98037 tax benefits for health insurance current legislation pp 18 16jonathan gruber an economist at mit has estimated that the typical worker in the 15 federal income tax bracket facing state income tax rate of 5 and combined payroll tax rate of 153 pays 065 after taxes for 1 of health insurance meaning that the tax price is 065 see jonathan gruber taxes and health insurance working paper 8657 cambridge ma national bureau of economic research dec 2001 p 4 17ibid pp 2627 18gruber has also estimated that in 1997 90 of uninsured taxpayers with tax liabilities continuedsubsidies the reason lies in the central role they play in the current system of health insurance coverage for the nonelderly although the present tax code contai ns variety of subsidies for health insurance three in particular have facilitated the emergence of this system the tax exclusions for employerpaid health insurance premiums socalled cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts15they are related in that each pertains to health insurance coverage obtained through emp loyers under these exclusions it is possible for individuals who receive health insurance through employers to pay federal or state income and payroll taxes on their own and their employers contributions for the premiums in combina tion the exclusions substantially lower the aftertax price of health insurance relative to other goods and services workers may consume and subsidize the purchas of employmentbased group health insurance relative to nongroup coverage16these exclusions are so deeply embedded in the current structure of health insurance coverage for the nonelderly that their removal could trigger signif icant increase in the uninsured population in recent study jonathan gruber an economist at mit who has written extensively on the impact of tax policy on health insu rance coverage among the nonelderly estimated that the elimination of the exclusions at the federal and state levels would lead to 14 drop in the number of employers offering health insurance to employees which in turn would result i n decrease in the number of individuals covered under employment based health plans of over 22 million and 50 decline in total spending on these plans17 relevant characteristics of the nonelderly uninsured population policymakers seeking to craft costeffective tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage should also take into account characteristics of the nonelderly uninsured population that are relevant to tax policy several such characteristic s deserve mention first the nonelderly uninsured are disproportionately concentrated in lowincome households in 2001 nearly 38 of uninsured individuals resided in hous eholds with annual incomes below 20000 it comes as surprise then that very hi gh proportion of uninsured taxpayers fall in lower tax brackets and that significant proportion have federal income tax liability18second while most uninsured individuals under age 65 live in householdshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs9 18continued belonged to the 15 tax bracket and 50 had federal tax liability see jonathan gruber tax subsidies for health insurance evaluating the costs and benefits workingpaper 7553 cambridge ma national bureau of economic research feb 2000 p7 19gruber taxes and

employed by small firms in 2001 over 50 of uninsured workers held jobs with firms having fewer than 100 employees20finally the previous characteristics notwithstanding the uninsured under age 65 do not constitute an isolated easily identified or targeted and stable popula tion group rather they are scattered in varying and shifting degrees throughout all income groups and firm sizes for instance in 2001 24 of uninsured individuals lived in households with annual incomes of 50000 or more and 23 of uninsured workers were employed by firms with 500 or more employees21 relevant features of health insurance market for the nonelderly it is also useful to consider certain features of the existing structure of health insurance coverage for the nonelderly in d esigning taxbased subsidies to expand health insurance coverage of particular interest for policymakers are the dominant role of employers as sources of health in surance coverage the advantages and disadvantages of group coverage provide d through the workplace and the limitations of coverage provided in the nongroup market in 2001 nearly 66 of nonelderly americans received health insurance coverage through employers another 15 were covered through public health insurance programs and about 7 obtained coverage through insurance plans purchased in the nongroup or individual market gruber has noted that in recent decades more than nine out of 10 privatel insured nonelderly individuals received their coverage from an employer either thei r own their spouses or their parents most workers who are offered insurance by their employers regardless of wage and salary income decide to take it although t he takeup rate appears to have declined somewhat in recent years as employers have passed on to employees increases in the cost of enrolling in health plans22the offering of insurance varies considerably by firm size in general smaller firms are m uch less likely to offer coverage in 2001 worker in firm with fewer than 10 employees was almost three times as likely to be uninsured as worker in firm with 1000 or more employees nevertheless small firms paying high average wages are as likely to offer coverage as large firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs10 23jason lee are health insurance premiums higher for small firms r s r c hs n t h s i s report 2 princeton nj robert wood johnson foundation sept 2002 pp 46 24according to one authoritative estimate health insurance loading fees as percent of benefits paid fall in the range of 60 to 80 for individual policies compared to 8 to 15 for groups of 201 to 1000 persons these fees cover the operating costs of insurance companies and represent markup over the expected payout of benefits under policy see charles phelps health economics 3rdedition boston addison wesley 2003 pp 342 343 25small firms pay more than large firms for the same health insurance coverage because the costs of marketing and administration are spread over fewer workers in small firms and underwriting costs typically are greater for small firms see us congressional budget office the tax treatment of employmentbased health insurance washington march 1994 pp 2122and eligibility coverage and takeup rates are similar among employees in small and large firms that offer health insurance coverage23 there are noteworthy advantages and dis advantages to tying health insurance coverage to employment on the one hand the work place serves as convenient almost logical way to pool health insurance r isks since most individuals choose their employers for reasons other than expected usage of medical care in coming years in general the larger the employment group the greater the scope for the risk sharing and community rating that enhances social welfare seen from this perspective employmentbased insurance has the pot ential to preclude the adverse selection prevailing in the nongroup insurance market furthermore insurance administrative underwriting and marke ting costs are lower for large groups than individuals24large groups also have greater bargaining power in extracting price and other concessions from insurers and healthcare providers on the other hand employerbased health insurance serves as an imperfect risk pooling mechanism in the case of small firms in firm with 20 employees for instance if two individuals suffer serious illness the average cost of health insurance can rise markedly the following year in addition making employers the primary source of health insurance covera ge for the nonelderly can contribute to efficiency losses by retarding job mobility insured workers may be disinclined to work for another employer out of fear of losing their coverage or having less desirable options for coverage anothe r drawback to employerprovided health insurance is that it offers limited renewability those who become unemployed may lose their coverage and there are federal laws to keep employers from dropping coverage when faced with huge premium increases finally system of employmentbased health insurance cove rage can foster production inefficiencies by implicitly favoring large firms over small firms the source of the inefficiencies is the considerable cost advantages that large firms typically enjoy over small firms in offering the same package of health benefits to employees25 some proposals to establish new tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage would rely on the nongroup mark et to achieve their objectives in 2001 164 million individuals were covered unde r nongroup policies coverage under these policies declined gradually between 1993 when it reached 175 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs11 26karen pollitz richard sorian and kathy thomas how accessible is individual health

pre existing conditions impose severe limits on the coverage they will provide for those conditions or add high premium surcharges to cover those conditions27many states have responded to these practi ces byestablishing highrisk insurance pools and some have enacted law barring insurers from excluding coverage of preexisting conditions but they seem to have had little impact on trends in the

aftertax cost this relationship implies that in designing tax subsidies to shrink the uninsured population it is useful to know how sensitive the decision to purchase health insurance is to reductions in its tax price given the structure of the health insurance coverage for the nonelde rly tax policy can work through three basic channels to expand cove rage 1 subsidies to employers to offer coverage 2 subsidies to employees to accept coverage that is offered and 3 subsidies to uninsured individuals to purchase nongr oup coverage these options suggest that policymakers might consider the responsiveness to tax price changes of the decision by employers to offer coverage the decisi on by employees to take up coverage if it is offered and the decision of uninsured i ndividuals to purchase nongroup coverage together with the ways in which these decisions may feed back on one another considerable research has been done on the behavioral responses of firms and individuals to changes in the cost of health insurance recent study by gruber reviewed this literature28one of his findings was striking lack of consensus on the price sensitivity of the three decisions shaping the efficacy of tax subsidies as policy tool to expand health insuranc coverage but such lack was not as problematic for policymakers as it may have seemed upon first glance because of important differences in focus methodolog data and applicabilityof results among the studies considered by gruber he compared the strengths and weaknesses of available estimates of price sensitivity and i dentified those he thought were useful for the purpose of forecasting the impact of propos ed tax subsidies on health insurance coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs12 29ibid p 16 30ibid p 19 31ibid p 22on the question of how responsive the decision by firms to offer health insurance to employees was to changes in its tax price gruber concluded that the best available estimate of this responsiveness was one of his own in 2000 study done with michael lettau he estimated that the price elasticity of employer offering of health insurance fell between 03 an d 04 this implied that 10 rise in the tax price of health insurance could lead to decline in the number of firms offering coverage to employees of three to four percentage points29 on the question of how responsive the decision of employees to accept health insurance coverage offered by their employ ers was to changes in its tax price gruber found that the decision seemed to be indepe ndent of such changes in other words available evidence indicated that employees did not measurably alter their take up of employer health plans in response to chang in their tax price he noted that this finding was consistent with growing body of evidence that the decisions of employers appear to have much more infl uence than the preferences of employees over the availability of fringe benefits like health insurance30 and on the question of how responsive the decision of individuals who lack public or employerprovided health in surance coverage to purchase nongroup coverage was to changes in its tax price gr uber noted that only one meaningful study had been done and that it was too flaw ed to provide helpful guidance for policymakers the study estimated tax price elasticity of nongroup coverage of 03 implying that 10 drop in the afte rtax cost of nongrou p health insurance would lead to 3 increase in the number of individuals covered under such policies in his view the studys shortc omings meant that the estimate should be construed as lower bound on the taxprice sensitivity of the demand for non group coverage among those not eligible fo r public or employer health insurance31 grubers study indicated that neither fi rms nor individuals were especially sensitive to reductions in the tax price of health insurance but it did offer fresh evidence that the offering decisions of fi rms tended to be more responsive to such reductions than the acceptance decisions of employees the study also served the purpose of highlighting some of the significant gaps in our understanding of the forces shaping behavioral responses to tax s ubsidies for health insurance coverage of particular interest was paucity of conclusive evidence on the price elasticity of demand for nongroup insurance among thos currently lacking public or employer health insurance little is also known about the price sensitivity of the uninsured who are not offered health insurance by their employershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs13 32the coefficient for the price elasticity used in the lewin group study came from 1998 analysis by the same organization that analyzed the effect of changes in employee contributions to employer health insurance on the number of workers and dependents purchasing employerprovided health insura nce other studies have come up with different continuedpotential effectiveness and cost of some proposed tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage recent proposals to use tax subsidies to achieve substantial reductions in the uninsured population raise the question of what approach is likely to be most cost effective several recent studies have addr essed this question among other things they shed light on the critical factors determining the costeffectiveness of tax subsidies to expand health insurance cove rage the principal findings of these studies are reviewed below lewin group study in 1999 lewin group issued study which assessed the effectiveness and revenue cost of nine proposed tax subsidies f or the purchase of health insurance the proposals ranged from something as simp as tax deduction for the purchase of nongroup health insurance to something as complex as the replacement of current federal tax subsidies for health insura nce with individual insurance mandates and refundable tax credits for the purchase f nongroup health insurance some were modeled after legislative initiatives then being considered in congress for each proposal the lewin group used microsimulation model of the us health care system known as the lewin group health benefits simulatio n model to estimate the number of persons who would be eligible for the proposed tax subsidy the change in the number of insured persons in response to its adoption and its federal revenue cost in 2000 dollars these estimates then were used to compute the percentage change in the uninsured population relative to 1997 the most recent year at the time for which figures on the uninsured population were available and the revenue cost per newly insured person the microsimulation model generated these estimates on the basis of several key assumptions two are worth mentioning here one assumption addressed the sensitivity of consumers in general to changes in the aftertax price of health insurance or the taxprice elasticity of demand for health insurance the proposed tax subsidies lowered the aftertax price of health insurance for eligible individuals which in turn sparked an overall increase in health insurance coverage among these individua ls naturally the magnitude of the increase depended critically on the price elasticity of demand the study used an elasticity of 02 which implied that 10 decrease in the aftertax price of insurance would trigger 2 rise in coverage nationwide nonetheless considerable uncertainty surrounded the actual price elasticity health economists who had studied the issue came up with estimates ranging from 00 to 2732httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs14 32continued estimates of the price elasticity of demand for health insurance but in doing so they employed different estimation methods for the m ost part for discussion of these studies see gruber and poterba fundamental tax reform and employerprovided health insurance pp 159162 33in 1993 study of the response of selfemployed individuals to the creation of partial tax deduction for their health insurance expenditures by the tax reform act of 1986 economists jonathan gruber and james poterba found that from 1986 to 1989 between 15 and 20 of the selfemployed with incomes below 20000 and about 50 of those with incomes above 50000 claimed the deduction fr om these response rates they concluded that lack of awareness of the presence of

individuals actually took advantage of it available vidence in 1999 suggested however that the takeup rate for these individua ls was significantly less than 10033 several of the studys findings have impor tant implications for the potential cost and effectiveness of tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage they are highlighted below lewin groups findings on costeffectiveness34 the most costeffective subsidy was refundable tax credit for the purchase of nongroup insurance by taxpayers not covered by employmentbased health insurance medicare or medicaid that was capped at 500 for single persons and 1000 for families the cost per newly insured person was 1246 2000 dollars the least costeffective subsidy was one that scrapped existing federal tax subsidies for the purchase of health insurance except for medical savings accounts an d substituted fixed refundable tax credit of 800 per adult and 400 per child capped at 2400 per family for the purchase of health insurance by all taxpayers except those who are covered under medicare or medicaid the cost per newly insured person was 10541 2000 dollars refundable tax credits for the purch ase of health insurance by low income working and nonworking individuals were more effective but more costly per newly insured person than an abovetheline tax deduction for the purchase f nongroup health insurance

coverage for the nonelderly among other things it abolished existing federal tax subsidies for health insurance substituted refundable tax credit for health insurance and medical care expenditures and required all individuals to purchase minimum level of health benefits and all employers to convert their health benefit plans to wages the plan resulted in the elimination of the entire uninsured population which was assumed to total 433 million in 2000 the least effective subsidy was 30 refundable meanstested tax credit for nongroup health insurance purchased by taxpayers without access to

gruber study had similar focus the potential effects of alternative tax subsidies for health insurance on the number of uninsur ed and the federal budget like the lewin group study many of the tax subsidies g ruber evaluated were modeled after legislative proposals stirring interest in recent congresses and the gruber studyalso employed computerized model of the li nks between tax policy and the us health insurance market to analyze these effectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs16 36the base case involved refundable tax credit for the purchase of nongroup health insurance by individuals

the costs and benefits p 9but the gruber study went beyond the l ewin group study in that it addressed two important issues raised by taxbased pproaches to expanding health insurance coverage which were excluded or given marginal treatment in the lewin group study one issue was the extent to which different income groups benefitted from the proposed subsidies and the second cerned the impact of the subsidies on the market for group health insurance the gr uber analysis also differed somewhat in approach but not in basic methodology it simulated the effects of base case along number of dimensions including the federal revenue cost the size of the uninsured population the number of individuals with employmentbased health insurance and the distribution of the net cost of the subsidy among major income groups36gruber then simulated the effects of ther proposed tax subsidies eg nonrefundable tax credit for the purchase f nongroup insurance and an abovethe line tax deduction for the same purpose on the same variables and compared the results to those of the base case for each proposed tax subsidy gruber timated the revenue cost to the federal government how many individuals woul d become insured how the benefits would be distributed among income groups and how many individuals with employment based health insurance would drop it or lose it in response to the subsidy37in simulating these effects he had to make assumptions about number of key behavioral variables including the ext ent to which those who were uninsured took up the subsidies to purchase nongroup cove rage the extent to which those already covered by nongroup health insurance c laimed the proposed subsidies and the extent to which firms reacted to the s ubsidies by eliminating or cutting health benefits for employees not surprisingly the results of grubers analysis hinged on the sensitivity of the demand for health insurance coverage to declines in its aftertax price gruber assumed higher price ela sticity than the lewin group study 053 compared to 02 this difference was hardly trivial 1 fall in the aftertax price of health insurance in both studies led to an increase in insurance coverage among the uninsured that was 26 times greater in grubers analysis while the validity of grubers assumed price elasticity is open to question it should be noted that it was closer to the middle of the range of available elasticity estimates than the one used in the lewin group study several results of grubers analysis also should be highlighted because they have important implications

between the timing of health insurance premium payments and the timing of subsidy transfers to eligible individuals with minimal or house hold savings had significant impact on the efficacy of the base case the reduction in the uninsured population was 37 greater when the base case was simulated on the assumption that such mismatches were prevented than when it was simulated without such an assumption gruber 2001 analysis in followup to his 2000 study gruber explored the potential cost and effectiveness of what he viewed as three likely directions for the use of tax policy to enlarge the insured population40the directions involved offering new tax subsidies to employers offering new tax subsidies t employees and offering new tax subsides for the purchase of nongroup insurance to individuals not eligible for public or employerprovided insurance coverage gruber assessed and compared the efficiency as measured by the estimated revenue cost per newly insured individual of these basic options his key findings are summarized below new subsidies to employers as gruber has noted many firms already offer health insurance to employees so an important consideration in devising new tax subsidies for employers to expand health insurance coverage is which firms would be eligible if the subsidies are not narrowly or properly targeted the cost p er newly insured individual could quickly reach unsustainably high levels available data on the links between the uninsured and the workplace suggest relatively simple and efficient solution offering the largest tax subsidy to the smallest firm s paying the lowest wages and phasing it out as firm sizes and average wages rise gruber simulated the effects of just such an approach he assumed maximum tax subsidy rate of 04 for firms with 10 or fewer employees and average annual wages of 10000 or less such rate was equivalent to tax credit for 40 of the cost to the firm of providing health insurance to each employee in addition he assumed that the amount of the subsidy w as reduced by 25 for every additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs20 41ibid p 29 42ibid p 30 43ibid p 31 44ibid p 33employee beyond 10 so that it reached zero at 50 employees and that it was also reduced by any increase in average nnual wages beyond 10000 gruber found that such tax subsidy added 23 million individuals to the ranks of the nonelderly insured at an annual cost of 47 billion or 2005 2000 dollars per newly insured individual41he also found that by increasing the subsidy rate to 06 the annual cost rose by 70 to 8 billion per year but coverage expanded by 50 resulting in higher cost per newly insured individual 230042 new subsidies to employees another policy option for expanding h ealth insurance coverage among the non elderly analyzed by gruber consisted of new tax subsidy to employees to take up coverage offered by employers he determined that it would have little effect on coverage rates and would b relatively inefficient43there were two reasons for this outcome first only 5 of those who are ffered insurance by employers were uninsured second the decision to take up coverage was insensitive to changes in its tax price gruber did note that this optio n offered the advantage of targeting low income workers but it had the disadvantage of not being able to target lowwage firms as many lowwage workers are empl oyed by firms that pay relatively high average wages and already offer insurance new subsidies for nongroup coverage the final alternative analyzed by gruber consisted of new tax subsidy for the purchase of nongroup insurance by i ndividuals not covered under public or employmentbased insurance he identified three major hurdles lying in the path of such an approach one was that about half of uninsured households pay income taxes this fact suggested that if the subsidy were tax credit it should be made refundable second hurdle was that mo st uninsured households lack access to the liquid assets required to pay insurance premiums before receiving tax subsidy such as refundable tax credit as result the effectiveness of tax subsidy would be greatly enhanced if it were made payabl in advance finally nongroup coverage was costly so any tax subsidy would need to cover large share of premiums if it were to be highly effective gruber simulated the effects of tax subsidy similar to what the bush administration proposed in its budget re quest for fy2002 he assumed that the subsidy involved refundable credit of 1000 for single filers with incomes up to 75000 and 2000 f or joint and headofhousehold filers with incomes up to 100000 in addition he assumed that it w as not payable in advance swayed by such subsidy the uninsured population shrank by 4 million persons and the estimated cost per newly insured came to 3300 2000 dollars44gruber performed another simulation under the assumption tha t the credit was payable in advance

another recent study by gruber is worth considering since it focused on the cost and effectiveness of the tax credit for health insurance coverage proposed by the bush administration in its budget request for fy2003 he presented his findings in statement made to the house ways nd means committee in connection with hearing on tax credits for expanding hea lth insurance coverage it held on february 13 200245the credit had the following features it was refundable available only for the purchase of nongroup insuranc by those not covered under public or employerprovided health insurance payable in advance and limited to 1000 for single individuals with adjusted gross incomes of up to 30000 and to 3000 for families with adjusted gross incomes of either 40000 if only one adult purchased insurance or 60000 if more than one adult purchased insurance grubers analysis again involved the use of microsimulation model this one was similar in design to the one he employed in his 2000 analysis and took into account what was known about the behaviora l responses of nonelderly individuals firms and insurance companies to changes in the tax price of health insurance one of his assumptions was that individuals and families who purchased nongroup coverage in response to the credit paid av erage market prices for that insurance he estimated that the subsidy would have total annual cost of 52 billion 2001 dollars and result in net declin in the uninsured population of 19 million yielding cost per newly insured individual of nearly 280046in addition an estimated 105 million individuals took up the new credit 33 million of whom were previously uninsured nearly 25 million of the individuals taking up the credit had been covered by employmentbased coverage of these 15 million persons voluntarily switched to nongr oup coverage because they found it to be better deal with the credit and 10 million persons involuntarily switched because their employers dropped health insurance covera ge in response to the credit some of the individuals who lost employerprovide d insurance ended up uninsured which explained why the net decrease in the uninsured population was 19 million persons and not 33 million for these newly unins ured the cost of nongroup coverage proved too high even with the credit some analysts have contended that t he adoption of tax credit for health insurance coverage modeled on the pr esidents proposal but somewhat more generous would trigger major overhaul of the nongroup market leading to the emergence of new lowcost plans with fewer gaps in coverage and less premiumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs22 47for discussion of policy debate over this possible outcome see mark v pauly and len m nichols the nongroup health insuranc

uninsured pp 127128variation by age and geographic location47to explore the cost and efficacy of plans such as these gruber performed another t wo simulations in one he assumed that half of all persons buying nongroup covera ge with the credit were able to do so at prices 25 below average market prices nd in the other he assumed that the same group of individuals were able to obtain coverage at prices 50 below average market prices his results suggested that the greater the decrease in nongroup premiums under the credit the larger the d ecline in the uninsured population and the greater the displacement of those previously covered by employmentbased insurance48specifically with 25 reduction in nongroup premiums the total cost per year was 54 billion 2001 dollars and the uninsured population fell by 22 million persons at cost per newly insured of 2503 by contrast with 50 reduction in premiums the total annual cos t came to 60 billion 2001 dollars and the uninsured population declined by 36 million persons at cost per newly insured of 1663 conclusions central challenge for policymakers interested in using tax policy to achieve substantial and lasting reduction in t he uninsured population is to devise tax subsidy that can accomplish this goal without having undesirable effects on the allocation of economic resources the distribution of disposable income among households and the cost of tax administrat ion generally tax policy can and does affect the price and terms of health insurance coverage the material examined here has important implications for the use of tax policy to expand this coverage its significance can be illuminated in series of questions focusing on factors to consider in designing tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage is the subsidy tax deduction or tax credit many uninsured individuals reside in lowincome households gruber has estimated that up to 90 of uninsured taxpayers with tax liabilities belonged to the 15 income tax bracket in 1997 tax deductions become more valuable as taxpayers marginal tax rate increases but generally one dollar of tax duction has lower revenue cost than one dollar of tax credit if the subsidy is tax credit is it refundable gruber has also estimated that 50 of uninsured ta xpayers have n tax liability though the proportion may be smalle r today owing to the reduction in marginal tax rates and the creation of 10 bracket under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 and the increase in wages and salaries since 1997 the year to which grubers estimate applies nonref undable tax credits are valuablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs23 only if taxpayer has tax liability against which it can be claimed refundable tax credits by contrast are valuable to all lowincome taxpayers because they can be claimed regardless of whether there is current tax liability if the subsidy is refundable tax credit is it fixed or proportional in amount another factor shaping the effectiveness of tax subsidy to expand health insurance coverage is the share of premiums it covers as many unins ured individuals reside in low income households the greater the share of individual and family premiums met by the subsidy the greater the rate at which the subsidy is likely to be taken up by the uninsured fixed refundable tax credits may cover smaller and smaller portions of premiums as health care costs rise over time i n addition premiums in the non group market vary by age sex and geographic location and in the group market by size of employer or risk pool and premiums in the nongroup market tend to be lower f or young adults in good health and higher for older adults in poor health who is eligible for the subsidy recent studies suggest that the most costeffective subsidies are apt to be ones which are narrowly targeted at groups with large proportions of uninsured individuals tax subsidies targeted at lowincome households headed by someone not covered by employerp rovided or public insurance are likely to have lower revenue cost pe r newly insured individual than subsidies with broader reach such as tax deduction for all outof pocket expenditures for health insurance but there is some evidence that targeting firms in the hope of inducing them to offer coverage to employees may be m ore effective than targeting individuals who lack coverage gruber has estimated that over threequarters of uninsured worker s are not offered health insurance by their employers in addition eligibility matters because of the different ways that firms individuals and private insurers can respond to tax subsidies for health insurance does the subsidy address key administrative issues yet another factor affecting the cost and efficacy of proposed tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage is administrative issues that could impede their smooth implementation at least three can be mentioned here one concern is possible mismatches between the timing of health insurance premium payments and the timing of subsidy transfers to eligible individuals because relatively few uninsured households appear to have sufficient liquid assets to draw upon in paying health insurance p remiums making the subsidies payable in advance of the due date for filing tax returns may enhance their efficacy related concern is the rate at which eligible individuals might take up tax subsid ies that are payable in advance experience with the federal earned income tax credit suggests that lowincome taxpayers are reluctant to claim advanceable tax credits because many fear they will end up facing tax liability when theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30762crs24 49gruber taxes and health insurance p 3 2 50see george guttman another irs burden the new health insurance credit tax notes march 3 2003 pp 13221324file their tax returns49finally there is some concern that the irs lacks the resources to efficiently administer any advanceable tax subsidy for health insurance coverage50i ts h u l da l s ob ek p n mind that there appear to be significant tradeoffs between ease of administration and precision of targeting in tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage does the subsidy address barriers to coverage of highrisk groups in the private insurance market persons with relatively high risks of certain health problems are likely to find it difficult to obtain affordable and adequate c overage in the nongroup market premiums vary widely by age sex and region and in many states insurers are free to exclude preexiting conditions from coverage or to severely restrict covera ge for these conditions these underwriting practices raise the stion of whether tax subsidy to expand health insurance coverage should include regulations aimed at curbing these practices what is the ultimate policy objective of the tax subsidy the design of costeffective tax subsidies to expand health insurance coverage also depends in part on the ultimate policy objective if the main goal is to improve equity in access to federal tax subsidies for health insurance tax deduction f or personal expenditures on health insurance by those ineligible for existing subsidies may suffice or if the main goal is to reduce substa ntially the uninsured population then proportional advanceable refundable tax credit targeted at uninsured workers not offered hea lth insurance coverage by their employers may suffice but if the main goal is to achieve universal coverage then it may be nece ssary to couple subsidy such as refundable advanceable meanste sted tax credit with reforms of the private health insurance marke t and requirement that all individuals purchase health insura nce or all firms provide health insurance to their employees
