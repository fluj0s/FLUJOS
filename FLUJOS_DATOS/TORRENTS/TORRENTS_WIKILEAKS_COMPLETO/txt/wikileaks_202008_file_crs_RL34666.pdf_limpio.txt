the department of defense dod science and technolog st program grew from 77 b illion to 128 billion in constant fy2009 dollars the cumulative increase was 225 billion the purpose of this report is to aid congre ssional oversight of dods st program by analyzing this budget increase by departme nt and agency by budget activity and by program element specifically the report examines whether the budget increase benefitted all programs or focused on certain priority areas in period of higher budget deficits as sustaining current leve ls of military spending becomes more of fiscal challenge and as the nation continues to position itself to engage effectively in changing strategic environment policymakers may scrutinize the allocation of st resources more closely what constitutes defense science and technology this report focuses on dods base re search development test and evaluation program rdte1 as indicated by its name this program funds activities that range from fundamental resear ch in the basic sciences to the design development and testing of complex w eapon systems ready for the field the dod divides this range of effort into seve n budget activities designated 61 through 67 see appendix activities 61 through 63 b asic research applied research and advanced technology development cons titute what is called the science and technology st program budget ac tivities 64 and 65 focus on the development of specific new weapon systems or com ponents eg the joint strike fighter or missile defense systems2 budget activity 66 pr ovides management support including support for test and evaluati on facilities budget activity 67 supports system improvements in existing operational systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34666crs2 the st program is often referred to as dods seed corn because it supports the development of science and t echnology base upon which to morrows high performance military systems will be built the payoff from st investments is rarely immediate the value of the knowle dge tends to be unpred ictable and hard to measure the operational capabilities that are developed take time to be incorporated into fielded systems nevertheless ad equate support for st activities is seen by many in congress and the defense community as imperative to maintaining us military capabilities and superiority funding trends in dod st figure 1 shows the dod st budget from fy1962 when the budget activity designations 6167 were first being adopted through fy2007 during the 1960s and early 1970s budgets for st remained re latively flat in current dollars with inflation eroding their real values in c onstant dollars beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through much of the 1980s st budgets increased in both current and constant dollars

authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34666crs4 analysis this report focuses on the growth in the base st budgets between fy1998 and fy2007 this period of time is interesting to policymakers for several reasons it includes the transition in fy2000 to period of significant and historic growth in the st budget it includes change in adminis tration as well as th historic strategic transition from the postcold war era to the waronterror era picking fy1998 as the baseline year is somewhat arbitrary but because st funding for the three years prior to fy1998 was relatively stable it woul d appear to represent valid starting point also declines in overall defens spending beginning in fy1986 bottomed out in fy1998 representing the end of th postcold war drawdown the period of analysis ends in fy2007 the latest budget year for which actual st funding data exist see below methodology the analysis in this report is based on data from two primary dod sources the dod r1 document and the rdte descrip tive summaries of the departments and agencies the r1 is an annual budget document released by the dod comptroller that summarizes all the program elements pes that make up the base research development test and evaluation rdte program program elements are the building blocks of dods budget in the case of the base rdte program each pe represents an aggregation of research activities in particular area these areas could be related to discipline eg materials science or mission g electronic warfare or subsystem eg propulsion technologies every rdte dollar is associated with one and only one pe the r1 document lists all of these pes broken out by department and agency and by budget activity 6167 in the fy2009 rdte budget request there were 712 pes of whic h 157 were considered to be in the st program the rdte descriptive summaries are released each year by the departments or agencies usually few days after the official release of the dod budget they provide written description of each pe nd include among other information goals and objectives and past and anticipated accomplishments in many cases pe may be divided into one or more projects this report does not examine projects below the pe level the funding amounts identified in thes documents are total obligational authority toa toa is dod financial measure in any given budget request toa equals budget authority ba which is what congress grants in its appropriations bills ie the authority to incur legally binding obligations it expresses the value of the direct program if changes are made to appropriations granted by congress because of genera l reductions rescissions lapsing unobligated funds transfers of unobligated funds re appropriations etc these changes are accounted for differently when modifying the toa and budget authority figures forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34666crs5 6 for more discussion of how toa and ba differ refer to the national defense budget estimates fy2009 office of the undersecret ary comptroller march 2008 p 1 known as the green book see httpwwwdefenselinkmilcomptrollerdefbudgetfy2009 fy2009_greenbookpdfprior years6 the r1 and the rdte descriptive summaries list the current years budget request an estimated toa for the immediate prior year which may include rescissions proposed in the cu rrent years budget and the actual toa for two years prior by which time most modifications to the initial appropriations budget authority will have been made the analysis in this report used actual toa for fy1998 through fy2007 as shown in the r1 documents for fy2000 through fy2009 it includes all st pes listed in the r1 documents for those years the toa data were recorded in current dollars these data were converted to constant fy2009 dollars using toa flators for rdte taken from the dods national defense budget estimates for fy 2009 unless stated otherwise from here on in this report all data is given in fy2009 dollars the basic analysis compared the cumulative actual funding from fy1998 through fy2007 in constant fy2009 dollars with what the cumulative funding would have been if the fy1998 amount had risen only with inflation this comparison was done by partment and agency by budget activity and by individual pe the comparisons were calcu lated both in dollars and as percentages percentage changes take into account the si ze of the program changes in low cost programs when measured in absolute dollars may conceal the relative importance of the change as might be revealed wh looking at the change in terms of percentages on the other hand initial chan ges in low cost programs could lead to relatively large percentage changes at first and perhaps overstate the importance of those changes the analysis takes this issue into consideration the methodology used in this analys is has couple limitations one problem is how to account for pes that were in itiated after fy 1998 in these cases the fy1998 baseline funding is zero that doe s not present problem when analyzing in terms of dollars but it makes the percentage comparison meaningless one could use the first year the pe was established to determine truncated baseline for calculating the percentage increase or decrease this however would not allow for direct comparison with pes that were in existence in fy1998 therefore the analysis of percentage changes in individual pes is restricted to pes that were in existence in fy1998 and does not include pes established after that time another limitation is that some pes were reorganized during the course of the 10 year period in some cases pes were rminated and their pr ojects distributed to new or existing pes while it is possible in some of these cases to analyze the data for these pes in the aggregate in other cases it is difficult to compare the new peshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34666crs6 7 for example in its fy2002 budget request the navy reorganized nearly half its pes projects from old pes were dist ributed among number of new pes making tracking those activities difficult across the analysiss time span as result number of navy pes do not lend themselves to this analysis to sser extent in fy2002 some air force pes were reorganized to align with the newly rest ructured air force research laboratory organization and again in fy2003 to reflec t recommendations from the space commission to segregate spacerelated research from the more generic aerospace activ ities some of these changes were later reversed 8 for example in fy2005 in response to c ongressional direction the defense advanced research projects agency split number of pes in two in this case where the integrity of the original pe was more or less preserved in the two new pes the analysis treated the three ie the old baseline pe and the two new ones as single pe 9 note in current dollars st funding peak ed in fy2006 in constant fy2009 dollars it peaked in fy2005to the old pes7 these situations were handled on case

research or advanced technology development budgets one reason for these differences is the cost of performing each type of activity basic research may involve theoretical work or laboratory experiments involving small volumes of materials advanced developmen t may involve the construction and integration of large hardware and software tested in specialized test beds 13 this is due in large part to net declines in mdas and darpas 63 activitiesless than 62 or 63 funding however ba sic research activity tends to be less costly12 in percentage terms the additiona l 61 funds were about

combat vehicl and advanced automotive technology program these pes contributed little to th overall increase in st funding and their relatively high increases in percentage terms are mainly due to their relatively low funding levels however the armys night vision program and the air forces aerospace technologies developmentdemonstration program did experience steady increases that indicate they were areas of sustained interest during this time period review of major findings the increase in st funding over the 10 years from fy1998 tofy2007 was distributed broadly across the st program each department army navy and air force and the defense agencies as whole shared roughly equally in dollar terms in percentage terms the defense agen cies increase taken as whole was noticeably less although the total increase in st funding in dollar terms was distributed between departments in roughly equal shares the increases were distributed vari ably across their budget activities applied research budget activity 63 of each of the departments increased the most and by roughly the same amount when taken as percentage across all of dod ba sic research incr eased the least in dollar terms although in percentage terms this varied considerably between departments and agencies of the pes that were in existence throughout the 10year period 73 exceeded their baseline funding the increases varied from pe to pe but the pes that increased the most represented relatively small share of the total increase it is difficult to discern any clear winners over these 10 years in terms of

for example the director of defense engineering and research has advocated more basic research in an expanding progra m congress may be able to accommodate an increase in basic research r elsewhere within the st program without having to make other major allocation ad justments however in flat or declining budget growth in particular department agen cy program or budget activity would have to be accompanied by decreases somewhere else any such decrease could come from those programs that experienced the greatest increases over the last ten years arguing that the past growth has been sufficient to meet perceived needs if however these areas of past growth are deemed to require yet more growth decreases would have to come from elsewhere within the program in this situation the relatively few programs that have already experienced decreases could be further reduced indicating their lower priority ho wever any such further reductions could render the program inefficient in trying to meet its goals alternatively decreases could be spread evenly over all other pr ograms reducing the impact on any particular program areas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34666crs15 appendix budget
