6607c28 shspec72 dianetic auditing and the mind when you are running engrams and secondaries you are handling the human mind what the mind was coating was the subject of scientology it is coating the thetan in other words you like blob of glup person is static the subject of the mind has been considerably mucked about and misunderstood the engram came from theory that lrh developed at george washington university man had way to explain memory if memory was molecular phenomenon man has enough storage capacity in the brain to last three months lrh wrote this up as proof that this isnt how man remembers it is difficult to think about mind harder than thinking about brain fortunately the mind doesnt have to understand itself lrh was there to understand it you would have to be aware of the fact that an individual is able to create matter energy space and time in other words pictures before you could understand the mind you dont have to ask or explain where thetan came from thetan just is this gets us into discussion of reality one has nailed this down philosophically in scientology reality is what is that is all you need to know about reality itself delusion is reality for one person out of agreement with others from these elements it is possible to figure out why man is trapped and why he acts and reacts as he does you can figure this out once you know the basic definitions in dianetic processing you have to know what the mind is the thetan is compulsive mockerupper he is stupid that is the one flaw in thetan if you can get him over this mad obsession to 1 make picture of everything that happens to him 2 then hide it from himself 3 then fix it up so it can impinge itself on his existence you can get him out of the cage he dramatizes these pictures or they enforce computations on him he does this by dislocating himself in time the mind is 1 pictures that have been made of experiences 2 plotted against time 3 preserved in energy and mass in the vicinity of the being 4 when restimulated they are recreated without his analytical awareness what is the mind that you are trying to get someone out of the trick of it all is that you cannot make postulate or an intention through this mass called the mind whenever you try the mind is restimulated so the thetan is not able to handle things or make things by postulate thetans thought cannot go through the barricade of his mockups when he tries to put forth an intention or postulate it collides splat with whatever engrams are in restimulation the less creation of his experiences the person has around him and the less he has around him to be restimulated the more he can think or project his thoughts and the bigger he gets you can delete these experiences and thereby free the being and his intentions and postulates dianetic auditing is the activity by which these experiences can be deleted the pc may be messed up because he is trying to restrain himself from dramatizing person has tendency to repeat in action what has happened to him in experience he tends to replay now something that happened then out of its time and place the thetan could give himself disabilities to prevent himself from dramatizing you are dealing with the basic mind the core of the reactive mind also has this same character but it is so outrageous and overwhelming that you had better not touch it without the map in view of the fact that the individual didnt know what happened he sometimes told himself what happened and got the actual experience overlaid with another experience this is how you get too many julius caesars julius caesar was pretty suppressive which made him the winning side or valence so lot of people whom he affected and overwhelmed took on his valence thetan has trouble remembering when he is all smashed down in the mind the effort to remember gets painful so he would rather not remember one of his favorite methods of handling the bank is almost as crazy as making the bank in the first place it is forgetting about it when you start erasing the mind the person may be upset at the point where you have erased his circuits and machinery and he hasnt remembered how to do things himself as far as auditing is concerned dianetics is play it is far more than man could do before but its benefits are far far less than the benefits of scientology auditing if you tried to erase the mind picture by picture you would be at it long time say you have had one pain per year and one major catastrophe every five or ten years if you added them up over all your lifetimes you would come up with too many to erase in any reasonable number of hours or years this is why lrh addressed the thetan rather than the thetans mockups with the grades one could be clear in few years starting from the bottom and not going at frantic pace in auditing engrams there are some phenomena you should be aware of chain wont erase if you erase only the late end of it the only way to solve problem is to handle the elements it contains if it contains past lives you will fail to handle it if you dont handle past lives if an incident gets heavier and more massy hit the silk go earlier if chain has basic before this lifetime that is where you will have to go to get it one of the symptoms of an incident going more solid is the pc bouncing out of it the pc bounces out of the incident into the lock that he has just made in pt running through the incident the first time in this session this can be manifested as the pcs repeating just what he said the first time he has learned better than to go near the incident this is the same mechanism that keeps his bank mocked up in the first place he cant confront it so he keeps it in pt it would erase if he confronted it but to do so is too painful you can get this phenomenon if you use the meter to determine what to run dont use meter to locate incidents if you run what the pc can find youve got something he can confront man can remember what he can confront and that is all he is going to remember if he runs the engram from pt all conceptual and not in the incident it is because the incident is really too much for him to confront guy with amnesia is just guy who is so spooked that he is not willing to remember anything it is not just bouncers or holders which govern peoples ability to move on the track someone who is about to be executed is terrified of the future he will be stuck in the moment before the execution or he will shoot earlier some people thus escape into the past track others are only willing to remember what happens after traumatic experience it is only running pcs beyond their ability to confront which causes trouble in dianetic auditing if you run the pc on what he can confront you wont get into situations for which you need solutions you could run the pcs chronic emotion that would be good project there is probably secondary for every engram so you are likely to drop into engrams while running secondaries the secondary lies right across the top of the engram if you try to run loss you end up running all the incidents on the track there are also overt chains the motivator series each engram has 2000 to 3000 locks each secondary also has 2000 to 3000 locks chains crossconnect and crossreference with other chains it would be impossible to take something that pc was afraid of and trace it back to all the reasons why he was afraid of it it will be found to occur in too many chains and locks the individuals experiential track is important because when we clear someone we get new thing being without bank who has experience when you find yourself in trap it is good idea to find out what the trap consists of that is one benefit of engram running you will find that there will be certain points of emphasis but all thetans have had experience there are specialized thetans if you cant get the pc to run engrams run breakfast if that is not confrontable have him run entering the auditing room for some people the flow of time from moment to moment is continuous pain dont try to get such individuals to confront heavy stuff
