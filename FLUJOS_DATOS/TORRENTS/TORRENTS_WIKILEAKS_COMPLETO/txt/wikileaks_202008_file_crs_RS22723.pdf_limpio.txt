investment partners v scientificatlanta inc 1 case appealed from decision by the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit2 the questions presented to the supreme court were wh ether the supreme c ourts decision in central bank na v first interstate bank na3 foreclosed claims for deceptive conduct under section 10b of the secu rities exchange act of 19344 and rule 10b5a and c5 where respondents engaged in transactions with public corporati on with legitimate business or economic purpose except to infl ate artificially the public corporations financial statements but where respondent s themselves made public statements concerning those transactions the court held that respondents had not violated the major antifraud statute of the federal securities lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22723crs2 6 511 us 164 1994 7 id at 177in this case plaintiff investors brought securities fraud class action alleging that charter one of the countrys largest cable television providers engaged in fraud to boost artificially its reported financial results by such actions as deliberately delaying the disconnecting of customers longer paying their bills improperly capitalizing labor costs and entering into sham transactions with two equipment vendors that improperly inflated charters reported operating revenues and cash fl ow in addition to naming charter charters executives and charters i ndependent auditor as defendants plaintiff investors also named the two equipment vendors sc ientificatlanta in c and motorola inc called the vendors in this case plaintiff investors alleged that the vendors entered into sham transactions with the knowledge that charter intended to account for them improperly and that analysts would rely on inflated reve nues and operating cash flow in making stock recomme ndations however plaintiff investors did not allege that the vendors prepared or disseminated the fraudulent financial statements and press releases which charter published to deceive analysts and investors plaintiff investors alleged that the vendors actions violated section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 the gene ral antifraud statute and rule 10b5 implemented by the securities and exchange commission sec to carry out the antifraud statute section 10 b makes it unlawful directly or indirectly to use or employ in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contraven tion of such rules and regulations as the securities and exchange commission ma prescribe rule 10b5 provides it shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud b to make any untrue statement of material fact or to omit to state material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading or c to engage in any act practice or course of busine ss which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of any security the eighth circuit held that plaintiff investors allegations did not state section 10b securities fraud claim against the vendors as primary violators much of the reasoning of the court relied upon the supreme courts decision in central bank of denver v first interstate bank of denver 6 in central bank the supreme court held that section 10b does not allow i nvestors to bring civil suits against those who have aided securities fraud instead according to the c ourt section 10b ma be applied only to those who use or employ any manipula tive or deceptive device or contrivance as in earlier cases considering conduct pr ohibited by 10b we again conclude that the statute prohibits only the making of material misstatement or omission or the commission of manipulative act the proscription does not include giving aid to person who commits manipulative or deceptive act7 extending the 10b5 cause of action to aiders and abettors doubt makes the civil remedy more farreaching but it does not follow that the objectives of the statute are better served secondary liability for aiders and abettors exactshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22723crs3 8 central bank at 188 9 charter communications at 992 10 id at 992993 11 central bank at 191costs that may disserve the goals of fair dealing and efficiency in the securities markets8 the eighth circuit stated in its decision th at because the focus of plaintiffs section 10b and rule 10b5 claims was deception by charter and that neither motorola nor scientificatlanta was alleged to have engaged in any deceptive act of the type engaged in by charter the district court properl dismissed the claims against the vendors as nothing more than claims barred by central bank that the vendors knowingly aided and abetted the charter defendants in deceiving the investor plaintiffs9 we are aware of case imposing 10b or rule 10b5 liability on business that entered into an arms length nonsecurities transaction with an entity that then used the transaction to publish false and misleading statements to its investors and analysts the point is significant to impose liability for securities fraud on one party to an arms length business transaction in goods or services other than securities because that party knew or should have known that the other party would use the transaction to mislead investors in its stock would introduce potentially farreaching duties and uncertainties for those engaged in daytod ay business dealings decisions of this magnitude should be made by congress10 it should be noted that the central bank case stated that secondary actors are not always free from liability under the securities acts the absence of 10b aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the secu rities markets are always free from liability under the securities acts any person or entity including lawyer accountant or bank who employs manipulative device or makes material misstatement or omission on which purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as primary violator under 10b5 assuming all of the requirements fo r primary liability under rule 10b5 are met11 the supreme court affirmed the eighth circuit decision the court stated that central bank had rejected aiding and abetting liability because aiding and abetting liability is not mentioned in section 10b recognizing aiding and abetting liability according to the court would allow plaintiffs to avoid the 10b requirement that they show reliance on the aider or abettors misstatements or deceptions in stoneridge respondents had duty to disclose and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public

actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability12 in response to plaintiffs argument that charters released fi nancial statement was to be expected from the secondary partie s deceptive acts and therefore was kind of scheme liability engaged in by the secondary pa rties the court stated that the plaintiffs could not prove that they had relied on th deceptive acts of the secondary parties in effect petitioner contends that in an efficient market investors rely not only upon the public statements relating to secur ity but also upon the transactions those statements reflect were this concept of reliance to be adopted the implied cause of action would reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business and there is authority for this rule13 further the court stated th at plaintiffs argument conf licted with section 104 of the private securities litigation reform act14 which was response by congress to central bank this statute provides that aiding and abetting liability is authorized in actions brought by the sec but not by private parties were we to adopt this plaintiffs cons truction of 10b it would revive in substance the implied cause of action against all aiders and abettors except those who committed deceptive act in the process of facilitating the fraud and we would undermine congress determination that th is class of defendants should be pursued by the sec and not by private litigants15 on january 22 2008 the supreme court d eclined without comment to hear an appeal by enron investors suing major banks which had allegedly ai ded enron to disguise its financial problems16 it is likely that the courts refusal to grant certiorari in this case is based upon its holding in stoneridge
