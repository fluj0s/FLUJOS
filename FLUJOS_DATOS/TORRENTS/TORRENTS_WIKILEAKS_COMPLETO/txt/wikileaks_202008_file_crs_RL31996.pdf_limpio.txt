october 2002 term american ins assn v garamendi 123 s ct 2374 71 uslw 4524 62303 preemption foreign relations californias holocaust victim insurance relief act which requires any insurance c ompany doing business in the state to disclose information about policies it or related companies sold in europe between 1920 and 1945 is preempted as interfering with the federal governments conduct of foreign relati ons the relevant foreign policy is expressed principally in executive agreements with germany austria and france executive agreements that settle claims of us nationals against foreign governments date to 1799 and congress has acquiesced in this longstanding practice although the ag reements at issue here address claims against foreign corporations rather than foreign governments that distinction does not matter the potsdam and yalta agreements are precedent for executive agreements addressing reparations implicating private parties and limiting the permissible scope of such agreements by requiring sharp dividing line would hamstring the president in settling international controversies valid executive agreements may preempt state law the court in zschernig v miller 1968 held that state laws may not intrude into the field of foreign affairs which the constitution entrusts to the president and the congress even in the absence of conflict with some affirmative federal activity in this case there is sufficiently clear conflic t to require finding preemption the general policy of encouraging european governments and companies to volunteer settlement funds in preference to litigation or coercive sanctions has held true in the insurance area where the executive agreements have encouraged european insurers to wo rk with the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims to develop acceptable claim procedures including procedures governing disclos ure of policy informa tion californias different tack of providing regulatory s anctions supplemented by litigation threatens to frustrate the operation of the particular mechanism the president has chosen california seeks to use an iron fist where the president has consistently chosen kid gloves cong resss silence on the subject is not to be equated with congressiona l disapproval of the p residents policies 54 opinion of court by souter joine d by rehnquist oconnor kennedy and breyer dissenting opinion by ginsburg joined by stevens scalia and thomas archer v warner 123 s ct 1462 71 uslw 4249 33103 bankruptcy debt embodied in settleme nt agreement that settled creditors earlier claim for money obtained by fraud can be considered debt for money obtained by fraud within the meaning of section 523a2a of the bankruptcy code and hence is nondischargeable inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996bankruptcy although the settlement agreement can be considered kind of novation that replaced the debt for mone obtained by fraud with new debt that new debt can also amount to debt for money obtained by fraud the outcome is governed by b r w nv f l s n 1979 in which the court held nondischargeable debt embodied in stipulation and consent judgment resolving suit based on fraud the court in brown said that the mere fact that conscientious creditor has previously reduced his claim to judgment should not bar further inquiry into the true nature of the debt and the same reasoning applies here there is significant difference between debt embodied in settlement and one embodied in stipulation and judgment the fact that the bankruptcy provision which riginally applied only to judgments sounding in fraud was later broadened t cover all such liabilities indicates that congress intended the fullest po ssible inquiry to ensure that all debts arising out of fraud are excepted from discharge 72 opinion of court by breyer joined by rehnquist oconnor scalia kennedy souter and ginsburg dissen ting opinion by thomas joined by stevens barnhart v peabody coal co 123 s ct 748 71 uslw 4041 11503 coal industry retiree health benefit ct deadline for assignment of retirees the coal industry retiree health bene fit acts requirement that the commissioner of social security sha ll before october 1 1993 assign each eligible coal industry retiree to an operating company for purposes of responsibility for funding benefits does not invalidate an initial assignment made after that date the claim that the deadline is jurisdictional is unsupportable and counterintuitive coupling the mandatory shall with specific deadline does not automatically void agency action taken after the deadline the act does not specify cons equence for noncom pliance with the deadline and in the ordinary course federal courts will not impose their own sanction the fact that other provisions of the act combine shall with deadline in manner that could not possibly be read to prohibit action outside the statutory period provides structural clues plausibility governs resolution of the issue congress would have said more than it did and would not have couched its intent in language already held to lack any clear jurisdictional significance had it intended to limit authority to act after the deadline the acts express references to unassigned beneficiaries merely means that congress recognized that in some instances there would be operator to which beneficiary could be ssigned congress did not foresee that the deadline for assignment might not be met it is fair to read the acts requirement that an operators percenta ge of obligations be determined on the basis of assignments as of the deadline date as qualified by congress assumption that all possible assignments would be made by that date congress intended to allocate the greatest number of beneficiaries to responsible operator and the deadline should be read as spur to prompt action not as bar to tardy completion 63 opinion of court by souter joined by rehnquist stevens kennedy ginsburg

removed to federal district court as an action arising under federal law even though the compla int did not refer to any federal law as general rule case is not removable if the complaint does not allege federal claim potential defenses based on federal law even if referenced by the complaint ordinarily do not create basis for removal in two instances however involving certain causes of action under the labor management relations act and erisa the court has recognized exceptions because the federal statute wholly displaces the statelaw cause of action the national bank act nba is another such statute the court has long held that sections 85 and 86 of the nba provide the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks and has also recognized that the special nature of federally chartered banks requires uniform rules limiting liability and prescribing exclusive remedies for overcharges 72 opinion of court by stevens joine d by rehnquist oconnor kennedy souter

rule applicable byregulation to social securitydisabilitybenefit determinations does not apply to disability determinations unde r employee benefit plans covered by erisa the secretary of labors regulations implementing erisas provisions on employee benefit plans do not require extra respect for the opinions of treating physicians nothing in the act itself suggests that plan administrators must accord treating physicians special deference and the ninth circuit erred in imposing such rule the two statutory regimes are different the social security act creates nationwide benefits program and presumptions help the administrator cope with the volume of claims and provide guidance to the administrative law judges who make the initial determinations erisa does not require the same

domestic international sales corporations dis cs and foreign sales corporations is reasonable interpretation of the statute and is entitled to deference by courts the regulation requires that rd expenses be allocated to broadly defined category of products from list of standard industrial classifications sics and prevents boeing from attributing ll such costs to one particular product model even in years when there were sa for that product the regulation thereby prevents boeing from deducting rd expenses that are not also reflected in combined taxable income derived by boeing and its disc for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996taxable years in question the statute grants the secretary authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the internal revenue code moreover the statute does not define combined taxable income and does not specifically refer t rd expenses although the statute does refer to percentage of combined taxable income that is attributable to export sales this limitation does not prevent the secretary from classifying all rd as an indirect cost attributable to all export sales of products in broadly defined sic category similarly general language calling for ratable apportionment of expenses tha t cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income does not prevent apportionment on categorical basis regulation governing computa tion of combined taxable income does not override the regulation at issue but instead relies on the challenged regulation for its application to the extent that legislative history is relevant it weighs in favor of the governments position 72 opinion of court by stevens joi ned by rehnquist oconnor kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer dissentin g opinion by

congressional redistricting voting rights act courtordered plan federal district court properly enj oined mississippi state courts order imposing congressional districting pla n for the state and properly fashioned its own redistricting plan rather than ordering atlarge elections in accordance with 2 usc 2ac the injunction was proper because the statecourt plan adopted after the state legislature had f ailed to redistrict on the basis of the 2000 census was not precleared under 5 of the voting rights act and had prospect of being precleared in time fo r the 2002 election section 5 requires preclearance when covered jurisdiction seeks to administer change in voting procedures states change in voting procedures may take effect if the attorney general has not interposed an objection within 60 days of the states submission in this case however the 60day period had been postponed by the attorney generals request for add itional information the state did not provide the requested information until feb 20 2002 the deadline for candidate qualification was march 1 2002 and the federal courts injunction was issued on feb 26 2002 the 60day period that began running on feb 20 with submission of the additional information had legal significance because the state never appealed the federal courts injunction and thus was longer seeking to administer the statecourt plan in fashioning redistricting plan for mississippi the fe deral court properly relied on 2 usc 2c which directs that singlemember districts shall be established by law although this language assuredly envisi ons legislative action it also embraces action by state and federal courts when legislatures have not acted an earlier enacted provision 2 usc 2ac5 which directs that representatives shallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996be elected atlarge until state is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof following an apportionmen t which has reduced the number of representatives to which the state is entitled is inapplicable mississippi statute also calling for atlarge election of representatives in such circumstances is similarly inapplicable 90propriety of injunction

requiring payment of just compensation to the client just compensation is due however just compensation is measured by the owners pecuniary loss and that loss is zero if the washington law is obeyed

burglary statute at the time in 1989 when the petitioners conviction for that crime became final or whether the knife instead was common pocketknife excepted from the definition of weapon in 1997 the florida supreme court relying on 1951 opinion of the state attorn ey general interpreted the provision for the first time as excluding pocket knife with blade length of 334inches the state court characterized its 1997 decision as part of centurylong evolutionary process in interpreting t he provision and this characterization raises the question of what the provision meant in 1989 when the petitioner was convicted in similar situation the court in fiori v white 2001 found due process violation in states refusal to apply to an earlier conviction definitive and exonerating interpretation of criminal statute said to reflect clarification of the statutes plain language rather t han new interpretation conviction denies due process if it is clear that th defendants conduct did not violate

2037 6203 commerce power federal arbitration act the alabama supreme court applied an improperly cramped view of congress commerce clause power in holding that the federal arbitratio n act faa applies only to transactions in interstate commerce and therefo re did not apply to debt restructuring agreements between an alabama bank and an alabama construction company the faa applies to contracts evidenci ng transaction involving commerce the term involving commerce is the functional equivalent of the term affecting commerce and ordinarily signals the broadest permissible exercise of the commerce power it is perfectly clear that the faa encompasses wider range of transactions than those actually in commerce there was need therefore to find that the restructuring related to interstate transactions or to outofstate projects nor was it necessary to find that any of the individual debtrestructuring agreem ents standing alone had substantial effect on interstate commerce the issue instead is the cumulative impact of the economic activity in question the agreements at issue meet the faas involving commerce test the respondent company engaged in business throughout the

referendum petition to the voters and the city engineer performed nondisc retionary ministerial act in denying the building permits while the refere ndum was pending statements made by private

hearing on the validity of an automobile impoundment fee until 27 days after his car had been towed the delay is supported by application of the three factors set forth in mathews v eldridge 1976 for determining whether an indivi dual has received the process that is due the private interest affecte d the temporary loss of the use of money is fully compensable 30day delay is unlikely to create the risk of significant factual errors the citys interest in administrative necessity however argues strongly in the citys favor the city already holds hearings within 48 hours for those persons unable to pay impoundment fees and it would be burdensome to have to hold all such hearings so promptly 90per curiam clackamas gastroenterology assocs pc v wells 123 s ct 1673 71 uslw 4293 42203 ada definition of employee the issue of whether the four shareholder directors of the petitioner professiona l corporation are employees under the americans with disabilities act ada an issue that in this case determines whether the corporation is an empl oyer subject to ada coverage as having 15 or more employees should be resolved by application of common law principles that define the masterserva nt relationship the adas definition of an employee as an individual employed by an employer is completely circular and explains nothingand i n such instances the court ordinarily presumes that congress intended the common law of agency to govern the petitioners approach of asking whether the shareholderdirectors are in reality partners simply begs the question an d the appeals courts approach seeking guidance in the adas broad purposes overlooks congresss reasons for limiting coverage to firms with 15 or more employees the common law definition of the masterservant relationship provides helpful guidance and is reflected in eeoc guidelines under that eeoccommon law approach the principal issue is whether the share holderdirectors ope rate independently and manage the firm or are instead subject to the firms control the case is remanded for further factual fi ndings related to this inquiry 72 opinion of court by stevens joi ned by rehnquist oconnor scalia kennedy souter and

this courts precedents parallelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996statutory provisions setting limitation periods do not require different conclusion the fact that provision governing petitions from state prisoners is worded differently it elaborates on the date on which the judgment became final by adding the words by the conclu sion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review does not mean that 2255 must be interpreted differently congress might have felt the need to spell out the meaning of final in the context of petitions by state prisoners but not in the context of petitions by federal prisoners in order to make it clear that finality is be determined by uniform federal rul rather than by reference to state law rules provision governing petitions by

subject to qui tam actions under the false claims act long before enactment of the false claims act fc in 1863 private corporations had been held to be artificial persons ordinarily included within the statutory term person although it was not until six years after enactment of the fca that the supreme court held that municipal c orporations are also persons this decision merely reflected common understanding antedating the fca the dictionary act defines person to include corporate entities unless the context shows otherwise but not hing about the fca makes the common understanding inappropriate the text is not inherently inconsistent with local government liability the original act included references to natural persons in the land or naval forces but also referre d unqualifiedly to other persons and although municipalities may not be subj ect to criminal penalties that is reason to exempt them from remedies that sensibly apply the fact that congress in 1863 was primar ily concerned with frauds co mmitted by private contractors during the civil war does not alter the fact that congress wrote expansively to cover all fraud 1986 amendments to the fca that raised the ceiling on damages from double to treble did not repeal by implication the fcas applicability to local governments although municipalities arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996generally exempt from punitive damages treble damages under the fca have compensatory as well as punitive traits some liability be yond the amount of fraud is usually necessary to compensate the government completely for the losses occasioned by fraud the fca does not provide for prejudgment interest or for consequential damages that typi cally come with recovery for fraud and qui tam recoveries must be subtracted from t he governments recovery more important than the presumption against punitive recovery is the presumption against repeals by implication the basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the fca more useful tool against fraud in modern times and it is simply not plausible that congress intended at the same time to repeal sub silentio the liability of local governments which today often

lanham act which prohibits false designation of origin does not prevent the unaccredited copying of noncopyrighted work the phrase origin of goods refers to the producer of the tangible goods that are

ii that it produced and sold even though it copied the videos from television series based on general eisenhowers book crusade in europe and made only minor modifications before selling them the most natural understanding of the origin of goods derived from dictionary definitions is the producer of the tan gible product sold in the marketplace interpreting the phrase to encompass the person whose ideas are embodied in the product would be out of accord with the history and purpose of the lanham act the lanham act prohibits actions that deceive consumers brandloyal consumer cares about whether favored company produced or stands behind product but does not necessarily care who originally designed or devised the formula for the product different ru for communicative products where authorship is important to purchasers would result in conflict with copyright law which provides that the right to c opy without attribution passes to the public upon expiration of copyright to hold the lanham act applicable in this way would be akin to finding species of perpetual patent and copyright when congress has chang ed copyright law it has done so with much more specificity than the lanham acts

which he could challenge inclusion in the mandatory detention category provision of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc 1226c requi res the attorney general to detain any alien who is removable from thi s country because he has been convicted of any of certain specified crimes congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens and the court has recognized the validity of detention during deportation proceedings detention pending removal proceedings necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing and thus increases the chance of successful removal this detention is normally of relatively short duration if detention becomes unreasonably long the alien may become entitled to an individualized determination as to ris k of flight and dangerousness judicial review is not precluded by language declaring that the attorney generals discretionary judgment applying the s ection shall not be subject to review and that court may set aside any action or decision of the attorney general regarding the detention of any alien here the respondent was not challenging discretionary judgment or decision of the attorney general but

demonstrates that race color religion sex or national origin was motivating factor for any employment practice even though other factors also motivated the practice this means that plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for reasonable jury to conclude by preponderance of the evidence that prohibited consideration was motivating factor for any employment practice that evidence may be circumstantial the statute is unambiguous plaintiff need only demonstrate discriminatory motive the statute does not mention much less require that plaintiff make heighte ned showing through direct evidence moreover the act defines the term demonstrates as meaning to meet the burdens of production and persuasion th is contrasts with other situations where congress has been unequivocal when

turn to include an entity the majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by foreign state corporation is an instrumentality of foreign state under this definition only if the foreign state owns majority of the corpora tions shares the meaning of share ownership is determined by referenc to corporation law and only direct ownership satisfies the requirement where congress intends to refer to ownership in other than the formal sense it knows how to do so as for example in statutes that refer to dir ect and indirect ownership or that define an owner as someone who owns or controls an entity shareholder by virtue of its ownership of shares does not own the corporations assets and therefore does not own subsidiary corpor ations other ownership interest does not

to existing as well as to future copyrights is valid exercise of congresss authority under the copyright clause the clause which empowers congress to grant copyrights for limited times authorizes congress to extend the terms of existing copyrights the word limited does not mean that copyright term once set becomes inalterable there is an unbroke n congressional practice of applying copyright term extensions to existing copyrights and the same practice has been applied to patents application of the cteas extension to existing copyrights is rational exercise of power on the issue of rationality the court defers substantially to congress the extensio n conforms copyright practice to that of the european union consistent with the berne convention and ensures that american authors will receive the same copyright protection in europe as their european counterparts congress also rationally relied on predictions that longer terms would encourage copyright holders to invest in restoration and public distribution of works the court rejects the argument that permitting congress to extend existing copyrights recognizes power to create perpetual copyrights in violation of the limited times constraint petitioners fail to show how the ctea crosses constitutionally significant threshold also rejected is the argument that there must be quid pro quo authors need not submit new

fair housing act it incorporates the ordinary tort rules of vicarious liability unless it specifies different intent congress has done so in several contexts eg the antitrust and food and drug laws but said nothing in the fair housing act or its legislative history about extending vicarious liabilitybeyond traditi onal principles traditional vicarious liability rules make employers liable for acts of their agents or employees in the scope of their employment but treat the corporation not its owner or officer as the employer corporate officers right to control an employees actions is insufficient by itself to establish the employeremployee relationship moreover the court defers to an administering agencys reasonable interpretations of statute and views hud regulation governing

threats or fear to obtain property but that they used such devices to cause the respondents to give up property rights rights to seek and to provide medical services the hobbs act language is

the objective punitive several factors provide guideposts for analysis registration and public notification of sex offenders are of recent origin and are not viewed as traditional means of punishment these requirements do not closely resemble punishments of public disgrace imposed in colonial times the stigma of megans law results not from public shaming but from the dissemination of information

encompassing commonlaw claims use of the article before law or regulation implies di screteness which is embodied in statutes and regulations that is not present in the common law also use of the words law and regulation together suggests that law should not be read so broadly as to encompass regulation and thereby render superfluous inclusion of the latter word narrower reading of law as excluding regulation could also exclude common law the acts saving clause providing that compliance with the federal standards or r egulations does not relieve person from liability at common law

have been satisfied by more modest punishment instead the case was used as platform to expose and punish state farm for its nationwide policie s even though much of the outofstate conduct was lawful where it occurred and state may not punish defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred more important the utah courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore relation to the plaintiffs harm the second gore guidepost examines the disparity between the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award few awards exceeding singledigit rati w i l ls t i s f yd u process when compensatory damages are substantial as they were in this case then lesser ratio perhaps only qual to compensatory damages can be upheld here the harm was economic r ather than physical and component of the punitive award was likely duplicated in the compensatory award the third gore guidepost the disparity between the punitive award and civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases reveals that the most relevant civil sanction 10000 fine fo r an act of fraud is dwarfed by the punitive damages award application of the gore guideposts therefore

grant relief to someone whose application to the bureau of cohol tobacco and firearms atf to remove his prohibition on possessing firearm was returned unprocessed in accordance with prohibition in the atfs appropriation law section 925c provides that any person whose application for relief from disabilities is denied by the secretary may file petition in federal district court for review of such denial atfs failure to act does not amount to denial within the meaning of 925c na c t u ld c i s i nb t fo na na p p l i c t i sa prerequisite for judicial review the phrase denied by the secretary references the secretarys determinations as to whether the applicant will be able to act in manner not dangerous to public safety and as to whether relief would be contrary to the public interest both of these standards point to atfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996as the primary decisionmaker the procedures that the section requires and the broad discretion conferred on the secretary also suggest the need for an actual adverse action on an application finally the admission of additional evidence in district court proceedings is contemplated only in exceptional circumstances ordinarily the district courts determination must rely heavily on the record compiled by atf but there is such record for the court to rely on when the application has been returned unprocessed 90 opinion for unanimous court by thomas united states v jimenez recio 123 s ct 819 71 uslw 4076 12103 conspiracy termination conspiracydoes not terminate automaticallywhen the object of the conspiracy becomes impossible to achieve the ninth circuits view that it does is rejected by almost all courts and commentators thus conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs did not end when government agents seized the drugs in question persons caught in sting operation set up after the drug seizure can be convict ed of conspiracy the essence of conspiracy is an agreement to commit an unlawful act and the agreement is distinct evil that exists regardless of whether the substantive crime ensues conspiracy poses threat to the public over and above the threat of the commission of the planned crime because the combination makes it more likely that the conspirators will continue their criminal ways and commit other crimes this additional threat persists when c onspirators continue to pursue their objective unaware that police have frustrated its accomplishment 90merits 81procedure opinion of court b breyer joined by rehnquist oconnor scalia kennedy souter t homas and ginsburg opinion by stevens concurring in part and

trust in connection with the secretary of the interiors approval f coal lease amendments negotiated by the tribe and peabody coal company after alleged pressure brought to bear on the tribe by the secretary must be rejected because the claim does not derive from any liabilityimposing provision of the indian mineral leasing act imla the indian tucker act grants the court of federal claims jurisdiction over tribal claims against the united states but is not itself source of substantive rights existing precedent requires tr ibal plaintiff to invoke rightscreating law that can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damages sustaine d the imla is not such law rather than imposing detailed fiduciary re sponsibility on the secretary to manage leasing and mineral resources in the best interests of the tribe the imla simply requires secretarial approval b efore coal mining leases negotiated between tribes and third parties become effective in this respect the imla resembles the general allotment act held not to give rise to damages action for breach of trust in managing allotted lands and may be distinguished from network of other statutes and regulations later held to impose full responsibility to manage indian resources and land for the benefit of the indians moreover interpreting the imla to impose fiduciary duties giving rise to compensable claims would counter one of the imlas principal purposes that of enhancing tribal selfdetermination by giving tribes the lead role in negotiating mineral leaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl3199663 opinion of court by ginsburg joined by rehnquist scalia kennedy thomas and breyer dissenting opini on by souter joined by stevens and oconnor united states v white mountain apache tribe 123 s ct 1126 71 uslw 4139 34 03 indian tucker act management of trust lands 1960 law under which the former fort apache military reservation is held in trust for the white mountain apache tribe subject to proviso granting the united states the right to use any part of the land and improvements f or administrative or school purposes triggered compensable trustee res ponsibilities over prope rty used under the proviso the indian tucker act allows damage actions against the united states only if the statute conferring substantive rights can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation the two mitchell cases represent the two categories of fiduciary duties bare trust under the gene ral allotment act the breach of which is not compensable and elaborate control under timber management statutes the breach of whic h is compensable the 1960 act goes beyond bare trust and permits fair inference that the government is subject to duties as trustee and liable in damag for breach although the act does not expressly subject the government to duties of management and conservation it does subject the propert to trust and the governments use of the property involving daily supervis ion and daily occupation creates fair inference of an obligation to prese rve the property improvements the governments defenses are rejected property used under the proviso is not carved out of the trust specific language on damages is not needed if the requisite fair inference can be drawn from the trust obligation damages remedy is not inappropriate for f ailure of maintenance even though injunctive relief may repres ent the economic equivalent 54 opinion of court by souter joined b stevens oconnor ginsburg and breyer concurring opinion by ginsburg joined by

who cannot demonstrate legitimate busin ess or social purpose for being on the premises the respondent was arrested for trespass after having received written notice barring him from the development the virginia supreme court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad because it granted the property manager discretion that could be used to prohibit speech protected by the first amendment persons wishing to hand out leaflets in the developments property would be required to obtain t he managers permission under the overbreadth doctrine law with legitimate applications can be invalidated if it punishes substantial amount of protect ed free speech but only if application to protected speech is substantial not just in an absolute sense but also in relation to the scope of the laws plainly legitimate applications rarely if ever will an overbreadth challenge succeed against law t h sn t specifically addressed to speech th trespass policy is addressed to non expressive

violates that principle neither the statute nor the regulations however say anything about creditors because the reimbursement does not involve execution levy attachment or garnishment the case boils

attorneys failure to pursue investigation of petitioners personal history and to present important mitigating evidence at his capital sentencing constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and the state courts rejection of his claim involved an unreasonable application of clearlyestablished federal law within the meaning of 28 usc 2254 the petitioner ther efore was entitled t federal habeas relief the governing law was established by strickland v washington 1984 holding that an ineffective assistan ce of counsel claim must be based on showing of deficient attorneyperformance that falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and that resulte d in prejudice to the defense under strickland defense attorneys strategi c judgment made after less than complete investigation is reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments s upport the limitations on investigation here the attorneys decision not to expand thei r investigation into their clients background fell short of professiona l standards then governing and was unreasonable in light of the informatio n actually discovered they abandoned the investigation after having acquire d only rudimentary knowledge of their clients history but after having ac quired information that any reasonably competent attorney would have realized was necessary to pursue in making an informed choice among possible defenses under the circumstances the state courts deference to the attorneys strategic decision not to present the background mitigating evidence was objectively unreasonable actual prejudice to the petitioners case was established the available mitigating evidence taken as whole might well have influenced the jurys appraisal of the petitioners moral culpability 72 opinion of

4217 32503 habeas corpus cases pending on aedpa effective date for purposes of applying the rule announced in lindh v murphy 1997 that amendments made by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa do not apply to cases pending on aedpas effective dat case does not become pending until an actual petition for habeas relief is filed in federal court neither the filing of motion for ppointment of federal habeas counsel nor the application for stay of execution suffices to make case pending aedpa places heavy emphasis on the standards governing review of the merits of habeas application and the meaning f pending should reflect that emphasis the issue therefore is whether on aedpas effective date the state prisoner had before federal court an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits of the petitioners claims textual support for the conclusion that an application is re quired is found in 28 usc 2254e1 which provides that presumption of t he correctness of the state courts determination of factual issues shal l apply in proceeding instituted by an application for writ of habeas corpus if proceeding could be instituted by request for an attorney or for stay of execution then the presumption would be inapplicable in such cases also the filing of habeas petition is the functional equivalent of the filing of complaint in civil action and civil action is commenced by the filing of complaint 63 opinion of court by thomas joined by rehnquist stevens scalia and kennedy concurring opinion by oconnor dissenting opinion by souter joined by ginsburg and breyer woodford v visciotti 123 s ct 357 71 uslw 3315 11402 habeas corpus ineffective assistance of counsel the ninth circuit erred in affirming the grant of habeas corpus relief to petitioner whose claim was barred by operation of 28 usc 2254d that federal statute allows federal court to grant habeas relief t state prisoner whose claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable applicatio n of clearly established federal law or if the state decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts the california supreme courts decis ion was not contrary to the supreme courts decision in strickland v washington 1984 which required reasonable probability that but for counsels error the outcome of the case would have been different the california courts occasional shorthand reference to the strickland standard did not establish error nor did the california court unreasonably apply strickland an incorrect application of federal law is not necessarily an unr easonable application under section 2254d although during the sentencing phase of the trial the defense counsel had made multiple concessions as to the effects of the defendants brain injury and had failed to intr oduce mitiga ting evidence about the defendants background the state courts could r easonably have concluded that this mitigating evidence was outweighed by severe aggravating factors 90per curiam httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31996yellow transportation inc v michigan 123 s ct 371 71 uslw 4003 11502
