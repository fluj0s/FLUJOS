6311c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing as an auditor you can now be found out by the ta motion that you get on your pcs an accomplished auditor can get ta at will ta motion has to be prevented by the auditor to keep it from occurring it is prevented by 1 additive complications 2 failure to recognize basics there are three zones of auditing and applied scientology 1 basic auditing 2 case analysis 3 routine 4 so there are three zones of expertise which you should recognize as separate areas of performance to be expert the auditor must be good in all three zones someone could do technique perfectly but lacking basic auditing and understanding of what the mind consists of he will not get anywhere lrhs auditing is perfectly mechanical and bythebook doing r4 he goes along doing it until the pc either gets to the end of the processing cycle or until the pc has fallen on his head in the latter case he becomes case analyst using different set of data namely how do banks go together the pc can say anything he likes about the situation as long as there is ta when the pc is done the case analyst goes looking for why the list is misbehaving having done an analysis the auditor knows that the accuracy of the analysis is subject to question because of the charge on the case so any charge gotten off will make more accurate analysis possible until all charge is gone only factors that are present now are analyzed former analysis is relied on analysis is valid after its date of inception because more charge may meanwhile have been taken off the case the accuracy of case analysis depends on the pcs ability to itsa so caseanalyses shift they are always conditional and timespecific there is trick of not speaking invalidatively while not buying something the pc is selling the pc says that x is his goal you say fine ill check it out calls the goal im sorry that didnt read in case analysis you look at the source that you got list from as well as the possibility that the pc was arc broken or not answering the auditing question etc when you find the right answer you will get some ta action it will correct to something like it should be when you reach that point you go back to being an auditor being mechanical etc and you give the question you go back to what you were doing you never wear both hats at the same time just wear the hat that is needed at the time there is one hat that you wear all the time the basic auditing hat lacking that it doesnt matter how good you are at the other two basic auditing is giving someone something to talk about letting him talk letting him know that he has said it when he has and running an emeter all the while the basic auditing hat includes 1 trs acknowledge at the end of the complete cycle of action if the answer involves only one itsa ack at the end of one itsa if it occurs after fifty itsas ack after 50 itsas 2 the auditors code 3 metering 4 itsa line handling all basic auditing actions are coordinated with the pc there are four elements to what happened in session 1 what the pc did 2 what the auditor did 3 what the bank did 4 what the meter did the auditors actions in the session are relatively unimportant the most unseen character in the world is an auditor in session he is about as visible as drop of water in stream this is an almost perfect example of thetan with mass the important actions in the session are the performance of the pc the pcs bank and the emeter the auditors actions only matter to the degree that they interfered with the pcs actions an auditors actions can be anything so long as they are not destructive to the session an auditor runs mostly on lack of action auditing is third dynamic activity the auditor merely runs it basic auditing is like the firebox of the ships engine thetech is like the generating equipment the big engine is the bank this is not so great an analogy all an arc break means is that something has gone wrong in the case analysis department not in the basic auditing department wrong goal found can be listed smooth as silk but any later slip will produce an arc break basic auditing can always be improved it is not bunch of dos and donts it is thetan sitting in the auditing chair running the pc and the pcs bank verifying it on the meter and keeping up both the small and the large auditing cycles there are rules or tricks in it anywhere that solve all its problems because it is not complicated action you make it far more complicated than it is the zone of auditing called r4 mentioned earlier in the lecture p 539 above is really technique of any sort these three zones of auditing apply at lower levels too in the same order of use and importance basic auditing then technique and case analysis if you get confused in your own mind about whats what you will think that you need new technique when your technique is fine but your basic auditing is out you think that you are being trained as auditors when in actuality you are simply being untrained from all the complications which during the vast vistas of time you have accumulated with regard to human relationships and minds person believes that if he takes too much responsibility for one of these sectors it is liable to go wrong that is just because he is unconfident the think on it is it is best to let the pc run the session because hidden datum if anything goes wrong then it isnt really my fault and this is called making the pc selfdetermined or the opposite think can occur the pc doesnt know what he is talking about he will get himself in trouble and i will be to blame so therefore i had better do everything in the session and not permit the pc to do anything in the session because if you depend on the pc that will make him guilty and that is like blaming the pc you really shouldnt do that so we will relieve the pc of all responsibility we will get our itsa from the meter but what is all this worry about it going wrong an effort not to have wrongness is not session there is very little to teach in basic auditing there is the pcs attention line you keep it on some area of the bank until he has said all that is there and when he is finished you see that he is and you tell him that he is done you can produce ta action with do birds fly with good basic auditing surprisingly enough auditing is doing basic auditing running process and having an analysis of the case that justifies running the process and that tells you when the process is flat auditing is these three departments the most important part of the session is the pc the next most important part is the pcs bank the next is the meter and its verification of what is going on and the least visible part though the most important part as far as the beingness of the session is concerned is the auditor session is an irreplacable section of time that will never occur again so what happens in the session is important the important questions for session are 1 what actually happened in the session 2 was there ta action 3 was the pcs ability to itsa and confront improved 4 was the pcs bank straightened out those are the important things not whether you appear in session in costume so long as when you appear in session your appearance doesnt impede the session appearance is only important in that it could be distracting or disturbing basic auditing training is simply the average action best calculated to produce result in session with minimal impedance of session gain there is completely proper auditing action except as measured against these elements all your selfcriticism is badly spent it is whether you produce results that really matters
