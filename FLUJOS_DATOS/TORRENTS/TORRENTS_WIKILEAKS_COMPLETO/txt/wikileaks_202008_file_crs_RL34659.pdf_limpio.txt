over appropriate climate change policy this background report describes chinese ghg emissions nd some of its mitigation efforts it touches briefly on chinas international cooperation china and the united states are the leading emitters of ghgs together responsible for about 35 of global emissions lack of official and reliable data makes any ranking of country emissions difficult to verify for now china has released one ghg inventory for the year 1994 chinese co2 emissions are high due to the countrys large population strong capital investment nd urbanization and heavy reliance on coal but are constrained by low incomes current forecasts are speculative but foresee chinese emissions to grow rapidly with its economy in june 2007 china released its nationa l climate change program plan to address climate change the program outlines activities both to mitigate ghg emissions and to adapt to the consequences of potential climate change within the program perhaps most challenging is chinas goal to lower energy intensity 20 by 2010 the country fell short of its annual milestones set in energy policies in both 2006 and 2007 in july 2008 premier wen jiab ao and the state council warned that meeting its energy intensity and emi ssion reduction goals remained an arduous task related goals include more than doubling renewable energy use by 2020 expansion of nuclear power closure of inefficient industria l facilities tightened efficiency standards for buildings and ppliances and forest coverage expanded to 20 the chinese and some international observers claim that china has been more proactive on climate change than some developed countries though others are cautious of chinas ability to achieve its goals meanwhile chinese business opportunities in clean and low carbon energy are expanding rapidly chinese negotiators adhere to the pr inciple of common but differentiated responsibilities agreed in the united nations framework convention on climate change they argue that emissions per person in china are low and that raising incomes must be their highest priority nd that industrialized countries bear primary responsibility for the historical buildup of ghgs in the atmosphere and should thus lead in mitigating emissions domestically industrialized countries also they say should assist developing countries to mitig ate emissions and adapt to coming change debate on potential climate change legislation in the united states has been influenced by chinas surging ghg emi ssions and uncertainty over how and when china might alter that trend there is concern that strong domestic action taken without chinese reciprocity would unfairly advantage china in global trade and fail to slow significantly the growth of atmospheric concentrations of ghgs the governments of both china and the united states have indicated some closure of their gap on future actions to address climate change some observers believe that the next administration and the 111th congress will seek more active measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34659contents introduction china and climate change 1 c h i n i n c n t x t 3 c h i n s n r g s c t r 4 chinas national greenhouse gas emissions 5 ghg

economic conditions by wayne m morrisonchinas greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation policies introduction china and climate change1 china stands front and center in the congressional debate on climate change due to that nations contribution to global emissions and competitiveness in global trade with its large population rapidly expandi ng economy and heavy reliance on coal china now shares the lead in global greenhouse gas ghg emissions with the united states chinas ghg emissions are exp ected to continue growing in the years ahead based on projections of continuing rapid economic growt h experts generally agree that emissions in all major countries must be abated in order to stabilize growth of atmospheric concentrations of ghg that leads to climate change in the united states critics of ma ndatory domestic ghg controls without reciprocal chinese action argue they woul d increase the costs of us goods relative to those from china thus harming competitiven ess of certain us industries to the degree that production might decrease here nd increase in china as result reduced emissions in the united states might be offset by higher emissions there called leakage this could exacerbate trade tensions between the united states and china and not appreciably reduce the risk of climate change so unless china takes significant simultaneous action with the ited states some analysts contend it is not in us interests to do so here proponents of us climate leadership on the other hand note the need for developed countries to act first due to historical contributions to current ghg concentrations and greater economic capabilities only if the united states and other industrialized emitters act first they argue can the developing countries be encouraged to do their part industrialized countries must demonstrate to china and other large developing count ries that emissions can be reduced without unacceptable economic losses this in their perspective is the only way to break the standoff that some claim the two nations face2 between 1979 and 2007 the chinese economy grew at an average annual rate of 983 hundreds of millions of chinese have improved their

200 million people in china lived on less than 125 day in 20055 eradicating poverty and raising incomes toward the global average remains high priority for china historically china has often put econo

pollution has become so bad in places that social and political stability are at risk officially recogniz ed public order disturbances grew from 58000 in 2003 to 87000 in 2005 many due to environmental pollution and land takings stemming from government corruption6 the world bank working with the chinese government and other experts in 2007 estimated that the cost of outdoor air and water pollution to chinas econom totalled around us100 billion annually or 58 of chinas gdp7 related to such findings the chinese government put environmental protection into its 11th five year plan 20062010 as high priority chinese central government officials have over the past decade pursued combination of measures to control air water and soil pollution and are struggling to build recycling industrialized economy to ease environmental pressures these efforts have met with mixed success ev when national officials genuinely want to encourage better environment local officials may have different priorities in mind as will be reflected further in this report one important question is the degree to which national goals and measures will be achieved controlling local and regional pollutants like oxides of sulfur and nitrogen particulates and mercury is difficult because of the differe nt priorities of local and central government officials and insufficient enforcement controlling ghg emissions in china is even harder for traditional pollutants both mitigation costs and impacts are local or regional averaged nationally polluters will pay the cost one way or another but with ghg emissi ons mitigation costs may be local while climate impacts are global so without shar ed international action this can lead to tragedy of the commons phenomenon8 where free riders

chinas energy sector because energy production and use and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions emit the largest share of total greenhouse gases comparing chinas energy sector to the united states helps to explain many differences between the emissions of the two countries chinese energy demand has surged since the start of this decade often growing at rate faster than the economy13 this growth

bp statistical review of world energy 2008 available at httpwwwbpcom 15 estimates of ghg emissions in china are uncertain in part because of underlying uncertainties in official energy and economic

was about 21 less according to british petroleum bp data the next biggest differences between china and the united states in energy structure besides chinas greater reliance on coal are chinas limited quantities of domestic natural gas and fewer nuclear power plants chinas national greenhouse gas emissions chinas greenhouse gas emissions have become point of polemics in us debate over appropriate domestic climate change policy especially regarding the fairness of whether the united stat government should commit legally to greenhouse gas reductions before or simulta neously with the government of china variety of perspectives and supporting data are put forward in such debates this section reviews availa ble data and along with table 1 describes how estimates of ghg in absolute terms relative to populati on or economic production or associated with exports to other countries may enter into policy consideration it also assesses arguments that count ries contributions to atmo

estimates are subs tantially similar the iea total for 2005 is 23 greater than the chinese tentativ estimate for 2004 the difference is likely due in part to strong growth in energy use from 2004 to 2005 but it also likely reflects significant differences in th underlying data proportionately co2 is greater share of emissions in the estimate from china 83 compared with 78 and the chinese estimate

unclear but likely by 2009 source crs graphic from iea estimates extracted january 8 2008 together the united states and china emit approximately 40 of global carbon dioxide emissions and about 35 of to tal ghgs many people argue that eventually both countries would need to play role in substantially mitigating emissions if the world is to hold atmos pheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at level that is considered safe27 the respective abatement to which each country should commit however is controversial because of the very different economic conditions in the two countries these diffe rences become apparent when comparing ghg emissions per capita and pe r unit of economic production httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34659crs9 28 there has been substantial literature in ternationally concerning contraction and convergence of emissions per capita see for example http wwwgciorgukcontconv cchtmlghg per capita although china is leading ghg emitter its ghg emissions per person fall far

should reduce them to allow for expa nsion by those who now consume less than average28 ghg productivity or intensity experts often compare economies by their productivity in use of partic ular

continues to fall xinhua july 15 2008the overall level of econo mic activity and industr ialization are important determinants of ghg emissions since ch ina is trying to increase its national income its emissions are also expected to increase china and other developing countries give high priority to eradi cating poverty and raising the incomes income per capita of their populations toward thos of industrialized na tions consequently these countries contend in ghg negotiations that addressing climate change must be of lesser priority while wealthier countri take the lead in reducing their ghg emissions some experts argue that economies th at are less ghgefficient with higher ghg intensity such as china must ve greater opportunity and responsibility to improve those efficiencies some of these experts may argue that advancing growth of developing economies would naturally lead to less ghg emissions based on some but disputed analysis that emissi on intensities of economie s naturally decline as incomes rise others have found that rapidly advancing t echnologies in use may improve ghg intensity but result in great er ghg emissions overall because of the macroeconomic expansion and consumption they could stimulate30 though total ghg emissions have grown in china its ghg emissions intensity has substantially fallen in recent decades t hough not consistently in the last few years aggressive energy efficiency policies have contributed to this decline and will be discussed further in the domestic policy section using ieas ghg emission estimates and the world banks world development indicators chinas ghg intensity fell more than twothirds from 1990 to 2005 whether calculated by gdp using exchange rates or gni using purchasing power parities for the same period the world average emissions intensity dropped 43 while the united states ghg intensity declined by 4831 as measure of the progre ss of its national policy the national bureau of statistics the national development and reform commission ndrc and the national energy administration said in statement that the energy consumption for every 10000 yuan of gdp fo r 2007 was 16 tons of coal equivalent falling by 37 from the year 200632httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34659crs12 measurement of economic activity affects crosscountry comparisons how economic activity is measured influences the comparison of ghg intensities across countries the exchange rate between the chinese currency and the us dollar influence how this number is reported for example the chinese rmb has strengthened roughly 20 in comparison to the dollar since it began managed float in july 2005a resulting in relative increase in chinas estimated gdp and therefore lowering of chinese ghg intensityb many analysts believe that using purchasing power parity ppp like several estimates in this crs report rather than currency exchange rates is be tter way to compare ghg inte nsities across countries with different econom ic structures and conditions economists have attempted to factorin national price differentials by using purchasing power parity ppp measurement the ppp converts foreign currencies into common currency usually the us do llar on the basis of the actual purchasing power of those currencies based on survey s of the prices of various goods and services in each respective country in other words the ppp data attempt to determine how much local currency yuan for exam ple would be needed to purchase comparable level of goods and services in the united states per us dollar however purchasing power parities are estimated as well world bank revision of its ppps in december 2007 reduced estimates of the size of chinas economy by about 40 for 2005c this relative reduction of the size of chinese economy while estimates of ghg emissions remained constant raised crs calculation of chinas ghg intensity for 2005 from 098 to 140 raising it substantially relative to other countries for which the

is at the core of debate about how to share among countries the challenge of stabilizing ghg c oncentrations in the negotiations leading to the kyoto protocol the brazilian delega tion proposed that the effort to reduce ghg emissions might be shared globa lly with commitments from developing countries not beginning until their cont ributions to present or future ghg concentrations in the atmosphere reach those of the historical contributions of industrialized countries the brazil proposal thus much analysis and political disc ussion about appropr iate responsibilities among countries

are several options for addressing embe dded emissions one is that the exportrelated emissions of country such as china be debited from its inventory and credited to those of importing countries such as the unite d states others would argue that administering such approach accurately would be infeasible while others would argue that it would be preferable for the ex porting country to pay the cost
