the aviation security act of 2001 s 1447 introduced by senator hollings the bill provided for the federalization of most aspects of airport security the responsibility for much of the law enforcement aspect of airport security would have been shifted from the department of transportation dot to the department of justice doj frontline screening of passengers and baggage would be carried out by

that was significantly different from senatepassed s 1447 the airport security federalization act of 2001 s 1447 amended by the text of hr 3150 introduced by representative young included provisions to shift the responsibilit for the security of all modes of transportation to new administration the transpor tation security administration tsa within dot the bill called for the oversight of all airport screeners by uniformed federal agents but would have allowed for the use of contract employees as frontline security screeners on november 19 2001 president bush signed the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 h rept 107296 atsa includes elements of both the house and senate bills as well as new provisions added to facilitate the final compromise that was agreed to in conference on the contentious issue of whether screeners should be federal agents or contractor personnel atsa provides that within one year federal employees shall be hired to take over airport security screening services at all but five us commercial airports two years later however airports may optout of the federal screener system and switch to contractor screeners the act also establishes new transportation security administration tsa headed by an under secretary of transportation for security within three months of enactment the responsibilities for aviation security would be transferred from the federal aviation administration faa to the tsa also included in the act are provisions requiring that within 60 days airports provide for the screening or bagmatching of all

september 11 2001 hijacking of four airliners and the enormous loss of life from the use of these airplanes as weapons has focused congressional concerns on aviation security during the debate in congress following the attack the overarching issue was the degree of federal involvement needed to both make commercial air travel safer and to restore the publics confidence in the security of our nations airway and airports on november 19 2001 president bush signed the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 after brief background discussion this report discusses different policy approaches to the federal role in aviation security the report provides an overview of the bills that passed in the house and senate it then discusses the conference agreement compromise and highlights the provisions of atsa finally sidebyside presentation of selected provisions from the house senate and enacted bills are displayed in table 1 background airport security airport security efforts are generally directed toward preventing access to aircraft or secure areas of airports by terrorists and others who pose as passengers infiltrate as employees or slip into restricted zones at an airport to plant explosives or hijack an aircraft to counter these efforts airlines screen passengers and baggage airports and airlines also require employee background checks1 they have also tightened secure area access requirements during the past two years however general accounting office gao and department of transportation dot inspector general ig investigations have criticized security measures at major airports in its report longstanding problems impair airport screeners performanc gaorced0075 june 28 2000 gao found that screeners performance in detecting dangerous objects was not satisfactory dot igs march 23 2001 aviation security memorandum to the faa administrator stated that baggage screeners were screening fewer bags per day than the recently installed explosive detection systems could screen per hour the ig also found that airport operators and airlines frequently were not complying with the background check requirements for employees with access to secure areas of their airports the ig found that while the faa had made significant progress inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31150crs2 2the bush administration has set aside 500 million of emergency appropriations to help pay for the retrofitting of cockpit doors most airlines on their own initiative have begun reinforcing the cockpit doors and locks in their aircraft 3since the passage of atsa the estimates of the costs for all its provisions ie airport security air marshals and equipment have been as high as 5 billiondeploying existing advanced security technologies it had failed to integrate the various security assets into seamless security system security in the aircraft since the late 1980s the focus of security efforts was on intercepting explosives in the airport the september 11 terrorist attacks have changed this following the attack there was renewed interest in expanding the federal air marshal fam program in the belief that an armed federal agent might have thwarted the hijackers supporters of expanding the fam program argued that an expanded program would also have deterrent effect on wouldbe hijackers the security of the cockpit has also became an issue supporters of stronger cockpit doors locks and latches argued that if the cockpits had been more secure the september 11 terrorists might not have been able to seize the controls2 the federal role in aviation security history of lessthansatisfactory investigative reports on airport security and long delays in the regulatory implementation of security improvements included in legislation led to statements of frustration by members in both houses of congress this past failure to improve the current system combined with the totally unforeseen scope of the september 11 attack by policy makers led to consensus for deeper federal involvement in aviation security federalizing airport security for many proponents federalizing airport security simply meant making airport security federal law enforcement or national security function federal agents would screen passengers and baggage and in some proposals would also patrol both the secure and public areas of airports faa estimated that this would require 28000 full time equivalent employees at cost of roughly 18 billion per year3 this federalizing option had the advantage of conceptual simplicity having federal law enforcement agents providing the security at us airports was also according to proponents the best way to restore public confidence in the aviation system during the postseptember 11 aviation security debate in congress they argued that it is doubtful that merely imposing federal oversight and supervision on the already failed us system of contractor airport security screeners would achieve the scope of change needed to assure the public of the effectiveness of us airport security critics however warned that this option would create bureaucracy that could become as ineffective as the current system and at much higher cost critics also argued that the change to totally federal workforce is an enormous undertaking and that imposing strict federal control over contractors could be accomplished morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31150crs3 4in the house hr 2951 contains identical language to s 1447 as introduced hr 3165 is identical to the senatepassed version of s 1447easily finally critics argued that to quickly improve the performance of airport security screeners managers must have more freedom to dismiss and discipline employees than would be likely under any system that utilized federal employees strengthening and enforcing the regulation of airport security under this option the federal presence and oversight would increase but private companies would continue to provide the security employees they would however work under stricter background checks training and supervision this was seen by proponents as less expensive than hiring the estimated 28000 federal agents that would be needed for the 100 federal employee option they also argued that this option would also give federal security managers more freedom to hire and fire based on merit and performance than they could if employees were protected by us civil service law opponents of this solution generally argued that in the us profit driven contract airport security services have performed poorly over many years and it is doubtful that they will ever achieve the level of security that could be provided by using federal agents aviation security legislative overview of s 1447 the house and senate passed significantly different aviation security bills the senate bill the aviation security act of 2001 s 1447 introduced by senator hollings4 passed with multiple amendments by 1000 vote on october 11 2001 on november 1 2001 the house passed the airport security federalization act of 2001 s 1447 as amended by the text of hr 3150 introduced by representative young during the house debate the bill was strongly supported by the house majority leadership and president bush the major issues of whether to make security screeners federal employees and whether to shift airport security responsibility to different agency along with many other differences had to be resolved in conference this section provides brief comparative overview of the house and senate passed versions of s 1447 it then discusses the major provisions of the aviation and transportation security act asta pl 10771 as enacted all three versions of the bill would have increased the federal role in assuring aviation security the degree of federal involvement provided for in the bills however varied significantly table 1 at the end of this report sets forth in sidebyside format selected provisions from the house senate and enacted versions of s 1447 the house and senatepassed bills airport security provisions as passed by the senate s 1447 would have federalized the responsibilities for much of airport security most of the lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31150crs4 enforcement aspects of airport security would have been carried out by the department of justice doj frontline screeners of passengers and baggage would have been federal employees under the authority of the attorney general the bill also would have required the screening of all airline airport and concessionaire personnel before they may enter restricted secure areas at an airport new background checks would have been required for existing employees who have not undergone such checks within the last five years the senate bill included significantly more provisions concerning perimeter and secure area access at airports than the house bill the house bill s 1447 as amended by the text of hr 3150 provided for the creation of new administration the transportation security administration tsa within the dot under the house bill new under secretary for transportation security would head the tsa and would be responsible for transportation security of all modes of transportation including aviation this bill did not specify whether airport security screeners must be federal or contractor employees it merely prescribed that the screening must be carried out by person s and procedures acceptable to the under secretar most supporters of the bill however voiced support for contract screener personnel under uniformed federal supervision the bill was less directive than the senate version concerning access to secured areas it required the under secretary to consult with faa and then to implement methods to impose standards for the screening of persons or vehicles having access to secure areas of an airport federal air marshal and cock pit security provisions the senate passed bill would have kept the fam program in dot but directed that the secretary administer the program under guidelines prescribed by the attorney general the house bill would have shifted the responsibility for the fam program from faa to the tsa both bills called for major expansion of the fam program both bills contained cockpit security provisions the senatepassed bill limited access to authorized flight deck personnel required strengthening of cockpit doors and locks and required that cockpit doors be locked during flight and restricts possession of cockpit door keys to the flight deck crew assigned to the flight the house bill also required the strengthening of cockpit doors and restricted the opening of cockpit doors during flight but in addition required cabin video monitors be installed as well as switches that would allow cabin crew to secretly warn flight crews when there are security breaches in the cabin the house and senate bills both included provisions that allowed pilots after successfully completing training program to carry firearm on an aircraft funding provisions security fees the senatepassed bill provided that air carriers pay 250 charge for each boarding passenger to offset the costs of providing aviation security services to air carriers the revenues were only be used to for the costs of providing aviation security serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31150crs5 the house bill provided for fee of up to 250 for each oneway trip on airline passengers to pay for the costs of screening passengers and property allowable costs were to be limited to salaries and benefits of screening personnel supervisors trainers and for the acquisition operation and maintenance of their equipment in addition the under secretary could impose fee on air carriers to pay the difference between the costs and the revenues collected from the passenger fee the passenger fee revenues were to be treated as offsets authorization the senatepassed bill authorized such sums as may be necessary for security funding for fy2002fy2004 it also authorized such sums as necessary for fy2002 to compensate airports for faa mandates imposed after september 11 2001 in addition the bill expanded the eligibility for airport improvement program funds and use of existing passenger facility charges to include funding for broader range airport security costs the housepassed bill authorized 500 million for fortifying cockpit doors installing video monitors and continuous transponders the bill authorized 15 billion for the direct costs of faa security related mandates following september 11 this bill also expanded aip eligibility for fy2002 for small hub and nonhub airports to include staffing and training costs and reimbursement of law enforcement personnel other provisions there are number of other provisions of note both bills included language requiring the development of programs of training for flight crews for dealing with hijacking attempts both bills also included provisions requiring criminal history and background checks for students seeking flight training on certain classes of aircraft the house bill included provision that significantly limited the scope of liability for damages arising out of the crashes of september 11 the house version also included provision requiring the under secretary for transportation security to deputize all airport screening personnel as federal transportation security agents conference issues although both the house and senate bills included many similar provisions there were only two issues of major conflict during conference the issue of federalization of airport security screeners and the issue of which agency should oversee aviation security federalization of airport security screeners at issue was whether requiring the hiring of federal agents as passenger and baggage screeners would reassure the traveling public of the safety of air travel more than providing federal supervisory personnel to manage contractor employees this issue was the most difficult to resolve the compromise provided that within one year of enactment all screeners would be federal personnel up to five airports participating in pilot program would be exceptions and would operate with security contractor personnel three years after enactment airports could optout of the federal screener system and contract with private companies for screener serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31150crs6 what federal agency should have security responsibility both bills provided for shift in aviation security responsibilities from the faa but they differed over which department should take over the underlying issue was whether aviation security is primarily an aviation issue that can be best managed by new administration within dot the house bill or is primarily law enforcement issue that can be best managed by the attorney general the senate bill the conference agreement included the house proposal for new transportation security administration within dot but outside of faa the aviation and transportation security act atsa on november 19 2001 president bush signed the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 atsa shifts much of the responsibility for aviation security from the airports and airlines to the federal government the act establishes new transportation security administration tsa headed by an under secretary of transpo rtation for security within three months of enactment the responsibilities for aviation security would be transferred from the federal aviation administration faa to the tsa the under secretary shall assume the rights and responsibilities of air carriers under their existing security screening contracts and may also make agreements with air carriers to transfer to the united states government at cost the ownership of equipment property and supplies associated with such security screening the new administration will be responsible for the security of all modes of transportation but clearly most of its personnel and efforts will be directed toward security at airports and of aircraft the following discussion analyzes atsas provisions for airport security funding air marshals cockpit security and other measures airport security atsa provides for federal oversight of airport security and requires that security screening personnel be federal employees although these screeners would be entitled to most standard federal employee benefits they can be dismissed at will and are prohibited from striking the law provides for oneyear transition to security force staffed
