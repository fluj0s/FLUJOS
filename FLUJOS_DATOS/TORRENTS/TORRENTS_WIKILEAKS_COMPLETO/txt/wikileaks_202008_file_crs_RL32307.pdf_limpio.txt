included the new york and new jersey harbor deepening pr oject restoration projects in the florida everglades and the side channels of the upper mississippi river system and projects to meet environmental requirements in th columbia river basin and the missouri river basin the presidents budget so funded three new projects that were determined to have high ec onomic and environmental retur n outside of these three projects there were other new constructi on starts because of the administrations concern with the funding needed to comp lete projects budgeted for construction in keeping with the administrations approach to reducing the agencys construction backlog the presidents budget limited fundi ng for planning to five new projects the request also focused the operation and maintenance funds for the inland waterways and harbors on projects s upporting high volume of traffic the corps announced in its budget briefing on february 2 2004 that it did not budget for the continued renourishment of shoreline stor m damage reduction projects indicating that it considered these costs as maintenance expenses to be borne by the nonfederal project sponsors this represented change from the corps past involvement with renourishment often at 50 federal cost share the budget also generally deemphasized shallo w draft harbors and waterways with low commercial use the

to existing shoreline protection policies that have not been specifically authorized by congress the bill does not fund the new study or construction starts re quested by the president it does fund some controversial construction projects including the dallas floodway extension and yazoo basin projects according to the conference report congress provided more funds for the popular continuing aut horities programs than requested by the administration the conference report also continued the recent trend of identifying specific priority projects for funding under these programs hr 4818 pl

of transforming ineel to be renamed idaho national labor atory into the nations leading center for nuclear power research the house approved funding increase of 512 million for total of 4638 million the benefits of nuclear power as clean reliable and affordable source of energy are key to economic and envi ronmental underpinnings of the us according to does budget justification however opponents ve criticized does nuclear research program as providing wast eful subsidies to an industry that they believe should be phased out as acceptably hazardous and economically uncompetitive within the nuclear energy budget the conference report provides 500 million for the nuclear power 2010 program which is focused on resolving the technical institutional and regulatory barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants by 2010 according to the doe budget justification the administration had sought 102 million for the program about half th fy2004 appropriation and third of the fy2003 level according to the doe budget justification the nuclear power 2010 program will enable an industry decision by 2005 to deploy at least one new advanced nuclear power plant in the us the current phase of the initiative includes site approval reactor design certif ication license applications detailed design work and development of improved construction techniques doe will pay up to half the cost of these activities the program is currently helping three utilities seek nrc approval for potential nuclear reactor sites in illinois mississippi and virginia in march and april of 2004 three industry consortia filed applications seeking total of 650 million over the next veral years to design nd license new nuclear power plants the nuclear plant licenses under the program would test the one step

should not issue new reactor licenses in the absence of reposito ry for spent nuclear fuel as discussed in later section the administrations funding request for does waste repository program created considerable friction w ith the house appropriations panel and contributed to the abse nce of senate markup the conference report includes 400 million for the generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative which focuses on moreadvanced reactors that could be deployed in the longer term the confer ence level is about the same as the amount approved by the house and 10 million above the administration requesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs17 the generation iv program is focusing on six advanced designs that could be deployed after 2010 two gas cooled one watercooled tw liquidmetalcooled and one moltensalt concept some of these reactors would use plutonium recovered through reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel the administrations may 2001 national energy policy report contends that plutonium r ecovery could reduce the longterm environmental impact of nuclear waste disposal and increase domestic energy supplies however opponents contend that the separation of plutonium from spent fuel poses unacceptable environmental risk s and because of plutoniums potential use in nuclear bombs undermines us policy on nuclear wea pons proliferation the development of plutoniumfueled reactors in the generation iv program is closely related to the nuclear energy programs advanced fuel cycle initiative afci for which the conference re port provides 680 million about

have been excluded from the omnibus with its programs funded instead through yearlong continuing resolution that would have ma intained funding at the fy2004 level the sticking point was over funding for yu cca mountain an underground repository for civilian nuclear waste which senator domenici the chairman of the senate energy and water development appropriations subcommittee favored for details on yucca mountain see the civilia n nuclear waste section in this report at the same time the house had voted to dr op funding for several nuclear weapons programs that representative hobson w ho chaired the house energy and water development appropriations subcommittee had strenuous ly opposed the senate had favored these weapons programs in the fy2004 budget cycle according to numerous press

that rnep would lower the threshol d for use of nuclear weapons and prompt other nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter us attack secretary rumsfeld said in 2003 that rnep is study it is nothing more and nothing less7 the study is examining feasibility and cost yet the fy2005 request seems to cast serious doubt on assertions th at rnep is only study beginning with the fy2005 budget cycle nnsa presented detailed fouryear pr ojection along with the current request for rnep the figures are fy2005 276 million fy2006 950 million fy2007 1454 million fy2008 1284 million and fy2009 884 million for fiveyear total of 4847 llion8 along with the increase the plan shows rnep starting assuming congre ssional authorization development engineering in which the nuclear weapons laboratories produce completed warhead design in fy2007 and production engineering in which the design is adapted for production and system to manufactur the weapon is created in fy2009 an nnsa manager responsible for the program maintained that the budget increase beyond fy2005 is an artifact of the budget process9 he stated that the money was inserted in the out years as placeholder to protect the option of proceeding with rnep were this not done it is argued that nnsa would face two choices that it deems unsatisfactory 1 by the time the budget for one fiscal year is submitted the budget for the next fiscal year is largely fixed without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could not be implemented until the second fiscal year 2 alternatively w ithout the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could be impleme nted promptly only by taking the needed funds out of other programs similarly the move to development engineering and production engineering reflects how the program might be expected to advance if it proceeds the official however indicated that d ecision has been made on whether or not to proceed with rnep pending completion of the study the rnep study was initially projected to cost 45 million 15 million year for fy2003fy2005 but each years numbers have changed for fy2003 delay in submission of dod study re quired by the fy2003 national defense authorization act

in the st udy by y12 plant which would make components of rn ep or of pantex plant which would convert existing weapons into rneps their participa tion adds some 2 million doe has imposed additional project manageme nt requirements that add 2 million the rest of the increase comes from better definition of the requirements of the study refinement of cost estimates and an increase in surety safety security and use control of the proposed wea pon on the latter point doe requires that any modifications of nuclear weapon look for ways to increase its surety10 nnsa says it has found ways to increase rnep surety and plans to do so the two armed services committees recommended providing the full amount requested for rnep for fy2005 276 million and house nd senate floor amendments to delete such funding we re rejected in contrast the house appropriations committee eliminated rnep and aci funds for fy2005 it saw these two programs as diversion of res ources from the most serious issues that confront the management of the nati ons nuclear deterrent and remained unconvinced by does assurances that rn ep is only study and aci is only to develop weapon design skills it found th at doe actions left little doubt that the objective of the program rnep and aci was to advance the most extreme new nuclear weapon goals irrespective of an reservations expr essed by congress accordingly the committee directs the nnsa to focus wholly on its primary mission of maintaining the safety security and viability of the existing stockpile as part of the compromise discussed ear lier the omnibus bill eliminated funds for rnep and aci aci has also been controversial critics claimed that its purpose was to develop lowyield mininuke that would make nuclear weapons more usable supporters responded that aci was not working on mininuke and that aci would help develop and maintain weapons design expertise the administration requested 90 million for aci for fy2005 the house provided funds for it for reasons just noted the house appropriations committee stat ed that its priorities are maintaining the stockpile and countering wmd prolif eration and found that does obsession with launching new round of nuclear wea pons development runs counter to those priorities while the omnibus bill provide d funds for aci the conference report stated that the same amount is made available for the reliable replacement warhead program to improve the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their componentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs26 campaigns these are multiyear multifunctional efforts that provide specialized scientific knowle dge and technical support to the directed stockpile work on the nuclear weapons stockpile for fy2005 there are six campaigns each of which has multiple components science engineering inertial confinement fusion and high yield advanced simulation and computing pit manufacturing and certification and readiness the house appropriations committee commended nnsa for great progress in budgeting by weapons type eg the amount requested for extending the life of the w80 warhead on the other hand it expressed its concern that nnsas accounting system still did not provide th full cost of weapon refurbishments because it did not assign the cost of campaigns to specific warhead types accordingly the committee directs the nnsa to assign the associated life extension costs by weapons type associated with each campaign pit manufacturing and certification campaign this is perhaps the most controversial campaign at present it may remain so for some years because one component of it is facility that may cost several billion dollars and is scheduled to start initial operations in fy2019 and ot her components of the campaign involve restoring us ability to manufacture pits critical nuclear weapon part pits are the fissile cores of nuclear warheads that tri gger the thermonuclear secondary stage doe has had facility to produce pits for use in stockpiled weapons since it suspended pit production at the rocky flats plant co in 1989 as result the united states has been unable to make allnew nuclear warheads of existing or advanced new designs see crs report rl31993 nuclear warhead pit production background and issues for congress for fy2005 this campaign has five components 1 w88 pit manufacturing when rocky flats suspended production it was making pits for the w88 warhead for the trident ii missile nnsa has established facility at alamos national laboratory that is producing these pits at low rate with target of 10 to 20 pits year by fy2007 2 w88 pit certification additiona l scientific work is underway to provide confidence without nuclear testing that the alamos pits will work as intended these pits cannot be certified for use in the stockpile until they meet the standards being developed 3 pit manufacturing capability this component will establish technologies to manufacture pits other than for the w88 4 modern pit facility mpf nnsa maintains that pits will ultimately develop defects as result of aging and other unanticipated problems so that higher capacity will be needed in the future further it is argue d since it would take many years to complete highercapacity facility work on it must begin promptly accordingly it is planning for mpf which would be new facility first operational in fy2019 with cap acity of at least 125 pits per year it might cost 2 billion to 4 billion critics maintain that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs27 plutonium component of pit whic h is by far the most difficult to fabricate is likely to deteriorate very slowly and perhaps in way that would not impair weapon perform ance they fu rther state that the need for the facility is unclear given anticipated reductions in nuclear weapons and that mpf is pr oceeding at too rapid pace to address these questions nnsa is conducting accelerated aging experiments in which plutonium of the type used in pit is mixed with greaterthanusual amount of more radioactive plutonium isotope to simulate more quickly the effects of aging 5 pit campaign support activitie s at nevada test site nnsa plans to conduct certain experiments at nevada test site to support w88 pit certification this campaign has attracted much c ongressional interest for fy2002 the house appropriations committee asserted that doe cannot s how that it has viable plan to manufacture and certify p its on the schedule dictated by national security needs criticized the project as years behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over the original cost estimate and stated that it would judge nnsas success on how well the pit project succeeds hrept 107112 the senate appropriations committee viewed the thencu rrent schedule which would not certify pit for use in the stockpile until fy2009 as unacceptable srept 10739 in its fy2003 report the senate ppropriations committee stated that it remains greatly concerned about the nns as refusal to reque st funds consistent with its own project plan submitted less than 1 year ago because this was not done the committee has been forced to reduce other items in the budget the final appropriation provided more funds than requested according to the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference the increase will ensure that the nnsa maintains its commitment to produce cer tifiable w88 pit by 2003 and certified w88 pit by 2007 for fy2004 the administration requested substantial increase to items in this campaign the house appropriations co mmittee saw the campaign as proceeding too quickly it recommended reducing the request for this campaign substantially it praised nnsa and alamos nationa l laboratory for turning around this campaign but urged nnsa to reduce costs it stated that the current plan would aggressively pursue multibillion dollar modern pit facility before the first production pit has even been successfully certified for use in the stockpile and recommended less aggressive planning approach to mpf the senate appropriations committee recommended the amount requested for this campaign the feinstein amendment samdt 1655 discussed under dsw which was tabled would have barred use of funds for mpf s ite selection confer ees provided the full amount requested for manufacturing and cer tifying the w88 pit but reduced mpf funding from 228 million to 108 million the conferees agree with the house report that until the congress reviews the revised future stockpile plan it is premature to pursue further decisions regarding the modern pit facility the fy2005 request with fy2004 funding in parentheses includes 1320 million 1250 million for w88 pit ma nufacturing 1015 million

the future mpf requirements as functi on of the 2012 stockpile and the expanded ta55 production capability are determined ta55 is the facility at alamos used for making pits in contrast it favored accelerating efforts to expand capability at ta55 as nearterm hedge accordingly the committee commended alamoss work to restore pit manuf acturing capability at ta55 adding 100 million to w88 pit manufacturing to acceler ate this work and eliminated the 298 million requested for mpf it provide d the amount requested for w88 pit certification and for pit campaign support activities at nevada

said that nations with nuclear weapons have responsibility to see that they are safe and reliable to the extent that can be done without testing clearly that is the prefer ence and that is why the

point on nuclear testing we continue to oppose ctbt comprehensive test ban treaty ratif ication we also tinue to adhere to testing moratorium13 of particular interest is readiness to conduct nucl ear test since fy1996 us policy has been that nnsa or doe prior to nnsas establishment should be ready to conduct nuclear test within 24 to 36 months from the time the order is given several studies identified work needed to reduce this time to 18 months these studies were funded by enhanced test readiness the fy2004 budget document stated the dod and the nnsa agreed to tr ansition to an 18month

which would have made this separation unnecessary accordingly the two accounts were expected to be merged into tes t readiness beginning in fy2004 depending on congressional language though the fy2004 nnsa budget request level did not reflect that merger the fy2003 appropriation for enhan ced test readiness was 150 million conferees on the consolidated appropria tions resolution for fy2003 directed

proposal does not address the fundamental di fficulties in maintaining test readiness during testing moratorium and noted that it took 1824 months to conduct fullyinstrumented test during the era of routine testing so that proposal to maintain indefinitely an 18 month posture during the testing moratorium reflects disturbing cost is object perspective finally even though nnsa and dod decided to

administering the production of nuclear w eapons and managing ra dioactive and other hazardous wastes in later years doe expanded its efforts to include the environmental restoration of radioactiv sites and those with other hazardous contamination in buildings soil and water to ensure their safety for future uses in 1989 the first bush administration blished the envir onmental management program within doe to consolidate the agencys efforts in cleaning up contamination from defense nuclear waste and civilian nuclear energy research doe is responsible for complying with numerous federal envi ronmental laws and regulations in administering the current program and is subject to fines and penalties for violations of these requirements consequen tly doe has signed numerous legally binding compliance agreements with the environmental protection agency and the states to perform cleanup activ ities and dispose of wastes according to specific deadlines doe reports that there are 114 geogra phic sites in 31 states and one us territory where the production of nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy research and development activities resulted in radi oactive and other hazardous contamination together these sites occupy approximately 2 million acres which is equivalent to the land area of rhode island and delaware co mbined doe reports that all response actions were complete at 76 sites as of the end of fy2003 at cost of approximately 70 billion doe expects cleanup to be comple at 3 additional sites by the end of fy2005 however most of the sites that have been cleaned up thus far are relatively small and are among the least hazardous the sites where cleanup remains underway contai n some of the most seve rely contaminated areas doe estimates that cleanup at the remain ing sites will not be complete until 2035 at cost of 142 billion doe had previ ously estimated that cleanup would not be complete until later date of 2070 at higher cost of 192 billion doe has substantially revised its ear lier estimates of cl eanup time frames and costs as part of its cleanup reform initia tive doe launched this initiative in fy2003 and has signed letters of intent with th environmental protection agency and the states to accelerate cl eanup at its major sites doe also has prepared performance management plans for many of its s ites which outline how cleanup would be accelerated and costs reduced acco rding to doe these goals would be accomplished by assessing the risk of ex posure to determine which cleanup remedies are selected risk is currently one of many factors that doe uses to select cleanup remedies altering the current process to use risk as the primary factor could result in decisions to contain waste on site as means of preventing exposure rather than removing it whereas containment can often be accomplished more quickly and athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs36 less cost the possibility of future exposure remains if the method of containment fails over time although there has been widespread concern about the amount of time and money needed to clean up nuclear waste site s questions have been raised as to how doe would use riskbased approach to accomplish its goals of faster and less costly cleanups without weakening envir onmental protection some have drawn attention to the possibility that more contamination may be left on site rather than removed because of the substantial am ount of time required for certain types of radioactivity to decay arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate in unexpected ways over the longterm and result in pathways of exposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally selected others counter that completely removing radioactive contamina tion from all sites to permit unrestricted future land use and eliminate all future pathways of exposure would not be economically feasible nd in some cases would be beyond the capabilities of current cleanup technologies does cleanup reform initiative woul d continue in fy2005 with funding provided under five accounts these account s include two for site acceleration completion one for defense and one fo r nondefense which fund efforts to complete cleanup and close contaminated f acilities at faster pace than previously scheduled there also are two environmental services accounts one for defense and one for nondefense as well which fund ac tivities that indirectly support the mission of accelerated cleanup and clos ure such as policy development and coordination and the integration of mission ac tivities across the complex of sites fifth account for the uranium enrichment decontaminati on and decommissioning fund supports the cleanup of uranium enrichment plants nd uranium and thorium processing sites which previously had been include d in an account entitled uranium fac ilities maintenance nd remediation defense sites have traditiona lly received the vast majo rity of funding under the environmental management program of the 751 b illion appropriation for the program in omnibus hr 4818 pl 108 447 610 billion would be allocated to the defense site acceleration comp letion account and 938 million would be allocated to the defense environmental services account the nondefense site acceleration completion account would receive 152 million and the nondefense environmental services account w ould receive 291 million the uranium enrichment decontamination and d ecommissioning fund would receive 499 million although the total appropriation for these five accounts would be 798 billion this amount is offset by 463 million in federal contribution to the uranium fund which yields total amount of 751 b illion for the environmental management program in fy2005 subject to an acrosstheboard rescission of 80 as noted above the most controversial issue regard ing funding for the environmental management program in fy2005 was does highlevel waste proposal for which the presidents budget proposed to set aside 350 million out of the defense site acceleration completion account u nder this proposal doe would speed the closure of tanks storing highlevel radio active and other chemical wastes at the hanford site in washington state the sava nnah river site in south carolina and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs37 15 department of

oactive wastes must be removed and safely stored in centralized geologic repository as required by the nuclear waste policy act nwpa for more info rmation see crs report rl32163 radioactive waste streams an overview of waste classification for disposal by anthony andrews doe has proposed to speed the closure of the tanks at these three sites by classifying some of the waste as incidenta l to reprocessing and to dispose of it as lowlevel waste by mixing and immobilizing it with cement grout inside the tank doe issued this proposal under an internal agency order order 435115 some members of congress states environmental organizations and communities opposed does proposal arguing that none of the tank wastes should be allowed to remain in place because of the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughly with the waste to contain it safely and prev ent leaks however others asserted that methods to remove all of the tank residues would genera new hazardous waste stream that would need to be managed properly to prevent exposure there also could be significant risks of exposure to workers who would remove the residues thus far doe has grouted highlevel ra dioactive wastes in two tanks at the savannah river site the natural resources defens council nrdc legally challenged does authority to dispose of these wastes in this manner in 2003 the us district court for idaho ruled that doe does not have the authority to classify the tank wastes at the savanna h river site or any other site as anything other than highlevel radioactive waste16 consequently these wastes would have to be removed and disposed of in centralized geologic repository as required by the nwpa doe appealed the 2003 ruling and on november 5 2004 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the above district court opinion ruling that the challenge to order 4351 was not ripe for review17 the court found that the district court decision predated doe pplication of order 4351 to particular situation and thus there was present conflict with the nwpa18 the court determined that while it was possible that doe might violate the nwpa at some point it might just as likely comply with all applicable law19 thus under the terms of the circuit court opinion doe may gage in activities pursuant to order 4351 and nrdc or others then would be free to bring suit if they believe those activities violate the lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs38 20 see eg tva v hill 437 us 153 1978 robertson v seattle audubon society 503 us 429 1992 aflcio v campbell 659 f2d 157 160 dccir dec 18 1980prior to the appeals court ruling the secretary of energy asked congress to enact legislation that would provide doe w ith statutory authority to classify some of the tank wastes as incidental to repro cessing at hanford sa vannah river and the ineel thereby exempting them from disposal requirements for highlevel radioactive waste in the nwpa whether th wastes could be left in the tanks and grouted in place would ultimately depend on the concurrence of state regulatory agencies who issue the permits for tank closures congress included authority in the r onald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 for doe to grout some of the tank wastes at savannah river and the ineel however the authority was not extended to hanford where most of the leaking ta nks are located as noted above doe still may pursue the grouting of tanks at nford under order 4351 but could be subject to legal challenge at that site f or further discussion see crs report rs21988 radioactive tank wastes disposal authority in the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 coordinated by david bearden from the appropriation for the defense site acceleration completion account hr 4818 pl 108447 would provide 292 million of the 350 million that the administration requested for its high level waste proposal of the 292 million 163 million would be allocated to the savannah river site in south carolina for projects to prepare for the grouting of tank wastes and 97 million would be allocated to the ineel in idaho for such projects the rema ining appropriation of 32 million would be allocated to hanford in washington state however it appears questionable whether this appropriation for hanford wo uld be sufficient legal authority to permit the grouting of tank wastes at that site as the waste disposal authority in pl 108375 does not include washington state there are differing court rulings regard ing whether an appropriation of funding by congress for specific activity alone provides sufficient authority for an agency to carry out that activity absent authority provided in other statutes or in apparent contradiction of preexisting authority in short congress can effectively validate otherwise unauthorized or unlawful acti on in an appropriations act by clearly indicating that it intends to alter or repeal preexisting law in addition to funding an activity whether an appropriation for specific activity constitutes an authorization may be subject to some argument and possible legal challenge unless congress explicitly addresses the authority in question20 the conference report language allocating an appropriation of 32 million for waste incidental to reprocessing activities at the hanford site in fy2005 doe s not expressly mention the grouting of tank wastes raising the question of the aut hority for the use of this disposal method at that site in addition to the issue of how to dis pose of radioactive tank wastes there also has been ongoing concern in congress bout the feasibility of does overall plans to accelerate cleanup and lower costs at the 114 sites across the country that make up the former defense nuclear weapons comple x prior to the conference agreement onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs39 hr 4818 pl 108447 the house appropr iations committee noted in its report on hr 4614 hrept 108554 that recent delays in cleanup schedules and cost overruns of certain projects raise questi ons regarding does ability to accelerate cleanup the committee also raised concerns regarding does delay in submitting report to congress on statutory changes that may be necessary to allow accelerated cleanup to proceed and the need for agreements with the states on all elements of the performance management plans for each s ite these plans outline how accelerated cleanup would be accomplished in addition to funding for the envi ronmental manageme nt program the conference agreement on hr 4818 pl 108447 would ppropriate 78 million for does office of legacy management the administration had requested 66 million the same as the fy2004 appropriati on of the amount in hr 4818 pl 108447 47 million would be allocated to defense sites and the remaining 31 million to nondefens sites congress provided the funding for doe to establish this office in the energy and water development appropriations act for fy2004 pl 108137 the primary function of the office is to assess longterm stewardship needs once cleanup is complete to ensure that does cleanup actions continue to be effective in the future these planning assumptions are currently based on time frame of 150 years doe previously administered these responsibilities under multiple elements of its environmental management program civilian nuclear waste considerable controversy erupted over the bush administrations fy2005 budget request for the doe civilian nuclear waste disposal program although the programs proposed budget totaled 880 million 50 boost over fy2004 the administration also proposed that 749 million be offset by revenue from the existing nuclear waste fee so that the net appropriation would be only 131 million the house appropriations committee noting that congress had not enacted the administrations wastefee offset propos voted to provide only the 131 million net appropriation re quest rather than cut other prog rams to make up the difference the controversy contributed to decision by the senate appropriations committees energy and water devel opment subcommittee against holding markup on the fy2005 funding bill at one point it appear ed that the energy and water bill would be left out of the omnibus spending b ill but compromise was ultimately reached to give the doe waste program 5770 million the same as the fy2004 funding level the administrations proposed spending in crease was intended primarily to pay for designing national nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain nevada and for developing national waste transporta tion program doe contends that funding for the waste program run by the office of civilian radioactive waste management ocrwm must average 13 billion per year between fy2005 and fy2010 to meet the current 2010 target date for sh ipping nuclear waste to yucca m ountain that target date was largely dependent on does plans to submit repository license application to the nuclear regulatory commission by the end of 2004 which doe recently announced would be delayed until 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32307crs40 in addition to the 880 million request for the civilian waste disposal program the administration had planned in fy2005 to transfer responsibility for doeowned spent fuel to new office of doe spen t fuel management which would report to the ocrwm director the 225 million request for the new office brought the total fy2005 request for ocrwm to 9075 million however the conference report did not include the proposed transfer the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa pl 97425 as amended names yucca mountain as the sole candidate site for national geologic repository congress passed an approval resolution in july 2000 hjres 87 pl 107200 that authorized the yucca mountain project to proceed to the licensing phase fy2005 funding in the conference report fo r the office of civilian radioactive waste management comes from two appropriations accounts first 3460 million is appropriated from the nuclear waste fund which consists of fees paid by nuclear utilities second 2310 million would be ppropriated from gene ral revenues under the defense nuclear waste di sposal account which pays fo r disposing of highlevel waste from the nuclear weapons progra m in the planned civilian repository the house appropriations committee excoriated the administration for requesting net appropria tion of only 131 million and for assuming that congress would enact the wastefee offset proposal in time at best the office of management and budget omb made an unwise budget calculation to assume this offset said the committee report at worst omb took foolish political gamble by assuming that reclassification legisl ation would be enacted this year the house panel warned in its report that the funding cutback would have far reaching consequences for the nuclear wa ste program but that there was funding available under the budget
