from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to ed cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu subject re your letter to science date fri 12 apr 2002 173533 0400 cc malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu esperwslch kbriffaueaacuk tosbornueaacuk pjonesueaacuk tcrowleydukeedu rbradleygeoumassedu jtouarizonaedu srutherfordvirginiaedu dear ed tom keith etc in keeping w the spirit of toms and keiths emails i wanted to stress before we all break for the weekend that this is ultimately about the science its not personal if my comments seemed to assail eg keiths motives or integrity etc i believe that they were misunderstood as i tried to clarify that in my previous message but i can see that there was potential for misunderstanding of my message precision in wording is very important given the high levels of sensitivity in this debate so i wanted to leave uncertainty about that and of course i very much apologize to keith and tim if they took them my comments that way they again were most decidedly not intended that way i hope we can resolve the scientific issues objectively and wout injecting or any personal feelings into any of this there are some substantial scientific differences here lets let them play out the way they are supposed to objectively and in the peer reviewed literature enjoy the weekend all cheers mike at 0135 pm 41202 0400 ed cook wrote hi mike tom etc okay i am quite happy to give this debate rest although i am sure that the issues brought up will still be grounds for scientific debate i admit to getting bit riled when i saw the ecs results on the mwp described as perilous because i regard that as being an unfair characterization of the work presented be that as it may my reply to science will be very carefully worded so as not to inflame the issues nuff said have good weekend i certainly intend to do so ed ed and others i thought i too should chime in here one last time ill leave it to you malcolm keith and others to debate out the issue of any additional uncertainties biases etc that might arise from rcs in the presence of limited samples that is beyond my range of expertise but since this is new and relatively untested approach and it is on the basis of this approach that other estimates are being argued to be underestimates we would indeed have been remiss now to point this out in our letter the wording perilous perhaps should be changed by i very much stand by the overall sentiment expressed by malcolm in our piece with regard to rcs one very important additional point that malcolm makes in his message is that conservative estimates of uncertainties appropriate additional caveats etc were indeed all provided in mbh99 and i have always been careful to interpret our results in the context of these uncertainties and caveats ipcc 2001 was careful to do so to and based its conclusions within the context of the uncertainties hence the choice of the conservative term likely in describing the apparently unprecedented nature of late 20th century warmth and moreover on the collective results of many independent reconstructions briffa osborn would have you believe that ipcc 2001s conclusions in this regard rested on mbh99 alone frankly keith and tim i believe that is unfair to the ipcc whether or not one cares about being fair to mbh or not what is unfortunate here then is that esper et has been spun i to argue that mbh99 underestimates the quantity it purports to estimate full northern hemisphere annual mean temperature given the readily acknowledged level of uncertainty in both estimates combined with the apples and oranges nature of the comparison between the two which i have sought to clarify in my letter to science and in my messages to you all and the comparison plot i provided i believe it is either sloppy or disingenuous reasoning to argue that this is the case the fact that this sloppiness also readily serves the interests of the skeptics is quite unfortunate but it is indeed beside the point it would probably also be helpful for to point out without naming names that many of our most prominent colleagues in the climate research community as well government funding agency representatives have personally contacted over the past few weeks to express their dismay at the way they believe this study was spun i wont get into the blame game because theres more than enough of that to go around but when the leaders of our scientific research community and our funding managers personally alert us that they believe the credibility of our field has been damaged i think it is time for some serious reflection on this episode thats my final 2 cents mike at 1021 am 41202 0400 ed cook wrote just few comments here and then im done dear ed and mike and others all of our attempts so far to estimate hemispherescale temperatures for the period around 1000 years ago are based on far fewer data than any of us would like none of the datasets used so far has anything like the geographical distribution that experience with recent centuries indicates we need and noone has yet found convincing way of validating the lowerfrequency components of them against independent data as ed wrote in the treering records that form the backbone of most of the published estimates the problem of poor replication near the beginnings of records is particularly acute and ubiquitous i would suggest that this problem probably cuts in closer to 1600 than 1400 in the several published series therefore i accept that everything we are doing is preliminary and should be treated with considerable caution therefore i would guess that you would apply the word perilous to everyones largescale nh reconstructions covering the past 5001000 years including those that you have been involved in why the sudden increase in caution now it sounds very selfserving to for you to call ecs perilous and not describe every other largescale reconstruction in that way as well i differ from ed and his coauthors in believing that these problems have special significance for the particular implementation of rcs they used in the light of one of their conclusions that depends heavily on that implementation as i understand what ed keith and hal fritts have written at various times about rcs and from my own limited experience with the method it is extremely important to have strong replication and i dont see 5070 samples probably from 2535 trees as big sample for reference most chronologies used in dendroclimatology are based on 1040 trees that is 2080 samples at 2 cores per tree for single site usually few hectares here are two passages from briffa et 1992 page 114 column 1 last paragraph for chronology composed of the same number of samples one would therefore expect larger statistical uncertainty using this approach than in chronology produced using standardization curves fitted to the data from individual treesthe rcs method therefore requires greater chronology depth ie greater sample replication to provide the same level of confidence in its representation of the hypothetical true chronology ecs mention this issue as i said in my previous email we hid nothing in terms of the uncertainty concerning the pre1200 interval are you suggesting that we should not have even shown those results if so that is ridiculous page 114 column 1 third paragraph there is discussion of the problems arising from applying rcs when pith age is not known in the ringwidth data the final standardization curve probably slightly underestimates the width of young trees and could therefore impart small positive bias to the standardized ringwidth indices for young rings in number of series however this effect will be insignificant when the biased indices are realigned according to calendar growth years and averaged with many other series the problem here is that this latter condition is not met in my view and the small positive bias that may be retained could turn out to be important to the most controversial conclusion of ecs the medieval question i cant speak for jan here but most of the data he used came from schweingrubers lab i believe that pains were taken to estimate the pith offset and that jan used this information in his rcs analyses jan would be best to comment here in any case jan has done number of experiments in which he has artificially added large pith offset errors into the rcs analysis and the resulting bias is small so i do not believe that your view is correct i also suspect that keith and colleagues underestimated both the size and variability of the loss of years at the beginning of records but the point stands even if this is not so so far as i can see ecs do not mention this issue at least in the context of possible positive bias are you claiming that the only possible bias is positive i can show you examples of probable negative bias using rcs the discussion of rcs in the supplementary materials seems to assume good replication it was generic description of the method the replication is clearly shown in the supplementary materials section as well as in the main paper if you dont like the replication that is your opinion i would love to have more replication as well who wouldnt but we did show the uncertainties which you seem to ignore in your criticism ironically the ecs estimates of warmth in the mwp are not that dissimilar to those seen in mbh as ecs fig 3 shows are the mbh estimates of mwp warmth also similarly biased ecs as ed rightly points out clearly indicate in both words and diagrams at several points in their paper and in the supplementary materials that the number of sites and number of samples they used decreases sharply before 1200 even so ecs gives prominence second sentence of the abstract for example to the reconstruction in that very period and makes comparison with the magnitude of 20thcentury warming all the methods and their realizations so far have significant problems in our letter mike and i we draw attention to specific problem with this implementation of rcs that has special bearing on the reconstruction of period to which ecs have drawn attention hence the strong note of caution about the ecs conclusion on the comparison between the 10th11th and late 20th centuries i hope its clear from this that i dont disagree with the general proposition that all existing reconstructions of hemipspherescale temperatures 1000 years ago or even for all the first half of the second millennium ad should be viewed as very preliminary if anyone is interested i attach short note on the replication in the year ad 1000 of records used in mbh99 to give an idea of what we are up against there is obviously lot more we can debate about here i will simply stop here by saying that i stand by the results shown in ecs and will say so in my reply to your letter pointing out that the use of the word perilous could be just as easily be applied to mbh we all have lot to do i see four important tasks 1 more investigation of the strengths and limitations of methods like rcs and agebanding for example how many samples would have been enough in this case does the rc change through time and so on 2 use of tree ring records where the loss of lowfrequency information is least those with long segments from open stands 3 the search for treering parameters without agesize related trend 4 the development of completely independent proxies with intrinsically better low frequency fidelity cheers malcolm the briffa et reference is to the 1992 paper climate dynamics 7111119 hi ed okthanks for your response ill let malcolm respond to the technical issues regarding rc im not really qualified to do so myself anyway your other points are well taken cheers mike at 1209 pm 41102 0400 edward cook wrote hi mike thanks for the reply i too do not want to see anything personal in our disagreements it would be shame if it got to that and it shouldnt i dont think that the science we are talking about is sufficiently known yet to claim the truth which is why we are having some of our disagreements i mainly wanted to clarify some issues relating to some criticisms of the ecs results that i thought were not totally fair my biggest complaint is with malcolms contribution to your letter because it really isnt fair to use such words as perilous ecs did not hide anything and the uncertainties are clearly indicated in egs figs 2 and 3 so you can make your own judgement however malcolms opinion does not invalidate the ecs record if malcolms statement is correct than all previous estimates of nh temperature over the past 1000 years are perilous especially before ad 1400 when the number of series available declines significantly in most records ed ed it will take some time to digest these comments but my initial response is one of some disappointment i will resist the temptation to make the letter to science available to the others on this list because of my fears of violating the embargo policy i know examples of where doing so has led to science retracting piece form publication so thanks for also resisting the temptation to do so but i must point out that the piece by malcolm and is very similar in its content to the letter of clarification that you and i originally crafted to send to science some weeks ago before your coauthor objected to your involvement if there is objection on your part id be happy to send that to everyone because it is not under consideration in science quite unfortunate development as far as im concerned the only real change from that version is the discussion of the use of rcs that is in large part malcolms contribution but i stand behind what malcolm says i think there are some real sins of omission with regard to the use of rcs too and it would be an oversight on our part now to comment on these finally with regard to the scaling issues let simply attach plot which speaks more loudly than several pages possibly could the plot takes epser et not smoothed but the annual values and scales it against the full northern hemisphere instrumental record 18561990 annual mean record and compares against the entire 20th century instrumental record 18561999 as well as with mbh99 and its uncertainties suppose that esper et is indeed representative of the fullnorthern hemisphere annual mean as mbh99 purports to be to the extent that differences emerge between the two in assuming such scaling i interpret them as differences which exist due to the fact that the extratropical northern hemisphere series and full northern hemisphere series likely did not covary in the past the same way they covary in the 20th century when both are driven predominantly in relative sense by anthropogenic forcing rather than natural forcing and internal variability what the plot shows is quite remarkable scaled in this way there is remarkably little difference between esper et and mbh99 in the first place the two reconstructions are largely within the error estimates of mbh99 but moreover where they do differ this could be explainable in terms of patterns of enhanced midlatitude continental response that were discussed for example in shindell et 2001 in science last december so i think this plot says lot its say that there are some statistically significant differences but certainly grounds to use esper et to contradict mbh99 or ipcc 2001 as sadly i believe at least one of the published pieces tacitly appears to want to do it is shame that such plot which i think is far more meaningful comparison of the two records was not shown in either esper et or the briffa osborn commentary ive always given the group of you adequate opportunity for commentary on anything were about to publish in nature or science i am saddened that many of my colleagues and i have always liked to think friends didnt affort the same opportunity before this all erupted in our face it could have been easily avoided but thats water under the bridge finally before any more backandforths on this i want to make sure that everyone involved understands that none of this was in any way ever meant to be personal at least not on my part and if it ever has at least on my part seemed that way than i offer my apologiesit was never intended that way this is completely about the science to the extent that i andor others feel that the science has been misrepresented in places however i personally will work very hard to make sure that more balanced view is available to the community especially because the implications are so great in this case this is what i sought to do w the nyt piece and my npr interview and that is what ive sought to do and malcolm to as far as im concerned with the letter to science being bit sloppy w wording and omission etc is something were all guilty of at times but i do consider it somewhat unforgivable when it is obvious how that sloppiness can be exploited and you all know exactly what im talking about so in short i think are some fundamental issues over which were in disagreement and where those exist i will not shy away from pointing them out but i hope that is not misinterpreted as in any way personal i hope that suffices mike ps it seemed like an omission to not cc in peck and scott rutherford on this exchange so ive done that i hope nobody minds this addition at 1057 am 41102 0400 edward cook wrote hi mike and malcolm i have received the letter that you sent to science and will respond to it here first in some detail and later in edited and condensed form in science since much of what you comment and criticize on has been disseminated to number of people in your mikes somewhat inflammatory earlier emails i am also sending this lengthy reply out to everyone on that same email list save those at science i hadnt responded in detail before but do so now because your criticisms will soon be in the public domain however i am not attaching your letter to science to this email since that is not yet in the public domain it is up to you to send out your submitted letter to everyone if you wish i must say at the beginning that some parts of your letter to science are as flawed as your claims about esper et hereafter ecs the briffaosborn perspectives piece points out an important scaling issue that indeed needs further examination however to claim as you do that they show that the ecs 40year lowpass temperature reconstruction is flawed begs the question flawed by how much it is not at all clear that scaling the annually resolved rcs chronology to annually resolved instrumental temperatures first before smoothing is the correct way to do it the ecs series was never created to examine annual or even decadal timescale temperature variability rather as was clearly indicated in the paper it was created to show how one can preserve multicentennial climate variability in certain long treering records as refutation of broeckers truly flawed essay as ecs showed in their paper table 1 the high frequency correlations with nh mean annual temperatures after 20year highpass filtering is only 015 that result was expected and it makes meaningful difference if one uses only extra tropical nh temperature data so while the amplitude of the temperaturescaled 40year low pass ecs series might be on the high end but still plausible given the gridded borehole temperature record shown in briffaosborn scaling on the annually resolved data first would probably have the opposite effect of excessively reducing the amplitude i am willing to accept an intermediate value but probably not low enough to satisfy you really the more important result from ecs is the enhanced pattern of multi centennial variability in the nh extratropics over the past 1100 years we can argue about the amplitude later but the enhanced multicentennial variability can not be easily dismissed i should also point out again that you saw fig 3 in ecs before it was even submitted to science and never pointed out the putative scaling flaw to at that time with regards to the issue of the late 20th century warming the fact that i did not include some reference to or plot of the uptodate instrumental temperature data cf briffaosborn is what i regard as of omission what i said was that the estimated temperatures during the mwp in ecs approached those in the 20th century portion of that record up to 1990 i dont consider the use of approached as an egregious overstatement but i do agree with you that i should have been bit more careful in my wording there as you know i have publicly stated that i never intended to imply that the mwp was as warm as the late 20th century eg my new york times interview however it is bit of overkill to state twice in the closing sentences of the first two paragraphs of your letter that the ecs results do not refute the unprecedented late 20th century warming i would suggest that once is enough ecs were also very clear about the extratropical nature of their data so what you say in your letter about the reduced amplitude in your series coming from the tropics while perhaps worth pointing out again is beating dead horse however i must say that the of omission in the briffaosborn piece concerning the series shown in their plot is bit worrying as they say in the data file of series used in their plot and in keiths april 5 email response to you briffaosborn only used your land temperature estimates north of 20 degrees and recalibrated the mean of those estimates to the same domain of landonly instrumental temperatures using the same calibration period for all of the other non borehole series in the same way i would have preferred it if they had used your data north of 30n to make the comparisons bit more oneto one however i still think that their results are interesting in particular they reproduce much of the reduced multicentennial temperature variability seen in your complete nh reconstruction so if the amplitude of scaled ecs multicentennial variability is far too high as you would apparently suggest it appears that it is also too low in your estimates for the nh extratropics north of 20n i think that we have to stop being so aggressive in defending our series and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each in order to improve them that is the way that science is supposed to work i must admit to being really irritated over the criticism of the ecs treering data standardized using the rcs method first of all ecs acknowledged up front the declining available data prior to 1200 and its possible effect on interpreting an mwp in the mean record ecs also showed bootstrap confidence intervals for the mean of the rcs chronologies and showed where the chronologies drop out even allowing for the reduction in the number of represented sites before 1400 ecs fig 2d and the reduction in overall sample size ecs fig 2b there is still some evidence for significantly above average growth during two intervals that can be plausibly assigned to the mwp of course we would like to have had all 14 series cover the past 10001200 years this doesnt mean that we cant usefully examine the data in the more weakly replicated intervals in any case the replication in the mwp of the ecs chronology is at least as good as in other published treering estimates of largescale temperatures eg nh extratropical covering the past 1000 years it also includes more long treering records from the nh temperate latitudes than ever before so to state that this is perilous basis for an estimate of temperature on such large geographic scale is disingenuous especially when it is unclear how many millennialong series are contributing the majority of the temperature information in the mannbradleyhughes mbh reconstruction prior to ad 1400 lets be balanced here i basically agree with the closing paragraph of your letter the ecs record was never intended to refute mbh it was intended first and foremost to refute broeckers essay in science that unfairly attacked tree rings to this extent ecs succeeded very well the comparison of ecs with mbh was logical thing to do given that it has been accepted by the ipcc as the benchmark reconstruction of nh annual temperature variability and change over the past millennium several other papers have made similar comparisons between mbh and other even more geographically restricted estimates of past temperature so i dont apologize in the slightest for doing so in ecs the correlations in table 2 between ecs and mbh were primarily intended to demonstrate the probable largescale lowfrequency temperature signal in ecs independent of explicitly calibrating the individual rcs chronologies before aggregating them the results should actually have pleased you because for the 20200 year band ecs and mbh have correlations of 060 to 068 depending on the period used given that ecs is based on great deal of new data not used in mbh this result validates to reasonable degree the temperature signal in mbh in the 20200 year band over the past 1000 years given the incendiary and sometimes quite rude emails that came out at the time when ecs and briffaosborn were published i could also go into the whole complaint about how the review process at science was flawed i will only say that this is very dangerous game to get into and complaints of this kind can easily cut both ways i will submit an appropriately edited and condensed version of this reply to
