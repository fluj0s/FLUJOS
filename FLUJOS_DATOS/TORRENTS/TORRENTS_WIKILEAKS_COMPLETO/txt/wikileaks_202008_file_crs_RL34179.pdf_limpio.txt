mechanical and electrical piece of cgx will be the same identical as ddx so the infrastructure that suppor ts radar and communications gear into the integrated deckhouse would be the sa fundamental structure and layout i believe to accommodate the kinds of technologies cgx is thinking bout arraying youd probably get 60 to 70 percent of the ddx hull and integrated inaudible common between ddx and cgx with the variation being in that last 35 percent for weapons nd that sort of thing the big difference between cgx and ddg 1000 will likel be the size of the arrays for the radars the numbers of communication apertures in the integrated deckhouse little bit of vari ation in the cic combat information center in other words the comma nd and control center and likely some variation in how many

hull design for the cgx was one of the navys arguments for moving ahead with the ddg1000 program it is longer clear however that reusing the ddg1000 hull design as the basis for the cgx is still the navys preferred approach july 2 2008 letter from john young the department of defense dod acquisition executive the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logis tics to representative gene taylor the chairman of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee stated i agree that the navys preliminary design analysis for the next generation cruiser indicates that for the most capable radar suites under consideration for the cgx the ddg1000 hull design cannot support the radar19 it is not clear that the ddg1000 can accommodate onehalf of the twinreactor plant that the navy has designed for its new gerald r ford cvn78 class nuclearpowered aircraft carriers20 i f t h ddg1000 hull cannot accommodate onehalf of the fordclass plant then the navy might face choice of either designing new hull for the cgx that can accommodate onehalf of the fordclass plant or designing new reactor plant that can fit into the

from the waterline tumblehome hull is thought to be less visible to enemy radars than conventional flared hull which slopes outward as it rises up from the waterline crea ting corner reflector between the water and the hull that can strongly reflect enemy radar beamsjuly 2007 press report on aoa july 23 2007 defense trade press report stated that analysts conducting the cgx aoa were considering dividing the cgx program into two groups of ship s 14 smaller c onventionally powered cgxs based on the 14500ton ddg1000 hu ll design for aaw operations and 5 larger nuclearpowered cgnxs21 displacing 23000 tons to 25000 tons each for bmd operations the report stated under pressure from the us navy to develop new cruiser based on the ddg 1000 zumwaltclass hull form and from congress to incorporate nuclear power group of analysts working on the next big surface combatant may recommend two different ships to form the cgx program one ship would be 14000ton derivative of the ddg 10 00 an escort cruiser to protect aircraft carrier st rike groups the vessel would keep the tumblehome hull of the ddg 100022 and its gas turbine power plant the other new cruiser would be much larger 25000ton nuclearpowered ship with more conventional flared bow optimized for the ballistic missile defense bmd mission in all five large cgnx ships and 14 escort cruisers would be built to fulfill the cruiser requirement in the navys 30year 313ship plan which calls for replacing todays cg 47 ticonderoga class aegis cruisers and adding specially designed seabased missile defense force the analysis group is said to be firm in its recommendation for the smaller escort cruiser details are less developed on the nuclearpowered variant sources said the article also stated the antimissile cruiser also wouldnt require the high level of stealth provided by the zumwalts tumblehome hull analysts said since the ship would be radiating its radars to search for ssiles returning to more conventional flaredbow hull form would free design ers from worries about overloading the untried tumblehome hull there will be great reluctance to use the wavepiercing tumblehome hull form for the larger ship said one experienced naval engineer he noted the ddg 1000 stealth requirement is necessary for the ships ability to operate in waters near coastlines but that the openocean region where bmd ship would operate means you dont need to go to the extremes of the tumblehome form splitting the cgx into two designs also makes political sense sources saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs10 23 christopher p cavas us may build 25000t on cruiser analysis of alternatives sees nuclear bmd vessel defense news july 23 2007 the article also stated according to sources the aoa looked at two possible nuclear powerplants based on existing designs doubling the singlereactor seawolf ssn 21 submarine plant and halving tworeactor nuclear carrier plants doubling the 34 megawatts of the seaw olf plant would leave the new ship far short of power requirements and not even match the 78 megawatts of the zumwalts but halving the 209megawatt plant of current nuclear carriers would yield bit more than 100 megawatts enough juice for powerhungry bmd radars plus an extra measure for the navys desired future directedenergy weapons and railgunstheres concern th at the ddg hu ll has stability problems and doesnt have growth margin said congressi onal source nuclearpowered option the source said also would placate congress and cashstrapped navy wouldnt be fully committed to nuclear ship the nuclear ship also would need to be larger than the ddg 1000 in separate statements navy officials have been hinting that 20000tonplus ship could be in the works sources said early analyses of the cgnx showed 25000ton ship which the navy said was too large more realistic one source said would be about 23000 tons23 october 2007 press report on aoa an october 29 2007 defense trade press report on the cgx aoa stated study refining

sources into aspects of the nextgeneration cruiser the cgx analysis delivered last year by the center for naval analyses cna which navy and indus try sources said describes handful of possible variants for the ship including nuclear powered vessel is just part of what is now the cgx aoa gu illory told itn inside the navy jan 15 at the surface navy associations snas annual symposium in arlington va guillory said the current aoa does not include sp ecific options that this is one version of the ship this is another version the options are the next level down he said so what are all the potential propulsion options for the ship then you look at the combat systems level you look at the weapons level ou look at the manning level you look at the shoreinfrastructuresupport level roughead has not made determination that the analysis satisfies all his questions so were still answering questions gu illory said lot of those questions dont require cna s input because they are questions navy staff has to answer he added there may be questions related to some other aspect of the navy guillory said for instance how will cgx impact our replenishment ships do we need more oilers thats not necessarily cgx question but it is navy question vice adm bernard mccullough deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources said there has been one briefing session on the cgx aoa with roughead in recent weeks were briefing the study report to cno mccullough told itn on jan 16 in brief interview at the sna conference weve had one session with him i imagine it will take couple morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs12 25 emelie rutherford navy staff answering cnos questions on nextgen cruiser analysis inside the navy january 21 2008mccullough added one would expect the service chief to have questions on an investment of the magnitude of the new cruiser the report also stated guillory said navy staff will continue to answer rougheads questions on the aoa til further notice until we satisfy all of his questions theres timetable for when he has to be satisfied he can continue to ask questions forever guillory said at some point then they will be passed over to the secretary of the navy the secretariat side for their approval and then forwarding on to the offi ce of the secretary of defense who ultimately is the receiver of the analysis of alternatives guillory said th aoa is lot to read and that it is his responsibility to make that discussion palatable at every level for roughead while parts of th aoa are made up of the c nas analysis guillory said the document also includes work by naval sea systems command and other entities such as laboratories there are lot of sources of information that go into this body of work he said nuclear power is one of many opti ons for the cgx propulsion system with other alternatives including steam sail marine gas turbine and diesel guillory said and then every aspect of that not only how much it costs to build one but then to maintain one he said does it take more people for nuclear ship than it does for gas turbine ship whats the lifecycle cost of that roughead told sna conference atte ndees on jan 15 that nuclear power is being weighed for the cgx i believe as we look to the future and you look at cgx to go down that path and not be examining nuclear power given what that power can produce for us operationally but also looking at the realities of the future we have to take that into account and put that in to our calculus roughead said as we look to the future we have to be considering it the cno added if you look around the country there are t of other people that are considering nuclear power as well 25 september 2008 press report on aoa september

grated air and missile defense is intended to replace the cg47 class cruiser the navys analysis of alternatives for the new cruiser was supposed to be completed in fiscal year 2007 but that deadline slid because service leaders said more time was needed to review requirements the navy did not budget cgx hull in its current program objective memorandum 2010 pom10 submitted to osd last month and

areas such as destroyer procurement30 how might such deferral affect the navys ability to meet projected operational challe nges in future years accuracy of navy cost estimate cbo believes that the navy is substantially underestimating ddg1000 procurement costs31 and consequently is also s ubstantially undere stimating likely cgx procurement costs cbo reported in june 2008 that it believes the first two cgxs would cost roughly twice as much as the navy estimates and that the average unit cost for all 19 cgxs would be about 40 more than the navy estimated in 2007 cbo also believes that its own cost estimates for the cgx may prove to be too low cb reported in june 2008 that cbos estimates for the fi rst two ships of the class are about double the navys estimates cbo assumed that the cgx would use the same hull as the ddg1000 the navys budget estimates for the 2011 and 2013 cruisers are based on the same assumption the navy expects those ships to cost 28 billion and 25 billion in constant fy2009 dollars respectively the navy last year conducted an analysis of alternatives aoa to determine what capabilities the cgx should have results of that analysis have not yet been released but version of the cgx built using the ddg1000 hull is only one of the options considered in the aoa the navy says that it is studying other options that would be larger and more capable than cgx built using the ddg1000 hull including ships that use nuclear propul sion the navy does not appear to be considering ship smaller than the ddg1000 as the basis for the cgx any design that is larger is likely to be substantially more expensive than the ddg1000 using the ddg51 as an analogy cbo estimates that the lead cgx would cost 52 billion in cons tant fy2009 dollars the average cost for each ship in that class would be about 42 billion in constant fy 2009 dollars assuming that the cgx is conventionally powered and uses the ddg1000 hull cbo also assumed that consistent with the ddg1000 program two shipyards would build the cgxs moreover cbos estimate for the cost of the cgx may be optimistic the last time the navy reused hull design for new class of surface combatants was in the 1970s when the service built the spruance class destroyers and ticonderoga class cruisers both ship classes shared the same hull design but were intended for different missions the spruances were generalpurpose destroyers used to escort other navy ships in the event of war and were designed in particular for antisubmarine warfare the ticonderoga class cruisers incorporated the aegis antiair combat system the spy1 radar and surfacetoair missiles to counter the threat to navy carrier battle groups posed by soviet navalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs17 32 ibid p 23 33 ibid p 24 box 1 34 ibid p 27aviation reflecting its more complex combat systems the cost per thousand tons of the lead ticonderoga was more than 60 percent higher than the cost of the lead spruance notwithstanding their many common hull features and mechanical systems32 cbo also reported that building future nuclear cruiser cgn x would probably cost more than the congressional budget office or the navy has currently estimated for conventionally powered cgx navy report on the costeffectiveness of nuclear propulsion estimates that the add itional cost to install that capability in conventionally powered surface combatant would be approximately 700 million if cgnx had to be much larger than th ddg1000 there would probably be additional costs press reports have indicated that cgnx could displace as much as 23000 to 25000 tons or 60 percent to 70 percent more than the ddg1000 large ship might be necessary for example if the navy were to use for the cgnx one of the reactors now used in the cvn78 class of aircraft carrier according to the navy that reactors size weight and supporting systems could not be accommodated within hull the size of the ddg1000 if that proved to be the case the larger nuclearpowered cgnx could cost much more than the ddg100033 cbo also reported that the relatively simple design of the lcs and the substantial cost increases that have occurred in the program suggest that the navy may also have trouble meeting its cost targets for the larger much more complex surface combatants in its shipbuilding plan such as the ddg1000 and the cgx34 nuclear power major issue for the cgx program is whether some or all cgxs should be nuclearpowered as men tioned in the background section the chairman and ranking member of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee strongly support making the cgx nuclear powered ship and the chairman of the defense subcommittee of the house appropriations committee has referred to the cgx as nuclearpowered ship as also mentioned earlier section 1012 of th fy2008 defense authorization act hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008 makes it us policy to construct the major combatant ships of the navy including the cgx with integrated nuclear power systems unless the secretary of defense submits notification to congress that the inclusion of an integrated nuclear power syst em in given class of ship is not in the national interest the conference repor t on pl 110181 contained extensive report language relating to section 1012 see appendix httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs18 35 see for example the comments of rear admiral kevin mccoy at june 25 2007 conference in arlington va sponsored by th american society of naval engineers asne news article reporting mccoys remarks stated in part mccoy has cautioned that the navys alternate propulsion study submitted to congress in january 2007 is not specific recommendation for using nuclear propulsion for the cgx cruisers which are intended to perform missile defense really the issue ill tell you is not so much about the power plant but its about the mission mccoy said june 25 and if you think the mission is sitting off hostile coast looking for bmd type mission for onebeam cycles on the big highpowered radar were talking the radar is costing in the 30 megawatts range then alternatives like nuclear power start to come in emelie rutherford despite hill pressure navy noncommittal on nuclear power for cgx inside the navy july 2 2007 36 for more on technical risks in the ddg1000 program see crs report rl32109 op citthe navy reported to congress in janua ry 2007 that equipping notional ship broadly like the cgx with nuclear power plant instead of conventional ie fossilfuel power plant would other things held equal increase the unit procurement cost of followon ships in the class by about 600 million to 700 million in constant fy2007 dollars the report concluded that if oil prices in coming years are high much or all of the increase in unit procur ement cost could be offset over the ships service life by avoided fossilfuel costs nuclearpowered cgx would be more capable than corresponding conventionally powered vers ion because of the mobility advantages of nuclear propulsion which include for example the ab ility to make longdistance transits at high speeds in response to distant continge ncies without need for refueling navy officials have also stated that nuclear power plant might be appropriate for the cgx in light of the high energy re quirements of the cgxs powerful bmd capable radar35

on the two lead ddg1000s which were procured in fy200736 potential key technical risk specific to the cgx program concerns its powerful new bmdcapable radar the need to reduce technical risk in the cgx radar may be one reason why the navy repor tedly plans to defer procurement of the lead cgx from fy2011 to fy2017 n ovember 29 2007 press article reportedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs19 37 dave ahearn large number of aegis sh ips would be needed to shield europe admiral defense daily november 29 2007that rear admiral alan hicks the director of the aegis ballistic missile defense bmd program cautioned that the navy shouldnt attempt to go with ra dically advanced radar for cg x at least not initially rather he said it might be wiser to go with incremental upgrades steadily improving radar technol ogy on the future cruiser that will take shape in the next decade just as th existing aegis system on cruisers and destroyers today has been upgraded steadily over two decades lots of people want to build this in credible radar hicks said on the one hand he sees that as valid eventual goal but i do believe you need to get there in stepped function jumping to radar that is three generations ahead in one leap is going to be terribly challenging and may drive costs skyward imperiling the need to make cg x affordable he said so we need to be very careful how we get riskreduction package to get to that cruiser perhaps by using existing radar technology as base to help reduce that development risk he said pointing to the success of the aegis modernization program37 hull design in addition to the issue of nuclear pow er another shipdesign issue for the cgx is whether the ship should use the ddg1000s tumblehome hull or some other hull potential altern ative hulls include existing hulls such as the ddg51 hull and the lpd17 amphibious ship hull both of which are conventional flared hulls or new flared hull design tumblehome hull with its reduced radar detectability is viewed as useful for accomplishing the ddg1000s mission of using its 155mm guns to strike targets ashore mission that could require the ddg1000 to operate fairly close to enemy shorebased radars some observers believe that hull with reduced detectability is less critical for the cgx because the cgxs aaw and bmd missions might not require it to approach enemy shores as clos ely and because the energy radiating from the ships powerful bmdcapable radar will in any event provide enemy sensors with an indication of the ships location other observers might argue that even if ships location is known hull with reduced det ectability can improve the ships ability to evade or to use decoys to confuse th homing devices in enemy antiship cruise missile and torpedoes or the fusing mechanisms in enemy mines even if the cgx does not require the reduced radar detectability of tumblehome hull reusing the ddg1000s tumblehome hull for the cgx might still have economic advantages in terms of avoiding the cost of designing new hull which could easily be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and taking advantage of production learningcurve efficiencies achieved from earlier construction of ddg 1000s designing new hull would incur hulldesign costs and sacrifice the opportunity to take advantage of ddg1000 production learningcur ve benefits on the other hand newdesign hull might more easily accommodate the power planthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs20 38 for more on the fordclass program see crs report rs20643 navy ford cvn78 class cvn21 aircraft carrier

system desired for the cgx and be designed with the latest features for reducing its production cost one option for making the cgx nuclea rpowered ship would be to equip it with onehalf of the new twinreactor plant that the navy has designed for its new ford cvn78 class aircraft carriers38 reusing the fordclass reactor plant would avoid the costs of developing new reactor plant for the cgx cost that could exceed 1 billion39 as mentioned earlier the ddg1000 hull or an enlarged version of the ddg51 hull might be t oo small to easily accommodate onehalf of fordclass plant at least not without maki ng changes to the plant using onehalf of the fordclass plant without making ch anges to it might require designing new hull that is larger than the ddg1000 hull if so then using onehalf of the ford class plant would pose tradeoff between avoided reactor plant design costs and additional hulldesign costs unit affordability vs unit capability issues such as the question of nuclear pow er and the ships hull design form part of more general potential general oversig ht issue for congress concerning whether the navy has achieved the best balan ce in the cgx design between unit affordability and unit capability as men tioned in the back ground sec tion the cgx is one of the navys relatively fe w remaining opportunities to use new ship design to manage the overall cost of the na vys shipbuilding program navy officials are aware of this but they also want the cgx to be capable of performing certain intended missions including the bmd mission that drives the need for the cgx to carry large and powerful new radar navy officials are seeking design solution for the cgx that represents the best balance between unit affordability and unit capability achieving such balance is longstanding challenge in ship design concerns about the potential affordability of the cgx have been reinforced by the experience with ddg1000 which turned out to be much more expensive than originally envisaged th navy originally planne d total of 16 to 24 ddg1000s and sustaining procurement rate of tw ddg1000s per year due in part to the ships cost this was reduced to total of 7 ddg1000s to be procured at rate of about one ship per year subsequently on july 31 2008 navy officials testified that the service wants to stop ddg1000 pr ocurement ships and restart ddg51 procurement affordability considerations may have played role in the navys decision40 dualdesign solution for the cgx pr ogram such as the one reportedly considered in the cgx aoa see backgr ound section is one possible strategy for striking balance between affordability and capability in the cgx program ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs21 41 dualdesign solution might also be viewed as reminiscent of the socalled highlow mix approach that was adopted in the 1970s and 1980s for the procurement of navy surface combatants and air force fighters the high low mix approach involved procuring mix of morecapable moreexpensive platforms the high end of the mix and lesscapable lessexpensive platforms the low end in the 1970s and 1980s the navy procured nuclearpowered cruisers and aegis cruisers as its highend ships and spruance dd963 class destroyers and oliver hazard perry ffg 7 class frigates as its lowend ships the air force procured f15s as its highend fighters and f16s as its lowend fighters the air force today might be viewed as again impl ementing highlow mix approach through its planned procurement of combination of hi ghend f22 fighters and moreaffordable f35 joint strike fighters jsfs the capability ratio of 23000 to 25000ton nuclear powered cgx relative to that of 14000 ton conventionally powered cgx might not necessarily be the same as that of the 1970s1980s highend surface combatants relative to the 1970s1980s lowend surface combatants or of the f15 relative to the f16 or of the f22 relative to the f35 the merits of the highlow mix approach as strategy for balancing unit capability against unit affordability have been debated on and off for years 42 for more on this issue see crs report rl33745 seabased ballistic missile defense background and issues

mission on the required numbe r of cgxs and the schedule for procuring cgxs the currently planned to tal of 19 cgxs reflects in part certain assumptions about the navys future ro in us bmd operations the navys future in us bmd operations however has not yet been fully defined it is possible that as the role becomes better defined the total requi red number of cgxs could change42 related question is whether the sche dule for procuring cgxs is properly aligned with foreigncount ry ballistic missile deve lopment programs 2005 defense trade press report for example states that navy officials project that china could field tbms capable of hitting moving ships at sea by about 201543 once cgx procurement were to begin it might be possible to accelerate the procurement dates of later ships in the pr ogram so as to get more of the ships in service sooner in situation of constrained navy f unding however accelerating procurement of cgxs to earlier years could leave less fundi ng available in

what that includes and i have just some notes here but such things as you have to have the docks and the drydocks and the pier capability to support nuclear ships whatever that would entail you would have to have lifting and handling equipment cranes that type of thing construction facilities to build the special nuclear components and to store those components and protect them in the way that would be required the construction facilities would be necessary for handling fuel and doing the fueling operations that would be necessary on the ship those types of things and then the second piece is and probably the harder piece other than just kind of the brickandmortar type is building the structures the organizations in place to do that work fo r instance nuclear testing specialized nuclear engineering nuclear production work if you look for instance at northrop grumman newport ne ws right now just to give you perspective of the people you are talking about in those departments it is on the order of 769 people in nuclear engineering 308 people in the major lines of control department 225 in nuclear quality assurance and then almost 2500 people who do nuclear production work so all of t hose would have to be you would have to find that workforce certify and qualify them to be able to do that45 the director of nr testified that newport news and gdeb have sufficient capacity to accommodate nuclearpowered surface ship construction and therefore there is need to make the substantial investment in time nd dollars necessary to generate additional excess capacity46 in light of this the navy testified only the first and third options above are viable47 the director of nr testified that my view of this is we have some additional capacity at both electric boat and at northrop grumman newport news my pr imary concern is if we are serious about building another nuclearpowered wa rship new class of warship cost is obviously going to be some degree of concern and certainly this additional costs which would be and i dont have number to give you right now but i think you can see it would be substantial to do it even if you could it probably doesnt help our case to move down the path toward building another nuclearpowered case when we have the capability exis ting already in those existing yards48 with regard to the third option of building the nuclear portions of

rged or transported in other fashion to the delivering shipyard if i had to do it ideally that is where i would probably start talking to my industry partners because although we have six large shipyards for building large navy ships it is really tw corporations that own them and those two corporations each own what is now surface combatant shipyard and they each own nuclearcapab shipyard i would say if we were going to go do this we would sit down with them and say you know from corporation standpoint what would be the best work flow what would be the best place to construct modules and

continued ddg1000s and cgxs to combined rate of one per year the article provides figures on the service lives of the aegis ships before or after the extension so it is unclear whether the authors are proposing to extend their lives from 35 years or some lower figure to 40 years or some other figure whether it would be feasible or cost effective today to extend the lives of the aegis cruisers is unclear depending on how intensively they are used in coming years the aegis cruisers might be worn out in terms of their basic structural or mechanical condition by age 35 some observers believe they might be worn out by age 30 if the aegis cruisers are in good enough structural and mechanical condition to permit operation beyond age 35 experience with past surface combatant signs suggests that the ships might have insufficient space weightcarrying ability or electrical power to accommodate the new sensors and weapons that could be needed at that point to keep them missioneffective beyond age 35 the navy has limited experience operating modern cruisers and destroyers beyond age 35 and thus limited experience with the engineering issues that might arise from attempting to operate such ships to age 40legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense authorizati on bill s 3001pl 110417 house the house armed services committee in its report hrept 110 652 of may 16 2008 on the fy2009

4986 house report the house armed services committee in its report hrept 110146 of may 11 2007 on hr 1585 stated the following the committee believes that the mobility endurance and electric power generation capability of nuclear powered warships is essential to the next generation of navy cruisers the navys report to congress on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatan ts and amphibious warfare ships required by section 130 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 public law 109163 indicated that the total lifecycle cost for mediumsized nuclear surface combatants is equivalent to conventionally powered ships the committee notes that this study only compared acquisition and maintenance costs and did not analyze the increased speed and endurance capability of nuclear powered vessels the committee believes that the primar escort vessels for the navys fleet of aircraft carriers should have the same speed and endurance capability as the aircraft carrier the committee also notes that surface combatants with nuclear propulsion systems would be more ca pable during independent operations because there would be need for underway fuel replenishment page 387 conference report section 1012 of the conference repor t hrept 110477 of december 6 2007 on hr 1585 stated sec 1012 policy relating to major combatant vessels of the strike

including all new classes of such vessels with integrated nuclear power systems b requirement to request nuclear vessels if request is submitted to congress in the budget for fiscal year for construction of new class of major combatant vessel for the strike forces of the united states thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs30 request shall be for such vessel with an integrated nuclear power system unless the secretary of defense submits with the request notification to congress that the inclusion of an integrated nuclear pow er system in such vessel is not in the national interest c definitions in this section1 major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy the term major combatant vessels of the strike forces of the united states navy means the following submarines b aircraft carriers c cruisers battleships or other large surface combatants whose primary mission includes protection of carrier stri ke groups expeditionary strike groups and vessels comprising sea base 2 integrated nuclear power system the term integrated nuclear power system means ship engineering system that uses naval nuclear reactor as its energy source and generates sufficient electric energy to provide power to the ships electrical loads including its combat systems and propulsion motors 3 budget the term budget means the budget that is submitted to congress by the president under section 1105a of title 31 united states code regarding section 1012 the conference report stated the navys next opportunity to apply this guidance will be the next generation cruiser or cgx under the current futureyears defense program fydp the navy plans to award the cons truction contract for cgx in fiscal year 2011 under this provisi on the next cruiser would be identified as cgnx to designate the ship as nuc lear powered under the navys normal shipbuilding schedule for the two progra ms that already have nuclear power systems aircraft carriers and submarin the navy seeks authorization and appropriations for long lead time nuclear components for ships 2 years prior to full authorization and appropriation for construction the conferees recognize that the milestone decision for the navys cgx is only months away after that milest one decision the navy and its contractors will begin significant design effort and in that process will be making significant tradeoff decisions and discar ding major options such as propulsion alternatives this is the normal pro cess for the navy and the department of defense dod to make choices that will lead to producing contract design that will be the basis for awarding the constr uction contract for the lead ship in 2011 in order for the navy to live by the spirit of this guidance the conferees agree that 1 the navy would be required to pr oceed through the contract design phase of the program with comprehensive effort to design cgnx independent of the outcome of decisions that the navy regarding any preferred propulsion system for the next generation cruiserhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs31 2 if the navy intends to maintain the schedule in the current fydp and award vessel in fiscal year 2011 the navy would need to request advance procurement for nuclear components in the fiscal year 2009 budget request and 3 the navy must consider options fora maintaining the segment of the i ndustrial base that currently produces the conventionally powered destroyer and amphibious forces of the navy b certifying yards which comprise that segment of the industrial base to build nuclearpowered vessels or c seeking other alternatives for bu ilding nonnuclear ships in the future if the navy is only building nuclearpow ered surface combatant ships for some period of time as it builds cgnx vessels and d identifying sources of funds to pa for the additional nearterm costs of the integrated nuclear power system either from offsets within the navys budget from elsewhere within the departments resources or from gaining additional funds for dod overall the conferees recognize that these considerations will require significant additional nearterm investment by the navy some in the navy have asserted that despite such added investment the navy would not be ready to award shipbuilding contract for cgnx in fi scal year 2011 as in the current fydp section 128 of the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 public law 109364 re quired that the navy include nuclear power in its analysis of alternatives aoa for the cgx propulsion system the conferees are aware that the cgx aoa is nearing completion in which case the navy should have some indications of what it will require to design and construct cgnx class accordingly the conferees direct th secretary of the navy to submit report to the congressional defense committees with the budget request for fiscal year 2009 providing the following information 1 the set of next generation cruiser characteristics such as displacement and manning which would be affected by the requirement for including an integrated nuclear power system 2 the navys estimate for additional costs to develop design and construct cgnx to fill the requirement for the next generation cruiser and the optimal phasing of those costs in or der to deliver cgnx most affordably 3 the navys assessment of any effects on the delivery schedule for the first ship of the next generation cruise r class that would be associated with shifting the design to incorporate an integrated nuclear propulsion system options for reducing or eliminating those schedule effects and alternatives for meeting next generation cruiser requirements during any intervening period if the cruisers full operational capability were delayedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34179crs32 4 the navys estimate for the cost associated with certifying those shipyards that currently produce conven tionally powered surface combatants to be capable of constructing and inte grating nuclearpowered combatant 5 any other potential effects on the navys 30year shipbuilding plan as result of implementing these factors 6 such other considerations that w ould need to be addressed in parallel with design and construction of cgnx class including any unique test and training facilities facilities and infrastructure requirements for potential cgnx homeports and environmental assessments that may require longterm coordination and planning and 7 an assessment of the highest risk areas associated with meeting this requirement and the navys alternatives for mitigating such risk pages 984 986
