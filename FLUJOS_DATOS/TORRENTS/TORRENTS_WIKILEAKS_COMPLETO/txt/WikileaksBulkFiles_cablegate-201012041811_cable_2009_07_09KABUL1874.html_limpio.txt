karzais july 12 election meeting classified by ambassador carney by reasons 14 b and d 1 sbu summary and comment president karzais 12 july weekly meeting on election security produced the unwelcome news that polling center numbers must be reduced due to poor security and isolation the dsrsg noted khost officials have decided to colocate 50 polling centers with the remaining 125 in the province ambassador eikenberry concluded discussion by noting the urgency of getting the facts in all provinces by completing the assessment the president has called for the president decided that afghan government funds 15m usd would be used to fund efforts to use community leaders to effect electoral security as appropriate minister atmar described decision to use usaid funding to help recruit women voter searchers comment in fact the money will come from undpelect that has received major funding from usaid end comment some discussion centered on the need to ensure rapid installation of local governance in helmand districts freed by ongoing operations the president questioned the defense minister about the lack of an afghan face in those operations end summary and comment 2 u on 12 july president karzais weekly election security meeting included his foreign interior and defense ministers nds intelligence chief vicechairman of the disarmament process diag chairman of the independent electoral commission nsc advisor and directorgeneral of the office of administrative affairs and council of ministers secretariat of foreigners the dsrsg comisaf ambs eikenberry ricciardone carney and rao chief attended 3 sbu discussion heavily centered on the agenda item calling for security assessment of the nearly 7000 polling centers the defense minister noted that instructions have gone out for the range of relevant afghan and isaf authorities to reconnoiter sites and prepare detailed plan to secure them plan based in realities of terrain and on the level of threat minister wardak described the 11 july election security rehearsal as positive step toward proper preparation for election he noted the need for another weeks time to complete reconnaissance and preparation of detailed plan for securing the polling center sites the president pushed wondering how many sites have received assessment team visits so far the interior minister replied that of the 6966 centers 400 sites have been visited so far he noted that mainly the police alone sometimes with the ana had done the trips nor had they made any security plans for the sites as yet he would issue instructions to add such planning not merely to visit nds chief saleh said that he has received the full list of centers from the iec and would have report of sites visited for next sundays meeting iec chairman lodin gave report that noted dispatch of up to 90 of nonsensitive electoral materiel without incident he spoke vaguely about some nontaliban afghan troublemakers he cited problems in herat in two districts and scored high level officers as saying kabul 00001874 002 of 004 things that benefit the taliban 4 sbu dsrsg galbraith cast doubt on the possibility of using much less securing all of the polling centers he had just visited khost where he noted in response to the defense ministers questioning of his sources local electoral and government officials had said they must colocate 50 of the more remote polling centers together with the remaining 125 centers in the province galbraith expressed the suspicion that from one quarter to one third of polling centers in other provinces of insurgent presence would probably need the same treatment the president doubted if the local population would be willing to go to the relocated polling centers the dsrsg explained that such centers would be relocated to market town where people normally go to shop not as close but along routes the people know he added that turnout would likely be reduced but not so much as if 50 centers would be unable to open at all after comment on the need for recruiting women to do security searches of voters below the dsrsg concluded by observing the very short period left in which to recruit and train all polling workers 5 u ambassador eikenberry noted the need to complete the surveying of all the polling centers in order to establish the facts and develop plans professor lodin recalled the experience of voter registration in which people moved and shifted to other populated areas to get their cards 6 u the need for women security checkers has apparently been resolved professor lodin said that total of 28000 male and female searchers are needed for 7000 polling centers the iec and the interior ministry are in discussion about this need and funds must be found that usaid can provide ambassador eikenberry recalled that usaid moneys may not go through the ministry of interior as matter of policy he suggested that the ministry of finance can put funds into the interior ministry as it will receive budget augmentation from forthcoming us funds minister atmar explained that an 11 july meeting of iec usaid and others had decided that the iec would employ women workers and moi would train them in search techniques in this context he noted decision to give women provincial council candidates one bodyguard each he stated that on the presidents instruction from the previous meeting twenty iecidentified warehouses would be subject of decision for security that he did not explain 7 sbu the interior minister also raised his earlier remarks about controversial map that questioned assumptions about safe areas he contended that rather than relocate polling centers and thereby risking to disenfranchise voters he proposed to deploy forces to secure priority not all districts b organize community leaders something that can work is the us is willing to help with financing without such us resources kabul 00001874 003 of 004 moi would do what it could president karzai interjected that atmar should take our resources that he understood 15m would be necessary and do it the finance ministry would reimburse moi moi nds idlg and others would put it into action and let the president know if more resources are needed he cut short the contention of minister stanekzai that up to 30m might be needed ending the discussion by reaffirming the figure of 15m 8 c continuing on the issue of contacting the local community for election security assistance the president accepted comisafs offer of special forces help he recalled that local community leaders had been important in ensuring that voter registration went well prof lodin noted that local leaders have enabled mobile registration teams to venture out up to 60 km from province centers where the police normally restrict travel to 20 km from the centers 9 sbu other electoral needs came under discussion with minister atmar noting exchanges at the 11 july election security rehearsal that put iec need for helicopters to move sensitive ballot materials after the vote at one per province at least he believed that security sector helicopters would likely be busy he mooted the possibility that the might augment its existing contract with shortterm helicopter rental with donor support ambassador eikenberry again noted that the key is to identify the requirement and then to analyze capacity and discuss how to make up any shortfall the dsrsg agreed undertaking to look into the possibility of shortterm helicopter rentals at this late date in the process 10 c the president turned to the military situation in helmand province noting that the afghan army is not visible and questioning the defense ministers contention that the army is fully deployed around the country with only limited number of troops available to join in the operation with the us marines people see the lack of an afghan face noted the president who observed that the ministers suggestion that he might add another battalion as an insignificant 600 men he urged the minister to try finding more forces to deploy in helmand 11 sbu further discussion on helmand included the dsrsgs observation that the flow of internally displaced is less than initially feared he added the need to ensure assignment and appointment of local governance officials as districts are cleared underscoring the importance of delivering government services rapidly all districts liberated in ongoing operations are having district leaders appointed according to both ministers atmar and wardak 12 c in other developments nds chief saleh stated that the pakistan army has said they are ready to mediate between mullah omar and the us amb eikenberry said that the us has reaffirmed to pakistan our policy that reconciliation is led through the government of kabul 00001874 004 of 004 afghanistan 13 sbu comisaf noted that isaf forces had entered the embattled district of barge metal pakistan border northernmost district in nuristan
