waste management and the environment background for current issues summary waste from animal agriculture is an increasingly prominent environmental quality issue animal waste especially excessive nutrient concentrations is being linked to some environmental problems especially water pollution the growing number f sites where degradation related to animal waste has been reported has focuse d attention on this problem and led to discussions of possible responses thre dimensions make this complicated challenge for policy makers one dimension revolves aro und both the prevalence of concentrating very large numbers of animals at farm sites rather than out in pastures with greate r concent ration of wastes and industrialization where producers raise animals unde r contract these changes contribute to perception by many that such large scal agriculture is increasingly like any other business and should be regulated in similar ways to protect public health especially at the larger facilities the environmenta l quality questions also include what to do with waste from small er farm operations that are not regulated under current federal law and how to address other waste problems such as air emissions and odor that are not currently regulated under federal laws second dimension is the role of government if any in resp onding to the animal waste management problem one aspect of these choices is whether the federa l government should build on the regulatory approach of the clean water act an d other environmental protection laws or rely on agriculture programs that are based on voluntary participation and incentives to attract participation with local deliver systems providing technical ssistance costsharing and education ongoing efforts by the environmental protection ag ency and department of agriculture are merging aspects of both approaches but many stakeholders remain cautious about thes efforts second aspect is determining the federal role as states and localities continue to enact legislation and implement an expand ing array of laws and programs third dimension is the role of information abo ut many aspects of animal waste on the one hand lack of technical information about these complicated problems and relationships limits discussions of effective responses at the same time forces that oppose agri cultural concentration and industrialization for social philosophical or other r easons are using the environmental debates as an avenue for raising thei r concerns numerous responses are underway and others are being considered environmental protection advocates who cite possible threats to water quality an d human health have been joined by others with rural social and economic concerns in pressing for action supporters of largescale commercial agriculture caution tha t actions should proceed carefully to avoid needless regulations higher food costs and other adverse effects on individual agricultural enterprises congress has hel d hearings briefings and information sessions on t his topic in the 105 congress twoth legislative proposals were introduced but neither bill was enacted congressiona l

environment background for current issues introduction managing the environmental effects of intensive animal rearing and feedin g operations has long been problem confronting the livestock industry thes facilities which include confined feeding operations and feedlots are specialize d part of the livestock production process largely separate from cropland agriculture in recent years manure and wastehandling and disposal problems from intensiv animal production have begun to receive attention as these facilities increase in size and the effects of these problems reach beyond the industry to affect others number of forces are at work on this segment of agriculture these include changes in the livestock industries themselves especially concentration of animals in larger faciliti because of cost and production quality advantages the presence of these types of facilities s led in some cases to conflicts between farm operators and their neighbors over such issues as corporate farming odors and air and water quality the us population of animals in livestock production being raised to fee d americans and other consumers worldwide is very large the inventory in the most recently published agricultural census collected in 1992 included over 77 millio n cattle and ca lves about 60 million swine and almost 1 billion broilers wast produced by these animals is valuable soil amendment and source of nitrogen phosphorus and other crop nutrients when applied to land in proper amounts th traditional waste management approach but if not properly used or disposed or if applied in amou nts that exceed plant needs animal waste or its residuals can leach through soil to contaminate ground water or can be transported by runoff to pollute lakes and streams thus as animal p roduction has intensified and concentrated more animals on individual farms growing challenge for agriculture is finding sufficient land to dispose of manure or finding economic alternatives especially if the supply of land for disposal is insufficient the parallel challenge for policymakers i s determining if the environmental i mpacts of animal waste management are significant enough to require new remedies and if so what strategies are appropriate in particular crop and animal agricultural contributions to water qualit problems are receiving more focused attention from some groups and fro m policymakers for 25 years th nation has been implementing federal law the clean water act to improve the qu ality of streams lakes and estuaries throughout that time considerable progress has been made in controlling pollution from the largest identifiable industrial and municipal sources nevertheless recent reports by stat environmental age ncies indicate that 40 of the nations rivers and streams assessed by states which are only small portion of all waters fail to meet applicable waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs2 us environmental protection agency office of water national water

current law more effectively and perhaps develop new strategie s concerning agricultures impact on water quality such policies are resisted by those who object to expanding environmental regulations and potential costs some interests of agricultural and environmental policy have been comin g together for ov er decade but the process has been bumpy one agricultural and environmental groups can have trouble communicating with each other because f differing perceptions about what the problems are and how to view them differin g concepts of environmental quality and respo nsibilities to maintain that quality as well as differin g institutional perspectives the agendas of these groups do not ofte n2 coincide environmentalists have focused on the various ways that agriculture affects environmental quality beyond soil erosion while agriculturalists worry about ho w much response to expanding environmental concerns is enough and whethe r responding to environmental concerns threatens the ability of producers to maintain earnings however representatives of both sides now find more common groun d than they did decade ago this report provides background for the current policy debate about anima l waste management it describes the livestock production industry today and public health and environmental concerns related to the industry it summarizes policies and

legislative activity and dialogues on problems an d solutions initiated by some segments of this industry finally it discusse s congressional responses to the issues and outlines policy questions likely to shap congressional action three points are important themes that emerge from the dis cussion in this report first the bulk of current policy debate on animal waste issues both legislative an d regulatory is occurring in states and that activity is vigorous and multifaceted federal attention followed more recently second dimensions of animal wast problems and solutions technical and policy are highly sitespecific which leads to many questions about balancing roles of government where broad policies are set and the importance of flexibility in policies and programs third recent nationa l

usda economic research service key statistical in dicators of the food and fiber sector4 agricultural outlook march 1999 33 two sets of numbers ar used to describe herd size the numbers cited above are examples5 of the inventory the number of animals at any one time the census of agriculture measures the inventory every 5 years and usdas national agriculture statistics service use s different techniques to measures it four times each year second way to show herd size is to list the number of animals marketed annually when the animals life cycle is less than year the numbers are larger than the total number of animals in each year recently using this measure about 100 million swine and about 75 billion broilers were marketed interests and others outside of it concerning agricultural and environmental issues compared with relations of these groups in the recent past besides waste management several other issues related to animal agricultur currently are of interest to the public and policymakers these include meat an d poultry inspection requirements animal health and welfare concerns ranging fro m animal diseases to humane treatment of farm animals such as production practice s that animal rights activists consider cruel or dangerous to animals to animal testing for medical research to human health impacts of hormones and ntibiotics in livestock and social issues such as impacts of corporate farming and industrialization n traditional family farms and demographic changes in rural areas where residentia l development becomes neighbor to agriculture discussion of these topics i s3 beyond the scope of this report bu t their outcomes like decisions that address waste management issues could affect animal agriculture operations in the future animal agriculture and its

of the farm economy cash receipts to the livestock sector in 1997 and 1998 were 93 billion each year nearly half of the slightly more than 200 bi llion for all of agriculture the4 populations of animals are very larg the 1992 census of agriculture counted over 77 million cattle and c alves about 60 million swine and almost 1 billion broilers for example the inventory of each type of animal gradually shifts in response t o5 changing market conditions and consumer preferences changes in geographi c location of these animals and how they are raised reflect economic considerations business relationships and changing technology these changes have contributed to low food protein prices and led to incre asing concerns about several topics including environmental effects concentration and geographic location livestock production continues t have fewer producers operat ing at fewer sites such concentration offers economies of scale and depends increasingly on modern technologies and

1992 the average number of swine per swine farm increased by 578 in north carolina by 271 in arkansas and by 202 in california and virginia while the number of swine farms in those states declined by 62 50 54 and 71 respectively and more recently has been occurring at different rates for all ther types of livestock however these changes are not uniform across the country growth is occurring in some states while decline is evident in others geographic changes in the swin e6 industry are the most dramatic and are in the limelight today during the 5yea r period betwe 1989 and 1994 swine production grew by 111 in north carolina while it declined by 31 in ohio and by be tween 10 and 14 in michigan kansas and wisconsin since 1994 significant changes reportedly have continued 7 the swine inventory stands at around 60 million and this figure has climbe d about 18 over the past decade during the same period the number of swin e8 farms dropped by 72 the largest farms have grown larger so that now less than 1 of farms with at least 2000 animals account for 43 of th inventory all farms with an inventory of at least 1000 head are ss than 3 of the farms but 60 of the swine are produced on them the remaining 97 of the farms raising fewer tha n 1000 head produce only 40 of the inventory perhaps more important states with rapid growth in overall herd size have higher portions of their herds in very larg operations for example almost 80 of swine sales in north carolina sout h carolina and virginia are from operations with at least 5000 head compared to only 16 of sales in traditional producing areas 9 the concentration process has been similar for cattle feed operations which are now centered in the great plains in the top 13 producing states the number f feedlots has declined by 75 during the past two decades and the remaining one s have grown larger the largest feedlots which number about 70 each have at least 32000 head about 90 of the marketed cattle come from only 5 of the feedlots very large feedlots have become more common in kansas nebraska and texas dairy has undergone similar shift although the numbers are less dramatic production has grown fastest in the southern and western states where larger herds with more than 200 animals are common in these states herds with more than 200 cows account for about 90 of all milk production and about onethird of

by more than 50 concentration of livest ock production occurred first with poultry and it is now the most concentrated seg ment broiler production nearly tripled between 1969 and 1992 while the number of farms with broiler houses dropped by 35 according to data compiled by the senate agriculture committee minor ity staff firms with more10 than 100000 broilers accounted for 70 of all sales in 1975 but now account fo r more than 97 of all sales vertic integration and market change growing concentration is n important part of broader changes in business relationships and marketing in th livestock sector which are often referred to as industrialization another important part of industrialization is vertical integration as farmers enter contracts wit h processors or integrat ors under these contracts which can vary widely producers raise the livestock while integrators actually own th animals assume marketing risks and usually provide medicine feed and technical expertise as well in thes relationships the producer usually owns the waste generally vertical integratio n has increased the volume and certainty of supply and improved the marke t character istics of the livestock producers forgo the risks and uncertainties of th marketplace by becoming contract growers and as more production comes withi n these types of relationships marketing opportunities may decline for those who do not choose or are unable to participate in economic terms efficiencies are gained fo r both producers and integrators at the expense of nonparticipants the degree of integration varies within the livestock sector poultry has bee n fully integrated and poultry producers have real options to being contractors swine gets much of the attention in discussions of industrialization but it is widel believed that about 20 of the production currently is under contract however recent survey by the national pork producers council found that almost 65 of all hogs slaughtered in janu ary 1999 were sold through contracts or some other type of prearranged marketing agreement rather than for cash price the portion sol d11 under contract for swine as for all livestock sectors is growing at the same time the number of processors that producers ca n contract with has been shrinking in the swine sector the four largest packers share of the hog slaughter grew to 54 in 1997 up from 32 in 1980 change is occurring even more rapidly in the cattle sector where the four largest beef packers accounted for 80 of all cattle slaughtered i n 1997 which was more than double the 37 in 1980 critics and some experts say that these changes have broader community an d social costs that are undesirable this vigorous debate is explored in anima l agriculture as well as many othe r agricultural topics for

national pork producers council before the17 senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry april 2 1998 7sanitary waste production comparisons of human community equivalents with the15 waste that herds or flocks of animals produce are illustrative for example th manure produced by dairy milking 200 cows contains as much nitrogen as th sewage of community with 5000 to 10000 resident s or the litter removed annually from broiler house with 22000 birds contains as much phosphorus as the sewage from community of 6000 people according to the usdas natural resource s conservation service nrcs 16 considerable disagreement exists over how to characterize the volume of animal waste in human terms for example in congression testimony in 1998 the national pork producers council stated that cattle swine and poultry feeding operation s produce the equivalent of about 700 pounds of collectable manure per person pe r year and contrasted that figure with other estimates of up to 10000 pounds pe r person for every pound of nitrogen produced by pigs the council said 2 pounds are piped into surface waters by public and industria l waste water treatment facilities and 4 pounds are released into the atmosphere primarily by in ternal combustion engines17 this is one of many areas in the animal waste management debate where variou s interests use different data to measure conditions from origin to disposal farmers may manage manure and related wastes in many different ways depending on the characteristics of the f arm operation and the physical conditions of the farm waste management systems usually include severa l components manure may be collected at temporary storage facilities until it can be treated or utilized common storage facilities include stacks ponds and tanks waste may be treated in many ways to convert it to more useful resource usually by concentrating the beneficial constituents and decreasing the total volume lagoons are the m ost common holding facility in an open lagoon the manure undergoes continuous anaerobic decomposition and nitrogen is released into the air while most of th phosphorous settles to the bottom operational failure of lagoons and the resulting waste spills have brought much of the recent critical attention t animal agriculture and some have called for phasing out lagoons in addition th waste collected in lagoons has limited va lue as fertilizer if the cost to apply it exceeds the value of the nutrients other types of holding and treatment facilities include composters soli d separators and settli ng basins holding capacities of storage and treatment facilities are recommended based on the estimated time period the anticipated volume of waste may have to be retain ed for example waste should not be spread while the ground is frozen or it will be washed into surface water s so farms in locations where winters are long need greater storage capacity the management process ends when th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs9 waste is transferred and used the most common use by far is to spread it across the farm fields as soil amendment and nutrient supplement h ow it is spread may have important environmental implications for example spray irrigation has bee n associated with environmental problems in some situations while cultivation into the soil generally minimizes the potential for such problems not all the manure produced by livestock can be collected so t hat its disposal can be managed the 1996 council for agricultural science and technology cast study estimates that almost 62 million ton s 55 of the total can be collected much of the remainder is directly deposited in range and pastures in discussing possibl environm ental harm from livestock wastes whether the magnitude of the proble m should be based on the tota l amount produced or just the amount that is collectable is subject to dispute some in industry say that collectable amounts are mos t important since waste at confined feeding operations is collectable and farmers can manage the disposal of these wastes to lessen environmental impact others say that all waste including that which is deposited on pastureland has potential fo r environmental harm manure as an agricultural asset manure can be valuable asset fo r agricult ure generally as supplement to or partial substitute for commercia l fertilizers this value can best be determined when manure is considered in th broader context of overall nutrient management manure nutrient values however vary considerably and any supply of manure must be assessed for determinin g application rates commercial chemical fertilizer by contrast has consistent content with that information supplied by the manufacturer also nutrients from manure are not all immedia tely available guidelines on the rate of release have been developed for nitrogen based on the source and form of the manure nrcs and probabl others has developed national design standards for many aspects of managin g manure and state regulations are being developed and implemented in growin g number of locations s well see discussion below of state programs and legislative activities better way to view manure is as soil amendment that improves many of the physica l and chemical properties as well as the nutrient values of soil by addin g organic material and improving soil structure and the ability to hold water and retain nutrients these benefits are of considerable value cast reported in 1996 tha t animal waste can supply an average of 15 of the nitrogen and 42 of th phosphorus needed by crops the study states that the total potential value of manure as fertilizer approaches 34 billion annually this figure does not include th economi c benefits of improved soil quality decreased runoff and soil erosio n potential and improved soil moisture or offsetting costs associated with processing transportation and management waste disposal options many options exist for disposing of animal waste

are receiving increased attention many of these options have some pr omise in some situations but none can be viewed as silver bullet that can solve most problems in mos t locations many have large initial investment costs the constituents and moisture content of the manure are important qualities in determining which disposa l technique s to use shipping costs constrain many options because manure is of low economic value on volume or weight basis so it is uneconomic to ship it lon g distances unless it can be concentrated so as to decrease the volume or increase the value scientists have looked at ways to increase the value while economists have prepared scenarios of the maximum shipping distances given more specifi c characteristics 18 options under study include composting

relatively stable and odorless material that can be used or sold as soi l amendment burning can be used to generate energy but there are limitations for example one ton of poultry litter contains about the same amount of energy as 8 0 gallons of home heating oil but has the same volume as about 500 gallons th residue of burned manure is about 10 of the original volume and contains little of the original nitrogen and s ulfur but most of the phosphorus that was initially present biochem ical change that has received considerable attention is adding phytase an enzyme to feed some but not all studies have shown that it removes 25 to 40 of the phos phorus and 10 of the nitrogen excreted by causing the animals to us nutrients more efficiently further the nitrogen is volatilized and lost to th atmosphere but it may be redeposited elsewhere see discussion of atmospheri c deposition on page 15 phytase does have cost and must be added to feed still other options include converting the waste to fuel and energy using industria l processes to convert the waste to other useful products and using it as fee d supplement there are s ome significant success stories of manure management on farms for many of the options to using manure as soil amendment ideas that go beyond these success for managing animal wastes abound examples that have been publicize d recently are b ased on using duck weed or zebra mussels but each approach is hard to apply widely because of so combination of physical limitations high costs lack of knowledge or management skills by the producer unfamiliar or unteste d technologies and host of other factors the costs and difficulties of storing an d handling may be the most common constraints for these options disposal problems even when farmers control adequate lan d proper disposal in ways that will benefit crops and not harm the environment can still be problem the manu re must be assessed for its nutrient value then transported to the site and

an important conclusion of this study is that counties with nitrogen excess hav excess phosphorus as well while the reve rse is not necessarily true while these data are about potential rather than actual nutrient amounts and do not account for th ways that nutrients might be managed or used in alternative ways the analysis does indicate where problems are most likely to arise those counties are

similar to the distribution of animal inventories and the largest farms disposal has become more difficult for producers because of two convergin g trends within the livesto ck industry 1 operations are larger which means that there is more waste at single site and 2 less land is under the control of these operators for example t he largest 1 of the beef feedlots produce 71 of the fed beef bu t control only 2 of the cropland on fed beef far ms while the smallest 92 of feedlots produce only 10 of the total but control 75 f the cropland these relationships21 between herd size and available land suggest that many of the largest farms lack the capacity to manage their manure on the land under their direct control thes difficulties have been compounded by increased concerns about water quality an d other problems that may originate with intense and concentrated livestock farms livestock waste problems have led to some stricter state environmenta l regulations and the threat of more to come agricultural interests argue that thes should be unnecessary because it is in the farmers own interest to maintain healthy environment they also argue that the largest farms should have the capital an d knowledge to effectively adopt appropriate waste management technologies bu t operators of smaller farms though likely to pose smaller problems individually but not necessarily cumulatively may be less likely to have the knowledge and th capital and at least one analyst has argued that federal farm program assistanc should be targeted to help this segment of the farm pop

agricultura l interests contend that much is being accomplished especially with the shifts in policy in the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 the federal agricultura l improvement and reform act of 1996 the

industria l facilities termed point sources most agricultural activities are considered to be nonpoint sources of pollution since they do t discharge wastes from clearly identifiable pipes outfalls or similar conveyances nonpoint pollution occurs as surface erosion of soil by water and as surface runoff of rainfall or snowmelt from diffuse areas such as farm and ranch land construction sites and mining and timber operatio ns nonpoint sources are not required to obtain discharge permits consequently agricultural and other nonpoint sources are t subject to the compliance and enforcement regime that applies to point sources agricultural and other npoint sources have become increasingly prominent in debates over water quality policy however because the types of diffuse sources are believed to re present the largest remaining water pollution problem affecting united states waters to begin to address these issues th 1987 cwa amendments directed states to implement programs for managing nonpoint sources consequently under federal law agricultural sources could be subject to statedeveloped plans requiring operato rs to use management measures to limit pollutant runoff from their lands

the act epa estimated that only 760 permits were current at the end of 199534 another factor is disputes between regulators and agricultural operators n whether particular facilities meet the

produc quantities of manure than can be risk to water quality and public health these already re considered to be cafos and therefore are point sources already subject to ndpes permit requirements some facilities with fewer than 1000 animal units which can pose risk f water pollution or public health problems because the facilities have manmade conveyance to discharge manure and wastewaters into streams other individual facilities or collection of facilities with fewer than 100 0 animal units that based on water quality monitoring are contributin g significantly to impairment of water body r watershed such facilities will be designated as cafos and will be priority for permit issuance an d enforcement epa expects that the total number of cafos meeting at least one of thre priority conditions for npdes permits will be 15000 20000 facilities thes facilitie s will be required to develop and implement cnmps and their permits wil l include specific performance measures monitoring and reporting under th strategy states and epa should identify the universe of cafos and inspect l cafos in watersheds with vu lnerable waters by 2001 and all other cafos by 2003 permitting will occur in two phases first between 2000 and 2005 epa an d authorized states will issue npdes permits under existing regulations to priorit facilities epa expects that this will occur mainly through general permits eithe r issued on statewide basis r for specific geographic areas such as watersheds but that individual permits will be issued to exceptionally large operations new operations or those undergoing significant expansion operations with historical complianc problems or operations with significant environmental concerns by august 1999 epa will issue permitting guidance and model permits as assistance to states epa also will initiate revis ions to the existing cafo permitting regulations and effluent guidelines using input from usda states tribes other federal agencies and the public epa currently is under courtordered schedule to revise the effluen t guidelines for poultry and swine by december 2001 and for beef and dairy cattle by december 2002 in the second phase of npdes permitting fro m 2005 to 2010 epa and states will reissue permits from the first round and will incorporate any ne w requirements that could result from regulatory revisions completed in the interim the f inal strategy vs the draft the final afo national strategy is similar to the september 1998 draft but has two key additions first it differs from the draft in how it addresses corporate integrators owners of livestock that contract out t farmers to raise the animals or poultry the final strategy recommends co permitting system in which permits would cover not just the grower or farmer but also the corporate owner in such system liability for han dling the animal waste and for any environmental vi olations would extend to the corporate owner that exercises substantial operational control over cafo as well as the farmer such co permitting would be new in the field of federal environmental regulation environ mental groups in particular have urged such copermitting arguing that i t could go long way to improving waste management by involving integrators i n ensuring that their contract growers are environmentally responsible while som states already recognize that corporate owners share responsibility with farmers industry groups have generally opposed including formal requirements in permi thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs25 farm groups fear regulatory intrusion land letter jan 28 1999 241programs in their view it is inappropriate to hold the corporate entity responsible for an environme ntal violation when that entity does not own the farm its buildings the land or the waste produced by the animals in another change from the draft the final strategy allows states that can show they meet the requirements of the npdes program to be recognized by epa s functionally equivalent to requirements of the federal program this part of th strategy recognizes that some states are implementing permitting programs unde r state law th at meet or exceed the requirements of the npdes program see th following section of this report state p rograms and legislative activity states will have to go through review and public notice in order to have their program s recognized as npdes equivalent epa promises in the strategy to act on program proposals within 45 da ys so that states can meet the goal of issuing permits for large cafos by january 2000 the early reaction of state officials to this part of th strategy was posi tive although they said that the details of demonstrating functional equivalency when issued by epa will require careful review reactions and response to the strategy epa and usda received more than 1800 public comments on the draft strategy the strongest reactions both to th draft and final form have come not surprisingly from farmers and farm groups during the public comment period on the draft strategy they raised concerns about regulations that drive up the cost of production and whether financial assistance will be available to sen costly impacts especially on small operations the expense of compliance could increase the cost of food make us farming less competitive and put farmers out of business they say number of farm groups and individuals have expressed fear that national afo strategy will enable epa through clean water rules to trol economic activity and landuse decisions of farmers most would41 prefer that any ani mal waste program focus on voluntary approaches that encourage owners and operators to utilize good environmental practices with regulation an d enforcement limited to only known problems of poor resource management at the same time some operators consider more pronounced federal role as an opportunity to harmonize flicting federal state and local policies view of the pork producers industry for example which believes that minimum nationwide standards could bring stability to livestoc k industries and level the playing field where states and counties are adopti ng patchwork of requirements however support by livestock groups for federal efforts is likely to hinge on whether federal rules ar viewed as unduly restrictive or impose unreali stic deadlines and whether they include incentives such as financial and technical assistance farm groups argue that the wate r quality data on which epa bases the need for regulatory action are flawed because the data reflect monitoring and assessment of only small portion of all waters they should not be used to assert that agriculture and feedlots are linked t water quality crisis these groups contend epa believes that while it is difficult to determine the exact contribution of any particular category of pollution s ource on national basis eg agriculture or municipal point sources

water quality yet because many have acted legislatively and administratively t address animal waste problems see discussion in the next section they fear as do farm groups that national program would attempt to impose one size fits all approach to problem that is diverse and complex however supporters of federal regulation point out that there is great variability among state programs and say that national approach is necessary to provide more even economic playing field b requiring minimum national standards for states key concern has been that many already have difficulty providing resources for feedlot inspections and enforcement thus they are wary of new regulatory requirements that could impose additiona l resource burdens states also say that they need flexibility to coordinate an d prioritize implementation of the federal strategy with other equally important stat environmental quality programs epas concern is to balance the states desire fo r flexibility with the federal agencys desire to have state programs be accountable by meeting minimum federal standards and provide an opportunity if needed for federal enforceability environmentalists reactions to the final strategy were mixed while applauding the fact that the strategy address the waste management responsibility of corporate owners some have said that the proposed timeline to implement the strategy 7 years to issue permits f or all cafos is too slow many are critical that epa failed to act on this p roblem sooner environmentalists often are skeptical of voluntar approaches to managing anima l waste particularly where there is requirement for water quality monitoring or reporting and little or public involvement in siting permitting or similar decisionm aking variability among existing state programs has been concern to environmental groups some have favored federal moratorium on new r expanded feedlots for 2 years for example to give epa and states time to develop and implement new programs and thus were disappointed that moratorium was not included in the final strategy43httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs27 this section is based on information from number of sources including

encompasses the approaches of all states which state agency is in charge or whether responsibility is shared varies in many states regulatory programs are limited t some livestock sectors but not others requirements of stat programs differ for example in minnesota permits are required for facilities with as few as 50 animal units while many states only require permits for facilities with more than 1000 animal units the epa threshold i n nebraska operations of any size require permit if they have potential to discharge as noted pre viously many states do not issue cwa permits to cafos on th premise that the facilities do not discharge wastes several states use letters f approval to authorize livestock operations others use general permits or licenses critics fault these systems concerned that they typically do not afford publi c involvement or provide for enforceability compared with permits general permits take one size fits ll approach which does not consider sitespecific requirements for individual facilities critics say some states iowa for example require permits for construction of wast lagoons and other facilities but not for operation others such as nebraska require permits for both but only in areas where operations are believed to pos environmental risk some states california georgia id aho indiana and oklahoma for example require op erators to follow design standards including use of liners for waste lagoons but many have such standards small but growing number f states require training and certification of operators for manure application an d

programs regardless of their statutor requirements is oversight and enforce ment how diligent state is in enforcing laws and rules federal and state may be reflected in the resources it provides for suc h activities typical of many states in 1998 minnesota had staff of 22 inspectors to regulate 45000 animal feeding operations that require permits meaning that with that level of staff it would

categories bills to establish moratoria on siting and licensing of largescale animal operations in the state bills concerned with which level of government shall control the siting of livestock operations an d regulatory bills the swine industry was dominant but not exclusive focus of state legislation issues debated in the states may presage issues that could arise at th federal level as well in most states where these issues were active in 1998 there were competin g proposals under consid eration representing alternative views of key interest groups in some cases strict state legislation was propose d by the governor in maryland and kentucky for examp but elsewhere the governors office opposed proposals for new regulations that were advocated by lawmakers and some interest group s minnesota and wisconsin in many of these debates environmentalists and small farm operators forme d alliances and urged legislators to regulate the entrance and operation of largescal farming operations which these groups believe pose great environmental risks an d great economic threats to the viability of stablished small family farming operations in many states these two groups have

soils high water tables shallow drinking water wells and extensiv networks of rivers and streams to some observ ers it was not surprising when in mid1995 spills from swine waste lagoons occurred the extent was more surprising one 8acre lag oon spilled 22 million gallons of waste into the neuse river killing 10 llion fish and closing nearly 365000 acres of coastal waters to shellfish harvesting and commercial fishing other waste lagoon spills also occurred that year drawing public attention to some of the environmental and economic consequences of conc entrated animal farming operations in the state but even before those events the 200mile long neuse river had for severa l years experienced algae blooms and fish kills during summer months due to high levels of nutrients from rural and urban runoff and industrial and municipa l discharg in 1997 the environmental group american rivers declared th neuse one of the most 20 threatened rivers in the united states in response the north carolina legislature enacted bills each year sinc 1995 to address animal waste problems 1 995 law mandated buffers between swine houses or lagoons and residential property public buildings such s schools and hospitals and streams or rivers it established blue ribbo n commission which presented recommendations that the legislature addresse d in 1996 that year the state required general permits and fees for all anima l feeding operations mandated annual inspections increased buffers fo r residences and required poultry operations to develop wa ste management plans recognizi ng that animal

either bill and proponent s subsequently managed to put both proposals on the ballot for voters consideration in november 1998 in the fall election voters adopted by wide margin the proposal to

1997 fish kills occurred in certain tributaries of th chesapeake bay in maryland primarily in the pocomoke river drainage basin these fish kills like some that occurred previously in north carolina and othe r coastal waters were attributed to the presence of pfiesteria piscicida in the affected waters some scientists believe that nutrient enric hment of the waters may play role in pfiesteria outbreaks although the mechanisms and linkages ar unclear because of the large number of poultry facilities adjacent to the affected maryland waters animal feeding operating were targeted for research an d management of nutrients maryland took number of actions to address pfiesteria affected waters and nutrient concerns citing human health risks the gover nor closed almost all of the estuaries where fish kills were observed to fishing and recreation the stat surveyed agricultural activities in the affected watersheds centering on the use of best management practices and gricultural nutrient management plans the state offered financial assistance to encourage farmers to grow cover crops to reduc soil erosion and catch nutrient runoff maryland became the first state approved by usda for the conser vation reserve enhancement program crep blue ribbon panel made recommendations about reduc ing nutrient loadings from upland sites generally and from agriculture in particular responding to public healt h concerns and conducting future research and monitoring based on the panels recommendations t he governor presented legislation to the 1998 legislative session containing both incentives and mandates to addres s animal waste problems associated with pfiesteria the governors bill sought to require farmers to adopt and implement nutrient management plans and limi t nutrient application fert ilizer and manure to amounts needed for crop uptake to control the flow of nutrients into state waters maryland would be the first state to require such plans for phosphorus as well as for nitrogen farmers would be subject to fines up to 5000 for noncompli ance the proposal also contained 45 million over 3 years in aid to farmers and tax credits to offset program costs while

ranging from market promotion to producer education t lobbying for favorable legislation and policies t he national pork producers council one such group initiated dialogue to bring together major interests includin g opponents of concentration to address animal waste issues that arise from activities of its members working through americas clean water foundation it organized national dialogue to promote sound environmental activities by pork producers the dialogue started in may 1997 and participants met on eight occasions bot h epa and usda were involv ed and have endorsed the process while two interests environmental groups and local governments chose not to participate fully th dialogue process received positive comment from many who are concerned with the environme ntal effects of animal agriculture it resulted in set of recommendations and proposals issued in december 1997 one purpose of the dialogue was to develop nationallyconsisten t environmental strat egy that would replace the patchwork of responses to major new or expanded proposals and actions at state and local levels that could affect them including moratoria and nuisance lawsuits at congr essional briefing

the spotted owl issue in the pacific northwest old growt h forest areas it was stated tha t major challenge for the council would be to get the full participation of all producers in this program53 implementation of the groups recommendations would not require an congressional acti on all of these recommendations as envisioned in the final report would be implemented through enactment of state and local l egislation and as result of initiatives undertaken by individual producers implementation would start when states adopt framework which would apply immediately to new and expandin g

years coperators and contractors should b certified and employees should be trained cabandoning earthen ba sins and lagoons should be prohibited and program to finance the costs of closure for ne w and expanded facilities should be in place in 5 years in november 1998 epa and the pork industry announced agreement on clean water act compliance audit program cap providing incentiv for pork producers to undertake voluntary onfarm assessments by reducing penalties for any clea n water act violations promptly disclosed and corrected under th program audits are to be conducted by trained and certified independent inspectors at cost to th farmer producers that report and correct violations within specified timetable and otherwi comply with cap agreement are eligible for reduced penalties rangin g from 1000 to 10000 per violation capped at 4000 0 per facility and epa retains the flexibility to waive penalties altogether the pork industry and epa see th program as helping to protect public health and water quality by identifying an d correcting existing or potential violations while giving certainty to industr concern ing epa enforcement industry officials say the program could cost abou t 50 million and that resources to pport it could become an issue initially the cost of the program is being supported by grants from epa and americas clean wate r foundation and by

industry and acceptable to outsiders the council asserts in the dialogue that many of th recommendations are little more than sound business practices tha t should be adopted if they are not already followed by all producers in the sw ine industry the dialogues recommendations provide baseline of expectations for those who raise pork an d potentially for others who raise other types of livestock whether pork producers can meet those expectations and whether they will be acceptable to critics of k production who ma have more substantial expectations are the two questions that will be debated in the future also in 199 8 the poultry industry initiated process similar to the k producers dialogue in hope of avoiding new federal and state rules in december the poultry industry environmental dialogue announced fram ework calling for most poultry producers to prepare voluntary litter management plans by january 2001 plans will be developed in the context of wholefarm nutrient management which conside rs chemical fertilizers nutrients from other animals on farm and nutrien t needs of crops planted on farm unde r the framework farmers would make annual reports to state agencies on the amount of litter produced amounts applied to land and amounts transferred to alternative use integrators are expected to ensure that producers have litter management plans and that produc ers make the annual reports56 the group did not achieve consensus on some issues such as who will pay fo r research and education programs and on the need to control phosphorus runoff as well as nitrogen environmental groups have criticized the exclusively voluntary nature of th pork and poultry industries efforts saying that national standards are needed t address the industries comprehensively because state standards vary greatly they are especially critical that the industry groups do not support requiring corporat owners to take responsibility for the waste produced by animals57 congressional response 105 congress in the 105 congress members of congress responded t oth th increased attention to animal waste management issu two bills introduced in 1998 took different approaches action was taken on either bill although the generated considerable discussion hr 3232 introduced by representative george miller proposed to amend the clean water act with cafospecific provisions currently feedlots are subject to permit requirements in the law that apply to all industrial facilities the bill woul dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs40 see

to obtain discharge permits tightening epas current regulatory threshold by halving the number of animal units triggerin g regulation it would require all cafos to have cwa permits within 18 months and require epa to revise existing cafo regulations within 2 years regulated feedlot operators would have to submit comprehensive nutrient management plans to state or federal permitting authorities the bill would require cwa permit for lan d application of animal waste in excess of amounts needed for agronomic uptake f plants feedlot operators who cease operations would be required to remove an d dispose of all animal waste at the facility second bill in the 105 congress s 1323 introduce d by senator tom harkinth took different approach th focus of this bill was on usda not epa it directed usda to establish minimum required elements and technical standards for anima l waste management plans cafo owners woul d submit such plans to usda in order to operate lawfully and usda would conduct nsite inspection as part of its review and approv process it defined cafos in terms of animal weight capacity meaning feeding oper ations with capacity of more than 400000 pounds for cattle or more than 200000 pounds for other livestock rather than number of animal units this definition would extend regulatory coverage to many additional facilities fo r example animal feeding ope rations with about 400 beef cattle compared with 1000 under current epa rules s 1323 called for usda in consultation with epa to establish maximu m permitted levels for application of animal wast to land based on quantities necessary for efficien t crop nutrient requirements taking into account all sources of nutrients and quantities which do not pose risk of increased soil toxicity or surface or ground water pollution it would be unlawful to apply wastes in excess of such quantities if more waste were produced it wou ld have to be treated for example at an offsite wastewater treatment plant finally s 1323 proposed to make development an d implementation of waste management plan s eligible for eqip funding and to increase total eqip funding from 200 million to 600 million annually through 2002 both bills specifed minimum elements for waste containment systems as well as minimum distance standards for aerial spraying of wastes bot h bills proposed to hold owners of animals integrators j ointly liable with the feedlot operator for application of animal waste in violation of management plan or cafo discharge permit the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee held hearing on s 1323 on april 2 1998 in may the house agricultur committee held an oversight58 hearing on recent epa activities affecting animal agriculture59httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs41 administration and interest group views in recent months interest groups have presented their views on animal waste management to pics in connection with the epausda national strategy discussed above and federal legislation administration views at the april 1998 senate agric ulture committee hearing on s 1323 witnesses from epa and usda said the administration opposed the bill because it would lead to regulatory duplication an d overlap by their two agencies at this hearing held before proposal or issuance of the national strategy usda said it prefers working with farmers on voluntary cooperative basis throug h implementa tion of eqip for example and does not have the resources to take on new regulatory role under the bills expanded coverage usda said the department would be responsible for inspecting 40000 animal feeding operations nationwide under the march 1999 final national strategy epa and states jointly hav responsibility for inspecting afos beginning with cafos in priority watershed s which are part of the estimated 15000 to 20000 that will eventually be required to obtain clean water permits interest group views in commenting on federal legislative proposals interest groups have repeated many of the points also made in connection with th administrations unified national strategy for afos for example several industr groups said that federal legislation is not needed at this time in view of th administrations initiatives together with ongoing state and local activities an d voluntary measures that the industry itself is implementing industry groups say that they do not need regulation but could use technical and financial assistance many state officials have argued that with the extent and range of legislative and regulatory activity occurring in states there is little need for federal legislation tha t could prove disruptive and duplicative of state efforts as on issues related to th national afo strategy state environmental and agricultural off icials do not necessarily object to minimal national uniformity but strongly believe that states and localitie s should not be preempted from imposing tighter controls where they choose to do so environmental and conservation groups support strong national baselin standards for permitting of waste storage facilities and operations and wast application strong federal program base d in law they say would provide for more accountability than programs ru n by state and local jurisdictions and is more likely to ensure that permitting and decisi onmaking includes public participation responding to industries emphasis on using voluntary measures these groups often say tha t voluntary measures are not enough to prevent harmful nutrient runoff moreover they say while many voluntary manure management plans are being developed and implementedand comprehensive nutrient managemen t plans will be developed under the epausda national strategy there is little in formation on how they are working 106 congress issues in the 106 congress legislative attention to anima lth th waste issues could occ ur in connection with reauthorization of the clean water act representative miller has introduced legislation hr 684 similar to the bill h sponsored in the 105 congress hr 3232 like that bill hr 684 would amendth the cwa to tigh ten epas regulatory programs for afos other specific

mhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs42 for additional inf ormation see crs report 98745 clean water action plan budgetary60 initiativesagriculture is likely to be closely related prominent issue if and whe n reauthorization occ urs however comprehensive reauthorization bills have been introduced in the 106 congress and congressional committees have not scheduledth hearings or other legislative activity the march 1999 release of the nati onal afo strategy by epa and usda could prompt variety of congressional activities such as oversight hearings or specifi c proposals to modify the clean water act or other existing laws legislative attention also could occur in connection with the administration s request for funding to implement the clean water action plan the president s fy2000 budget request includes total of 458 million in additional funds t implement this water quality initiative including 126 millio n more for usdas eqip how the presidents priorities will fare in congress depends both on support for the funding requests themselves and on whether the requests are viewed as taking funds away from other programs or projects having congressional priority in 1998 th president s fy1999 budget sought 568 million in increases to fund the plan bu t congress passed appropriations bills that provided less than 15 of the increase d funds requested60 conclusion policy questions social and political pressure to address the environmental impacts of livestock production has grown to the point that many federal policymakers today are asking what to do not whether to do something the setting is one where agricultural policy and environmental policy which traditionally have separate agendas and priorities come together on some points major direc tion of inquiry is what strategies will be effective and attainable who shou ld be responsible for developing and implementing strategies to address known and future problems and who should bear the burdens of new strategies animal waste management issues are one set of concerns along with number of thers that currently face animal agriculture generally underlying the current discussion is broader debate as well should evolving policies dea l primarily with residues of livestock production or should policies also seek t influence the ongoing trends in the industry towards concentration of animals among smaller numbers of producers consideration of the following questions is likely to shape policies that are developed to address the waste management issues irrespective of how other societal concerns also are addressed what is the federal role today federal state and local gove rnments currently have numerous programs and policies in place that address animal waste issues at the federal level policies include epas existing regulatory programs implementing water quality requirements and usdas technical assistance and incentive paymen t programs to farmer s especially through the new eqip with release of the national afo strategy both will be c oordinating their activities to implement that plan both also will be coordinating activities to address agricultural p ollution generally under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs43 for example commercially available amendments such as slaked lime or alum can reduce61 ammonia nitrogen volatilization and phosphorus solubility of poultry waste but may not be considered affordable or economically justified by farm operatorsadministra tions clean water action plan one question in terms of epa program changes resulting from the national afo strategy is whether and if so how it will propose to modify the current regulatory thres hold of 1000 animal units and possibly bring more animal feeding operations clearly under epas rules many othe r questions will be raised as epa develops r evised feedlot rules including what type of water quality monitoring requirements and land application standards should be set at the federal level ve rsus by state and local governments one issue to watch over time is the availability of funding and staff for both epa and usda as the implement new programs and initiatives what should the federal role be vis vis state and local roles state an d local governments implement variety of regulatory siting and zoning technica l assistance and cost share programs key question especially in view of the varied state and local policies that also now exist is what degree of federal leadership and national consistency is appropriate and how federal policies will blend with those of states and localities as discussed previously some groups and individuals favor strengthened federal role that holds states to minimum national consistency fo r example the national pork producers council advocates minimum na tional standards which it has recommended through its dialogue others would prefer that states have the lead role in policy formulation based on their knowledge of geographic climatic economic or other unique factors while limiting the federal ro to providing guidance and financial assistance related question i s how the federal role might change over time because of legislative and admin istrative actions by growing number of states further there are questions about additional aspects of the federal role generally in addressing animal waste issues for example is there role for government i n supporting efforts to facilitate exchange or transfer of manure to lessen imbalance s between areas with intense animal production and areas with fewer livestock farms where the nutritive value of manure can be used is there need for government t encoura ge certain manure management practices with potential for increasing th nutrient value while reducing offsite damages what levels of financial assistance61 can and should the federal government provide to farm operators andor states fo r implemen tation of waste management planning how should federal funds t operators be provided direct ly from federal agencies routed through states which determine highpriority needs or some other system also because current federal environmental programs do not deal with animal waste impacts on groundwater r air quality there is question of whether federal policy should address thes concerns which are beyond the clean water act regime related question concerns how to balance the roles of epa and usda i n terms of federal responsibility and policy directi on this split was reflected by the two legislative proposals introduced in the 105 congress one emphasizing epas rol eth under the clean water act hr 3232 reintroduced in the 106 congress as hrth 684 the other focusin g on enhanced responsibility for usda s 1323 implicitly this question asks whether animal waste is viewed primarily as an environmenta lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs44 pollution problem or primarily as an agricultural resource management problem answers may not represent eitheror policy choices but could involve bette r coordinat ion of the agencies differing roles which is key goal of th administrations clean water action plan what balance of federal regulation and voluntary approaches is needed this question is closely related to those concerning the appropriate federal role and the way in which animal waste management is viewed as policy matter if it i s viewed as point source pollution problem epas traditional regulatory tools f standard setting permitting compliance deadlines and enforcement are the ke available tools alte rnatively if viewed as an agricultural resource issue the desired policy tools might be those most familiar to the agriculture community non regulatory incentivebased approaches here too solutions are unlikely to be exclusive eitheror determinations solution s are more likely to be broadbased along the lines and consistent wit h evolvin g policies which view resource management problems especially thos involving water resources at the scale of watersheds some view watershe d management as the next generation of both pollution control and resourc management policies since it is co ncept centered on addressing the highestpriority problems within geographic areas that encompass multiple economic and resourc activities and multiple ownerships it seeks to move beyond focusing on individual chemical contaminants or their sources to broader assessment of all sources f impairment within the watershed including habitat degradation air quality impacts biological factors or polluted runoff in many watersheds agricultural source s cropland and livestock will be part of the mix solving problems on watershe d basis may involve mix of policy tools funding grants and loans land us management regulation technical assistance and educatio n marketbased approaches such as trading of effluent reduction requirements by point and nonpoint sources and coordination among federal stat and local levels of government these are the kinds of policy and program tools that epa usda and other agencies are usin g today whether they wi ll be the correct or exclusive tools to address future problems remains to be determined what kinds of additional research and evaluation are needed expert s identify number of areas of research needed to in form current and new animal waste management policies first many believe basic research on using and disposing f manure is crucial odor manage ment is key air quality concern although this topic may be hi gher priority to industry states and localities than to the federa l government which has regulatory interest as of now other research needs include improved soil tests to determine nutrient application rates and methods improve d systems to identify water resources at risk from manure and fertilizers ie those where geology soils and climate create potential for runoff and erosion and better understanding of the possible effects of concentrated animals and their waste on air quality broader federal issues in which research on animal agriculture could be useful component include the role of concentrated animal populations in globa l warming and patterns of atmospheric deposition and possible effects on huma n health httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98451crs45 two related questions are who should take the lead on research question s government or industry for example and whether some research must preced implementation for example studies on crop uptake of nutrients and application of phytase or other nutrientreducing enzymes in feed how the results of relevan t federally funded research and technology development will be tra nsferred to the public and private sectors and the commercial marketplace also is an issue efforts t educate and assist farms in understanding the value of manure as soil amendment and the use of alternate disposal techniques seem likely to be priority further ne part of research agenda is likely to be more complete evaluation and monitoring of programs both ongoing and new what programs ie governme ntal and private sector are underway and how effective they are i n addressing animal waste issues could be exam ined evaluation activities will provide accountability especially where federal dollars are spent and will aid in determining what steps are needed to address remaining problems is federal legislation needed this finally is the question of how congres s will choose to address national policies on animal wast management legislation has been proposed to guide epa andor usda activities and thus influence states and livestock producers at issue is wh ether current federal policies especially the epa usda national afo strategy alone will be adequate to address animal wast problems nationally and encourage improv ed management practices congress could likewise guide the agencies activities through the appropriations process by eithe r limiting or ex panding funding for specific programs and initiatives or more broadly for the administrations clean water action plan
