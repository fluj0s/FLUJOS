supervisory harassment so vere that it drove the employee to quit constructive discharge in effect the court in an opi nion by justice ginsburg with only justice thomas dissenting accepted the theory of constructive discharge as tangible employment action but it also set conditions under which the employer could assert an affirmative defense and avoid strict liability under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act4 the issue is of key importance for determinin g the scope of employers vicarious liability in supervisory sexual harassment cases alleging hostile work environment legal background employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors originally courts drew distinction for purposes of employer liability between so called quid pro quo and hostile environment claims of sexual harassment the former consist of cases where supervisor threatens to grant or withhold tangible job benefits or to inf lict detrimental job cons equences based on subordinates response to unwelcome sexual advances by the supervisor employers were uniformly held liable whether or not they knew of the harassmen t or had any policy against it for any retaliation suffered by employees who resisted this form of sexual extortion but the quid pro quo theory failed to address the plight of employees who refused the supervisors advances without adverse c onsequence or who submitte d to save their jobs in meritor savings bank v vinson 5 the court recognized hostile environment sexual harassment which dispensed with the need for any tangible harm psychological or economic to pursue title vii claim in hostile environment action the plaintiff must demonstrate unwelcome sexu conduct of verbal physi cal or visual nature that is so severe and pervasive as to alter em ployment terms and c onditions by creating subjectively and objectively hostile abusive or offensive working environment meritor however did not define standard for holding employers liable for harassing conduct by their supervisors which led to varying lower court approaches one approach held the employer st rictly liable for the acts of its supervisors other courts applied negligence standard holding em ployers liable only for harassment of which they were both aware and failed to prevent middle course emphasized as factors whether the employer had reason to know of the harassment or had formal anti harassment policy in place the supreme court in farager and ellerth sought to allay some of this judicial confusion as to the nature and scope of an employers legal liability for the discriminatory and harassing conduct of its supervisors in title vii cases it held employers strictly liable for sexually hostile work environment created by supervisor when the challenged discrimination or harassment results in t angible employment action6 but in the absence of such company act the employer may raise an affirmative defense based on its having in place reasonable re medial process and on the employees failurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21702crs3 7 ellerth 524 us at 761to take advantage of it thus the ellerthfarager defense has two components that the employer exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and b that the pl aintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise the supreme court defined tangible employment action categorically to mean any significant change in employment status that may but not always result in economic harm specifically the term includes hiring firing failing to promote reassignment with significantly different responsibilities or decision causing significant change in benefits7 however constructive discharge where the employee quits claiming that conditions are so intolerable that he or she was effectively fired presented an unresolved issue could an employer faced with claim of constructive discharge still assert the ellerthfarager defense the suders case nancy suders was hired by the pe nnsylvania state police as police communications officer in march 1998 she claime d that she was forced to resign her job in august 1998 because of sexually hostile work environment created by three male supervisors and harassment due to her age and political ffiliation the conduct alleged included repeated episodes of namecalling explicit sexual gesturing obscene and offensive sexual conversation and the posting of vulgar images in the workplace suders complained to the employers equal empl oyment opportunity officer but received assistance in resolving her problem near the end of her tenure suders was accused of theft of records from the barracks and as result was handc uffed photographed and held for questioning immediately after this incident she resigned suders filed federal district court lawsuit alleging that the state police and the individual defendants had subjected her to hostile work environment based on her sex age and political affiliation and had constructively discharged her in violation of title vii the age discrimination in employment act and the pennsylvania human relations act at the close of discovery the defenda nts successfully moved for summary judgment suders claims raised genuine hostile environment issues but the district court found the state police were shielded from strict title vii liability by the faragerellerth affirmative defense threejudge panel of the third circuit agreed that suders claim of hostile work environment stated genui ne issue for the trie roffact the district courts analysis regarding the faragerellerth affirmative defense however was flawed for two reasons first whether the state police exercised reasonable care to prevent the harassment remained in dispute more importantly the district court failed to consider the merits of suders constructive discharge claim and whether valid claim of this nature would affect the availability of the affirmative defense the constructive discharge doctrine originated in federal labor law and was later transposed by judicial interpretation to employment discrimination cases basically the courts have held that an employee alleging constructive discharge must demonstrate the concurrence of two factors 1 she suffered harassment or discrimination so intolerablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21702crs4 8 jaros v lodge net enter corp 294 f3d 960 8th cir 2002 9 caridad v metronorth commuter railroad 191 f3d 283 2d cir 1999concluding that constructive discharge does not constitute tang ible employment action cert denied 529 us 1107 2000 10 turner v dowbrands inc 221 f3d 1336 6th cir 2000 11 according to the opinion with these realities in mind if we were to hold that constructive discharge does not constitute tangible employment action employers would undoubtedly catch on to the availability of the affirmative defense even if the victimized employee resigns from objectively intolerable conditions at wo rk under such rule the temptation of employers to preserve their affirmative defense would be overwhelming in many situations some employers might wish for an employee to quit voluntarily others might even tacitly approve of increased harassment to achieve that result in any event the benefits of stepping in to remedy the hostile work environment are measurably cloudier 325 f3d at 461 12 idthat reasonable person in the same position would have felt compe lled to resign and 2 the employees reaction to the workplace situ ation was reasonable given the totality of circumstances because of its direct econo mic harm to employees the third circuit joined the eighth circuit 8 in concluding that constructiv discharge if proven is the functional equivale nt of an actual dismissal and am ounts to tangible employment action taking the opposite position the second9 and sixth10 circuits had decided that voluntary resignation as opposed to dismi ssal was never the kind of official action that deprived the employer of its legal defe nses otherwise constructive discharge would have been included in the recital of tangib employment actions listed by the supreme court in the faragherellerth opinions moreover constr uctive discharge could result from actions of coworkers for which employer s have never been held vicariously liable as well as supervisory harassment fina lly the opposing circuits refused to view constructive discharge as tangible employment action because it is unilateral act of the employee that is neither instigat ed nor ratified by the employer writing for the third circuit in suders however judge fuentes was convinced that to permit the affirmative defense in constructive discharge cases would discourage active intervention by employers to prevent harassment at its earliest stages and could even promote its continuation11 conversely he did not believe that its decision would encourage precipitate or irre sponsible action by victimized employees because of the stringent test for proving cons tructive discharge it is highly unlikely that the employee will walk off of the job at the first sign of harassment and expect to prevail under title vii12 consequently whenever an employ ee shows that working conditions have become so unendurable as to lead reasonabl employee to resign without formally being dismissed the employer would be strictly liable for compensatory and punitive damages or other title vii relief or in suders case when an employee has raised genuine issue of material fact as to claim of constructive discharge an employer may not assert or otherwise rely on the affirmative fense in support of its motion for summary judgmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21702crs5 the supreme court ruling justice ginsburgs opinion in suders applied the framework of the courts 1998 rulings to stake out middle ground between the conflicting approach to constructive discharge taken by the courts of appeals the only real difference between the harassment in ellerthfarager and this case was one of degree that is suders presented worst case scenario or harassment racheted up to the breaking point but constructive discharge claim requires more than pattern of severe or pervasive workplace abuse as would satisfy the legal standard for ordi nary harassment employees advancing compound claims must also prove that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign such objectively intolerable conditions could result from cow orker conduct unofficial supervisory act or official company acts the courts earlier d ecisions applied agency principles to define employer vicarious liability for superviso rs harassment of subordinates only when supervisory misconduct is aided by the agency relation as evidenced by tangible or official act of the terprise is the employers re sponsibility so obvious as to warrant strict liability when tangible employment action is taken the basis for imputing blame on the employer is less evident and the focus shifts to the title vii policy of prevention the employer may then defeat vicarious liability by showing that it had reasonable antiharassment procedures in place that the employee unreasonably failed to utilize the supreme court affirmed that title vii encompasses employer liability for constructive discharge claims attributable to supervisor it disagreed however with the third circuits conclusion that the affirmative defense from ellerth and faragher was never available in such cases the third ci rcuit equated c onstructive discharge with tangible employment action in effect conflating what the cour t viewed to be two separate inquiries thus while actual termination alwa ys involves an official company act justice ginsburg reasoned constructive discharge may or may not consequently when an official act eg demotion paycut job transfer or ot her official directions or directions likely known to the employer doe s not underlie the cons tructive discharge the role of the agency relationship in the supervisors misconduct is uncertain and the employer is entitled to the benefit of the affirmative defense the third circuit erred in drawing the line differently justice ginsburg elaborated under its formulation the affirmative defense would be eliminated in all hostile environment constructive discharge cases but retained as ellerth and faragher require in ordinary hostile environment cases ie cases involving tangible employment action that placement of the line anomalously would make the graver claim of hostileenvironment constructive discharge easier to prove than its lesser included component hostile work environment moreover the third circuits formulation that court itself recognized would make matters complex indeed more than little confusing to jurors creation of hostile work environment is necessary predication to hostile environment construc tive discharge case juries would be so informed under the third circuits deci sion jury presumably would be cautioned to consider the affirmativedefense evid ence only in reaching decision on the hostile environment claim and to ignore or at ast downplay the same evidence in deciding the closely associated constructive discharge cl aim it makes scant sense thus to alterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21702crs6 13 suders slip opinion at p 18the decisive instructions from one claim to the next when the only variation between the two claims is the severity of the hostile working conditions13 the court was critical of one other aspect of the third circuit decision while rejecting the availability of the affirmative defense in any constructive discharge case the appeals court suggested that the existence of an effective antiharassmen t policy may nonetheless be relevant to the threshol d question of whether the hara ssment was intolerable and the employees decision to quit reasonable one in response justice ginsburg sought to clarify that the employer rather the employee has the ultimate burden of proving the unreasonableness of the employees actions in this regard in his dissenting opinion justice thomas faulted the court for adoptin g an overly broad defi nition of constructive discharge which improperly failed to demand proof by th employee that supervisory harassment was intended to force resignation conclusion in recognizing hostile environment constructive discharge claims suders enhanced title vii protection for employees who quit their jobs over intense sexual harassment by supervisor but the decision also makes it eas ier for an employer to defend against such claims by showing that it has reasonabl procedures for reporting and correcting harassment of which the employee failed to avail herself only if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to an empl oyersanctioned adverse acti on officially changing her employment status or situa tion for example humiliating demotion extreme cut in pay or transfer to position in which she woul d face unbearable working condition is the employer made strictly liable for monetary damages or other title vii relief moreover even where there has been tangible empl oyment action coupled with constructive discharge or resignation the em ployer may have defenses ava ilable first the employer may argue that the harassing conduct did not occur as alleged or was not sufficiently severe pervasive or unwelcome to meet st andards for title vii violation second if the tangible employment action is shown to be unrelated to the alleged harassment or is taken for legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons partic ularly if by persons other than the alleged harasser the employer might escape liability finally the employer might be able to demonstrate that whatever fo rm the underlying supervisory harassment may take it did not meet the standard for cons tructive discharge so intolerable that reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign but suders also makes it more difficult to obtain summary judgment and avoid jury trials in sexual harassment cases involving constructive discharge claims under the decision if there is any real dispute about whether the employee suffered tangib employment action the employer may not rely on the affirmative defe nse to obtain summary judgment
