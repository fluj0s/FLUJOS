sent to the president and does not become law reflects the agreement of the house and senate and serves as an internal guide to congre ssional action on legislation to implement budget policies the

matters such as reconciliation directives enforcement of budget resolution policie s relies primarily upon points of order and reconciliati on procedures keyed to the budget levels establis hed in the budget resolution pointoforder provisions c ontained in the 1974 act which sometimes are supplemented by pointoforder provisions carried in annual b udget resolutions allow any member in either chamber to prevent the consideration of legislation that would violate budget resolution policies9 of course points of order are not self enforcing and may be waived with sufficient majority thereby allowing legislation in violation of budget resolution policies to be considered in the senate most of the points of order pertaining to budget enfor cement require the affi rmative vote of three fifths of the membership 60 votes if seats are vacant in order to be waived the purpose of the budget reconciliation pro cess which is an optional procedure that operates as an adjunct to the annual budget resolution is to change substantive law so that revenue mandatory spending and public debt limit levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies the reconciliation pro cess is discussed in more detail below constraints on the growth of discreti onary spending which is provided in annual appropriations acts relies primarily on the enforcement of spending suballocations made by each of the hous and senate appropr iations subcommittees under section 302b of the 1974 act c onstraints on the growth of mandatory spending which is provided mainly in s ubstantive law rely principally on the enforcement of spending allocations made to each legislative committee under section 302a of the 1974 act as we ll as on the reconciliation process as stated earlier the house and sena reached final agreement on budget resolution for fy2006 hconres 95 on april 28 200510 the aggregate and functional spending levels in the budget resolution and the spending allocations made to the house and senate appropriations committees reflected the assumption that discretionary spending for fy 2006 would total 843 billion in new budget authority plus an additional 50 billion for costs of the war on terrorism in addition the budget resolution included rec onciliation instructions expected to lead to the development of several reconciliation measures including an omnibus spending bill that would reduce manda tory outlays by about 35 billion over fy2006fy2010 the hastert plan could be established on formal basis by revising pertinent budget levels and re lated matters in the fy2006 budget resolution specifically the aggregate spending levels and functional alloca tions of spending and the spending suballocations made under s ection 302b to the house and senate appropriations committees could be reduced to reflect the anticipated acrosstheboard spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs6 11 for further information on this topic see crs report rl33122 congressional budget continuedcut in addition the reconciliation instru ctions to achieve savings in mandatory outlays could be increased by the amount contemplated by the plan and the associated spending aggregates functional allocations and committee allocations under section 302a could be further reduced accordingly finally the resultant deficit levels could be re vised downward for consistenc with the reduced spending levels there are two main procedural adva ntages to revising the fy2006 budget resolution at this late point in the session first by revising all of the pertinent elements of th budget resoluti on the total dimensions of the plan and its implications for each element are more readily apparent the embodiment of the plan in legislative vehicle would afford members an opportunity to debate it as whole and possibly to offer amendments to it second revision of the budget levels would provide an updated basis of enforcemen t particularly with regard to adjusted section 302b suballocations of spending applicable to the consideration of the remaining regular and supplemen tal appropriations acts for fy2006 an attempt to revise the fy2006 budget re solution at this late point in the session may however entail pr ocedural disadvantages the eight house and eight senate committees subject to spending reconciliation instructions for example may all finish their ma rkups of rec onciliation submissions before revised budget resolution is adopted although house and senate leaders previously requested that they boost mandatory outlay savings bey ond the instructed levels some committees may not be able to do so to the degree c ontemplated by revised budget resolution or at all accordingly some committees might find themselves out of compliance with revised reconciliation instruction with little or opportunity to resolve the matter the principal difficulty with respect to revision of the budget resolution in this instance is that senate leaders have not i ndicated desire to join the house in such an effort inasmuch as budget resolu tion reflects the concurrence of the two chambers action by only one chamber may seem like futile or empty gesture by some nonetheless action by the house but not the senate on budget resolution revisions may be seen as means of ga rnering support for the later implementation of the plan in that chamber although revision of the fy2006 budget resolution may be desirable in furthering the goals of the hastert plan the goals still may be accomplished without such revision there is procedural impediment to approving discretionary spending leve ls that are less than those allowed under the section 302b suballocations or in achieving savings in mandatory outlays that are greater than those required under the reconciliati on instructions these outcomes can be achieved with only simple majority votes in each chamber pursuant to the 1974 act and related h ouse and senate prac tices budget levels and other matters in budget resolution may be revised or adjust ed in several ways11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs7 11 continued resolutions revisions and adjustments by robert keith 12 section 304 of the 1974 act originally was codified at 31 usc 1325 in the title dealing with money and finance as part of the recodification and enactment of title 31 under pl 97258 sept 13 1982 the provision was moved to title 2 which pertains to the congress 13 the reconciliation process is examined extensively in crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jrthe hastert plan advocates the use of revised budget resolution which may be the most practical means of making budget resolution revisions at this stage of the budget process other means of revision involve significant shortcomings such as entailing significant delay ie by folding revisions for fy2006 into the fy2007 budget resolution or being anticipated beforehand ie through the inclusion of reserve funds or other procedures in the fy2006 budget resolution section 304 of the 1974 act authorizes the house and senate to adopt revised budget resolution for fiscal year as separate measure12 this action may occur at any time after the initial budget resolution for that fiscal year required by section 301 has been agreed to but before the app licable fiscal year has ended the revised budget resolution may change any or all of the budget levels or other matter contained in prior resoluti on or merely reaffirm them during the consideration of revised budget resolution the regular procedures for the consideration of budget resolu tion set forth in section 305 of the 1974 act apply section 305b1 provides deba limitation of 15 hours in the senate for the consideration of revised budget re solution compared to debate limitation of 50 hours for the budget resoluti on required under section 301 the house and senate adopted revi sed budget resolution under section 304 as separate measure only once in marc h 1977 for fy1977 due to the fact that two budget resolutions already had been dopted in 1976 for fy1977 as was required at the time the revised budget resolution wa s referred to as the third budget resolution for that fiscal year the velopment of the third budget resolution for fy1977 stemmed from budget revisions including stimulus package submitted to congress by incoming president jimmy cart er at the beginning of the 1977 session budget reconciliation process as indicated previously the purpose of the budget reconciliation proce ss is to change substan tive law so that revenue mandatory spending and pub lic debt limit levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies13 reconciliation is twostep process under the first step reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing one or more committees in each house to devel op legislation that changes revenues spending or the public debt limit by the amounts specified in the budget resolution under the second step of the reconc iliation process rec onciliation legislation is considered in the house and senate under

th policies of the budget resolution are put into effect or the reconciliation legislation is vetoed and the veto is not overridden the fy2006 budget resolution included rec onciliation instructions expected to lead to the development of three different reconciliation measures 1 an omnibus spending bill that would reduce manda tory outlays by about 35 billion over fy2006fy2010 2 revenue bill that w ould reduce revenues by 70 billion over the same period and 3 bill that would increase the limit on the public debt by 781 billion the hastert plan advocates increasing the savings in mandatory outlays by 15 billion over fy2006fy2010 as discusse d above revised budget resolution could be adopted that would increase the spending reconciliation instructions to some or all of the eight house and eight senate committees already subject to them the adoption of revised budget resolution is not necessary however to achieve this outcome the savings targets set in the spending reconciliation instructions are viewed as floors not ceilings accordin gly each of the instructed committees may recommend savings that exceed the instru cted levels without committing procedural violations under the fy2006 budget resolution each of the committees subject to spending reconciliation instructions was to submit its recommendations to its respective budget committee by september 16 2005 by informal agreement the deadline was extended into late october when the house and senate budget committees are scheduled to assemble and report the omnibus reconciliation bill to the extent that committee submissions to the budget committees do not increase the mandatory outlay savings by an additional 15 billi on additional savings could be proposed during house nd senate floor action on the omnibus reconciliation bill in assembling the omnibus measure the budget committees are proscribed by the 1974 act from making any substantive revision in the legislative recommendations submitted to them by the instructed committees while floor amendments proposing great er mandatory outlay savings could be offered they could run afoul of other pro cedural obstacles such as the requirement that amendments to reconciliation measures be germane constraints on the offering of such amendments could be set aside in the house by the use of special rule reported by the house rules committee in the house reconciliation measures usually are considered under the terms of special rule in the senate the motion to recommit with instructions also is available and it affords more latitude with respect to germaneness if it is used to remedy noncomp liance by committee amendments offered in the senate are subj ect to an additional constraint the byrd rule section 313 of the 1974 act which bars the inclusion of extraneous material14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs9 15 these spending cuts are discussed in detail in crs report rl32153 acrosstheboard spending cuts in omnibus appropriations acts by robert keithacrosstheboard cut in discretionary spending another element in the hastert plan is an acrosstheboard cut in discretionary spending although the size of the cut and other features rema in to be determined acrosstheboard spending cuts typically take the form of rescissions of specified percentage of budget authority or other resources but coul d be formulated as rescissions of fixed amounts as well the house and senate have considerable experience in recent years in using acrosstheboard cuts in discretionary sp ending to achieve certain budgetary goals in five of the past six fiscal ears fy2000fy2005 excluding fy2002 congress and the president brought action on the regu lar appropriations acts for the fiscal year to close by incorporating unfinished act s into an omnibus appropriations measure each of the five omnibus act s included an acrosstheboard spending cut to offset part of the measures cost15 the five acrosstheboard spending cuts enacted previously which were all stated as percentages ranged in size from 022 to 080 of c overed appropriations and an estimated 11 billion to 35 billion in savings the 038 cut for fy2000 in pl 106113 saved an estimated 24 billion in budget authority the 022 cut for fy2001 in pl 106554 saved an estimated 11billion in budget authority the 065 cut for fy2003 in pl 1087 saved an estimated 26 billion in budget authority the 059 cut for fy2004 in pl 108199 saved an estimated 28billion in budget authority and the 080 cut for fy2005 in pl 108447 saved an estimated 35billion in budget authority an acrosstheboard cut of 10 in ll discretionary spending for fy2006 to illustrate the potential budgetary impact w ould yield savings of 843 billion in new budget authority for that year with an quivalent amount of outlay savings spread out over several years if th fy2006 appropriations adhere to the budget resolution assumption of 843 billion in new budget au thority not counting the additional 50 billion for the war on terrorism if an omnibus appropriations act is not used to wrap up action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2006 an acrossthe board spending cut could be included in any of the remaining appropriations acts nd made applicable to all or some of the other appropriations acts by expanding the application of an acrosstheboard spending cut to other appropriations acts provision might be judged as legislative in character which generally violates house and senate rules the rules are not self enforcing however and should such poi nt of order threaten the spendingcut provision the point of order c ould be waived by simple majority in either chamberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs10 16 exempted appropriations acts were referenced explicitly in the spending cut provisions except for fy2003 in that year the spending cut was made applicable to the 11 regular appropriations acts covered by the omnibus m easure but not to the defense and military construction appropriations act s which had been enacted as freestanding measuresaside from the percentage or fixed amount to be used in making reductions several features of the acrosstheboard spe nding cut would affect the level of savings and the manner in which the cuts are impleme nted first the types of funding to be covered by the spending cuts would have to be decided initially for fy2000 and fy2001 coverage included discretionary budget authority provided for the fiscal year in the applicable appropriations acts and obligation limits imposed in the acts the coverage of the spending cuts was expanded beginning with fy2003 to advance appropriations for the fiscal year provided in prioryear appropriations acts as well as to contract authority for the fiscal year subject to limitations set forth in the covered annual ppropriations acts second the number of regula r appropriations acts subject to the spending cuts and whether there would be exemptions fo r particular accounts or programs would have to be determined in the past coverage of regu lar appropriations acts under the cuts have ranged from 10 acts for fy2005 to 13 acts for fy2000 the fy2000 acrosstheboard spending cut which was th only one of the five to apply to all 13 of the regular appropriations acts covered the five acts incorporated into the omnibus measure as well as the eight acts that d been enacted as freestanding laws the expanded coverage of the spending cut was accomplished by making it apply to funding provided for that fiscal ear in this or any other act in the remaining instances between one and three of the regular appropriations acts were exempted from the spending cuts the laborhhseducation appropriations act was exempted for fy 2001 the homeland secu rity appropriations act was exempted for fy2005 and th defense and military construction appropriations acts were exempted for fy2003 fy2004 and fy200516 further exemptions were provided for specified accounts and pr ograms and supplemental appropriations acts military personnel accounts for exampl were exempted specifically from the spending cuts for fy2000 and fy2001 these accounts also were exempted in subsequent years by virt ue of the exclusion of the entire defense appropriations act third it would remain to be decided if the reductions imposed by the percentage cuts would be made subject to pr oportionality requirement or percentage limitation the fy2000 cut required that fense accounts be reduced uniformly with regard to nondefense accounts propor tional cuts were not required but program project or activity ppa within an account could be reduced by more than 15 the cuts for the other four year s required proportional reductions to all accounts and ppas some but not all of the previous acro sstheboard

amount to be resc inded the accounts and programs involved the estimated fiscal and program effects and the reasons for the rescission multiple rescissions can be grouped in single message the comp troller general who heads the government accountability office m onitors the impoundment process in part to ensure that congress is pr operly notified of rescissions after the message has been submitted to it congress has 45 days of continuous session usually larger number of calendar days during which it can pass rescission bill dealing with one or more of the proposed rescissions congress may rescind all part or none of the amounts proposed by the president rescission bills are considered under expedited procedures in each chamber as provided for under section 1017 of the act in

and expenditure if the president fails to release funds at the expiration of the 45day period for proposed rescissions the comp troller general may bring it to compel their release this has been rare occurrence however as matter of practice the house and senate typically deal with rescissions in regular or supplemental appropriations acts rather than rescission bills17 the most recent and perhaps most well known instance in which congress acted on rescission bill occurred in 1992 on march 20 1992 president george hw bush made speech in which he critic ized congress for wasteful spending and

amount ed in the aggregate to just under 8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs12 19 see for example the special message of march 10 1992 proposing 30 rescissions in federal register vol 57 63 apr 1 1992

topic see crs report rl30619 examples of legislative provisions in omnibus appropriations acts by robert keith in most cases there is bar against an agency spending appropriated funds that may have been appropriated in violation of house or senate rulesbillion19 although the president focused on exam ples of what he considered to be wasteful domestic spending eg prickly pear research more than 7 billion in rescissions involved defens spending including the cancellation of two seawolf submarines20 congress responded with single rescission b ill hr 4990 s 2403 considered pursuant to the impoundment c ontrol act of 1974 th senate passed s 2403 on may 6 by vote of 6138 while th house passed hr 4990 the next day may 7 by vote of 4122 the bill was acted into law on june 4 as pl 102298 less than three months after presid ent bush first made his proposals the rescission act provided slightly more in rescissions about 82 billion than the president had requested while some of the presidents rescissions proposals were accepted in whole or in part eg one of the seawolf submarines was cancelled others were not accepted at ll in some instances congress substituted rescissions that had not been requested by the president eg reductions in the strategic defense initiative under the hastert plan congress c ould await rescission proposals from the president or initiate its own it could act on them in the form of rescission bill under the impoundment control act of 1974 or it could include them in annual appropriations acts for fy2006 that still are pending deauthorization most discretionary spendi ng programs are created and funded under twostep process the first step involves the creation of the program in authorizing legislation while the s econd step involves funding the program by means of an annual appropriations act house rule xxi and senate rule xvi reinforce this dichotomy by generally prohibiting appropriations for unauthorized programs and barring the inclusion of gislative provisions in appropriations acts the procedural barriers between authorizin g measures and appropriations acts are not ironclad however so metimes unauthorized programs are funde d and legislative provisions are included in appropriations acts21 authorizing legislation may include one or more provisions that explicitly authorize the enactment of appropriations the energy policy act of 2005 pl 109 58 august 8 2005 for example provide s an authorization of appropriations in section 107 119 stat 612 for the advanced building efficiency testbed section 107 reads in part there are authorized to be appropriated to the secretary to carry out this section 6000000 for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2008 to remainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs13 22 house appropriations committee reducing government wast by terminating low priority programs press release july 11 2005 available at h ttp www appropriationshousegov 23 from time to time sunset legislation has been proposed to establish regular comprehensive procedure for the periodic re view and possible termination of federal programs but such legislation has not been enacted into lawavailable until expended while section 107 of the act does not provide any funds to the program it does authorize specific amounts accordingly annual appropriations of up to 6 million could be considered in fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 without incurring violation under house rule xxi or senate rule xvi in many instances the underlying law th at created federal program remains in effect on permanent basis but selected elements of the authorizing law such as authorization of appropriations provisions are modified or renewed from time to time comprehensive authorizations for certain departments and agencies such as the defense department are made on recurring annual or multiyear cycle during the fy2006 appropriations cycle so far the house appropriations committee has recommended the rmination of 98 programs that were funded in the prior year or newly proposed in the presidents budget for fy200622 in budgetary parlance the programs have been zeroed out ie terminated by virtue of having received funding for the upcoming fiscal year according to the committee the terminations would save more than 43 billion the hastert plan proposes to pe rmanently eliminate these 98 programs through deauthorization there are veral possible ways to deauthorize program including 1 repealing the underl ying authorization law 2 repealing the provisions in the underlying authorizati on law that authorize the enactment of appropriations if such provisions were used or 3 enacting new law that nullifies the operation of the underlying law eg secti on xxx of pl yyyzzz shall have force or effect other methods to deau thorize programs may be available as well while the hastert plan presumes that the deauthorized programs would be terminated permanently there is guarantee that future congress would not decide to renew one or more the programs it is not cl ear by what means the long term savings from deauthorizati on if any would be estimated there is established procedure devoted to the deauthorization of programs so it is not clear what type of legislative vehicle would be used23 the consideration of single measure that incorporates th necessary deauthorizing language could be accommodated in the house through the use of special rule reported by the house rules committee in the senate such measure would not likely fall under any of the categories of expedited legislation consequently it probably would be subject to filibuster in the event filibuster ccurred debate could be brought to close by adopting cloture an action that would requi re the affirmative vote of 60 senators prior to invoking cloture nongermane ame ndments presumably could be consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33127crs14 24 for more information on sequestration see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith 25 see crs report rs21378 termination of the payas yougo paygo requirement for fy2003 and later years by robert keithsequestration some recent media reports on the hastert plan have stated that the sequestration process is available as means of securing offsets these reports are incorrect the sequestration process was established under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as modified by the budget enforcement acts of 1990 and 1997 and other laws as m eans of enforcing deficit targets and later discretionary spending limits and the payasyougo p aygo requirement24 sequestration involved automatic largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs triggered by the issuan ce of report by the director of office of management and budget indicating violation of the pertinent budgetary constraint the procedures for enforcing the discretionary spending limits expired as scheduled at the end of fy2002 the procedures for enforcing the paygo requirement which we re scheduled to expire at the end of fy2006 for the outyear effects of legislation enacted by sept ember 30 2002 effectively were terminated early in late 200225 while the 1985 act as amended remains on the books it would have to be amended by another law providing at minimum revised termination dates and limits on discretionary spending in order to take effect
