6205c01 shspec140 missed withholds see hcob 3may62 arc breaks missed withholds for summary of this lecture the toughest thing to do is to get the auditor to ask simple question have i missed withhold on you its utterly wild there is even case of someone letting someone die rather then saying it there is even another way to say it is there something i should have found out about you auditors failure to do this makes lrh feel like he is on an involuntary withhold he feels like he is screaming in soundproof room people will actually let pc sit there yapping and screaming as though they the auditor had responsibility for what is going on when all they have to do is to ask for the missed withhold missed withholds cause lot of phenomena even gpms are caused by missed withholds it is almost as if the basic principle of existence is when existence is good thou hast not missed withhold and when existence is bad thou hath missed withhold missed withhold properly asked for the meter cleaned remedies each one of these things and many more 1 pc failing to make progress we know now that ptps stem from missed withholds and they stop progress 2 pc critical of or angry at the auditor nonwithholdy pc wont get angry at an auditor goof it doesnt matter whether the auditor was guilty as charged by the pc or not if the pc natters about it he has had withhold missed it is not what is known the thing he is nattering about that is wrong with the pc so you dropped his goals list into the spittoon so what if he says what the hell are you doing he has had withhold missed earlier in the session dont get reasonable about it complaints come from missed withholds get then pulled dont develop them dont follow them just pull them and get on with the session 3 pc refusing to talk to the auditor this happens fifteen to twenty minutes before the blow refusal to talk is simply the realization that one cant because one isnt being heard failing to acknowledge can stick the pc with an involuntary withhold that becomes missed you see this in prayer guy talking to god is talking to circuit if god is talking back sooner or later the circuit will blow and he will have fantastic missed withhold he will get angry at the catholic church or whatever when he suddenly gets answer to his communication one way to handle this is to acknowledge the living daylights out of the pc another is to ask if you have missed withhold 4 pc trying to leave session this is reverse flow of screaming at the auditor you create missed withhold with every failure to acknowledge pc originations or answers eventually the pc will scream at you if you refuse to receive communication from the pc you can create an arc break 5 any needle pattern if the needle is active regardless of what you are saying or even when you are not talking the pc has missed withhold all needle patterns are caused by missed withholds see 6202c15 shspec145 new trs p 240 below needle pattern is series of missed withholds culminating in constantly active needle it is dirty needle that can be wide or narrow you can and should correct such pattern get the ruds back in 6 pc not desirous of being audited this applies to anybody not just pcs but how could you miss withhold on stranger when you havent even talked to him well you are the one who is supposed to know see p 184 above on what nonscientologist thinks knowledge is knowledge of his withholds so it is automatic if your presence is good enough you can get past all the argument and actually pull the withhold 7 pc boiling off mechanically this is stuck flow but the reason for the stuck flow is missed withhold pc even going little fuzzy has missed withhold however minor it may be 8 pc exhausted this is caused by missed withhold as unlikely as it seems 9 pc feeling foggy at session end this is like boiloff you will get little nitpicky missed withholds like i wanted to take smoke break an hour ago and didnt mention it for this you can preface the missed withhold question with in this session 10 pcs havingness drops missed withhold is notreach isnt it thats havingness havingness comes up when missed withholds are cleaned up 11 pc criticising auditor to others here we are going out into life even if the auditor wasnt perceptive didnt acknowledge etc he has still missed his withholds we only learned this piece of tech fairly recently and by the way people studying scientology think that every time we come out with something new old things cease to be true eg they think the arc scale see scientology 08 pp 102 and 103 went out because we have just said that the effects scale exists this is not true 12 pc demanding redress of wrongs he is saying that you should audit him for free or some such thing it doesnt matter if everything he says is true the solution isnt to be found in court but in missed withholds you can ask what should the organization have found out about you to handle this 13 pc critical of organizations or people of scientology or of scientology these things can have enormous effects and yet be trivial even laudable in and of themselves say guy donates money to research foundation and finds out that it has been credited to his account instead the foundation has missed withhold on him right there he has tried to say something and it hasnt been acknowledged he has tried to communicate something and the communication has not occurred every question you dont answer becomes kissed withhold letter registrars should be aware of this the missed withhold comes from the they should know what im thinking they should have found out you can end an entheta campaign by sending detective around to investigate then they figure you know and the campaign stops because you have unmissed the withhold better out really find out what as going on and publish the truth believe it or not they wont attack you worse than before they will leave you alone the original attack wasnt based on your overts matter how many they may have been it was based only on the withholds missed by you 14 lack of auditing results this is cousin to 1 above progress handling this assists organizations immensely cleaning up missed withholds gives auditing results hence new pcs etc 15 dissemination failures what have i failed to find out about you handles this the trouble is that it is too simple so auditors miss it the missed withhold extends into virtually every other area of scientology tr4 the communication formula notknowingness ptps havingness etc
