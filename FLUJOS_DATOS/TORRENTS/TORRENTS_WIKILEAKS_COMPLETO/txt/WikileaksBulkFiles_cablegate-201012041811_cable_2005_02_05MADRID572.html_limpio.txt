of state for security requesting that the diplomatic security service provide protective security services for spanish antiterrorism judge baltasar garzon judge garzon will be longterm guest lecturer at new york universitys king juan carlos center for nine months from february 28 2005 until december 01 2005 his classes will deal with terrorism and national security issues 2 sbu judge garzon is considered critical threat profile judge due to his ongoing oversight and involvement in highlyvisible terrorism cases including the september 11 2001 trade tower bombings as connected to the moroccan alqaida cell known as the barakat yarkas group 3 sbu in the letter received the spanish secretary of state for security highlights what they consider to be the risks and considerations that come with the public exposure of judge garzons work in new york city and requests permanent security presence for him the gos is committed to provide two armed spanish police to judge garzon full time but believe that us law enforcement presence is essential for coordination and effectiveness 4 sbu in discussions on february 11 with the spanish police chief for protective service angel quintana the rso explained that due to extreme demand on dss manpower it was unlikely that 2 dss agents could be provided full time and that it was also unlikely that even single agent could be dedicated for nine months to this detail the rso opined that the more likely scenario would be an accessible agent for coordination communication and problem solving out of dp or pl 5 sbu due to the limited planning time february 28 departure rso requests urgent consideration be given to this request with rapid response to the rso for the spanish protective police travel and visa requirement planning keeping the spanish embassy in washington and the spanish consulate in new york in the loop manzanares
