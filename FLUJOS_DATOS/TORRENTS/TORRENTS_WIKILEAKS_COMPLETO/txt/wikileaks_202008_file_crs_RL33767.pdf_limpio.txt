from retransmitting all programming originating on any station affiliated with abc inc cbs broadcasting inc fox broadcasting co or national broadcasting co the district court co mplied rejecting echostars lastminute arguments and partial settlement agreement and ordering the injunction imposed effective december 1 2006 at issue befo re the eleventh circuit was whether echostar had violated the satellite home view er act shva as amended which grants limited statutory license to satellite carriers transmitting distant network signals to private homes if the subscriber s cannot receive local signals and the scope and consequences of violating shva the court of appeals determined that ec hostar engaged in pattern or practice of violating shva on nati onwide scale and consequen tly that shva required the court to impose nationwide injuncti on against echostar for its improper retransmission of programming this wa s different legal conclusion than that reached by the district c ourt which had concluded that because of echostars cessation of the violation shva did not re quire pattern or practice liability and the court consequently had di scretion to order echostar to reanalyze its subscriber base in compliance with shva and to limit termination to subscribers found ineligible under the cour tsupervised analysis subsequent to the district courts or ders

the satellite home viewer act and satellite retransmission of distant network signals introduction on may 23 2006 the eleventh circuit c ourt of appeals ordered the district court for the southern dist rict of florida to impose an injunction on echostar communications corporation1 to cease retransmitting ll programming originating on stations affiliated with abc inc cbs broadcasting inc fox broadcasting co or national broadcasting co2 the district court complied in two orders one granting motion for entry of permanent injunction and denying settlement agreement3 the other ordering the implement ation of the injunction effective december 1 20064 at issue before the eleventh circuit was whether echostar had violated the satellite home viewer act shva5 as amended which grants limited statutory license to satellite carriers transmitting distant network signals to private homes if the subscribers reside in unserved households and the scope and consequences of that violation6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33767crs2 7 id at 523 8 id at 527 9 cbs broadcasting v echostar 276 f supp 2d 1237 1256 sd fla 2003 10 for an overview of regulations that affect local programming

276 f supp 2d at 1254 12 cbs broadcasting v echostar 450 f3d 505 508 n 2 11th cir 2006the court of appeals held that because echostar was unable to disprove it had engaged in pattern or practice of shva violations on nationwide scale7 the terms of the satellite home viewer act required that the court impose nationwide injunction against echostars improper retransmission of distant network programming8 this differs from the decision of the district court which had concluded that so long as echostar was currently complying with shva the court had discretion to order echosta r to reanalyze its subscrib er base supervised by the court to ensure compliance with shva and terminate all subscribers who were ineligible to receive the signals9 this report briefly describes the satellite home viewer act as amended through the lens of the eleventh circuits ruling regarding satellite providers retransmission of programming originating on distant network affiliate stations to persons who live in unserved households10 it then describes the facts underpinning the courts decision followed by the main legal issues the court addressed and discussion of the district courts implementation of the court of appeals decision the report concl udes with possible legislative action the satellite home viewer act satellite retransmission of distant network signals to unserved households the satellite home viewer act of 1988 shva as amended grants satellite carriers like echostar compulsory license to retransmit copyrighted distant network programming to unserved households11 the purpose behind granting the compulsory license is to satisfy the public interest in making available network programming in these typically rural areas while also respectin g the public interest in protecting the networkaffiliate distribution system12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33767crs3 13 id at 509 n 1 14 id 15 unserved household is statutorily define d at 17 usc 119d 10 and more precisely summarized in cbs broadcasting v echostar at 510 shva identifies five categories of unserved households the other two categories regard subscribers who receive signals through satellite dish on commercial truck or recreational vehicle or transmissions by c band services prior to october 31 1999 16 17 usc 119a7d 17 17 usc 119a7 18 the only definitive way to determine whether household is unserved is to use the accurate measurements model which requires ons ite testing however if satellite carrier uses the less expensive accurate predictive model illr courts will assume the results of that model are correct unless television ne twork provides evidence to the contrary cbs broadcasting v echostar 450 f3d 505 52122 19 see 17 usc 119a2biiii 20 an acronym for individual locati on

network programming is programming that satellite television subscriber receives from ne tworkaffiliated broa dcast station located outside his or her market area13 an example is person who lives in fort lauderdale but receives an abc cbs fox or nbc network station from new york city14 an unserved household for the purposes of this discussion is one in which subscriber 1 cannot receive an overtheair television signal at certain level of signal intensity 2 has received waiver from the local affiliated network station or 3 is grandfathered in15 under shva the satellite carrier bears the burden of proving its subscribers reside in unserved households16 if it fails to provide sufficient evidence that household is unserved the sa tellite carrier may be held liable for damages and injunctive relief17 for households receiving an ove rtheair television signal shva permits two methods of termining whether household is unable to receive signal of requisite strength the use of the accurate measurements method and the accurate predictive model18 the accurate measuremen ts method requires actual physical measurements to determine the strength of the television signal at the subscribers residence pe rformed in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements19 by contrast the accurate predictive model or illr20 does not require home visits yet allows the satellite carrier through computer model to presumptively establish that household cannot receive sufficient signal and is therefore unserved21 penalties for violating shva vary depending on whether they are classified as individual violations or patterns of vi olations an individual violation occurshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33767crs4 22 17 usc 119a7a 23 17 usc 119a7b 24 17 usc 117 a7biii the court shall order 25 17 usc 119a7b 26 17 usc 119a7bi 27 17 usc 119a7bii 28 from 1996 to 1998 echostar offered distant ne twork programming through an agreement with another satellite provider primetime24 jo int venture which evaluated signal strength based on consumers evaluation of his or her signal quality from 1998 to 1999 echostar evaluated new subscriber eligibility using r edlightgreenlight method that determined eligibility based on location in an approved zip code from 1999 to april 2002 echostar used modified version of the illr model to determine subscriber eligibility including consideration of nielsendefined designate d market areas and interference with signal strength from april 2002 until the district c ourts ruling in june 2003 the district court continuedwhere there is willful or repeated retransmission to subscriber who is not eligible to receive the transmission22 by contrast pattern of violations occurs when satellite carrier engages in willful or repeated pattern or practice of delivering distant network service to subscribers who are not eligible to receive the transmission23 district court has broad discre tion to remedy individual violations but has less discretion in its choice of remedy for pattern or practice of violations24 assuming court finds willful or repeat ed pattern or practice of violations it must order permanent injunction barring retransmission by the satellite carrier of any primary transmissions from any network station affiliated with the same network and may order damages not to exceed 250000 for each sixmonth period during which the pattern or practi ce of violations occurred25 if the violations occurred on substantially nationwide basis the court must order permanent injunction against the satellite carrier encompassing the primary transmissions of any primary network station affiliated with the same network26 nationwide ban if the violations occurred on local or regional basis the court must order permanent injunction against the satellite carrier that bars the retransmission in that locality or region27 factual findings regarding echostars violation of federal law at issue was whether echostar willfu lly or repeatedly violated shva by retransmitting distant network signals to ineligible satellite television subscribers from 1996 to 2003 and if so whether the nature of the violations was best classified as individual or pattern or practice violations thereby triggering different penalties the district court examined the methodology by which echostar classified household as unserved and the percenta ge of the carriers subscriber base inappropriately classified as eligible for service th court concluded that from 1996 to 2002 echostar used improper methodology28 to assess whether person residedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33767crs5 28 continued concluded that echostar undertook signifi cant measures to comply with shva 29 during the prime24 subscribers period at least 78 of the 331586 subscribers were ineligible for service despite promise by echostars ceo the district court found evidence that echostar terminated service to any of these ineligible subscribers for compliancerelated purposes during the redlightgreenlight time period the court noted that of the cbs distant programming subscrib ers signedup during this period 69 received signal of sufficient strength to longer qualify as an unserved household on that basis under the september 1999 subscriber list 72 of echostars distant network subscribers 630000 in total were predicted to be disqua lified based on signal strength absent other factors under the april 2002 subscriber lis t hundreds of thousands of subscribers were found to be ineligible to qualify as an unser ved household on the basis of signal strength 30 cbs broadcasting v echostar 450 f3d at 512515 31 id at 516 see 17 usc 119a7bi 32 id at 517 quoting cbs broadcasting v echostar 276 f supp 2d at 1254 33 id 34 id 35 id at 524 in an unserved household with the result that 60 or more29 of subscribers were ineligible for service30 because echostar did not satisfy its statutory burden of proving it only retransmitted distant network signals to uns erved households the district court held that echostars conduct c onstituted willful or repeated copyright infringement actionable under the part of shva th at governs individual violations31 t h district court did not reach conclusion as to whether echostar engaged in pattern or practice of violations which would tr igger permanent injunction because pattern or practice currently exists that would warrant such an extreme sanction32 the court of appeals decision the court of appeals overturned the dist rict courts legal conclusion regarding echostars punishment holding th at the district court was indeed obligated to issue nationwide permanent injunction agains t echostars retrans mission of network programming as consequence of the in escapable conclusion based on the district courts findings that echostar did engage in pattern or practice of violations33 the district court erroneously concluded that the legal standard for pattern or practice liability required echostar to be currently engaged in violating shva34 the court of appeals held that the perm anent injunction required under pattern or practice must be imposed so long as pa ttern or practice of statutory violations occurred at some point in time35 the court then proceeded to evaluate whether echostar had engaged at any time in pattern or practice of violating shva according to the court the standard for concluding pattern or practice liability under shva is whenever sate llite carrier fails to carry its burden of provinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33767crs6 36 id 37 id 38 id at 525 the court stated if these findings do not describe pattern or practice of violations we do not know what does id at 526 39 id 40 id the best case scenario indicate s that on nationwide basis echostar is presumptively providing illegal service to 265 of its subscribers receiving abc distant network programming 269 for cbs 202 for fox and 281 for nbc 41 id at 526 42 id at 523 the court noted the one error the erroneous conclusion that the act prohibits the use of multiple illr vendors had effect on the outcome id 43 id 44 id at 525 45 id at 526 note there is nothing in the cour t order to indicate that noncontinental states are excluded from the nationwide injunctioneligibility for distant network service on sufficient scale and to sufficient degree that court can presume that the satellite carrier is engaging in pattern or practice of serving ineligible subscribers36 looking at the legislative history of shva the court determined that threshol d of 20 of subscrib ers being ineligible for service is relevant marker for pattern or practice analysis37 the court of appeals belie ving that there is other possible conclusion that can be drawn from the district courts findi ngs of fact deter mined that echostars prior conduct did constitu pattern or prac tice of violations38 the court based this conclusion on three main factors first echostars threeand ahalf year history of using inadequate procedures for assessing subscriber eligibility39 second echostars exceeding the 20 threshold of unlawful subscribers nationwide40 third echostars pattern of behavior about which the c ourt stated we have found indication echostar was ever interested in complying with the act41 the court also denied all but one of echostars 17 claims of error42 in addressing echostars ssertions that the court d discretion to determine remedy for the violations the court found that congress unequivocally stated purpose to restrict the courts traditiona l equitable authority upon finding of pattern or practice43 because the act instructs that court shall order permanent injunction and may order st atutory damages the court found there to be ambiguous statutory language in the shva or any legislative history that would indicate that the remedial measure chosen by congress is anything but mandatory44 as result on august 15 2006 the court of appeals ordered the district court to issue nationwide permanent injunction barring the retransmission of distant network programming pursuant to the acts statutory license45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33767crs7

those parties in the district court on august 31 fox broadcasting company fox filed motion for entry of nationwide permanent injunction in accordance with the court of appeals decision the district court issued two orders in response to foxs motion on october 20 200647 echostar and the affiliate associations the settling parties made three arguments against the courts imposition of the injunction and in favor of granting the proposed consent agreement first the settling parties argued that fox lacked standing to obtain relief because the act only applies to networks not network stations and fox abandoned its crossappeal to the court of appeals thereby waiving its right to seek an injunction second they argued that the nationwide permanent injunction fox sought was overly broad nd considering the agreement between the settling parties the court had discretion to enter more narrow relief finally echostar argued that the entry of nationwide permanent injunction would cause manifest injustice to the parties and echostars customers the district court rejected all three arguments the district court concluded that the stion of foxs sta nding was irrelevant because the court had an obligation to implement the mandate issued by the eleventh circuit even without the request of any party the dist rict court also found that according to controlling case law it wa s unable to review or alter the mandate from the court of appeals as the partie s settlement agreement did not present new evidence or an intervening change in controlling law the only circumstances under which the district court held it would have discretion to review the court of appeals mandate the district court also conc luded that implementing the law would not constitute manifest injustice as it would be neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law the standard for court making that finding as result the district court gran ted an order of permanent injunction48 effective december 1 2006 that permanently enjoined and restrained echostar from retransmitting performance or display of work embodied in the primary transmission of any network station affi liated with abc inc cbs
