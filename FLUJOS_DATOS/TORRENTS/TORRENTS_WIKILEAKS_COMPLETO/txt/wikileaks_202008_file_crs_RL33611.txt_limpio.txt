assessments article 17 of the charter requires each member state including the united states to contribute to the expenses of the organization as assessed by the general assembly32 the general assembly has adopted scale of assessments which is based generally on countrys capacity to pay that requires the united states to pay the maximum or 22 of the regular budget while 53 members pay the minimum or 0001 if there were maximum and minimum assessment levels for the regular budget and assessments were based exclusively on ratio of countrys gross national product the united states would be assessed about 30 and some very small and poor countries might be assessed less than 0001 regardless of the size of assessment each member has one vote on budget decisions although budgets since 1988 have been adopted by consensus33 some experts have maintained that the general assembly budget decision process by one 32 the united nations charter was ratified by the united states august 8 1945 and entered into force october 24 1945 there are currently 192 members of the united nations 33 article 18 of the charter each member of the general assembly shall have one vote paragraph 2 of this article states that decisions of the general assembly on important questions shall be made by twothirds majority of the members present and voting these questions shall include budgetary questions crs18 nation one vote that commits few member states to pay major percentage of that budget is unfair and that other principles should replace one nation one vote on budget issues34 when this issue came up between 1985 and 1988 the assembly decided that every effort would be made to adopt the regular budget by consensus in this way any member state including the major contributors might prevent consensus on budget resolution the intention was to give major contributing nations stronger voice in budget matters on april 28 2006 however this practice of consensus on budget matters was broken when the fifth committee on administrative and budgetary matters voted 108 in favor to 50 including the united states against with 3 abstentions on resolution that would define how secretarygeneral annan would carry out the 23 proposals he had presented in his report investing in the united nations for stronger organization worldwide the resolution was sponsored by the group of 77 and china this vote in the fifth committee was followed on may 8 2006 by vote in plenary on the same resolution35 in december 2007 during general assembly consideration of the 20082009 regular budget the united states voted against related resolution ares62236 questions relating to the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20082009 but joined the consensus on the resolution that approved biennial budget of 417 billion36 us representatives characterized the budget resolution as an initial budget with items to be added to the original budget later in the 62nd session the united states was particularly concerned over the piece meal and ad hoc approach37 on december 11 2007 when us ambassador mark wallace addressed the general assemblys fifth committee administrative and budgetary on the status of the 20082009 budget he made the following observations the secretarygeneral has proposed an initial budget of 419 billion for the biennium 20082009 as we all know this 419 billion proposal represents only part of the actual budget in addition the secretarygeneral simultaneously but separately identified various add ons to the base budget that would bring the actual 20082009 budget up to approximately 48 billion the 20062007 approved budget was 3799 billion though it ultimately totaled 417 billion the 20082009 projected budget of 48 billion represents 15 increase over the 20062007 budget 34 some have suggested weighted voting in the assembly based on population or other criteria 35 the vote in plenary was 121 in favor to 50 including the united states against with 2 abstentions 36 ares62237 programme budget for the biennium 20082009 the fifth committee acted on both draft resolutions on december 21 2007 they were adopted in plenary meeting of the general assembly on december 22 2007 see also us department of state voting practices in the united nations 2007 pages 138 and 154155 37 wallace mark explanation of vote december 22 2007 in the fifth committee us mission to the united nations usun press release 387 07 crs19 the proposed regular budget with just the add ons already identified by the secretarygeneral makes this budget the largest regular budget in the history of the this budget also represents the largest increase in the history of the on dollar basis moreover even this 48 billion figure is not what any of us expect as the final budget because it does not take into account additional proposals that have more recently been identified or which we can expect during the course of the biennium we expect that the final actual total budget of the 20082009 biennium to be in excess of approximately 52 billion accordingly such final budget is likely to represent an increase of 25 or more from the 20062007 budget and lets remember what such an increase actually funds as my colleagues from the g77 and china rightly point out in paragraph 30 of the draft resolution before us approximately 75 percent of the budget resources are related to salaries and common staff cost the budget increase does not go directly to humanitarian or development aid but rather to increasing the size of the secretariat bureaucracy we all agree that the piecemeal ad hoc approach of the current budget is inconsistent with sound budgeting practices see paragraphs 9 and 35 of the draft resolution on the 20082009 biennium budget moreover we are concerned that substantial cuts or offsets have been proposed by the secretarygeneral or member states to this largest of all budget increases38 for calendar year 2008 the top three contributors united states japan and germany were assessed total of 47201 of the regular budget the top 10 contributors which include four of the five permanent members of the security council pay 76092 of the total regular budget according to

2006 thenus ambassador to the united nations john bolton suggested that the general assembly consider the use of different economic data in forming the scale of assessments ambassador bolton proposed that the scale of assessments be based on purchasing power parity ppp in our calculation of gross national income ppp is the numbers of units of countrys currency needed to buy in the country the same amounts of goods and services in different country at this time the assessment is based on gross national income gni as determined by gross domestic product the world bank currently uses ppps as an analytical tool but not for income comparisons40 in its july 10 2006 report the senate appropriations committee recommended that the current rate of assessment should not be increased and that the united nations consider economic factors such as purchasing power parity and foreign currency rates41 the house appropriations committee noting that chinas assessment rate was low relative to its real gdp growth directed the state department to report as to whether the current assessment formula should be revised42 the committee on contributions is standing committee of 18 members selected by the assembly on the basis of broad geographical representation personal qualifications and experience this committee advises the assembly on the scale of assessments recommending assessment levels for new member states reviewing appeals for change of assessment and examining applications of article 19 against countries in arrears on payment of their assessed contributions each third year the committee reviews the scale and based on instructions from the assembly recommends revisions in the scale for the next threeyear period the committee met june 5 to 30 2006 to carry out this review and to recommend scale for the period 2007200943 us national is member of this committee on december 22 2006 the general assembly without vote approved new scale of assessments for the period 2007200944 the

the war crimes tribunals the security council has created two war crimes tribunals to investigate and prosecute those accused of serious crimes against humanity under specified circumstances the international criminal tribunal for the former republic of yugoslavia icty was set up in 1993 to investigate and prosecute those accused of genocide crimes against humanity or violations of international humanitarian law on the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991 the international criminal tribunal for rwanda ictr was created in november 1994 to investigate and prosecute persons accused of genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law in the territory of rwanda between january 1 and december 31 1994 and also rwandan citizens suspected of such acts or violations in the territory of neighboring states each tribunal is under the council requirement and timetable to complete its work by december 31 2010 the general assembly decided that each tribunal would be financed through special assessed account and that member states would be assessed to contribute to those accounts in unique way half of the annual budget of each would be paid on

renovation of the complex with completion scheduled for 2013 instead of 2016 under this plan the entire secretariat building would be emptied in one phase instead of four phases the increased cost of leasing additional swing space would be offset by the lowered cost of the secretariat building renovation the assembly authorized the leasing of additional swing space but kept the budget and payment schedule unchanged the main buildings in the united nations headquarters complex in new york city were constructed between 1949 and 195249 the dag hammarskjold library was completed in 1961 since that time substantial renovation of the buildings has occurred an examination of conditions in the complex was made by architects engineers and other consultants in 1998 and 1999 according to 2001 report

unrelated activities51 in september 2005 direct cmp costs were estimated at 12 billion the initial financing plan called for loan from the host government the united states early discussions had envisioned that this might be an interestfree loan as was the 65 million loan from the united states to finance original construction of the headquarters complex in march 2005 the us government offered to the united nations an interestbearing loan of 12 billion to finance the capital master plan and to be provided in three installments over period of three years the loan would be repaid to the united states over 30 years with interest charged at 554 annually the membership through general assembly resolution would have to authorize the secretarygeneral to sign loan agreement once signed

building would be renovated in four phases in 10floor increments starting at the top52 affected staff would be relocated to leased office space the general assembly building would be renovated in single phase with large temporary building constructed on the north lawn as the site for assembly activities during the renovation that north lawn facility would then serve as site for conferences while the conference building was renovated in two phases53 the total cost of this approach was estimated at 1587 billion in examining possible financing for the project mr reuter determined that the most viable would be through multiyear assessment of member states to special assessed account for the cmp he also recommended establishment of working operating reserve fund at the level of 20 of anticipated annual expenditures to ensure stable cash flow believed to be an essential precondition for uninterrupted financing of project costs this reserve fund should be set up before the construction phase of the 51 development of this swing space building to be located on portion of public park at first avenue between 41st and 42nd streets required state legislative approval the new

changes in building code requirements and in security and redundancy systems and rapid inflation of construction costs and significant changes in costing parameters construction inflation accelerated to 11 and tight labor and material markets the last change was attributed to major increases in construction activity in the city after the events of september 11 2001 as well as the demands for

2002 as an independent and impartial advisory board63 the board of auditors office of internal oversight services oios and the assemblys advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions all urged the appointment of such an advisory board in 2005 the board of auditors noted that prominent candidates had declined to serve on the board the explanations included that service on the board would require enormous knowledge of the plan itself and an ongoing time commitment that board members would take on an implied liability that was seen as undesirable that such advice would be better obtained from working experts in the respective fields and that those persons prominent in the respective fields might also be potential competitors and participation in the advisory board would make them ineligible to compete as contractors64 also cited as problems were the lack of an executive director for the cmp for significant periods of time and understaffing in the cmp office on july 2 2007

effective and efficient organization that works within budgetary constraints kassebaumsolomon provisions between 1985 and 1988 number of factors combined to create concern among some in congress over the use of regular budget funds and the direction of voting in the general assembly some in congress viewed many member states as voting against the united states in the assembly in 1985 congress adopted the kassebaumsolomon amendment section 143 foreign relations authorization act fy19861987 hr 2068 pl 9993 august 17 1985 that reduced us assessed contributions by 20 unless steps were taken by the united nations to give the major contributors to the regular budget an influence on budget questions proportionate to their rates of assessment70 in december 1985 in response to the issues raised by the kassebaumsolomon amendment and accompanying congressional debate the general assembly established group of highlevel intergovernmental experts to review the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the united nations and to offer recommendations for streamlining the organization this group of 18 proposed 71 recommendations most of which were approved by the 1986 assembly session in addition the 1986 assembly adopted revised planning programming and budgeting process that sought to ensure an influential role for major contributing countries by among other changes using

department authorization act fy19881989 hr 1777 pl 100204 created new payment schedule that tied full funding of us contributions to the regular budget to further progress toward reform by providing

decisionmaking on budget questions 2 reductions in secretariat staffing and 3 reductions in the number of soviet employees on fixedterm contracts the remaining 20 could be paid 30 days after congress had received the certification unless congress passed joint resolution prohibiting the payment 70 this amendment applied to the united nations and to any specialized agencies for which the united states was assessed more than 20 in regular budget contributions for specialized agencies 1987 legislation revising the original provision required presidential determination to congress that each affected agency made substantial progress toward adoption and implementation of reform budget procedures before any contribution over 20 could be paid crs33 although deadline was given for submission of the presidents certification report release of up to 60 of the funds appropriated for the regular budget was dependent on submission of the report and its acceptance by the congress on september 13 1988 president reagan certified that progress had been made and announced release of an initial 44 million in calendar year 1987 regular budget contributions to the united nations later certification resulted in release of 144 million in calendar year 1988 regular budget funds reagan also called on the state department to develop plan to pay over 500 million in arrears to the entire system over the next three to five years it would take several years however for the us arrears built up over time to be paid to the united nations office of internal oversight services in 1993 congress provided that 10 of the us assessed contribution to the regular budget be available only when the secretary of state had certified to congress that the united nations has established an independent office with responsibilities and powers substantially similar to offices of inspectors general authorized by the inspector general act of 1978 71 many in congress believed that an independent mechanism was needed

investigative activities73 the helmsbiden agreement and payment of arrears the us government pressed for reform in the 1990s linking payment of past arrears to reforms these arrears to both the united nations specialized agencies and few nonun organizations originated from the nonpayments of the mid1980s others derived from the placement of cap on us contributions to peacekeeping account contributions highlevel negotiations between the clinton administration and congressional leaders led to agreement on an arrearage payment plan linked to reform benchmarks popularly known as the
