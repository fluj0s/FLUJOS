industrial countries review of major studies stephen cooney resources science and industry division july 7 2004 abstract the decline in us manufacturing employment and perceptions of an erosion in the us industrial base have been concern for us policymakers after the onset of recession at the end of 2000 the united states lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs over three years notwithstanding an economic recovery that began in late 2001 only in early 2004 did manufacturing employment start to recover adding total of about 100000 new jobs on seasonally adjusted basis from february through may according to the department of labors bureau of labor statistics there is widespread concern that the decline in manufacturing employment is mostly permanent and not just cyclical decline detailed crs analysis found however that accelerated improvement in us labor productivity accounted for reduction across many industries in hourly labor input required to produce increased manufactured output that analysis also looked at other countries ﬁnding that the recent us experience is not unique manufacturing employment is declining almost everywhere as productivity improves recently the commission of the european union2 eu and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published reports including analyses of comparative performance of the us and other economies especially with

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457manufacturing and information technology trends in the united states and other industrial countries review of major studies summary the performance of the us manufacturing sector including the loss of manufacturing jobs has been long and widely discussed but the i ssue has intensified since the recession of 2001 less widely not ed is that other industrial economies have also seen loss of employment in manufacturing with increased labor productivity employment in manufacturing has declined in most industrial countries as well as the more industrially advanced developing economies this point was discussed in crs report rl32179 manufacturing output productivity and employment two reports in 2004 by international bodi have analyzed the comparative performance of us manufacturing in ways that provide report card on relative us performance both reports rate the us economy as more effective than other industrial countries in using informati on and communications technologies ict to enhance competitiveness and growth the commission of the european union eu in its study fostering structural change an industrial policy for an enlarged europe found that while european industry overall has not suffered decline in output since 1979 it has failed to match the united states in two key respects first us manufacturing has had superior growth to the eu in labor productivity since 1995 secondly the eu report found that this is because of better productivity and output growth in ict products and in applying ict in delivery of services the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 2004 produced study entitled the economic impact of ict which was the latest in series of comparative analyses it ra nked the united states as the highest among industrial countries in its investment in ict used to measure diffusion of technology within the economy this pr opensity to invest in ict may have contributed to the higher rates of growth seen in the united states compared to other industrial countries the oecd research i ndicated that relatively lower levels of product and labor market regu lation in the united states by comparison with other industrial countries are important govern mental variables in encouraging private sector ict investment and its contribution to growth this crs report w ill not be

studies introduction the decline in us manufacturing employ ment and perceptions of an erosion in the us industrial base have been concern for us policymakers after the onset of recession at the end of 2000 the united states lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs over three years not withstanding an economic recovery that began in late 2001 only in early 2004 did manufacturing employment start to recover adding total of about 100000 new jobs on seasonally adjusted basis from february through may according to the department of labors bureau of labor statistics there is widespread concern that the decline in manufacturing employment is mostly permanent and not just cyclical decline detailed crs analysis found however that accelerated improvement in us labor productivity accounted for reduction across many indus tries in hourly labor input required to produce increased manufactured output that analysis also looked at other countries finding that the recent us experience is not unique manufacturing employment is declining almost everywhe re as productivity improves1 recently the commission of the european union2 eu and the organization for economic coopera tion and

study of industrial trends the question of european deindustria lization was the focus of the recently released report of the european commission hereafter the commission fostering industrial change an industrial policy for an enlarged europe 3 the conclusion was that europe is not deindustrializing but there were also serious reservations about some current trends in european manufacturing especially by comparison with the united states the concern about deindustr ialization in europe ar ises from the decline in manufacturings share of value added in the combined eu gross domestic product gdp4 this is shown in the eu report as falling from 274 in 1979 to 190 in 2001 on current value basis5 the eu report found that most industrial sectors have recorded job losses and that the decline in manufacturing employment is considered as key factor in concerns over deindustrialization6 as shown in table 1 employment has declined in almost ll industrial sectors in europe out of 26 manufactured product groups as selected by the commission using the international labor organiza tions internationa l standard industr ial classification isic only one rubber and pl astics had greater employment in 2001 than in 1979 however the commission differentiate s between industrial change and absolute deindustrialization it states that the shift in employment from manufacturing to services reflects in part substantial improvements in labor productivity in manufacturing devel opment that makes eu industry more competitive not less so in domestic and export markets among the 26 manufactured product groups listed by th commission only five showed declines in output in 19792001 these were tex tile mill pr oducts clot hing shipbuilding leather and footwear and mineral and nuclear fuels as shown below in table 1 these five product groups are also among th less successful performers in the united states with respect to both output growth and employment

europe during the same period the crs report also highlighted the significance of improved labor pr oductivity in the us manufacturing sector7 consequently as shown in table 1 most us industries increased absolute output levels be tween 1979 and 2001 even though many also displayed declining employment sectoral comparison of eu and us industry despite common useuropean trends nd overall european growth in output the european commission in its report nevertheless viewed the data on relative competitiveness with some concern it noted significant slowdown in the rate of eu labor productivity after the mid1990s as shown in table 2 according to this analysis the trend in overall eu labor productivity improvement was stronger than in the united states in 1979199 5 the annual eu rate of improvement of labor productivity in manufacturing alone during this period wa s approximately the same as the us rate about 35 however in 19952001 the rate of annual us labor productivity improvement in manufacturing increased to 38 according to the eu report while the rate of improvement in europe was only 23 the commission noted that better performance by some eu national economie s finland ireland sweden as well as in the united states is evidence that decline in productivity was not an inevitable result of other broad economic trends8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457crs5 9 ibid 10 generally the eu and oecd reports use the designations high technology and information and communications technologies ict interchangeably in the united states high technology may also be used

performance was especially disappointing in hightech sectors review of table 1 shows that the eu beat the united states in 11 of 26 categories when one compares output grow th data in manufacturing on sectorby sector basis over the 19792001 period however the point made by the commission is that while growth in europe s labor productivity in sectors with strong technological content has been r obust in comparison with the overall economy it has on the whole been significantly lower than in the united states in these sectors9 looking at table 1 one can see that this has led to higher rates of us output increases especially in computers and office mach ines electronic components including semiconductors sc ientific instruments cat egory that includes medical equipment and measuring and controlling instruments such as those used in electronics manufacturing and insulated wire and cab which includes fiber optics10 the commission found that the gaps between us and eu productivity improvement rates were grow ing notably in those industries that manufacture ict equipment the gap in these trends was also growing in those services that are intensive ict services users11 this will be discussed in more detail when reviewing the oecd analysis belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457crs6 12 business week us factories falling behind may 24 2004 pp 9496 13 these are categories cited as examples in ibid and are based on latest us data which may not exactly correspond to either the categories listed in the commission report or earlier us sicbased data categories 14 european commission fostering structural change pp 1013 15 ibid pp 610conversely the eu report finds that us output growth is slower than in the eu in some traditional industrial sectors according to barry bosworth of the brookings institution in reference to the performance of us industry everybodys talking about high rates of growth in productivity but its in two areas high technology and services the rest of the goodsproducin g industries have not shared in this12 number of important us manufacturing sect ors have not experienced high rates of productivity growth cement included in th isic category of nonmetallic minerals fabricated metal products furniture printing food manufacturing electrical equipment paper and primary basic metals with the exception of furniture which the commission and the isic combine statistically with miscellaneous manufacturing us overall out put has grown slower or not appreciably faster than the eu performance in these product groups as shown in table 1 13 eu policy conclusions nevertheless continued ability to match labor pr oductivity trends and output growth of us industries in certain sector s of traditional european strength such as chemicals and electrical machinery is of relatively little comfort to the european commission it believes that these product groups are more vulnerable to competition from developing economies bot h the more advanced competition from east asia and the newer competitors looming in china and india the commission believes that there will naturally be shif ts of production as well as research and development activities to such countries as they become increasingly important to industrial producers global competitive pos ition moreover competition from these countries will intensify not only in trad itional industries where cost and market location considerations are paramount but also increasingly in high technology fields where ict technical proficiency is important14 while facing such challenges the commission believes that the eu is not well positioned compared to the united states or japan in specializing more in i ndustries requiring higher levels of private sector research and devel opment activities and industrial innovation the report cites data to show that the eu trails the united states in many dimensions on such factors15 the commission report proposes multidimens ional approach to resolving the problems of lagging eu competitiveness measured in terms of labor productivity gains and output increases in hightech sectors with regard to the united states and other industrial regions it emphasi zes the 2004 enlargement of the eu as unique answer to the competitiveness problem the commission views the new member states particularly the larger economies of eastern europe as vital sources of well educated and trained or highly trainable labor at competitive wage rates the commission believes that this productive potential can be readily integrated

objective of increasing total rd sp ending in europe to 3 of gdp by 201018 the commission report summarizes this action plan similar plan on innovation policy and plan to be proposed for strategic

recent years has produced series of reports and analyses on the new economy generally the impact of ict on overall economic growth and development in early 2004 it produced further report in this series the economic impact of ict measurement evidence and implications 20 as in the eus analysis the oecd study makes specific comparisons between the performan ce of us european and in this case some other industr ial economies the focus of the most recent oecd study is on the key question that the european commission policymakers have been grappling with namely what encourages greater diffusion of ict in to the general economy the bulk of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457crs8 21 ibid ch 2 the diffusion of ict in oecd economies by dirk pilat and andrew devlin 22 ict for the purpose

countries the authors admit that many of their conclusions are tentative in part because the data series are not definitive ict diffusion the subject of the study is itself relatively new phenomenon and reliable data series do not have long history the present crs report focuses on the second chapter in the oecd study this develops crossna tional conclusions and comp arisons based on recently developed official statistics which the authors feel provide sound basis for international conclusions21 us leadership in information technology investment the oecd report finds that the united states leads the other economies in terms of how much of its capital investment has gone into ict22 ict investment is measured as share of gross fixed nonresidential capital formation in each of 18 countries in 2001 the us percentage was about 28 it was the only country whose percentage of such inve stment was greater than 2523 also when measured against the levels of 1980 and 1991 the us percentage of capital investment in ict had increased progressively and steadily among other countries the united kingdom sweden the netherlands canada and australia each placed more than 20 of capital investment in ict finla nd was above 17 germany japan and italy were above 15 ireland was just at 15 but growing rapidly and france was about 12 just above portugal at the bo ttom of the group considering also the absolute size of the us economy by comparison with the other countries this statistic alone indicates how large is the us lead in terms of its installed ict base and presumably the competitiv advantage thereby derived information technology in vestment and regulation the oecd report sought to find indicator s of what encouraged or discouraged firms investment in ict much of th report examines specific case studies and microeconomic indicators such as the size of firms that utilize ict and specific reasons why firms do not make ict investment s such as concerns with data security and lack of trained personnel but of particular interest with regard to the policy perspective were the findings of the oecd study with respect to the business environment that governments create fo r the operation of companies the oecd report found that higher levels of investment in ict is generally linked to lower levels of detailed g overnment regulatory control in an economy defined as product market regulation and employment prot ection legislation these two measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457crs9 24 oecd economics dept working paper 226 summary indicators of product market regulation with an extension to employment protection legislation by g nicoletti s scarpetta and boyland cowkp 99 18 april 2000 25 in statistical terms the correla tion between the two indices was 054 ibid p 30 and fig 210 the oecd authors noted that the market regulation rankings were based on 1998 data and that some countries had passed ne w liberalizing legislation since then 26 oecd nicoletti et summary indicators pp 4043were based on summary indi cators developed in an earlier oecd working paper24 product market regulation wa s based on series of measures of government intervention in the economy these meas ures included relative size of the public enterprise sector its scope role of legislation in cont rolling public privatized and private enterprises administrative burdens on enterprises legal barriers including barriers to entry for new enterprises licen sing requirements and price controls the oecd report used an index scale from 0 to 6 to measure levels of product market regulation among 18 member countries incl uding the united states japan and most eu member states all countries scored within range of 10 to 30 the authors of the chapter related this index to the vel of investment in ict as share of non residential gross fixed capital form ation according to the authors product market regulation can limit competition since ict offers firms new capabilities eg in selling or purchasing online firms may be able to enter markets and introduce products and services that were not feasible before ict might thus enable the introduction of competition in markets that were previously characterized by low competition for example national or regional monopoly product market regulations may also reduce the incentives for firms to innovate and develop new ict applications the study found that countries that had high level of product market regulation in 1998 had lower shares of inve stment in ict than countries with low degrees of product market regulation the united kingdom the united states australia and ireland were the only countries among the 18 studied with score of 10 or less on the product market regulation scale and as noted above the first three also ranked above 20 in the ratio of ict investment to gross capital formation the three countries with the highest levels of product market regulation index scores 20 were italy greece and france whic h also ranked among the lowest countries in ict investment intensity at 15 or less germany and japan ranked about the middle on both dimensions25 the oecd report also measured the extent of ict investment against the strictness of employment pr otection legislation again the oecd constructed six point scale based on legislat ed restrictions on working hours notice and severance pay requirements for nofault dismissal of permanent fulltime workers and constraints on temporary employment26 the authors hypothesized that if firms cannot adjust their workforce or organizati on and make ict effective within the firm they may decide to limit investment or relocate activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457crs10 27 correlation between the indices was 065 ibid p 30 and fig 211 the employment protection index was based on legislation in place in 1998the authors found fairly strong nega tive correlation between scores on this sixpoint index of employment protection gislation and the ratio of ict investment intensity the united states was by far the lowestscoring country on employment protection legislation and the highest on ict investment intensity the united kingdom was secondlowest in employment protection and secondhighest in ict investment following what some in europe call the anglosaxon model australia and canada both scored 10 or less on the em ployment protection index and were among the leaders in ict investment among the continental european countries denmark scored lowest on empl oyment protection and thirdhighest on ict investment netherlands and sweden both scored high more than 20 on ict investment but both were over 20 on employ ment protection however japan and germany scored between 25 and 30 on empl oyment protection compared to their midrange scores on ict investment france spain italy greece and portugal were all above 30 on the employme nt protection legislation index and were also among the lowest scores on ict investment the oecd reports authors also noted that two independent studies published in 2002 conf irmed such links between levels of legislated employment protection ict investment and productivity performance27 conclusion as noted in the european commission study many factors influence manufacturing performance not all of which are covered here the eu authors state for example that they did not consider the impact of exchange rates or trade issues on industrial performance but within the limits of the eu and oecd reports the main features of comparison betw een us and european manufacturing performance are reasonably clear manufacturing in both europe nd the united states experienced declines in its shares of th overall economy in terms of both employment and currentvalue gdp however manufacturing output has increased over this period so that it may be misleading to talk about deindustrialization the european commission is concerned however that the us manufacturing sector has clearly been outperforming europe since the mid1990s in information and communication technologies ict the fastestgrowing high tech sectors of modern economies oecd economists comparing perfo rmance across many industrial economies find that the united states has had by far the highest rate of growth in ict investment they also find that such investment in the united states appears to be positively influenced by the relatively low degree of product market regulation and legislated employment protection compared to other industrial countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32457crs11 both the eu and the united states are examples of mature industrial economies as is japan also included in the oecd study which are struggling with the effects of multiple transitions the ratio of jobs in manufacturing to those in services is declining high labor productivity in ma nufacturing means fewer wellcompensated manufacturing production jobs pe r unit of output and ready availability of trainable labor in developing countries in an increasingly globalized world economy has encouraged offshore outsourcing of industr ial products and proce sses both the eu and the oecd studies appear to conclude that the us manufacturing economy has outcompeted its eu counterpart not in all product groups but certainly in promoting the manufacture of ict products and the pplication of ict throughout the economy with different purposes the eu and oecd studies appear to arrive at differing policy conclusions emphasizing the po licy areas under its purview the european commission foresees that europe can address the problem of lagging labor productivity and investment in ict th rough full integration of new member countries in the internal eu market greater and more systematically coordinated support of rd within the eu and atte ntion to other policy areas such as competition policy though focused on the microeconomic factor s that appear to promote or hinder firms adoption of ict the oecd study comes to an unambiguous conclusion with respect to the business environment pr ovided by governmen t higher levels of product market regulation and legislated job protection ffectively discourage wider use of ict in industrial economies am ong eighteen oecd member industrial nations the united states clearly had th highest percentage of investment in information and communication technologies as share of gross nonresidential fixed capital investment the united states also sc ored the lowest on an index of strictness of employment protection legislation and was in the lowestscoring group on strictness of product market re gulation from this comparative review of the policy evidence contained in these international studies it would appear that increased governmental efforts to regulate pr oduct and labor markets in the business environment reduces the investment in information technology and possibly its contribution to overall growth
