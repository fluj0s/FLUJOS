relief currently focuses on the lack of price thresholds in minerals management service mms ocs lease sales held in 1998 and 1999 without the price thresholds deepwater producers continued to benefit from royalty relief even as oil prices hit record levels in an unresolved issue over the secretary of the interiors authority and discretion to impose price thresholds the department of the interior asserts that the secretary of the interior is not required to impose price thresholds in each lease but has the discretion to do so all lease sales held since the enactment of dwrra included price thresholds except those held in 1998 and 1999 according to the mms and the government accountability office gao omitting price thresholds for those two years could cost the federal government as much

prices hit record levels during 2006 allegations arose about missteps at the minerals management service mms regarding the collection of royalties for oil and gas production on the outer continental shelf ocs of particular concern to congress is that price thresholds for royalty relief in deepwater leases were omitted from deepwater lease sales held in 1998 and 1999 such thresholds establish maximum price per barrel of oil or million btu of natural gas where producers may receive royalty relief above the threshold price royalties must be paid except for the 1998 and 1999 lease sales the thresholds are included in all leases eligible for automatic royalty relief under the deepwater royalty relief act of 1995 dwrra pl 104 58 without the price thresholds oil and gas can be produced from lease up to specified volume without being subject to royalties matter how high the price goes g17g5g21g561g14g142g138g156g146g151g144g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 the outer continental shelf lands act of 1953 ocsla as amended provides for the leasing of ocs lands in manner that protects the environment and returns to the federal government revenues in the way of bonus bids rents and royalties lease sales are conducted through competitive sealed bonusbidding process and leases are awarded to the highest bidder successful bidders make an upfront cash payment called bonus bid to secure lease minimum bonus bid is determined for each tract offered bidding on deepwater tracts in the mid1990s led to surge in bonus revenue eg 14 billion in fy1997 1 bonus bids totaled 9026 million in fy2007 in addition to the cash bonus bid royalty rate of 125 or 1666 has been imposed on the value of production with royalties sometimes paid inkind 2 more recently the mms imposed an 1875 royalty rate on its offshore leases annual rents range from 5 to 950 with lease sizes generally ranging from 2500 to 5760 acres initial lease terms of 510 years are standard and leases are continued as long as commercial quantities are being produced the mms in the department of the interior administers the offshore leasing program g20g152g162g138g149g157g162g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561 ocsla authorizes the

interior interprets the dwrra pl 10458 to provide the secretary of the interior with the authority and discretion to establish thresholds above which the relief is discontinued another interpretation of the law concludes that thresholds are mandatory not discretionary4 in addition the authority of the secretary to impose price thresholds has come into question in lawsuit filed by kerrmcgee5 the us district court western district of louisiana issued ruling on october 18 2007 in favor of kerrmcgee 6 meaning that the secretary of the interior did not have authority to impose price threshold levels in leases issued under dwrra 19962000 the ruling could apply to potentially 2331 billion in future ocs royalties according to the mms but may not affect congressional efforts to impose new fees or establish new lease eligibility criteria discussed below7 threshold levels were established in 1995 for eligible deepwater leases and are adjusted annually for inflation8 the market price for oil in late 2006 was above the threshold so leases with thresholds were paying royalties on oil production some gas lease thresholds were below the late2006 market price and others slightly above9 dwrra provides for fields10 with eligible leases to receive royalty suspensions for specific volumes of production at specified depths table 1 the royalty relief was contingent on the lease being part of nonproducing field before dwrra was enacted11 eligible leases are those issued in the gom between 1996 and 2000 at depths greater than 200 meters located wholly west of 87 degrees 30 minutes west longitude the lease is offered subject to lease suspension volumethe amount of oil and gas that can be produced royaltyfree eligible leases do not require an economic evaluation to be granted royalty relief also within the deepwater category are preact leases lease sales held before november 1995 post2000 leases lease sales held after november 2000 and leases classified as expansion projects all of which can qualify for royalty relief under dwrra with an application demonstrating economic need in addition post 2000 leases or royalty suspension leases may be offered with an automatic royalty suspension volume on lease rather than field basis the energy policy act of 2005 epact 05 pl 10958 expanded the postact royalty relief program by providing automatic minimum suspension volumes at specified depths in each lease continued mms report guidelines for the application review approval and administration of the deepwater royalty relief program for preact leases and post2000 leases

rule suspends the royalty on gas from wells with at least 15000 feet true vertical depth located in waters less than 200 meters deep in the central and western gom it also provides royalty suspension

energy security proponents contend critics during the debate on royalty relief that preceded passage of epact05 charged that the government would forfeit millions of dollars through the subsidy and that drilling costs were already coming down as result of advances in technology thus making many deepwater lease tracts economical according to mms deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico has

currently focuses on the lack of price thresholds in ocs lease sales held in 1998 and 1999 without the price thresholds deepwater producers continued to benefit from royalty relief even as oil prices hit record levels how these price thresholds were omitted is the subject of ongoing congressional and administrative investigations according to the minerals management service although the secretary of the interior is not required to impose price thresholds in each lease but has the discretion to do so all lease sales held since the enactment of dwrra included price thresholds except those held in 1998 and 1999 the mms and the government accountability office gao estimate that this error could cost the federal government as much as 10 billion the mms estimated that about 956 million in royalty revenue was foregone through fy2006 annually the mms collects about 10 billion in revenues from oil and gas leases on federal lands the policy concern for some is whether and if so how to amend the 1998 and 1999 leases to include price thresholds some argue that modifications to the leases should be retroactive to capture past as well as future revenues from deepwater oil and gas production others in congress argue that any mandatory modification of the leases might be breach of contract or unconstitutional and would be contested in court another legislative possibility is to enact incentives such as proh ibiting lessees from bidding on future leases to induce holders of 1998 1999 leases to accept price thresholds mms has initiated efforts to have lessees voluntarily modify their leases to include price thresholds going forward from october 2006 in december
