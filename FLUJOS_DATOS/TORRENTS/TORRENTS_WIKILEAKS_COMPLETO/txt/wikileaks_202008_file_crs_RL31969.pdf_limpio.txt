united states the ensuing debate in congress focused on the degree of federal involvement needed to impr ove aviation security and restore public confidence in air travel the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 115 stat 597 established the trans portation security administration tsa and contained provisions establishing federal screener workforce and requiring screening of checked baggage using explosive detection systems atsa also significantly expanded the federal air mars hal program require d that all cockpit doors be strengthened and pr ovided for various other aviation security measures the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 116 stat 2135 established the department of homeland security dhs and placed the tsa within dhs funding for aviation security programs re mains central issue especially since passenger and air carrier security fees fall well short of fully funding these programs funding for airport security improvements

publics confidence in air travel on november 19 2001 president bush si gned the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 atsa shifted much of the responsibility for aviation security from the airports and airlines to the federal government the act established new transportation security administration tsa headed by an under secretary of transportation for security three months after enactment february 17 2002 th responsibilities for aviation security were transferred from the federal aviation administration faa to the tsa on november 25 2002 president bush si gned the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 this act established the department of homeland security dhs and placed the tsa in tact as distinct entity within dhs under the border transportation and security directorate for the first 2 years following enactment tsa migrated to the newly formed dhs in march 2003 in the 108th congress the faa reauthorization act vision 100 pl 108176 has served as the principle vehicle for enacting several statutory changes pertaining to aviation security most notably vision 100 established an aviation security capital fund for integrating explosive detection equipment into airport baggage handling systems this fund is authorized up to 500 million per fiscal year through fy2007 of which 250 million is designated as ma ndatory spending derived from aviation

offsetting the cost of aviation security costs for aviation security are partially offset by the collection of aviation security fees from passengers and airlines atsa includes provisions for security service fee imposed on passengers not to exceed the lesser of 250 per trip leg or 500 per oneway trip to fund aviation security programs in addition atsa contains provisions for collection of fees from air carriers for aviation secur ity to supplement f unding for aviation security through fy2004 the sum of aviati on security fees paid by carrier may not exceed the amount that carrier paid in calendar year 2000 for screening passengers and property from fy2005 on the percarrier limit on fees can be adjusted based on market share or othe r appropriate measure in lieu of actual screening costs paid in calendar year 2000 an ongoing challenge for funding avia tion security has been the financial difficulties faced by the aviation industry fi nancial troubles for th airlines have had significant impact on aviation security fee collections and has also resulted in the passage of legislation providing large financial bailouts to the airlines immediately after september 11 2001 congre ss passed the air transpor tation safety and system stabilization act pl 10742 115 st at 230 on september 22 2001 which provided 5 billion in emergency assistance to compensate air carriers for direct and incremental losses stemming from the terrorist attacks1 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act pl 10811 117 stat 559 enacted on april 16 2003 provided almost 23 billion dollars in additional assistance to air carriers paid in proportion to the share of the air ca rrier and passenger security fees each air carrier had remitted to tsa additionally p l 10811 also contained provision that temporarily halted the collection of air carrier and passenger security fees from june 1 through september 20 2003 passenger security fee collections resumed at the beginning of fy2004 and although th ere appears to now be some modest recovery in airline travel funding for av iation security programs remains an ongoing challenge for congress slightly more th an 2 billion

aviation and transportation security act before the committee on commerce science and transportation united states senate february 5 2002through aviation security fee collections this fiscal year which offsets only about 54 of the current federal cost for aviation security the administration expects revenue from aviation security fees to increase to 258 billion in fy2005 however the tsa budget request for fy2005 would increase total tsa spending by 891 million as compared to fy2004 appropriations in fy2005 the tsa also expects fee collections for the twic program and background checks of foreign flight students to fully support the costs of thes programs the tsa obtained fee authority for conducting background checks of foreign flight students in vision 100 pl 108 176 and is seeking fee authority for cr edentialing transportation workers under the twic program besides the fiscal challenge of funding aviation security operations the impact of funding aviation security improvements at airports with airport improvement program aip funds is significant issue several airports esp ecially many of the large hub airports have been utilizing ai p funds to pay for installing explosive detection systems eds in baggage handling areas and retrofitting baggage conveyers to accommodate eds equipment in add ition to other securityrelated projects the use of aip funds for secu rity projects has direct impact on many airport projects to improve capacity and safety the consolidated appropriations resolution pl 1087 117 stat 11 containe d provision allowing the tsa to issue letters of intent to commit fu ture funding for such aviation security projects the federal share of costs for airport security projects defined with regard to these letters of intent was set at 75 for large and dium hub airports and at 90 for all other airports vision 100 pl 108176 establishe d separate aviati on security capital fund to finance projects to integrate expl osive detection equipment into airport baggage handling systems the law au thorizes up to 500 million per year over the next 4 years for the fund the first 250 million per year is to be collected from aviation security fees and comprises ma ndatory funding level for the fund vision 100 pl 108176 also increased the federal share of costs for these projects to 90 at large and medium hubs and 95 at ot her airports while vision 100 authorizes up to 500 million per year through fy2007 fy2004 appropriations for eds installation totaled onl half of that 250 million it s been estimated that the total systemwide cost to integrate eds equi pment at airports could exceed 23 billion depending on the nature and type of structural changes needed2 transitioning tsa to the department of homeland security the homeland security act of 2002 specifi the structure of the newly formed department of homeland security dhs and places tsa within dhs under the directorate of border and transportation security along with the us customs service the federal protective service the federal law enforcement training center and the office for domestic preparedness formerly part of the office of justice programs one key challenge for the dhs and tsa as component ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31969crs7 dhs will be the ab ility of the orga nization to establish policies procedures and tools for effectively sharing critical information regarding national security threats and coordinating resources to rapidly re spond to threats to aviation security while dhs officially went into full operational status and tsa migrated its operations to the departme nt of homeland security in march 2003 the next few years will be critical phase for fully fining the organization mission and culture of dhs as whole and tsa as functional entity within dhs this transitional period will likely spur continued congressional oversight to ensure that tsa is able to fully establish and maintain its capability to effectively carry out the civil aviation security programs established under atsa and the homeland security act of 2002 although tsa will remain intact in its curre nt organizational stru cture as an element of dhs for the first two years under pr ovisions of the homeland security act of 2002 tsa may be restructured after that period november 2004 will be critical time for tsa because not only will restru cturing be an option but also under provision in atsa airports will be able to opt out of the federal security screener program and adopt security screening program comprised of private screeners while tsa has remained as distinct entity the federal air marshal service fams was moved out of the tsa by dhs and placed in the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice in december 2003 this move allows dhs to train additional law enforcement officers serving as immigration and customs officers as federal air marshals thus increasing their ability to deploy additional air marshals during periods of heightened secu rity concerns for civil aviation this is also expected to increase career opportunitie s for air marshals as well as immigration and customs officers who are expected to have wider array of training and assignment opportunities within the bureau the aviation security technical corr ections and improvements act of 2003 hr 2144 introduced on may 19 2003 proposes technical corrections to title 49 of the us code to align aviation secur ity functions carried out by tsa with the operations of the dhs and officially design ates the head of tsa formerly known as the undersecretary of transportation for security as the administrator of the transportation security administration w ithin dhs the tsa administrator reports to the undersecretary for border and transportation security airport security primary focus of the tsa in its first two years of operation was the deployment of federa l passenger and baggage screener s and equipment to meet the mandates for federal airport security screeners and screening of all checked baggage using explosive detection equipment these elements along with riskbased assessments of passengers are considered the first layer of security in multilayered system intended to protect passenger air lines from explosives hijackings sabotage and other acts of terrorism passenger prescreening since 1996 the computer aided

largely been compromised by information publicly discussed following the terrorist attacks of september 11 20013 therefore the tsa contracted with lockheed martin to develop the nextgeneration passenger ri sk assessment and prescreening system capps ii key issue is what information this system will collect and analyze and how this system will balance the requirement for security through intelligence gathering with travelers civil liberties and right to privacy as described in an august 1 2003 federal register notice4 the proposed capps ii system will compare basic passenger information such as full name home address and telephone number and date of birth to information available from commercial data providers to authenticate passengers identity once passengers identity is verified the passenger identification data will be compared against government databases of terrorists and individuals w ho are thought to pose threat to civil aviation each passenger will be assigned risk score that will place them into one of three colorcoded risk categor ies most passengersabout 95 would be colorcoded green meaning that they are t hought to pose low or minimal risk and consequently they will only unde rgo standard levels of phy sical screening at airport security checkpoints small percentage of passengers estimate d to be about 5 will be coded as either yellow meaning th at they are thought to pose potential risk to aviation security and will be require d to undergo additional secondary physical screening at the airport checkpoint or red meaning that they are thought to pose significant threat to aviation secur ity and will be prohibited from boarding according to the tsa the estimated 5 of passengers that will be flagged as either yellow or red under capps ii is expected to be significant reduction from the 15 of passengers that are currently identifie d for additional scrutiny under the existing capps passenger prescreening system5 several questions remain regarding the implementation of the capps ii program these focus on the protection of privacy and civil liberties and include what specific data will be collected how will the data be used who will have access to the data how long will data be retained in the system what access will members of the public have to their personal data retained in the system will the system have an acceptable error rate how will inaccuracies in data be resolved and so on language in both the homela nd security appropriations for fy2004 pl 10890 and visi on 100 pl 108176 directs the gao to study these issues and provide recommendations for methods to eliminate or minimize the adverse affect of capps ii on privacy discrimination and other civil liberties the initial gao report required under

the test phase tsa may not use capps ii to delay or deny boarding of any passenger the tsas efforts to launch the test phase of capps ii have been delayed by the airlines reluctance to voluntarily provide passenger records for testing the system the airlines reluctance stem s from recent incidents in which public criticism and legal actions resulted from airlines voluntarily providing passenger data to government agencies in the first instance jetblue airways supplied passenger data to an army contractor that used the da ta to test datamining system for security at army bases6 delta airlines was originally slated to participate in the initial test phase for capps ii but declined to provide the data after privacy advocacy group launched web site urging boycott of delta airlines for their role in the program7 more recently it was disclosed that northw est airlines provided passenger records in the months following septembe r 11 2001 to nasa researchers who were reportedly unsuccessful in usin g that data to develop datamining tool for security analysis classaction suit has been file d against northwest airlines on behalf of all passengers whose informa tion was allegedly divulged8 as result of these concerns the implementation of capps ii may depend on legislative or regulatory mechanisms to resolve the airlines legal concerns as well as the concerns raised regarding privacy protections despite these setbacks the tsa anticipates testing capps ii in the spring of 2004 and implementing the system by summer 20049 atsa also gives the tsa the authority to develop known or trusted traveler program this program would allow passengers who voluntarily submit to background checks and receive unique identif ication card to be streamlined through the security screening process and subj ected to only minimum amount of physical screening proponents of such plan argu that this program could help tsa focus limited security resources on conducting more thorough checks of those passengers who are more likely to pose security threat while opponents argue that terrorists may exploit such system to bypass more stringent security checks at airports10 while tsa is studying the feasibility of such plan specific details regardingimplementation of knowntrav eler program have been released one significant hurdle in implementing such program is the need for effective technologies and procedures to positively establish the iden tity of known travelers the air cargo security act s 165 contains provision th at would require tsa to lead an effort to establish

screeners atsa provided for federal oversight of airport security and required that security screening pers onnel be federal employees although these screeners are entitled to most standard federal employee benefits such as health benefits and participation in retirement plans the tsa administrator has much greater flexibility over pay and retention of screeners as compared to federal employees

deploying federal airport screeners at all commercial airports where passenger screening is required on that date there were 429 such air ports and at present there are 432 under an agency order issued by the tsa in january of 2002 screeners may not form collective bargaining units12 however several ts screeners and federal union representatives are challenging this or der asserting that as federal employees screeners have the right to form or join bor organization if they so choose it has also been reported that the large volume of discrimination complaints received by tsa over 1800 in 2003 may be indicative of inadequacies in tsas internal grievance process several current and former screeners have alleged that the agency has failed to adequately address allegations of discrimination against minorities and veterans and claims of unfai r hiring and firing practi ces nepotism and management violations13 in deploying federal screeners to meet the mandate estab lished

ers relocation bonuses of up to 5000 to improve staffing levels at chronically understaffed airpor ts some in congress and many airport operators voiced concerned that the methods being used by the tsa to realign the screener workforce may not accurately reflect the numbers of origination passengers that pass through checkpoints at given airport and may not address future expansion plans and increased mand for screeners as passenger volume increases with economic recovery concern has also been voiced that scheduling practices for screeners who primarily work straight shifts is not well suited for meeting daily fluctuations in passeng er volume which typically experiences significant daily and weekly peaks and lulls it has been the department of transportations stated goal that passengers should not wait more than 10 minutes to pass through an airport security checkpoint15 an august 2003 survey by the bureau of transportation statistics found that passenger wait times averaged about 18 minutes16 as demand for air travel increases maintaining reasonable queue times at security checkpoints may pose significant challenge to tsa especially at larger airports with centralized checkpoints while the details of secu rity inspections processes at airport checkpoints consist of sensitive information it has been reported that tsa screeners are undergoing more stringent tests at security checkpoints that have revealed screeners sometimes fail to detect hidden threat objects17 following september 11 2001 more stringent criteria were establis hed for screening checked items and more items have been included in the list of prohibited objects that cannot be carried by passengers or in their carry on items key criterion in continuing oversight of tsas staffing levels training and performance of its screener workforce will likely be the ability to continually provide an expected level of service without comp romising the high security standards

programs developed by the faa in the mid1990s known shipper programs consist of established procedures identified in air carrier and freight forwarder security programs to ensure that shipments placed aboard passenger aircraft are received from known sources who have an established busine ss history of shipping with given air carrier or freight forwarder and have adequate security measures in place to protect the integrity of their shipments under existing regulations air carriers and freight forwarders must refuse to ship cargo from unknown sources on passenger airplanes and shippers must consent to inspections of cargo s 165 and hr 1103 seek to expand the known shipper program through voluntary industrywide pilot program that would establish common database of known shippers the tsa

det ection criteria and increasing throughput shipments of mail by air present additi onal security challenges express and first class mail is protected from search consequently the postal services principal technique for screening mail is through pos tal clerk screening of customers sending packages weighing more than one pound concerns over the adequacy of these procedures led to ban on shipping posta l packages weighing more than 16 ounces on passenger aircraft since september 11 2001 the 1997 white house commission on aviation safety and security commonly referred to as the gore commission had recommended that the postal service s hould obtain authorization from customers allowing examination of packages by eds and if necessa ry seek appropriate legislation to accomplish this37 however to date mail is not screened by eds and the 16 ounce mail limit for passenger aircraft remains in effect the tsa has indicated that it is exploring the use of canine teams to inspect mail and allow carriage of heavier mail packages on passenger aircraft to resume it was recently reported that the tsa and the postal service are satisfied with the ongoing canine team pilot program

ca rried aboard passenger aircraft primarily using known shipper programs concerns have arisen that explosives and incendiary devices could be inserted into cargo at multiple points along the supply chain these concerns have focused on the fact that at present only small amount of cargo is physically screened thus leading to the possibility that an explosive or incendiary device inserted into cargo shipment c ould go undetected experts offer differing opinions regarding the probability of such threat while some point out that without the aid of cohort with access to ai rcraft specific flight s would be difficult to target others caution that with increased screening of passengers and their baggage terrorists may view air cargo as an opportunity that provides less chance of detection based on this potential threat of explosives and incendiaries in air cargo as well as in checked baggage ongoing research efforts are examining the feasability and effectiveness of equipping the passenger air carrier fleet with blastresistant cargo containers faa has had active res earch program in blast resistant containers for more than 10 years examining the ai rworthiness ground handling and blast resistance of hardened cont ainers which is now under the auspices of the tsas transportation security laboratory tsl39 these containers are seen as potential means for mitigating

the relative ease of access to aircraft at almost 19000 public us and private general aviation airports throughout the country these airports vary gr eatly in terms of their security risk and their proximity to major metropolitan areas that might be targeted in terrorist plots involving the use of general av iation aircraft security meas ures at these airports also vary greatly as some do not have per imeter fences and most are not staffed continuously to address these concerns th aircraft owners and pilots association aopa in cooperation with tsa has launched an irport watch program for pilots to report suspicious activities to law enforcement authorities similar to community neighborhood watch program the airport watch program provides training materials including brochure and video and toll free hotline 1866ga secure for pilots and airport operators one specific group that has b een instructed to be particularly watchful for suspicious activities are operators of agricultural aircraft eg crop dusters there is particular concern among some law enfo rcement and terrorism experts that terrorist groups may seek to use agricultural aircraft to disperse chemical or biological agents the national agricultural aircraft associ ation naaa has produ ced an educational program addressing security in aerial application opera tions and has cooperated in several industrywide fbi background i nvestigations since september 11 200144 in addition to the airport watch program veral operators of general aviation airports have enhanced security over the past two years by taking steps such as installing perimeter fences nd surveillance equipment hiring security personnel and establishing access controls to aircraft parking and operations areas these efforts have been carried

security to ensure that security measures are adequate and do not impos an undue burden on general aviation operators airspace restrictions since september 11 2001 the faa in consultation with federal state and local law enforcement agencies has implemented various temporary flight restrictions to prohi bit or limit flights over security sensitive locations and events while these restrictions typically apply to all aircraft they more specifically target general aviation operators who do not typically adhere to regular and predictable flig ht schedules and routes the faa has also implemented specific security procedures for the airspace around washington dc the washington dc airspace security measures consist of an air defense identification zone adi z that requires special flight procedures within this 30 mile radius of the city pilots in this area must be on an active flight plan use discrete transponder code and be in constant 2way radio communications with air traffic controllers who monitor flights and report deviations from assigned flight routes to law forcement agencies within 15miles of washington dc flight operations are furthe r restricted and only those aircraft with specific permission may enter this airspace currently general aviation operations are prohibited at washington reagan national airport while limited general aviation operations are permitted at the three small airports located within 15miles of washington dc these airports dubbed the dcthree include college park airport potomac airfield and hyde field operations at these airfields are generally limited to locally based aircraft that primarily consist of small singleengine airplanes these aircraft and their crews must undergo security checks and must adhere to specific operationa l procedures in order to operate to and from these facilities pilot groups and some members of congress ve expressed concern that restrictions on general av iation operations at reagan national airport and the dc three airports have had significant ec onomic impact on the operators of these facilities and have questioned the continuing need for these security measures the faa and

strictions have been imposed to protect airspace around major us cities and other pot ential terrorist targ ets for example during the war with iraq in marchapril 2003 additional airspace restrictions and security procedures were put into eff ect over new york city chicago and disney theme parks while specific security pr ocedures around major cities have since been rescinded or reinstated only for brief periods at times when the national security threat level has been elevated the flight restrictions around disney theme parks have continuously remained in effect so the fy2003 consolidated

enforcing airspace restrictions is difficult and defending ground based asse ts from aircraft penetra ting restricted airspace is even greater challenge congress may continue to monitor dhs faa and department of defense policies and proce dures regarding airspace restrictions and enforcement of those restrictions to ascertain whether homeland security requirements are adequately addressed though these measur users of the national airspace system are not unduly burdened and flight safety is not compromised
