public k12 education general over view and current status by rebecca r skinner and richard n apling beginning with fy2002 impact aid construction increased from 128 million to 48 million in appropriations 5 the infrastructure act authorized direct fede ral grants for repair renovation alteration and continuedconstruction the labor hea lth and human services edu cation and related agencies appropriations for fy2006 hr 3010p l109149 provided 178 million excluding the acrosstheboard rescission for im pact aid construction the final fy2006 appropriation provided 366 million excluding the across theboard rescission for credit enhancement for charter school fac ilities whereas the senate committee would eliminate funding for the program background one major issue of concern in the 109th congress is whether the federal government should assume greater responsibility for school construction some ar gue that the federal government already provides indirect financial support for school construction by exempting the interest on state and local governmental bonds from federal income taxation at varying annual cost to the federal government1 the exemption allows bonds to be issued at lower interest rate s that still provide competitive returns in addition the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 authorized tax credits for new form of obligation called q ualified zone academy bonds qzabs qzabs may be used for schools based in empowerment zone s or enterprise communities or with 35 of students qualified for free or reduced pr ice lunches under the federal school lunch program2 qzabs were extended through calendar year 2003 by the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 and then through calendar year 2005 by the working families tax re lief act of 2004 pl 108311 the federal governments direct role in financing elem entary and secondary school construction began with impact aid laws in 1950 there were also some precursors to the impact aid legislation that provided f unds for school construc tion some relief bills during the new deal expanded definitions3 of relief and public works to include school construction however there has been gap in federal funding for formal program for school construction other than through the im pact aid construction program which has had substantial reduction in funding in the past4 in the 103rd congress the education infrastructure act of 1994 title xii of the esea was enacted as federal grant program for school infrastructure the grant program was never funded5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20171crs3 5 continued construction of public elementary and secondary sc hools sc hool libraries and media centers grants were authorized for leas that lacked fi scal capacity and where school buildings were in urgent need of repair the initial funding for the infrastructure act title xii esea for fy1995 100 million was rescinded w ith subsequent funding 6 the highest estimate is from national educ ation association nea study published in 2000 modernizing our schools what will it cost nea suggests that the total funding need for public school modernization is 3219 billi on of that total 2682 billion of the need is for school infrastructure and 537 billion of the need is for education technology this report was prepared as statebystate assessment usin g research from nea affiliates in all 50 statesestimates of construction needs accurate estimates of school construction needs are difficu lt to obtain and most are based on opinion surveys of local school fficials however gao and nces have surveyed needs and projected costs to fulfill those needs gao reports eight gao reports have been issued three in 1995 three in 1996 one in 1997 and one in march 2000 dealing with school facilities americas schools report differing conditions gao june 1996 surveyed national sample of 1 0000 schools school officials were asked to estimate costs to repa ir or upgrade facilities to good overall condition at minimum offi cials estimated that 11 billion was needed to comply with federal mandates with total timated need of 112 billion the last in series of gao reports school facilities cons truction expenditures have grown significantly in recent years gaohehs0041 ma rch 2000 concludes that construction expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools 86000 across the nation have grown by 39 fro m fy1990 to fy1997 to about 25 billion in inflationadjusted 1998 dollars however average annual construction expenditures varied widely from state to state rangin g from 934 per pupil in nevada to 37 per pupil in connecticut with the national average at 473 according to gao states with the largest per pupil expenditures for construction eg nevada also had high enrollment growth rates most school construction is financed by state and local governmental bonds the interest on which is basically exempt from federal income tax in most states there is some combination of local and state funding although 15 states provided little or state funding for school cons truction in 19981999 gao indicated the data are incomplete with regard to funding s ources for school construction and an accurate estimate of the cost for construction needs is also difficult to obtain national center for educati on statistics nces study an nces study
