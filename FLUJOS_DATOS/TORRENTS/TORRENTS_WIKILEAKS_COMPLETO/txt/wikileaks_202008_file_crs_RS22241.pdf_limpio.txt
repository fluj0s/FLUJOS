be updated as warranted to incorporate new information hurricane katrina struck the us gulf coast on august 29 2005 causing widespread flooding and significant property nd infrastructure damage to the fishing and aquaculture industries in louisiana missi ssippi and alabama total of 15 major fishing ports 177 seafood processing facilitie s 1816 federally per mitted fishing vessels and more than 13000 statepermitted fishing ve ssels were located in the region initially affected by katrina katrina earlier brushed across the florida keys causing damage there as well on september 24 2005 hurri cane rita struck near the border between texas and louisiana causing further damage in eastern texas and western louisiana the number of fishing vessels beached sunk damaged or otherwise lost has not yet been determined other vessels are trapped in back bays by debris that blocks shipping channels for fishermen who did not lose their vessels recovery may be mitigated somewhat as many fishermen are traditi onally opportunistic adaptable and highly mobile moving vessels to avoid catastrophe shifting deliveries among ports as stocks move or prices offered by processors change as well as changing gear and refitting vessels to exploit different stocks at different times of the year unlike oysters which likely suffered significant mortality fish and crus tacean populations may have suffered minimal increased mortality due to the hurricanes in addition marketablility of catch appears little affected by contamina tion from storm runoff or cons umer concerns about such however persistent

area during this the peak harvesting season other vessels are beached or trapped by debris blocking shi pping channels rita extended the damage to western louisiana and eastern texas ho w much of the processing capacity and how many vessels might be salvageable is still being determined for shrimp the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries estimates the 12month potential loss at dockside at more than 81 million with 12month poten tial production losses at the retail level at almost 540 million1 an undetermined number of sh rimpers may have drowned trying to ride out the storm aboard their vessels but information is not yet available to document these fatalities millions of pounds of unrefrige rated shrimp at dama ged processing plants must be disposed the coast guard reportedly has approved ocean disposal of this waste prior to katrina this segment of the us fishing industry had been declining due to competition from lessexpensive foreign imports and among domestic harvesters since domestic capacity is much greater than necessa ry to efficiently harvest the resource in addition shrimp trawling is very fuel cons umptive and rising fuel costs make shrimp trawling increaingly uneconomical some shrimpers who survived katrina and rita may find it difficult to resume fishing because of high fuel costs additional impediments to shrimping are the underwater obstacles that foul and damage shrimp trawls hurricane debris will provide many new obstacles ie hangs and storm surges may have moved former obstacles to ne w uncharted positions2 the national marine fisheries service nmfs has promulgated temporary rule llowing shrimp trawlers to use limited tow times as an alternative to turtle excluder devices through october 24 20053 some shrimp fishermen in the affected areas have refloa ted beached vessels and are readying vessels to resume fishing some may relocate to other ports along the gulf coast oysters with the decline of oyster harves t from the midatlantic region the gulf coast has been providing most of the domestic oyster harvest oy ster beds and vessels along the gulf coast were extensively damaged if not totally destroyed by siltation and contamination related to katrina molluscan shellfish oysters clams and mussels beds in louisiana and mississippi are closed to harvesters for oysters the louisiana department of wildlife and

fish and shellfish stocks inshore nursery areas could have been disrupted although the hypoxic dead zone off the mouth of the mississippi river normally dissipates at this time of year it might be

to have been significantly harmed by katrinarelated events seafood consumers while some fish and shellfish from the gulf may disappear from the market extensive domestic and imported seafood lternatives remain there could be some increase in price as retailers adjust to different products and suppliers the price of oysters may be more affected than other seafood products because of less opportunity for substitution of similar ite ms however some shrimp and oysters are still being produced in unaffected parts of the gulf in addition fishermen are moving quickly to resume fishing with those vesse ls that were relatively undamaged the us food and drug administration fda is workin g with state and local officials to visit seafood processors packagers and transporters in the affected
