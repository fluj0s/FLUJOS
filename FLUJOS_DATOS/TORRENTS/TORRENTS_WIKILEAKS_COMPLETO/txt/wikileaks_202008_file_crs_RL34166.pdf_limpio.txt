concerns over allegations and appearances of improper or undue influence of special private interests and their hired lobbyists over highranking government officials and decision makers over the last few years several instances of individual members of congress and of certain highranking officials in the presidents administration incurring ethics problems andor being involved in federal or state

to 42 of the voters greater even than terrorism 40 the economy 39 or iraq 37 4 the task facing the 110th congress was to enact legislation to help restore the confidence of the general public in the fairness and equity of the democratic processes in government and in the integrity of the institution of the congress and its members any legislative solutions needed to take into consideration however the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech association and the right to petition the government for all citizens including those who are or who hire lobbyists to represent those

policy makers and decision makers in the federal government including hiring persons to represent such interests before the government and the public involves expression and conduct protected by the first amendments guarantees of freedom of speech association and petition 5 any regulation of lobbying activities must therefore not overly or unduly interfere with such protected advocacy rights and activities in the area of lobbying activities by paid professional lobbyists the regulation of such activity at the federal level has thus involved merely disclosure reporting and publicity as opposed to prohibitions limitations or restrictions on such conduct 6 the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 lda which replaced an earlier 1946 law governing lobbying disclosures is directed at socalled professional lobbyists that is those who are compensated to engage in certain lobbying activities on behalf of client or an employer7 in addition to covering only those who are paid to lobby the initial triggering provisions of the law cover only lobbying activities which may be described as direct contacts and communications with covered officials the laws registration requirements are not separately triggered by grass roots lobbying activities that is an organization which engages only in grass roots lobbying regardless of the extent of grass roots lobbying activities is not required to register its members officers or employees who engage in such activities and does not need to report or disclose its activities or expenses under the lda 8 5 united states v harriss 347 us 612 1954

changed or modified by each house separately by way of simple resolution without the concurrence of the other body or the signature of the president the provisions in s 1 regarding the senate rules on gifts are similar in many aspects to the internal changes made to the rules of the house in hres 6 in january of 2007 the new rules of both the house and senate now work to restrict under50 gifts from lobbyists foreign agents and their private clients which had been permitted under the former rules change the manner in which tickets or passes to luxury boxes at sporting and entertainment events are

their clients with certain exceptions for educational institutions house or other qualifying charitable institutions senate and for certain shortterm conferences and events concerning such officially connected travel one significant change which is intended to increase oversight and enforcement of the restrictions in the rules is that members and staff must now receive advance approval from the appropriate ethics committee when such travel is to be paid for by any outside private source prior to th current rules changes receipt of expenses or payment for such travel from lobbyists or travel which substantially involved recreational activities such as golfing or water sports or tennis were already prohibited by the express provisions of both house and senate rules and legitimate questions of enforcement and oversight of those rules had been raised under the new rules however before receiving such approval for officially connected travel member or staff employee must now certify to the appropriate ethics committee that the trip conforms to the requirements and strictures of the new regulations including the limitation on lobbyists involvement and participation in the trip and assuring that the source of funds does not come from lobbyists or except in very limited circumstances their clients additionally registered lobbyists who must file periodic reports on expenditures under the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as amended must now also certify that they have not offered gifts including travel to members of congress or staff that would violate the provisions of house or senate rules like any certification to an agency or department of the federal government such statement if intentionally false or fraudulent could be subject to the criminal penalties for false statements and fraud at 18 usc 1001 changes have also been made in internal congressional rules that require senator or senate staffer to reimburse for the use of noncommercial aircraft at the higher
