discusse s appropriations for water infrastructure programs of the environmental protection agency epa focusing on such designations in the account that funds these programs information on the programmatic history of epa involve ment in assisting wastewater treatment and drinking water projects is provided in two appendixes congressional appropriators began the practice of supplementing appropriations for the primary clean water act cwa and safe drinking water act sdwa assistance programs with grants for i ndividually designated projects in fy1989 since then of the 454 billion appropria ted to epa for water infrastructure assistance more than 15 7 billion has gone to designated project grants notably since fy2000 appropriators have aw arded such grants to larger total number of projects resulting in more comm unities receiving such assistance but at the same time receiving smalle r amounts of funds on average members of congress may intervene to provide funding for specific community for number of reasons in some cases the community may have been unsuccessful in getting state approval to fund the project under other programs some especially small and rural communities seek grant because the cost of project financed through state loan which must be fully repaid is deemed unacceptably high loans are the prima ry assistance under the cwa and sdwa however this congressional practice has been criticized by state water program managers and administrators of infrastruct ure financing programs because designated projects are receiving more favorable treatment 55 federal grants rather than loans and because the practice sidesteps th standard process of states determining the priority by which projects will recei ve funding projects so funded through appropriations acts also ve generally not been reviewed by congressional authorizing committees attention is often drawn to the relatively few projects that have received large grants more than 100 million especially over multiple years the majority of designated projects however receive comparatively small amounts more than 75 of the projects designated in the epa appr opriations legislation have received total awards either in single year or over multiple years of 2 million or less while some members of congress interest groups and administr ation officials are critical of these types of congressional actions it is likely that communities will continue to seek this type of assistance and there is little indication that the practice will

projects designated in epa appropriations trends and policy implications introduction congressional action to designate funds w ithin appropriations legislation for specified projects or locations has been increasing in recent years as way to provide funding for designated communities to build and upgrade water infrastructure systems in the past such legislative action has often been popularly referred to as earmarking the future needs for projects to treat municipal wastewater or treat and deliver public drinking wate r supplies in the united states are large 2025 billion for wastewater treatment and 277 billion fo r public water systems according to the most recent estimates reported by states and the environmental protection agency epa1 federal funding to assist communities in meeting the goals and requirements of environmental laws has been provided first through progra ms in the clean water act and also more recently through program in the safe drinking water act under the core assistance programs in these acts congress annually appropriates block amounts which are allocated among states acco rding to specified allotment formula states then make assistance awards to individual communities from 1972 through fy2008 congress has provided 858 billion for these core programs under both laws federal funds capitalize state revolving funds srfs which states then use to make loans to communities for water infrastructure capital projects local communities in turn repay loans to th state revolving fund not the federal government in fy1989 congressional appr opriators began the practice of supplementing appropriations for the srf programs with designated project grants in the epa appropriations account that funds clean wa ter act and safe drinking water act assistance unlike loans under the two srf programs these grants generally are provided on the basis of 55 45 federallocal cost sh aring with requirement to repay the federal shar since 1989 congress

referred to as earmarks there is single definition of the term earmark that is accepted by all practitioners and observers of the congressional appropria tions process nor has ther been standard practice across all 13 appropriations bills while definitions of this practice vary an earmark generally is considered to be an allocation of resources to specifically targeted beneficiaries they may be proposed by the president or may be originated by congress in the 110th congress number of budget process reform proposals were debated including changes to house and nate rules affecting earmarking as this practice has been controversial5 the focus of this report is funds set aside within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32201crs3 5 continued overview by robert keithepa stag account to fund individual water infrastructure projects locations or organizations detailed either in the appr opriations act or the joint explanatory statement of its accompanying conference report and not distinguishing those requested by the executive from those designated by congress trends in congressionally designated project grants pressure to provide designated special project grant funding has been evident in the appropriations process where in r ecent years congress has reserved as much as 30 of funds in the account that pr ovides clean water and drinking water assistance for specified communities the practice of designating portion of the construction grantssrf account for specifi c wastewater treatme nt and other water quality projects began in the fy1989 epa appr opriations

somewhat less in recent years 16 in fy2005 fy2006 and fy2008 the number of projects recei ving these designated f unds also has increased from four in fy1989 to 282 in fy2008 since fy2000 the larger total number of projects has resulted in more communities receiving such grants but at the same time receiving smaller amounts of funds thus while few communities have received individual awards of 2 million or more in recen t years the average size of grants has shrunk 181 m illion in fy 1995 49 million in fy1999 600427 in fy2005 108 million in fy2006 and 628340 in fy2008 see table 1 for additional detail fy2007 special case is discu ssed separately below conference reports on the individual appropriations bills provide some descri ption of projects funded in this manner but the text is typically very brief the effective result of using substan tial amounts for congressionally designated project grants has been to reduce the amount of funds provided to states to capitalize their revolving loan programs of th 454 billion appropriate d to epa for water infrastructure programs since 1989 both fo r wastewater under the clean water act and drinking water projects under the safe

comprehensive cwa reauthorization bill hr 961 but provisions in it that addressed regulatory relief and similar issues were controversial and further action occurred in the 107th and 108th congresses house and senate committees considered legislation to reauthorize water infrastructure financing programs but bill was enacted similar legislation was reported by senate committee in the 109th congress s 1400 but was not enacted in the 110th congress the house passed bill to reauthorize the cwas princi pal water infrastructure financing program on march 9 2007 hr 720in the early years of this congressiona l practice special purpose grant funding originated in the house version of the epa appropriations bill while the senate for the most part resisted the practice by rejecting or reducin g amounts and projects included in housepassed legisl ation with this differen ce in legislative approach special purpose grant funding was an issu on several occasions during the house senate conference on the appropriations bill since fy1999 however both the house and senate have propos ed projects in their respec tive versions of the epa appropriations bill with th final total number of proj ects and dollar amounts being determined by conferees in addition as it has now been 20 years since the last major amendments to the clean water act the desire by some members to address special needs wastewater problems that might be debated during reauthor ization of that act has increased thus leading to greater pre ssure on house and sena members to use the appropriations process to handle such concerns6 since the practice of designating project s began to increase in the early 1990s the position of the clinton and both bush administrations has been to propose limited number of such grants for incl usion in the presidents annual budget submission such as usmexico border projects but generally to oppose the congressional practice of specifying large number of projects as significant portion of funds in the stag account especia lly in recent years appropriators have supported most but not all pr ojects requested by the president while modifying the funding amounts for some of the administr ations requests and adding many more projects not requested by the administrati on for example the first administration request for specified pr oject was in the fy1992 budget the george hw bush administration sought 400 million at that time for grants to be directed to six projects in coastal cities congress agreed to funding for those six plus two others likewise in fy1993 congress agreed to gr ants for six projects requested by the administration plus seven others in fy2008 the administration requested grants for two special needs proj ects congress funded both of them plus 280 others project grants fo r specific cities the four projects designated in fy1989 were projects for which funding had been authorized in the 1987 water quality act wqa pl 1004 these project authorizations were in title v of the wqa which did not specifically amend the clean water act the authorized projects were boston to provide secondary trea tment of wastewater and improve the environmental quality of boston harbor httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32201crs6 7 some water infrastructure projects funded in the epa bill also have received designated funding in other appropriations acts for exam ple alaska native and rural village projects received 217 million in agriculture ppropriations acts from fy1997 to fy2006 additionally small number of those with gr ants designated in epa appropriations has received funding through energy and water velopment appropriations acts which fund water projects and programs of the us army corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation examples of water infrastructur projects funded in this dual manner include combined sewer overflow projects in lync hburg and richmond virginia and nashua new hampshire construction of alternative wate r supply in jackson county mississippi and projects to support an environmental restora tion plan in onondaga lake new york in general projects so designated in the ener gy and water appropriations bill have previously been authorized in legislation such as wat er resources development acts wrda before receiving appropriations since the 1992 wrda pl 102580 congress has authorized more than 100 corps environmental infrastructur projects and programs in that act and subsequent amendments to it and has provid ed energy and water appropriations to about onehalf of themsan diego to remedy discharges of untreated sewage from tijuana mexico des moines sewage trea tment plant project and oakwood beach new york for relo cation of natura l gas facilities related to two sewage treatment facilities for the next two years appropriato rs continued to designate only wqa authorized projects with one exception two of these authorized projects boston harbor and san diegotijuana continue d to receive some funding through fy1999 but most designations since fy1992 ve been for projects not specifically authorized in federal law from fy1989 to fy1999 congress appropr iated total of 740 million for the boston harbor project the largest tota l amount received by single community under provisions in the epa appropriati ons act few other communities have received large total amounts of such grants over multiple years for example the wqaauthorized san diego project received 235 million over seven years and another san diego project for wastewater reclamation facility received total of 135 million in the early 1990s ange was awarded total of 160 million from fy19921994 for unspecified projects new york city received 210 million in grants over that same time period also for unspecified in frastructure projects detroit has received grants totaling 350 million since fy1992 for project called the rouge river wet weather demonstrati on project designated funding in the epa appropriations act for projects along the usmexico border distributed to multiple communities have totaled 723 million since fy1996 projects in alaska native and rural villages also distributed to multiple locations have been awarded 384 million since fy19957 the large awards for these projects tend to mask the average value of water infrastructure designated project grants for example in fy2008 the average of all 282 awards was 628340 but discounting the 44 million for alaska native and rural village and usmexico border projects the average for other individual grants was

all earmarks until reformed process is put in place earmarks included in this years house and senate bills will be eligible for consideration in the 2008 process subject to new standards for transparency and accountability we will work to restore an acc ountable aboveboard transparent process for fundi ng decisions and put an end to the abuses that have harmed the credibility of congress under the fy2007 appropriations bill for epa that had been under congressional considera tion during 2006 hr 5386 the house would have provided 200 million for 146 special project grants the senate would have provided 210 million for 195 projects as result of the process adopted in pl 1105 none received funding the congre ssional moratorium did not apply to special project grants requested by th administration in the presidents fy2007 budget request it had sought 149 million fo r alaska native and rural villages 248 million for usmexico border project s and 990000 for single project in puerto

policy implications groups representing state water prog ram managers and administrators of infrastructure financing programs have criticized the congressional practice of awarding grants to designated communitie s they contend th at it undermines the intended purpose of the state funds wh ich is to promote environmental improvements nationwide many state offici als would prefer that funds be allocated more equitably not based on what they view largely as political considerations and they would prefer that state envir onmental and financin g officials retain responsibility to set actual spending prioritie s further they say because directedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32201crs8 funding to special projects diminishes the vel of seed funding for loans under state revolving funds it delays the time when stat will become financially selfsufficient and may actually prolong the period when states seek continued federal support the practice has been criticized because designated projects are receiving more favorable treatment than other communities projects they generally are eligible for 55 federal grants and will not be re quired to repay 100 of the funded project cost which they must do in the case of loan through an srf and the practice sidesteps the standard process of states determining the priority by which projects will receive funding it also means that th projects have generally not been reviewed by the congressional authorizing committees this is especially true since fy1992 when special purpose grant funding has been designated for projects not authorized in the clean water act or amendments to it or in the safe drinking water act members of congress may intervene to provide funding for specific community for number of reasons in some cases the community may have been unsuccessful in getting state approval to f und the project under an srf loan or other program for some especially small and rural communities the cost of project financed through state loan which the community must repay in full is deemed unacceptably high because repaying the loan can result in increased user fees that ratepayers feel are unduly burdensome th community then seeks grant to avoid this costly financial scenario numbe r of the special purpose grants have been made to projects characteriz ed as needy cities based on local economic conditions since fy1993 report language accompanyi ng the appropriations bills and specifically legislative language since fy 2004 has directed that grants awarded in this manner shall require that 45 of projects cost be the responsibility of the local community epa is allowed to be flexible in applying the local costshare based on the communitys financial capability but the agency has rarely modified the general requirement technically the cwa title ii grants program ended when authorizations for it expired after fy1990 one result of awarding special purpose grants in appropriations bills has been to perpetuate grants as method of funding wastewater treatment construction long after fy1990 at the same time it also results in grants which had not previously existed fo r drinking water system projects following enactment of an appropriations act project grants designated by congress are not provided automatically to the designated recipient communities or organizations since the funds are awarded as epa grants recipi ents must first meet all applicable epa requirements in regulations and guidelines that apply to other grant programs including applying for th grant and complying with other federal laws and requirements and must continue to comply with program and project specific rules as long as the grant remains active consequently there are administrative costs associated with special purpose grants both for the local communities and for epa which administers several hundred more of these grants every yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32201crs9 final thoughts attention is often drawn to the relatively few projects that have received large grant awards by congress especially over multiple years however the other side of that story is the large number of proj ects that receive relatively small amounts especially as percentage of the total cost of water infrastructure projects which can be very large even with the large awards described here for some communities more than 75 of the projects designated in the epa appropriati ons legislation have received total awards either in single year or over multiple years of 2 million or less the trend of appropriators to provide smaller awards is reflected in the fact that only small number of projects have recei ved awards of 1 million or more 62 out in fy2004 12 of total earmarks 76 in fy2005 11 of total 36 in fy2006 14 of total and 27 in fy2008 96 of total this congressional practice has raised two significant policy issues the first is that it alters the process of who deci des which water infrastructure projects will receive funding from state program offici als to members of congress for those projects not also requested by the execu tive and how the merits of particular projects may be evaluated the second issu noted above is that it reduces the amount of funds provided to capitalize state revolving loan programs thus arguably delaying the time when states will become financially selfsufficient in administering capital programs and potentially prolonging the time when states and communities seek continued federal aid some members of congress interest groups and administration officials are critical of including special project grants in this and other appropr iations acts other members and many local officials view it as an appropriate way to assist communities that would not be served by the legislated programs based on the recent trends th ere is little indication that the practice will cease despite the moratorium for fy2007 the practice re sumed in fy2008 although new rules do provide greater transparency by requiring that the sponsors of earmarks be identified in committee reports still as individual aw ard amounts have gotte n smaller it is not unreasonable to question whether some communities may conclude that the cost of receiving such funding both in terms of political capital spent to seek it and actual resources spent subsequently to secure the grant from epa exceeds the benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32201crs10 appendix background federal involvement in wastewater treatment the water pollution control act of 1948 pl 80845 was the first comprehensive statement of federal interest in clean water programs while it contained federally required goals limits or even guidelines it started the trickle of federal aid to municipal wastewater treatment authorities that grew in subsequent years it established grant program to assist localities with planning and design work and authorized loans for treatment plant construction with each of the four successive amending statutes in the 1950s and 1960s federal assistance to municipal treatment agencies increased construction grant program replaced the loan program the amount of authorized funding went up the percentage of total costs covered by federal funds wa s raised and the types of project costs deemed grant eligible expanded in the federal water pollution contro l act amendments of 1972 pl 92500 popularly known as the clean water act cwa congress revised the existing federal clean water law incl uding provisions related to wa stewater systems in the 1972 law congress strengthened the federal role in clean water and established the first national standards for sewage trea tment number of new conditions were attached to projects constructed with grants such as comprehensive planning requirements in order to assist communities in meeting the ambitious water quality improvement goals of the new law federa l funds increased dramatically and the federal share was raised from 55 to 75 the grant program was reauthorized in 1977 pl 95217 and again in 1981 pl 97117 efforts began focusing on us of federal funds for projects with clear environmental benefits out of concern that the prog rams wide scope was not well focused on key goals especially reflect ed in the 1981 amendments were budgetary pressures and desire to reduce federa l spending annual authorizations were reduced from 5 billion to 24 billion the fe deral share was again set at 55 and project eligibilities were limited the most recent cwa amendments we re enacted in 1987 pl 1004 that legislation authorized 18 billion over nine years for wastewat er treatment plant construction through combination of the traditional grant program and new state water pollution control revolving funds s rf program under the new program federal capitalization grants are provided as seed money for stateadministered loans to build sewage treatment plants and other water quality projects local communities in turn repay loans to the state process intended by congress to enable phaseout of federal involvement after states bu ild up source of capital for future investments under the ame ndments the srf program was phased in beginning in fy1989 and entirely replaced the previous grant program in fy1991 the intention was that states would have greater flexibility to set priorities and administer funding while fe deral aid would end after fy1994 as general matter states and cities supported th program changes and the shift to loan program that was intended to provide longterm f unding for water quality and wastewater construction activities however the change means that local communities now arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32201crs11 responsible for 100 of project costs fina nced under the srf program rather than 45 under the previous grant program while municipalities have made substantial progress toward meeting the goals and requirements of the act state water quality reports continue to indicate that discharges from wastewater treatment plants are significant source of water quality impairments nationwide the original authorizations expired in fy1994 but pressure to extend federal f unding by reauthorizing the title vi srf program and by providing appropriations both for srf cap italization grants and earmarked project grants has continued in part because estima ted funding needs remain large thus congress has continued to ppropriate funds and the anticipated shift to full state responsibility has not yet occurred author izations since 1972 for the previous title ii grant program and now for the title vi srf program have totaled 66 billion while appropriations have totaled 783 billion throug h fy2008 for the first 10 years following enactment of the 1987 am endments appropriations for wastewater treatment assistance title ii and title vi grants averaged 157 billion per year from fy1998 to fy2004 title vi appropria tions averaged 135 billion per year fy2005 appropriations

background federal involvement in drinking water in contrast to the 40plus years of federal support for fi nancing municipal wastewater treatment fac ilities congress only recently in 1996 established program under the safe dri nking water act sdwa to help communities with financing of projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations funding support for drinking water only ccurred more recently for several reasons first until the 1980s the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations second and relatedly good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively low cost by comparison essentially ll
