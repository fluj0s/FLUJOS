needed introduction and background postconflict societies are major us foreign policy concern the postconflict environment often perp etuates economic strife and poverty such as in cambodia and can lead to regional instability such as conflict in many central african countries that has been ongoing since the 1990s postconflict societies may also pr ovide potential haven to terrorist groups such as the talibans sheltering of qaeda in afghanistan in order to help improve the quality and qua ntity of postconflict assistance the us government has actively supported world bank involvement in postconflict aid growing component of world bank activity in 1998 world bank study showed that the volume of world bank lending to postc onflict countries has in creased by 800 since 1980 and that 16 of the world banks 1998 lending was to post conflict countries1 more recent estimates set the amount of post conflict assistance at between 20 and 25 of total current lending in 2003 the world bank lent 185 billion the increase in world bank lending to postconflict countries can most easily be attributed to an increase in conflicts durin g the 1990s the end of the cold war and the collapse of

form of velopment assistance with two goals 1 addressing shortterm challenges which may include humanitarian assistance and other forms of relief and postemergency assistance nd 2 repairing and in some cases creating the infrastructure both physi cal and institutional necessary to support longterm economic developmen t while these goals of relief and development are not inherently incompatible

process is designed to help country tr ansition from conflict to the normal world bank relationship with borrower countri the first stage is called watching brief and involves monitoring the evolving soci oeconomic situation on the ground during conflict this allows the world bank to begin preparations for its involvement once fighting ends the second stage is the creation of needs assessment once the physical safety of world bank staff can be guarant eed the bank usually along with the united nations will send in teams of analysts to research and prepare this report this document presents the banks analysis of countrys reconstructi on needs and estimates of their cost it is normally prepared prio r to an international donor conference where countries may pledge funds and draw up th framework for multidonor trust fund the needs assessment also plays fundamental role in the third stage the creation of transitional support strategy tss short to mediumter m assistance plan that often acts as bridge between shortterm recove ry assistance and longterm development objectives once recipient country successf ully emerges from conflict and is eligible for lending country assistance strategy cas will be prepared by the world bank the cas is the primary lending framework fo r world bank assistance usually prepared every three years the cas identifies key areas where world bank assistance would be most effective and proposes lending projects to accomplish these goals world bank grants the world bank is increasingly providing aid in the form of grants rather than loans grants accounted for 17 of all ida assistance in 2003 under the ida13 agreement pos tconflict countries are eligible to receive up to 40 of their ida allocation in grants negotiations for ida14 began in february 2004 and the administration has stated it will seek to increase the percentage of ida resources allocated as grants5 grant usage for 2004 is planned to be about 226 ida also sets aside 500 million per year for temporary increas for postconflict country allocations the world bank has created separate entity the postconflict fund pcf to provide grants for physical and social r econstruction in 2003 the pcf allocated 118 million through sixteen newly approved grants and disbursed 13 million across its total portfolio since the pcf was establis hed in 1997 615 million has been approved for 120 separate grants and 469 million has been disbursed7 world bank watching briefs and needs assessments are of ten funded by the pcf world bank trust funds aid recipients often are not member of the world bank it might owe arrears to the bank or there might be effective government for the world bank to deal with in these cases trust funds either admin istered solely by the world bank or by the world bank in conjunc tion with other inte rnational institutions have coordinated and disbursed post conflict aid there is rationale for bilateral donor s to provide post conflict aid through multilateral donors such as the world bank since the world banks charter abhors anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819crs4 8 alesina alberto and dollar david w ho gives foreign aid to whom and why

creating the conditions for war bretton woods project feb 2004political involvement many agree that it is more proficient as we ll as more credible provider of information about postconflict countries study has also shown that bilateral foreign aid is often heavily determined by donor fore ign policy interests rather the economic needs of the recipient country8 moreover since the world bank has some degree of autonomy from its donor members it may be easier for the bank to secure policy reforms in recipient countries than by individual donors it is also argued that governments provide aid multila terally when their publics are more skeptical about the benefits of providing the foreign aid sending foreign assistance through an institution such as the world bank can also help donor government reassure its c itizens that its foreign aid funded by tax revenue is being spent appropriately9 some analysts contend that the united states loses too much control over the provision of its aid with multilateral approach first they argue it is very difficult for donors to earmark funds when they are cont ributed multilaterally if other donors are not in broad support of the us aid agenda the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by pr oviding bilateral aid through the us agency for international developmen t or some other us agency second since the united states does not have veto power on world bank lending the bank sometimes provides assistance to countries despite strong us opposition for example the world bank approved 180 million in earthquake recovery in 2003 for iran state department determined supporter of intern ational terrorism purely b ilateral approach might ensure that us funds are used to support aid pr ograms that run counter to us foreign policy oversight issues for congress although aid is highly context specific some general questions may be raised as congress exercises its oversight role and c onsiders appropriations for the world bank and other international fi nancial institutions involved in postconflict assistance most importantly postconflict ope rations are major compone nt of the current ida14 negotiations these negotiations are expected to be concluded by the end of 2004 with the president seeking appropriations nd authorization during the upcoming 109th congress how extensive is world bank research into how aid impacts post conflict countries some argue that the world bank often rushes in to provide assistance during postconflict transitions without full understanding of the implications of how postconflict aid affects the recipi ent country critics have noted that on some occasions world bank interventions could serve to recreate the political or economic conditions that led to conflict in the first place10 increased conflict analysis and researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819crs5 11 collier paul and hoeffler anke aid policy and growth in postconflict societies world

ensure that civil violence is not systemically repeated does the postconflict country have the institutional infrastructure to effectively utilize donor assistance studies have found that although post conflict countries absorptive capacity is low dur ing roughly the first three years after the end of violence it tends to double by the end of the first decade11 this research suggests that it may be best not to create an aid surge in the immediate years after the cessation of violence but rather phase in assistance over the first decade however postconflict countries often receive the high est levels of foreign aid early on and such assistance often tapers off over the ensuing years what is the appropriate sequencing of reforms although there is often low initial aid absorptive capacity early policy decisions can greatly affect longterm economic growth potential one world bank study found that social policies such as monitoring poverty and establishi ng safety nets for marginaliz ed members of society are very important in the immediate postconflict environment but that such policy choices have been insufficiently incorporated into the design of postconflict aid evidence shows that donors often make monetary and fiscal policy and debt management their first priority once they commit postconflict aid12 is there clear and welldefined objective before aid is given although each recipient has both short and long term assistance needs an aid program can only be successful if these needs are clearly defined the bank has been very successful in conducting needs ssessment reports that have served as guides for post conflict assistance since ma ny other actors are involved in the postconflict environment such as the us agency for international development development program various international nongovernmental organizations clear wellcoordinated objective is imperative for successful transition out of conflict how does the world bank ensure that shortterm policies enacted do not compromise longterm objectives expansionary economic policies such as price controls or rapid expansion of government employees may create needed shortterm economic stimulus but they can complicate countrys longterm economic viability for example immediately following the introduction of aid flows to the west bank and gaza public expenditure s dramatically increased along with proliferation of government ministries13 once aid levels come down it is much harder to restrain fiscal spending consistency among short and long term economic policy plans is essential is there clear and well defined exit strategy major objective of any postconflict assistance must be the encour agement of local capacitybuilding to make governing decisions and ensure that local populations

reconstruction process domestic institutions must be built that can eventually take over the reconstruction process recent study has shown that in some cases c ountries can become recurrent users of inte rnational financial assistance these countries often lack the incentive and ability to make necessary reforms14 is the world banks role appropria tely coordinated with the united nations and other donors since the world banks mandate forbids its involvement in security and military related activities the u n plays vital and important role in establishing physical security nd often takes responsib ility for many political matters outside of the world banks mandate in some cases such as east timor the has served as the facto government of the postconf lict region in addition to providing security or its governance function the also has an external development role in helping the world bank coordinate donor assistance f unctional conflicts of interest could occur if the is helping coordinate the distribution of aid and at the same time is serving as facto government and is recipient of aid flows how extensive is the monitoring nd evaluation of postconflict aid major objective of the us government nd other donors is to reinforce the world banks efforts to increase the use of measur able results and performance based allocation in the world banks lending international attention often fades as one international crises segues into the next because postc onflict assistance is often most valuable years after the end of violence fu rther monitoring and evaluati on of postconflict aid efforts may be prudent to ensure that the bank is ad ministering such aid ffectively and adhering to us policy objectives this would also be in line with the administrations results measurements objectives additional issues active world bank postconflict activity raises many other questions including how do donor countries fore ign policy objectives interact or interface with the world banks mandate to avoid political activity what are the lessons learned from earlier interventions and how successful have the interventions been is the world bank the best international act or to coordinate developmen t assistance has previous donor coordination been successful or has there been overlap between national agencies activities and the other devel opment banks should postconf lict aid be provided in the form of grants or loans definitive answers are not available for many of these questions but greater understanding of postconflict aid and its imp acts would likely increase its effectiveness
