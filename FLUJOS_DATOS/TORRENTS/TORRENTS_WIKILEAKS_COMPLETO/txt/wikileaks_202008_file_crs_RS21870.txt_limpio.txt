aspects of permanent education tax benefits and authorized temporarily the higher education deduction this report very briefly describes the postsecondary education tax benefits available to individuals and highlights their temporaryversuspermanent features it discusses legislation that would remove the applicability of egtrras sunset provision to these education tax benefits and hr 1424

economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 it authorized the deduction for tuition and related fees for tax years 2002 through 2005 in december 2006 congress reauthorized the deduction retroactive to its expiration date and extended it to december 31 2007 in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 hr 1424 the emergency economic stabilization

the agi limits are adjusted for inflation and the amount of the deduction is not phased out as agi increases1 egtrra also extended through december 31 2010 the temporary exclusion for employerprovided educational assistance which was set to expire for courses beginning after december 31 2001 the act allowed the 5250 annual limit on education httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21870 assistance to again cover graduate as well as undergraduate courses the income exclusion originated with enactment of the revenue act of 1978 pl 956002 although the abovetheline deduction for classroom expenses of elementary and secondary k12 school educators often is included in conversations about education tax benefits its purpose differs from that of the other provisions the educator deduction initially authorized in the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107 147 is intended to help elementary and secondary school teachers among other school personnel defray expenditures for classroom materials they voluntarily make to enhance the quality of students education like the higher education deduction it most recently was reauthorized retroactive to its expiration date and extended to december 31 2009 in hr 1424 the classroom expense deduction is available to teachers instructors counselors principals and aides employed at least 900 hours in school year at public and private k12 schools it is limited to 250 for purchases of certain items eg books and supplies used by educators in the classroom3 1 for additional information see crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction

lifetime learning credits for qualified postsecondary education expenses since tax year 1998 persons with income tax liabilities4 may subtract from them the tuition and related fees paid on behalf of students eg child spouse or themselves claimed as exemptions on their returns before determining the amount of the tuition and fees for which the credits can be claimed qualified expenses must be reduced by any taxfree scholarships and financial aid eg pell grants awarded to the student the two credits are intended to aid different student populations for the hope credit students enrolled at least halftime in program leading to an educational credential who are in their first two years of postsecondary school and for the lifetime credit students enrolled in one or more courses at the undergraduate or graduate level who need not be pursuing an educational credential the hope credit was capped at 1650 per student in tax year 2007 the lifetime credit at 2000 per return only one of the credits may be claimed for given student in 2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21870 the amount of the credits was gradually reduced for single return tax filer with agi between 47000 and 57000 joint filer between 94000 and 114000 agi limits may be adjusted annually for inflation5 the education savings bond program which became effective in 1990 pursuant to section 6009 of the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of 1988 pl 100647 is permanent as well bond owners who apply the principal and interest of series ee and i bonds toward tuition and related fees on behalf of dependent student at the undergraduate or graduate level in the same year in which the bonds are redeemed may be eligible to exclude the interest from their taxable income the bond must be registered in the taxpayers andor spouses name rather than the dependents name the taxpayer must claim an exemption for the student and must meet agi limits in the year in which bond proceeds are used toward tuition and related fees in 2007 the exclusion began to phase out at an agi above 65600 for single filer and above 98400 for joint filer the exclusion cannot be taken by single filers whose agi is at least 80600 for joint filers 128400 agi limits may be adjusted annually for inflation6 egtrra changed temporarily typically for tax years 2002 through 2010 certain aspects of three other permanently authorized education tax benefits two of the benefits are meant to encourage individuals to save toward future educational expenses ie the 4 to take advantage of nonrefundable credits taxpayers must have income tax liabilities remaining after they have taken personaldependency exemptions standard or itemized deductions and other personal credits 5 for additional information see crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction 6 for additional information see crs report rl32155 taxfavored higher education savings benefits and their relationship to traditional federal student aid by linda levine and charmaine mercer hereafter cited as crs report rl32155 taxfavored higher education savings benefits crs4 coverdell education savings accounts and section 529 programs the third is the student loan interest deduction the coverdell education savings account cesa is trust or custodial account that originated as the education ira in pl 10534 for the purpose of providing taxfree savings vehicle for higher education expenses the account became available in 1998 the appeal of the permanently authorized cesa was enhanced in egtrra starting in tax year 2002 but on january 1 2011 absent congressional action the following modifications will be supplanted by their prior versions7 the annual limit on an individuals aftertax contributions to beneficiarys account was quadrupled to 2000 from 500 the marriage penalty was eliminated as well such that joint filer with an agi below 220000 is now eligible to make contributions to cesas compared to prior law when their agi had to be below 160000 taxfree cesa withdrawals were extended from payment of qualified higher education expenses eg tuition books and supplies to payment of qualified k12 expenses eg tuition tutoring and uniforms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21870 higher education expenses were expanded to include for example special needs services for special needs beneficiaries8 for special needs beneficiaries the under18 age limit for contributions to cesas was eliminated as was the requirement that funds in cesas generally be distributed to beneficiaries by age 30 the date by which contributions to cesas can be made was extended to the tax filing date for that year the length of time for corrective withdrawals of excess contributions and associated earnings to avoid 6 excise tax was extended to june 1 from the due date of the beneficiarys tax return for the contribution year the definition of beneficiarys family members was extended to first cousins into whose accounts funds may be rolled over taxfree from existing accounts and who may be named as new beneficiaries of existing accounts this too is the case for section 529 plans discussed below before determining the qualified expenses that cesa withdrawals can offset expenses must be reduced by the amount of taxfree scholarships and financial aid eg pell grants taxpayers then can claim hope or lifetime credit or higher education deduction for the remaining tuition and fees of given student and make taxfree withdrawals from cesas if the withdrawals do not go toward the same expenses for which the other benefits are claimed before january 1 2002 taxpayers could not claim the credits unless they waived the taxfree treatment of cesa withdrawals if through december 31 2010 cesa withdrawals become taxable because of receipt of taxfree assistance and of education credits or deductions the withdrawals will not be subject to the 10 tax penalty usually assessed nonqualified distributions 7 ibid 8 definitional changes were made to room and board as well the changes similarly apply to section 529 programs crs5 few states sponsored qualified tuition program before its federal tax treatment was clarified at section 529 of the internal revenue code by the small business job protection act of 1996 pl 104188 two types fall within the permanently authorized section 529 program prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans aftertax contributions to beneficiaries 529 college savings plans are invested by account owners in one of many portfolios predetermined by state sponsors and withdrawals from the accounts can pay for variety of postsecondary expenses aftertax contributions to prepaid tuition plans on behalf of beneficiaries are collectively invested by plan sponsors to serve as hedge against tuition inflation egtrra extended sponsorship of prepaid tuition plans from states to institutions of higher education effective through december 31 2010 the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 made permanent this and other temporary amendments to 529 plans included in egtrra for example pl 109 280 made permanent the taxfree treatment of 529 withdrawals used to pay qualified education expenses and the ability of taxpayers to contribute to 529 plan and cesa in the same year for the same beneficiary without incurring penalty to take an education credit or deduction for tuition and fees in the same year that taxfree withdrawals are made from 529 plan provided that the distributions are not used toward the same expenses for which the credit or deduction is claimed and to make one taxfree same httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21870 beneficiary rollover in 12month period9 an abovetheline deduction from taxable income of up to 2500 in annual interest payments on student loans was permanently authorized as of 1998 in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the loans must have been used toward the cost of attendance for students enrolled at least halftime in undergraduate and graduate programs leading to an educational credential from 2002 through 2010 the student loan interest deduction longer is restricted to interest paid within the first 60 months during which interest payments are required unlike under prior law egtrra also allows voluntary payments of interest to be deducted over the period in addition the act raises the agi of taxpayer who may claim the tax benefit from 55000 to 65000 for single filer and from 75000 to 130000 for joint filer effective in 2002 from 2003 through 2010 the income limits may be adjusted annually for inflation thereafter absent congressional action agi will revert to preegtrra levels legislation related to the relationship between egtrra and education tax benefits the 110th congress did not actively consider the application of egtrras sunset provision title ix to the acts affordable education provisions title iv generally title iv is composed of subtitle education savings incentives subtitle b educational assistance subtitle c liberalization of taxexempt financing rules for public school construction and subtitle d other provisions ie section 431s establishment of the higher education deduction rather the 110th congress concerned itself specifically with the higher education deduction that egtrra had authorized in title iv subtitle d 9 for additional information see crs report rl32155 taxfavored higher education savings benefits and crs report rl31214 saving for college through qualified tuition section 529 programs both by linda levine crs6 some members supported retaining the higher education deduction as evidenced by legislation to expand the tax provision extend it or make it permanent eg hr 193 hr 411 hr 686 hr 1407 hr 1437 hr 2411 hr 2734 hr 2782 hr 3388 hr 3630 hr 3879 hr 3906 hr 4086 hr 6049 s 359 would have removed applicability of egtrras sunset provision to the higher education deduction and enhanced it while also amending the deductions definition of an eligible student to conform to that of the hope credit ie carrying at least half the normal fulltime work load for the course of study being pursued members also appeared to favor simplifying use of the federal tax code to help individuals better afford college10 for example hr 2902 s 614 and s 2763 would have replaced the higher education deduction and the two education credits with one credit proposals to eliminate the higher education deduction and lifetime learning credit or to retain them but substitute the hope credits definition of an eligible student would curtail peoples access to tax benefits that reduce the cost of taking courses during ones working life to acquire or improve job skills only one of the bills noted above went beyond committee referral namely hr httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21870 6049 the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 the house passed the bill on may 21 2008 among its many provisions was oneyear extension of the higher education deduction the senate attached its version of hr 6049 to financial rescue bill hr 1424 that it passed on october 1 2008 the senate substitute language extends the higher education deduction from december 31 2007 to december 31 2009 on october 3 2008 the house voted favorably on hr 1424 which includes the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 at division c the jct estimates the extension of the deduction might cost 31 million in fy2009 and 22 million in fy2010 10 for examples of the complexity that families face choosing between the three tax provisions see crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction
