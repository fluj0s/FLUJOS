in contempor ary practice however it is difficult to know when the last six days of session begin ad journment resolutions usually are not approved until very shortly before the adjournment takes place the house sometimes agrees to special rules near the end of session that ma ke motions to suspend the rules privileged for the remainder of the session 5 at the start of the 108th congress the house agreed to standing order that allowed the speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules on wednesdays through apr 9 2003 on apr 30 2003 the house agreed by unanimous cons ent to continue to grant this authority to the speaker through june 25 2003 congressional record daily edition apr 30 2003 p h3532 on june 26 2003 the house agreed to resolution hres 297 stating that the speaker could

by the committee on rules suspension of the rules on wednesdays hres 5 amended house rule xv clause 1a to allow the speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules on wednesdays 3 previously house rules only granted this authority to the speaker on mondays and tuesdays4 this change codified the increasingly common practice of adding certain wednesdays as suspension days in the 108th and several preceding congresses wednesday was added as suspension day on an ad hoc basis by unanimous consent special rule or standing order5 entertaining motions to suspend the ru on wednesdays has helped the house to better manage the growing number of measures considered under suspension procedures in the 108th congress 924 measures were brought up under suspension compared to 685 measures brought up under suspension in the 107th congress6 furthermore in recent congresses fewer motions to suspend the rules have beenentertained on mondays this practice may reflect broader trends in how the house schedules legislative business 7 repeal of the corrections calendar hres 5 amended the house rules in several places to remove all mention of the corrections calendar procedural device created in the 104th congress to expedite the cons ideration of legislation that corrected or eliminated ambig uous laws and regulations under the former procedures that were described in clause 6 of rule xv the speaker could place measures reported by committees on the corrections calendar the measures could be called up for consid eration on the second and fourth tuesdays of each month debate on bills

was also in order passage of measures called from the corrections calendar required threefifths vote the procedure was used with some frequency during the 104th congress but its use declined markedly in succeeding congre sses twentyone bills were considered from the corrections calendar in the 104th congress but in the three subsequent congresses 105th107th total of eight bills were considered using the procedure bills were considered from the corrections calendar in the 108th congress house leaders concluded that the purpose of the corrections calendar could be more easily achieved through the use of othe r procedures for the consideration of legislation such as unanimous c onsent or suspension of the rules9 reference to the senate in debate hres 5 amends rule xvii clause 1b to allow references to the senate and senators during debate while directing members as always to keep remarks re levant to the subject under debate and to avoid personality hres 5 strikes the paragraphs in the rule that described the kinds of senate references that were previously allowed according to house leaders the change will expand the permissible references to the senate but still maintain the traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings10 the speaker will continue to call memb ers to order who violate this house rule for almost 200 years the house stric tly interpreted br itish parliamentary custom and did not allow members of the h ouse to refer in debate to senate actions or senators or to the senate at all except in general neutral and factual way11 one reason behind the prohibition was the prin ciple that two chambers of bicameral legislature should make decisions independe ntly of each other without referring to arguments made in the other body the ot her reason was that the prohibition would minimize disputes or misundersta ndings between the chambers12 in the late 1980s the house loosened th prohibition against references to the senate that had been established by precedent13 1987 amendment to house ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32772crs4 13 continued daily edition jan 3 1989 p h7 14 the original rule included only the question of passing bills or resolutions or agreeing to conference reports in the 97th congress the house added the question of agreeing to motion to suspend the rules and on ordering the previous question on special rules in the 98th congress the rule was changed to allow th speaker to schedule vote on the question of agreeing to the speakers approval of the journal later in the legislative day in the 101st congress the question of agreeing to motion to instruct house conferees if they failed to report was added and in the 106th congress the house added the question of agreeing to an initial motion to instruct conferees in the 104th congress the house expanded the list to include vote ordering the previous question on all the questions that are susceptible of postponement house manual sec 1030 p 808allowed members to refer to senate actions if they were matter of public record and to refer to the sponsorship or status of bills resolutions and amendments in the senate in 1989 the house further expa nded permissible references to allow members to provide factual descriptions of senate ac tion or inaction on measure before the house and to quote senate pr oceedings relevant to the creation of legislative history establishing the meanin g of measure before the house house rules however still prohibited characterizations of senate action or inaction and references to individual senators quotations from senate proceedings that would not be relevant to the legislative histor of measure then under debate were also prohibited authority to postpone and cluster votes since 1979 house rules have granted the speaker the authority to post pone certain electronic votes clause 8 of rule xx allows the speaker to schedule votes on some questions at convenient time within the next two legislative days postponing votes on questions so that series of electronic votes can be taken b acktoback is generally considered to be convenient for all members the rule furthe rmore allows the speaker to shorten the length of electronic votes if several vot are postponed then after the first vote is held open for the minimum 15 minutes requi red by house rules the speaker can reduce the time for all subseque nt votes to 5 minutes each since the adoption of the original rule allowing the speaker to postpone certain votes the house has amended the rule several times to include votes on additional questions14 this most recent revision adds three questions to the list of questions that can be postponed agreeing to motion to reconsider agreeing to motion to lay on the table motion to reconsider and ag reeing to an amendment reported from the committee of the whole the three questions added to the list of votes that can be postponed are rarely settled by recorded vote and therefor the speaker will have few opportunities to postpone them one motion to reconsider the vote on final passage of the bill and in fact on most questions decided in the house can be made by member on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32772crs5 15 house rule xix clause 3 provides the opport unity to offer the motion to reconsider the motion can only be made in the house not in the committee of the whole furthermore it is only in order the same day as the vote or on the day after the vote for more information see house manual sec 1003 pp 783788 and crs report rl32207 commonly used motions and requests

rises and reports see crs report 98995 the amending process in the house of representatives by christopher m davis and stanley bach 17 this longstanding practice was codified in house rule xx clause 5c in the 108th congress hres 5 of the 109th congress also amended the rules to include the long standing definition of whole num ber of the house the number of representatives chosen sworn and living whose membersh ip in the house has not been terminated by resignation or action of the houseprevailing side of the question15 the motion is rarely made instead it is routinely laid on the table without objection the house also does not often vote elect ronically on amendments reported from the committee of the whole most major measures are considered in the committee of the whole and most amendments ar offered debated and voted on in the committee of the whole16 since the committee of the whole is technically committee of the house any amendments that are agreed to are reported to the full house and since only the h ouse has the authority to actually amend the bill the amendments must be voted on again gene rally all amendments agreed to in the committee of the whole are agreed to bloc by voice vote after the committee of the whole reports to the house member could howev er demand separate vote on any amendment voting sec ond time on all the amendments could potentially be timeconsuming the rules change will allow the speaker to schedule electronic votes on these amendments if demanded at later time in the legislative schedule quorum in the case of catastrophic circumstances article i section 5 clause 1 of the c onstitution states that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do bu siness quorum has long been defined as majority of the whole number of the house and the whole number of the house has long been viewed as the number of members elected sworn and living whenever the death resignation disqualif ication or expulsion of member results in vacancy the whole number of the house is adjusted17 in the event of catastrophe however it may not be immediately known whether member is alive or dead thereby making it impossible to adjust the whole number of members furthermore if member is incapacitated but living or unharmed but unable to attend the proceedings of the house he or she would still count toward the whole number used to determine quorum missing injured and stranded members are still elected sworn and living if many such members are affected and the congress needs to act this situation coul d prove problematic because it may be impossible to establish quorumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32772crs6 18 the failure of the house to comply with the constitutional quorum requirement is demonstrated if majority of the whole number of the house does not respond to quorum call or call of the house or do not participate in record vote for more information see crs report 98988 voting and quorum procedures in the house of representatives by stanley bach 19 sectionbysection summary of h res 5 adopting house rules for the 109th congress congressional record daily edition jan 4 2005 p h13 20 this motion is in order even if the abse nce of quorum has been demonstrated article i section 5 clause 1 of the constitution states that in the absence of quorum smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide 21 under the modern practice the call to compel attendance of absent members rarely occurs but for an example of proceedings see congressional record daily edition nov 2 1987 p h9459in order to address this issue the house modified clause 5 of rule xx to prepare for catastrophic ev ent that leaves large number of members missing incapacitated or incapable of attending the proceedings of the house the addition to the rule establishes method for blishing provisional quorum in the case of catastrophic event this new thod does not provide new means for determining the whole number of the hous on the contrary it is method to be used provisionally until quorum can be c onstituted by majority of the whole number of the house under the new rule if the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstance then quorum sh all be majority of the provisional number of the house steps required to establish the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstance the rule requires four st eps to be taken in order and without intervening adjournment to tablish that the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstan ces only after the steps described below are taken will quorum be determined based on the provisional number of the house majority of members presen t may terminate the proceedings by adopting the motion to adjourn first dispose of motion to compel the attendance of absent members if the absence of quorum is demonstrated18 then under house rule dating back to 1789 member can make mo tion to compel the attendance of absent members this motion described in hous rule xx clause 5a must first be disposed of either favorab ly or unfavorably before any other steps are taken to establish that the house is without quorum due to catastr ophic circumstances19 the motion to compel the attendance of absent members requires majority vote for adoption and that majority must comprise at least 15 members20 if the motion is adopted then the call of the house occurs through members presenting themselves perhaps after receiving notification from the sergeantatarms and having their presence recorded by the clerk21 if the motion is not adopted either because it failed to garner support from ma jority of members present or because the majority supporting it is fewer than 15 members then the motion is stillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32772crs7 22 under some conditions house rules grant th speaker the authority to declare recess clause 12b of rule i states to suspend the business of the house when notified of an imminent threat to its safety the speaker may declare an emergency recess subject to the call of the chair clause 12 also author izes the speaker to declare recess when question is pending before the house 23 in catastrophic circumstances the person ex ercising the authorities of the office of speaker might not be an elected speaker or speaker pro tempore he or she might be speaker pro tempore appointed unde r clause 8a or clause 8b1 of rule i or acting under clause 8b3 of rule iconsidered disposed of and the other step s necessary to establish that the house is without quorum due to catastrophi c circumstances can occur second conduct 72hour call of the house that does not produce quorum after disposing of the motion to compel the attendance of absent members the house must have call or ries of calls of the house over period of 72 hours excluding time spent in recess22 the call could be the one that was ordered by adoption of the motion to compel the attendance of absent members the speaker23 could also entertain motion for call of the house under clause 7b of rule xx however ordered if the ca ll failed to produce quorum based on the existing whole number of the house after 72 hours then the call could be closed and additional steps to establish that the h ouse is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances could be taken third the speaker must receive catastrophic quorum failure report and announce its contents to the house after the call of the house is closed the speaker with the majority and minority leader can then receive from the sergeantatarms or his designee catastrophic quorum failure report that states the hous cannot estab lish quorum b ecause of catastr ophic circumstances such as an attack or natural disaster according to the rule catastrophic quorum failure report must contain the number of known vacancies list of former representatives whose seats are vacant this list would include any known dead representatives as well as any representatives who resigned or w ho were removed by action of the house if their seats had not yet been filled list of representatives considered incapacitated list of representatives not incapacitated but still incapable of attending the proceedings of the house and list of representatives not accounted for the sergeantatarms is directed by the new rule to prepare the report in consultation with the attending physician to the congress or his designee the clerk of the house or his designee and public h ealth and law enforcement officials the speaker after consultation with the two pa rty leaders is required to announce the content of the report to the house th is announcement is not subject to appealhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32772crs8 24 according to the new rule if the hous is conducting business with provisional quorum then it cannot expel representative who is not incapacitated but is otherwise incapable of attending the proceedings of the house rule xx clause 5c6 25 congressional record daily edition jan 4 2005 p h10 the speaker cited the numerous precedents in house manual sec 628 p 341 and specifically asher c hinds hinds precedents of the house of re presentatives of the united states washington gpo 1907 vol ii sec 1255 pp 805807 and secs 13181320 pp 873874fourth conduct 24hour call of th house that does not produce quorum even after the speakers announcemen t the house is not considered to be without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances until the completion of second extended call of the house this call of the house can be ordered under the procedures described in clause 5a of rule xx or by motion for the call under clause 7b this second call of the house or series of calls c ould be closed after 24 hours excluding the time spent in recess if it did not pr oduce majority of the whole number of the house the provisional number of the house if all four of these steps are completed then the house has establis hed that it is wit hout quorum due to catastrophic circumst ances quorum for conducting business can then be determined based on the provisional number of the house the number of members who res pond to the 24 hour call of the house will be the provisional number of the house and majority of the provisional number will constitute quorum for doing business if members rrive after the call of the house the provisional number is increased accordingl if any member counted under the 24hour call of the house to determine th provisional number later ceases to be representative due to death resignation or action by the house then the provisional number of the house would also be reduced accordingly24 the catastrophic quorum failure report must be updated each legislative day in other words it must be updated each time the house reconvenes after an adjournment the speaker is required to make these updates available to the house if at any time sufficient number of memb ers arrive to constitu quorum of the whole number of the house then the provisional number would longer be in effect constitutionality of th provisional quorum some members expressed concern that the catastrophic quorum rule was unconstitutional when hres 5 was called up for consideration representativ made constitutional point of order the speaker declined to entertain the constitutional point of order citing numerous earlier precedents barring the speaker from ruling on the constitutionality of pending proposal25 instead typically the house determines for itself the constitutionality of proposition either by voting to consid er it or voting to adopt it the representative then raised the question of consideration and the house by vote of 224192 agreed to consider hres 5 and the provisions in it dealing with the new quorum procedure thereafter hres 5 was agreed to by vote of 220195 whether an attempt will be made to challenge in court the constitutionality of the rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32772crs9 26 for more information on the issue of cat astrophic loss of members of congress see crs report rl31394 house
