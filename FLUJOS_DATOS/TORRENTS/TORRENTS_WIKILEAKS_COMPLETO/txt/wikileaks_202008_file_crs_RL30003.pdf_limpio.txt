exemption from the acts minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for those employed in the capacity of outside salesman now secti on 13a1 of the act such persons working beyond their employers base

flsa is the primary federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay child labor and related issues enacted in 1938 pl 75718 the flsa has frequently been amended to alter its sc ope and to modify its implementation2 evolution of the statute the flsa is the result of century of negotiation ove r labor standards speaking generally workeroriented groups ve sought to expand the scope of labor protections and to enhance their enforcem ent conversely many industry groups critical of labor standards re gulation have sought to d iminish such requirements and where repeal has not been an option to defi ne coverage so as to reduce the employer burden through 60 years the flsa has been subject to such amendment sometimes proworker and on other occasions proemployer but usually argued by both sides in the name of the workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs2 3 for details concerning implementation of s ection 13a1 see 29 cfr 541 especially subparts 541500 to 541508 this exemption like much of the rest of the flsa was drawn from experience with the nati onal industrial recovery act of 1933the act both through amendment and th rough regulatory action has frequently been updated to meet the volving requirements of the 20thcentury workplace evolution of the flsa can be divided in to two broad periods from 1938 to the early 1970s amendment of the act tended to expand coverage since the 1977 flsa amendments however changes in the act often narrowly focused and incremental have tended to constr ict coverage and some may argue to reduce worker protections the early flsa was reasonably simple nd direct it required that covered workers be paid at least minimum wage and when asked to work unusually long hours that they receive overtime pay it also limited child labor through the years the statute has become increasingly complex responding to the specific interests of constituencies pro and body of exempti ons has been added to the act these statutory changes have resu lted in development by the department of labor dol of technical implementing regulations together with opinion letters to guide application of the law to individual workplaces the various inside sales proposals would generally modify the minimum wage and overtime pay obligations of employers with respect to any employee employed in sales position where certain qualifying conditions are met defining those qualifying conditions would seem to be one of the core issues of the continuing debate section 13a1 of the flsa in 1938 congress excluded certain wo rkers from flsa coverage and similarly exempted their employers from the acts minimum wage and overtime pay requirements among those exempted were persons employed in the capacity of outside salesman concept to be defined and delimited by dol since outside sales personnel were engage d beyond supervisory purview and thus an employer was unable to monitor the hours they wo rked and relate such hours to minimum hourly wage requirements the exemption may have been less positive statement of policy than simply logical and necessary this provision section 13a1 remains in the act3 diverse treatment of sales personnel during the 1960s and early 1970s flsa coverage was significantly expanded bringing additional sales pe rsonnel under the acts wage and hour provisions these newly covered sales workers were treated somewhat differently from the outside salesman of the original statute this treatment reflected the conditions under which they worked ie inside an establishm ent or at least on the premises and under the direct supervision of an employer va riations were allowed in the application of wagehour coverage to different categor ies of covered sale s workers but the distinction between inside and out side sales personne l was retainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs3 4 the wall street journal january 28 1997 p a18 the washingtonbased labor policy association lpa is public policy advocacy organization

overtime 1½ times ones regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty in single workweek flexible and compressed scheduling is permitted with employer approval here employer discretion is key the employer can set straight 40hour workweek 5 days of 8 hours each but he can also allow somewhat wider latitude and institute flexibility under current law sales worker with employer agreement can arrange his or her workhours to accommodate client need s the only restraining factor other than employer approval is that hours wo rked per week when in excess of 40 must be compensated on timeand ahalf basis should the employer determine that business interests eg increased sales or profitability justify having an employee work more than 40 hours per week extendi ng the hours of work is management option the impetus for change during consideration of the wage hour legislation of 19371938 there was intense debate over coverage patterns immediately af ter the flsa was adopted its amendment was sought in each congress si nce that time there have been proposals to modify the act some to expand covera ge many others to grant either total exemption or specialized treatment under th law to one employer group or another through the years employer spokesper sons have argued that the acts modification has been and remains n ecessary in order to correct technical deficiencies to deal with administrative ambiguities to restore the original intent of the congress or simply to modernize 1938 statute with time employer efforts to modify the flsa have coalesced by the 1990s the

legislative proposals during recent years we are embarking on course of chipping away at the fair labor standards act instead of doing thorough analysis of it remarked representative owens dny the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on workforce protections during the spri ng of 1997 he suggested he would welcome comprehensive piece of legislation that would thoroughly examine the flsa and set it within the context of what is happening in labor today11 but in the absence of broad review chairman ballenger rnc declared that the subcommittee would look at obstacles in the law which prevent employers and employees from working out arrangements which benefit both pa rties and which need to be updated to reflect the i ssues confronting todays workplace12 congressional oversight phase one three broad sections of the flsa are at issue with respect to overtime pay for sales personnel section 6 deals with the federal minimum wage section 7 with overtime pay section 13 contains the body of exemptions and is in turn divided into subparts sec tion 13a exemptions both from the minimum wage and from overtime pay section 13b exemptions only from the overtime pay requirements of the act thus the siting of pr oposed amendment is of some importance13 recently the focus has been primarily though not exclusively upon overtime pay at issue are two current flsa provisions first section 7i which deals with certain retail and rvice workers and second section 13a1 which deals withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs6 14 in the proposals the new language is vari ously section 13a17

overtime pay for sales personnel two patterns have emerged in the 103rd and 104th congresses legislation was proposed but not adopted to alter coverage under section 7i with respect to retail and service employees in the 105th congress both legislative language nd debate shifted the legislation of the 105th congress hr 2888 approved by the house in june 1998 would have added new subsection to section 13a the latter focus has continued through the 106th and the 107th congresses the 103rd congress in march 1994 thenrepresentative murphy dpa explained that outside sales personnel and inside commission sales personnel were governed by two separate flsa sections s ection 13a1 the exempti on for outside sales workers and section 7i an exemption for certain retail and service sales workers the latter was governed by two conditions l these workers must earn in excess of 1½ times the standard minimum wage and 2 at least half of the workers total compensation must be made up of commissions re presentative murphy then introduced legislation to amend section 7i by striking retail or service establishment and inserting an establishment15 the murphy bill would have made all qualifying establishments exempt from flsa overtime pay requirements qualifying workers in such establishments would have lost overtime pay protection representative murphy focuse d on the distinction between retail and wholesale salespersons and the business practices of industry ie the impact of section 7i for the competition between wholesalers and retailers who often compete head to head in the past he stated whol esalers frequently had outside sales representatives who visited commercial cust omers on the road now he continued conditions in various industries have chan ged to the disadvantage of wholesalers retail giants generate large volume of business through mu ltiple retail warehouse sales outlets dispersed over wide geographic areas and they are large enough to purchase directly from manufacturers and either operate their own distribution network or have factory shipme nt directly to their retail locations he explained that wholesale and retail inside sales personnel engage in

receive compensation in the form of commissions on sales yet their employers are excluded from making use of the inside commission sales exemption as result he stated the exemption tends to competitively favor massive corporate retailers over local or regional wholesale distributors for these reas ons he said i am introducin g legislation to apply the 7i inside commission sales exemption to employees of wholesale suppliers16 representative murphy did not focus upon labor standards prot ections rather his concern was the compe titive positions of wholesal and retail firms where distinctions between the two seemed gra dually to be blurring referred to the subcommittee on labor standards the murphy bill died at the close of the 103rd congress action had been taken the 104th congress in midmarch 1995 the 104th congress representative fawell reintroduced the murphy bill this legislation he ex plained is necessary to repair the inequity that presently exists between retail and wholesale establishments under current law he stated wholesalers inside salesperson must be paid timeandonehalf for hours worked in excess of 40 per week while the identical job at retail establishment does not involve that require ment he pointed to the considerable overtime costs required of employers and suggested that the wholesaleretail distinction in this area was longer useful17 when early in 1995 the house s ubcommittee on workforce protections commenced oversight on aspects of the flsa sharp cleavage developed with respect to the fawell bill industryem ployer witnesses fa vored the measure employee spokespersons opposed it michael leibig georgetown university law professor recalled that the purpose of the flsa overtime provisions was to discourage employers from working people over 40 hours week at all where em ployers make practice of scheduling workhours in excess of 40 per week he stat ed they reap the cost of doing that18 leibig urged caution arguing that

anymore maybe back in 1938 or in 1950 mrs mink well what was it in 1938 mr priest i couldnt tell you im not sure all i know is that today the function of an inside salesperson in our facility in our

they serve the customer and thats exactly what we do on ly we sell at wholesale prices mrs mink well if the two are the same the retailer and the wholesaler is it possible that the solution would be to repeal the exemption altogether so that both entities would have to pay overtime for work over 40 hours mr priest i would hope not in mrs minks suggestion for leveling the competitive playing field

issue during the 104th congress assistant secretary for em ployment standards bernard anderson in letter to representative owens affirmed that the basis for the wholesaleretail insideoutside overtime pay distinction rested on the employers ability to monitor outside work to amend the act as propos ed by the fawell bill anderson argued and deny overtime protection to longcovered employees would

argue that the blame was misplaced schedulin g of work traditionally has been an employer function flexibility manageme nt decision flexible scheduling options are allowable under the flsa and such arrangements could be utilized were employers disposed to use them that mo re employers have not established flexible work schedules may result from variety of managerial perceptions but there would seem little to suggest that the infrequent use of such options is rooted in the flsa it may be that allowed to work longer hours at extra expense to the employer workers would be able to produ ce more earnings for themselves and more profits for management but some would argue that such practices are inconsistent with the intent of congress when it crafte d the overtime pay provisions of the flsa that is to reduce the length of the workweek and to spread available work opportunities others might argue that with the passage of time the original policy intent of congress is now outmoded c

wages that greatly exceed the amounts that are otherwise available through hour ly pay rates plus overtime40 representative andrews concurred salespeople who can substantially increase their salary by earning more commissions ought to be allowed to work longer hours unfortunately he opi ned current law keeps them from earning as much as they could this common sense legislation he added would provide greater flexibility by allowing salespe ople to choose to work harder in order to earn higher commissions he added that businesses and salespeople will share in the increased profit and

legislation might be applied in specific employment situati ons and what impact it might have for individual workers provoked questions representative owens opposed the bill whic h he stated transfers income from workers to employers he charged that it is impossible to tell who is exempted from overtime by this legisla tion mr owens explained to be exempted an employee must ve specialized or technical knowledge related to the products or services being sold generally sales person is expected to know something about what they are selling how much specialized or technical knowledge is required to fall within the exemption from overtime how many sales people would typically possess this kind of knowledge few some most or all the bill exempts employees who are in sales pos ition the b ill goes on to retain overtime coverage for those whos duties predominantly involve initiating sales contacts while specifically exempting from overtime those who are predominantly employed to service existing sales contracts how is predominantly to be measured by the amount of time an employee spends in given activity or the percentage of income an employee produces in given activity or by some other means does predominantly mean more than 50 of ones activities or 75 or something else what is sales position in the first instance if i am primarily employed to service copier machines but sell enough of those machines that the commissions equal 40 of my annual income does this legislation exempt from overtime one should ask he stated how many employees w ill lose the protection afforded by overtime if this legisla tion is enacted and he inquired can anyone tell how many workers would be affected if this legislation is enacted42 hr 2888 representative owens argued wa s primarily aimed at inside sales personnel though the b ill applies to any employee in sales positi on43 unlikehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs14 43 continued and to inside and to outside sales workers these terms were not used in the bill as introduced rather any employee employed in sales position if 44 the formula for exemption under the propos ed section 13a18 would require wage earnings of 1½ times the minimum wage currently 515 per hour through year of 2080 hours 16068 plus commission ear nings of not less than 40 of the wage earnings 6427 or 22495 per year 45 statement of representative major r owens march 5 1998 46 alexis m herman secretary of labor to representative cass ballenger chairman subcommittee on workforce protections march 4 1998outside sales persons he observed an inside sales person is directly employed in making and processing sales for their entire time at work so he queried why shouldnt the employer be required to pa overtime when the employee is required to work more than forty hours in week since hr 2888 would alter both overtime pay and minimum wage protecti on he urged adoption of an earnings qualifier higher than proposed in the legislation 2249544 relatively low wage workers he suggested could be expected to work virtually unlimited hours in excess of 40 per week without pay to qualify for the exemption if an employee is paid 15 times the minimum wage this legislation seems to provide that the employee need not be paid anything for hours worked in excess of 40 hours week since all compensa tion for such time would be strictly dependent upon commissions in other words this bill does not simply repeal the requirement that employees be paid 15 times their regular rate of pay for overtime work it repeals the requirement that an employer provide any wage or salary for hours worked in excess of 40 hours week thus representative owens stated the ffect of this legislation is to permit employers to either require those workers to work longer hours or to pay them less per hour worked or both far from enhanc ing the earning opportunities of workers he concluded the primary effect of this legislation is to increase the income of employers at the expense of workers45 dol which had not testified on the issue expressed concern that the measure would establish minimum wage and overtime exemption for all sales people who meet certain criteria and deny flsa protection for significant numbers of often lowpaid workers who have long received such protection labor secretary alexis herman objected that the bill clearly shifts business risk from employers to employees she questioned its speci alized or technical knowledge provision which she viewed as so vague and subj ect to differences in understanding and application that there will u ndoubtedly be an incr ease in the already high levels of private litigation i nvolving sales employment ms herman in opposing the bill argued that this complicated multitest exemption will be difficult to interpret and apply leading to misundersta ndings disputes and litigation46httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs15 47 press release committee on education and the

wage and overtime pay requirements of the law he noted in side sales employees would have the opportunity to increase their wages the overtime pay requireme nt of the act he stated has the unintended

macdonald vice president for human resources at ibm was the lead industry witness first he emphasized that the flsa is an old law there have been dramatic changes in the workplace during the 60 years since the enactment of the flsa he stated when the act wa s passed in 1938 the work place was vastly different than it is today while agreeing with the original intent of the flsa he opined that certain provisions of the act need to be modernized to accommodate the workplace changes that have occurre d over the last si x decades since its enactment he noted that there are limited exceptions under the flsa but averred that they were written many years ago without t odays professional salesperson in mind second in that same spirit he emphasized the technical change that had come to the world of sales ibms inside sales force he noted uses the internet and the telephone to sell products to our customers it is now the age of ebusiness the ibmcom business and the emer ging networked economy third he stressed the need for flexibility the 21st century he affirmed demands flexibility flexible enough for employees to have balance in their lives and encourage them to take responsibility for th eir career direction the constraints of the flsa are counter productive to th requirements of knowledge workers in the new economy he stated the talented ibm workforce cannot thrive and may not survive under the old economy model of ri gid supervisory structures inflexible concepts of time and place and lack of challenging career opportunities for all of these reasons macdonald urged that em ployers of inside sales workers longer be bound by the minimum wage and overtime pay re quirements of the fair labor standards act as noted elsewhere the act does not preclude work beyond 40 hours in single workweek so long as overtime rate s timeandahalf are paid for those hours worked in excess of 40 it is logical to ask macdonald agreed why ibm does not simply accept the increased cost of overtime payment and enable the employees to work longer hours to drive higher perfo rmance his response the fundamental business model of ibmcom does not support increased costs that are derived simply from more hours worked rather than increased sales flexible scheduling even flexiplace em ployment is allowed under the flsa new technology has widened the options for such alternative work patterns67 in thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs19 67 continued hill book company 1981 one of the standard benefits reportedly associated with flexible scheduling is the reduction

fax machine mailings and outside ibm personnel or business partners her current annual sales quota is 6000000 while her outside teammate has the op tion to work from home when she needs to rearrange her work schedule to accommodate her family life andor travel ms enenmoh affirmed as nonexempt professional i do not have that option while ms enenmoh viewed the flsa as the restraining factor it was not clear why her position would not be suited to flexible hours and flexiplace employment 69 delaware valley wholesale florist inc is described as one of the largest wholesale floral supply companies

issue he pointed out that ibms flexibility options have seen steady progression of enhancements such as telecommuting to meet employee needs then he adde d telecommuting is not an option for our

same issues addressed by macdonald that the flsa is antiquated that the workplace s changed through the use of phone fax computer and email and that his employees are highly motivated and highly skilled professionals in need of enhanced flexibility in order to maximize their earnings schenauer affirmed that his employees would much prefer to be allowed to work flexible hours but argued that the flsa prevents such scheduling flexibility the remedy he affirmed would be to eliminate minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for his inside sales workers both industry witnesses concurred in objections to the flsa nunciated by the labor policy association70 the final witness was christine owens deputy director aflcio public policy department ms owens had somewhat di fferent perspective concerning hr 2070 which organized labor opposes she ex plained that the proposed legislation would eliminate minimum wage and overtime pay protection for certain sales workers without providing any new protecti ons or safeguards once workers met the qualifying wage and duties tests set forth in the bill there would be guarantee of added pay regardless of the number of overtime hours they work and employers would be free to require as much overtime as they desire without incurring anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs20 71 where workers are covered by collective bargaining agreement the

onesided and complete win for employ ers while conferring new rights on employees it would allow employers sh argued to lengthen workers hours cut workers pay and avoid any ri sks associated with sales employers ms owens suggested woul d lose nothing by passage of hr 2070 she stated that for qualifying work ers somewhere between an estimated 15 and 25 million an employer could assi gn fixed schedule 40 hour workweek then with minimum wage or overtime pay requirements the employer could simply mandate additi onal hours of work without any additional pay at all in short she affirmed they would be workin g for free and she added workers have protected right to refuse to work whenever their employers want them to or for any number of hours their employers require71 potentially she suggested employers could manipulate sales workers job duties andor pay levels in order to take advantage of the new exemption72 markup and report on june 27 2001 over democratic objections the

articulated by the industryoriented labor policy associ ation has won support from range of employer groups although new exempti on from the flsa with respect to inside sales employees is but sm all part of projected modernization package it could affect significant body of workers the proposal in one form or another has been before the congress at least since the 103rd congress and has reemerged in the 107th congress as hr 2070 proposed by repr esentative tiberi with representative andrews in june 2001 the house s ubcommittee on workforce protections voted to report the measure to the full committee on education and the workforce the hearings and debates thus far ve presented series of unresolved questions some of whic h are touched upon below flexibility the need for flexibility has been one of the main arguments in favor of hr 2070 ie that inside sales workers like great many other workers would like to have more options with respect to their hours of work the argument is made that sales work does not necessar ily conform to an 8hour da or to 40hour workweek some have suggested that workers need to be free to adjust their work hours to those of their clients perhaps opting for split shift compressed work schedules or flexiplace employment proponents of h r 2070 argue that current overtime pay requirements of the flsa preclude such flexibility the flsa with several less stringent exceptions built into the act requires that timeandahalf be paid for hours worked in excess of 40 in any single workweek77httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs22 77 continued declared unconstitutional in 1935 the provisi on was not incorporated within the flsa 78 among other factors an employer must bala nce the cost of short intermittent periods of overtime pay against the cost of hiring dditional employees recruitment processing training nonwage compensation etc where the regular rate of pay is relatively low it may be more costefficient simply to pay the overtime penalty where overtime is regular practice and may involve significant periods of work time then the cost may induce an employer to hire additional help 79 were an hourlypaid employee permitted to work at home off the clock and then expected to work at the office on the clock that could pose problems but concern with such practices was why congress structured the requi rements of the flsa in the way that it did 80 throughout consideration of the inside sales exemption proponents have stressed the technological changes that have taken place in the worldofwork faxes email computers etc that technology revolution has taken place seems clear the debate however is whether this justifies creating minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for inside sales workers under minority views in hrept 105558 p 1617 for example it is observed technology has enabled employers to ensure that sales persons entire time at work is continuedwhere lowwage workers are concerned the cost of requiring them to work hours in excess of 40 per week may not be an effective deterrent to the practice78 where workers are more highly paid it can be significant factor that was the stated intent of congress when it adopted the flsa ie to reduce in systemic way both for humane and for economic considerations the hours that employees customarily worked traditionally it is the employer who sche dules the hours that his employees will work the pattern can be traditional 9 to 5 arrangement or the employer can establish system of alternative work structures flexitime compressed work hours split shifts etc where there is need for example for worker to remain at the office on assignment through several extr hours on one day shorter work period can be scheduled for later in the week or earlier in the week if the need is anticipated should an inside sales work er need to take telephone call sometime late in the evening at home that can be arranged with employer approval and without violating the flsa so long as wo rk hours are compensated for in the normal way79 within the context of 40 hours any configuration of wo rktime is permitted 5 days of 8 hours 4 days of 10 hours 2 da ys of 20 hours etc the choice rests with the employer however if the total of hours worked within single work week exceeds 40 then those hours worked in excess of 40 must be paid for on timeand ahalf basis if an employer opts for flexib work scheduling there is nothing in the fair labor standards act to prevent such policy an antique statute the flsa was enacted in 1938 in res ponse to decades of labormanagement conflict over conditions of wor k through that period prior to 1938 and since there has been socioeconomic evolution ne w technologies have come into use80 therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs23 80 continued spent directly in productive activity and thereb has enhanced an employers ability to earn profit that same technology cannot and s hould not serve as basis for diminishing workers income or requiring workers to wo rk even longer hours the fact that more sales persons are now able to work inside and fewer must work outside is not justification of eliminating overtime there are some variations in language between hr 2888 and hr 2070 of the 105th and 107th congresses respectively the most recent committee report on this issue was hrept 105558 since most of the concerns pro and are

deals specifically with exemptionshave been fluctuations in workforce demogr aphics of gender of ethnicity of age of educational level soci ety has changed and continues to evolve during the period the percentage of the workfor ce that was unionized rose nd then receded but through it all the basic motivating elements of the labormanagement relationship appear to have changed really very little over the years the flsa has been anything but static some might even suggest it has been remarkably fluid th ere have been eight rounds of general amendment of the statute expansions or contractions of coverage modification of existing provisions and increases in the minimum wage rate there have also been numerous precise singleissue amendments to the act further the secretary of labor has developed an extensive body of administrative rules and opinion letters through which to make the statute confor m to the realities of the contemporary workplace and during almost every session of congress since 1938 there have been hearings on some aspect of the act often multiple hearings thus generic charges that the act is antique or on par with the dead sea scrolls are highly contentious arguments that the act is in need of updating persist some provisions it might be urged are longer used and could safely be eliminated one might reconsider examination of the entire section 13 for exam ple item by item to ascertain if each of the exemptions from the provisions of the act is still justifiable internal thresholds for the small business exemption for the tip credit for exemption of executive administrative and professional workers etc some may argue could be focus of oversight such issues were extensively explored by the minimum wage study commission 19781981 its report laying the foundation for future congressional oversight of the act81 as with most any statute systematic review may be appropriate both fo r equity and for efficiency of administration the putative

that acceptance of comp time instead of overtime pay would be voluntary question that has not been wholly resolved continuedthe flsa82 on this issue the initiative appears to have been taken by industry although individual employees have appeared at hearings speaking as individuals organized workers have consistently app eared in opposition under hr 2070 it is the employer who would be exempt from having to pay minimum wages and overtime pay where his employees meet certain qualif ying standards however advocates of changing the law often speak in terms of providing flexibilityso that workers can balance both their workfamily needs and their ability to increase their earnings opponents of changing the law on the ot her hand often argue that these changes would deprive workers of essential protections and real flexibility for family and personal development the case for enactment of hr 2070 is ofte n made in terms of the benefits that it will provide to the inside sales workers though it is also presented as win win situation more profit for management and increased opportunity for the workers to earn more and to advance profe ssionally if one assumes that the workers will be able to make signif icant sales during those hours worked in excess of 40 per week that is sales that they could not ve made within 40 hour work period then there may be benefits for those workers conversely had mana gement instituted program of flexible andor compressed scheduling as the law now permits might those sales have been made within standard flexible 40 hour work week although proponents of hr 2070 stress the need for enhanced flexibility for workers scheduling remains ma nagement prerogative were hr 2070 to be enacted the exemption that it provides need not be utilized unless management deems it appropriate the opti on rests with the employer83 were the wage and hour constraints of the flsa removed the em ployer would have the right to direct employees to work extra hours without pay and without ov ertime compensation even where that might be inconvenient for th worker or in conflict with the workers nonworkrelated responsibilities eg child or eldercare university classes etc the issue of worker choice was ra ised during subcommittee markup june 2001 and an amendment was offered to h r 2070 that would have guaranteed that extended hours of work would be permitted only with the voluntary consent of the worker the amendment was voted down 6 yeas to 7 nays with the proponents of hr 2070 standing in opposition84httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs25 84 continued under minority views hrept 105558 p 18 it is affirmed hr 2888 of the 105th congress creates very powerful economic incentive for an employer to require an employee to work as many hours as possible and thus diminishes rather than enhances workers flexibility if the intent of this legisl ation is to benefit workers then the choice to work overtime must belong to the worker 85 statement of representative owens ma rch 5 1998 see also hrept 105558 p 15 86 italics have been added here for clarity of reference 87 hrept 105558 p 7 dealing with hr 2888 of the 105th congress similar proposal explains the exemption is not intended for employees who merely take orders over the telephone or utilize prepared script such as telemarketing sales employees this type of an employee would not meet the requirement for possessing specialized or technical knowledge about the products or services being sold still under minority views p 20 it is charged hr 2888 provides basis for assessing or determining what constitutes specia lized or technical knowledge nor are the terms sufficiently clear as to lend themselves to common understanding 88 the need for further clarification of this language is discussed in the minority views in hrept 105558 p 20a need for clarification as the inside sales legislation was being markedup during the 105th congress representative owens queried can anyone tell how many workers would be affected if this legislation is enacted85 some may argue that the question remains to be answered with respect to hr 2070 of the 107th congress the targeted body of workers would be any employee employed in sales position if certain specified qualifying duty nd wagerelated cond itions were met86 keeping in mind that the department of labor would likely need to develop regulations through which to implement hr 2070 were it to become law it may be useful to review some of those qualif ying conditions for example amplifying if would be the employee has specialized or technica l knowledge related to products or services being sold87 b the employees sales are predominantly made to persons i to whom any employee occupying the sales position has made previous sales or ii without the employee havi ng initiated the sales contact c the employee has detailed understanding of the needs of those to whom the employee is selling d the employee exercises discretion in offering variety of products and services 88 italics added each of the phrases italicized here would lik ely need to be defined by the department of labor for administrative purposes while the qualifying factors may be entirely appropriate what do they mean how mig ht they be interpreted by small businessperson for example in boise simply trying to understand and to complyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs26 89 under minority views in hrept 105558 p 20 the opponents of hr 2888 of the 105th congress state the more prosaic issues ra ised by the legislation are litigators dream 90 here again we are dealing with hours that are worked in excess of 40 per week and therefore for which the employee would only be compensated through commissions on sales 91 under minority views in hrept 105558 p 20 it is argued even after the initial continuedwith the law or for that matter what might the provisions mean to worker attempting to determine his or her rights under the stat ute and as important how would the department define their meaning some have argued that these provisions lend themselves almost of necessity to litigation89 beyond interpretation of hr 2070s provisions per substantive questions may arise as consideration proceeds for example since it is stated that the legislation targets group of highly profe ssional salespeople engaged in sophisticated work why should they not be able to ta ke the initiative in ma king sales contacts are they expected to await potential clients call while waiting what other work might they be expected or allowed to perform while in an unpaid status90 what are the implications of limiting such high quality sales professionals to making sales predominantly to repeat customers the pay standard for exemption may present similar questions again hr 2070 defines an exempt worker as any employee employed in sales position if the employee receives i base compensation deter mined without regard to the number of hours worked by the employee of not less than an amount equal to one and onehalf times the minimum wage in effect under section 6a1 the federal minimum wage multiplied by 2080 and ii additional compensation that is based upon each sale attributable to the employee f the employees additiona l compensation based upon sales attributed to the employee is not less than 40 percent of the amount described in subparagraph ei g the employee receives ra of compensation based upon each sale attributable to the employee wh ich is beyond sales required to reach the compensation required by subparagr aph f which rate is not less than the rate on which the compensati on required by subparagraph f is determined and h the rate of base compensati on described in subparagraph ei for any employee who did not work for an employer for an entire calendar year is prorated to reflect annua l compensation which would have been earned if the employee had been compensated at the same rate for the entire calendar year could an average employer attempting to utilize the exemption provided by hr 2070 feel confident that he was within the law91 would the average workerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30003crs27 91 continued round of litigation the obligation of maintain ing records sufficient to demonstrate that employer was justified in withholding overtim pay would seem substantial and the issue of just what records would be sufficient to meet that burden is likely to remain murky 92 the targeted group of workers would seem to be nonunion employees where union was involved these matters would presumably be addressed in collectively bargained agreement but in the absence of collective bargaining and trade union representation such interpretation would be left to the em ployer and the individual workers with the department of labor somewhere in the backgroundunderstand sufficiently whether or not his or her rights were being respected under these provisions92 what new complexities might hr 2070 add to the burden of the department of labor in its responsibility for enforcing compliance with the fair labor standards act some may believe that these issues could be effectively resolved through the process of promul gating regulations by the department of labor others believe they would invite litigation
