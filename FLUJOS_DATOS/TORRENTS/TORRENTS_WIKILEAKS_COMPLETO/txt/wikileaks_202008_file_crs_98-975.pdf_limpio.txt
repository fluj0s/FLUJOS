division summary johnsons seagrass small marine plant growing in shallow estuaries and coastal lagoons only along the southeastern florida coast has be listed by the national marine fisheries service nmfs as threatened species under the endangered species ac t the first marine plant so listed the continued existence of this species appears to be mos t affected by water clarity and sediment disturbance eg stormwater runoff boating and personal watercraft activities and siltation as well as by hurricanes an d storm surges in addition limited seed production by this species makes its recover uncertain state and local government officials marine industries and the us arm corps of engineers as well as private citizens are concerned that protection under th could preclude or increase expenses for routine dredging projects and th expansion of three florida ports nmfs will seek to protect this species through measures and address local concerns that species protection may interfere wit h maintenance dredging projects this report will be updated as this issue evolves background johnsons seagrass halophila johnsonii is very small twoinch high flowering marine plant with the most limited geographic distribution of about 60 species f seagrasses worldwide it grows on variety of sediment types ranging from mud t coarse sand discontinuously and patchily in estuar ies and coastal lagoons along about 1501 miles of the southeastern florida coast from sebastian inlet to virginia key in nort h biscayne bay although it most frequently grows from the interti dal zone to about six feet below mean tidal height johnsons seagrass has been reported growing at depths greater than other seagrass species at 12 feet or dee per in very clear water on tidal deltas adjacent to inlets and in hobe sound as an opportuni stic species johnsons seagrass expands the total area covered by seagrasses through its ab ility to survive in environments where otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98975crs2 nj

seagrass species large patches of this species are reported to occur inside lak worth lagoon south of west palm beach in indian river lagoo n the largest patches are usually on tidal deltas adjacent to inlets johnsons seagrass appears to have relatively h igh tolerance for low light levels and fluctuat ing salinity and temperature features that may allow this species to coloniz environments where other species of seagrass cannot survive howev er severe storms can damage seagrasses tho ugh erosion and siltation during hurricanes sediments moved by storm surges and other turbulent flow eg waves and currents can easily dislodge erode or bury existing s eagrass communities particularly shallowrooted species such as johnsons seagrass milder storms can resuspend sediments and limit light penetration in general seagrasses stabilize sediments as well as provide shelter habitat an d dissolved oxygen for many marine animals seagrasses provide microhabitats for small marine animals and are source of easily decomposed and digested organic matter food for various invertebrates fish and larger animals including endangered west india n manatee s and threatened green sea turtles various species of commercially an d recreationally valuable fish and shell fish live within seagrass beds juvenile fish of various commer cially and recreationally important species hide in seagrass beds to escap predators it is reasonable to infer that similar ecological role can be attributed t johnsons seagrass although study of this species has been limited in addition marine biodiversity is greater where johnsons seagrass occurs only female flowers have been observed for johnsons seagrass and this species mechanisms of seed dispersal and establishment of new beds have not been studied although some suggest that johnsons seagrass only reproduces asexually fruit has been described by several i nvestigators in addition this species has small shallow rhizome2 ie root structure relative to total plant biomass high biomass turnover rate and rapid lateral spreading rate of as much as 125 centimeters per day the small rhizom structure suggests that johnsons agrass is unable to store large energy reserves while some suggest tha t these two characteristics uncertain reproductive capacity and small energy reserves make johnsons seagrass vulnerable to stress disturbance and less likely to repopulate any area from which it disappears others assert that species with highe r biomass turnover and lateral spreading rates are in general better at colonizing available habitat johnsons seagrass has been reported in some humaninfluenced areas of th intracoastal waterway suggesting that this species ability to repopulate is significant however regrowth and reestablishment of surviving populations of johnsons seagras s could be more difficult than for s pecies with life history that features wide dispersal of seeds the ecology of johnsons seagrass has not been extensively studied

recovery of damaged seagrass ecosystems is affected by variety of factors such as the cause and extent of damage the seagrass species affected an d physical characteristics of the damage site reduction of water clarity caused by human activity and increased coastal land use can threaten seagrass by reducing photosynthesis erosion caused by boat wakes may also increase turbidity and siltation siltation not only reduces incide nt light but can also create anoxic conditions in the sediment by limiting oxygen diffus ion such anoxic conditions are problematic to seagrasses as they may cause problems with root metabolism or result in the production of compounds such as sulfides that can be toxic to the seagrass with as much as 70 of runoff pollution contributed by nonpoint sources water qualit problems especially poor stormwater control practices can increase water turbidity s well as nutr ient loading being deeper water species johnsons seagrass is mor susceptible to subtle changes in water quality excessive nutrients eg nitrogen an d phosphorus from urban and gricultural land runoff can stimulate increased algal growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98975crs4 associated

most studies on the effects of propeller scarringthat severely reduces water clarity and in creases epiphyte loading shading seagrasses in addition seagrass habitat may be affected by the timing and duration of stormwater runoff although johnsons seagrass is reported to tolerate wide range of salinities additional research is required to better understand this species ecological response to freshwater inflows propeller scars and anchor mooring can break and excavate seagrass root systems severing rhizomes completely removing them from the sediment and reducing th physical stability of the community severing seagrass rhiz omes removes what little stored materials and energy these plant accumulate makin g them highly susceptible to any stress eg light limitation due to turbidity in addition propellers an d anchors often alter bottom topograp hy eg propellers make trenches in the sediment which influences seagras s recovery time for example boats are reported to have damaged or destroyed abou t 18000 acres 20 of the agrass beds in biscayne national park personal watercraft9 eg jet skis are also recognized as potential hazard to seagrass beds in very shallow water some seagrass beds can require as long as 5 years to recover from minor damage and decade or more to recover where the wash from boa t motor or personal watercraft operated in shallow water digs crater in seagrass b ed however since seagrass species vary in their ability to recover from scarring one must be cautious in inferring that such characteristics are also relevant to johnsons seagrass which is capable of spreadin g quickly10 dredging of navigation channels can resuspend and redistribute sediments severely decreas ing available light burying plants and altering bottom topography however dredging in florida is highly regulated to prevent such damage and johnsons seagras s continues to occur on tidal deltas adjacent to several inlets that have been regularl dredged for many decades major ports harbors and navigation channels are maintained at depths greater than 6 feet and johnsons seagrass has not been reported within suc h dredged basins or navigation channels only in adjacent shallow areas thus it would be new dredging in shallow areas rather than mainte nance dredging of previously dredged basins and navigation channels that would be more likely to affect johnsons seagras s habitat although some have suggested that dredging may have enhanced this species scientific evidence does not support this argument protection efforts the state of florida has taken steps to protect seagrass habitat new an d redeveloped sources of stormwater discharge are required to meet state wate r management district regulations several counties are reportedly installing pointsource stormwater mana gement systems that may improve water quality from point sources in addition improvements in wastewater t reatment within the past two decades are reported to have increased water
