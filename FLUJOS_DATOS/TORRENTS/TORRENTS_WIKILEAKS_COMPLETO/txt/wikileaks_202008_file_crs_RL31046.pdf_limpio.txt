included in the foreign authorization legislation by law authorization of foreign policy agencies and programs is required prior to expenditure of foreign op erations and state department appropriations in effect the authorizing legislation sets spending ceilings for the foreign policy agency appropriations see table 1 below prio r to 1995 congress had reauthorized us government

those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy appliedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31046crs11 critics of the certifica tion requirement oppose it on several grounds some argue that it will reduce qua lity health care fo r women in developing nations by denying us funding to some of the most experienced and effective organizations these critics further believe that family planning organizations that do remain eligible for us aid will cut back on serv ices because of uncertainty over the full implications of the restrictions and their desire not to risk losing access to usaid funding thus opponents contend that the mexico city policy may actually lead to more abortions overseas critic s also believe the new cond itions will undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos nd multilateral groups creating situation where the united states challenges their right to decide how to spend their own money and imposes socalled gag order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regula tions in developing nations the latter these critics note would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states from an administra tive standpoint they say it increases usaid costs to manage family pla nning programs because of the additional paperwork and is likely to delay implementation of projects supporters of the certification requireme nt argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible that organizations receiving am ericantaxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend stop s the fungibility loophole they further note that the mexico city policy does not stop organizations from continuing their family planning operations overseas it merely requires them to adhere to the conditions or to carry out their prog rams without us government support in the first several votes on the issue in 2001 the house international relations committee adopted 2622 an amendment to hr 1646 by representative lee that would overturn the mexico city policy th lee amendment which incorporated the text of hr 755 would not subject foreig n groups to

international negotiations with the objective of completing the rules and guidelines for the kyoto protocol in manner that is consistent with the interests of the united states and that ensures the nvironmental integrity of the protocol the wording of the bills in these sections was not identical and there were some items in each that are absent in the other but they shared most of the same concepts such as the contribution of human activities to global climate change and the need for american business to know how governme nts worldwide will respond to the threat of global warming the kyoto protocol completed in 1997 and signed but not ratified by the united states includes legally binding re quirements for 38 industrialized nations to reduce their emissions of 6 greenhouse gase s including the predominant one carbon dioxide which is released by burning of fossil fuels and wood under this protocol the us reduction would be 7 below 1990 vels of emissions as an average over the period 20082012 since this bill passed th house president bush has indicated that although it is his intention to remain engaged in the framework convention on climate change unf ccc and related international negotiations the united states rejects the kyoto protocol and will not participate in it the us senate is on record in sres 98 pass ed in 1997 rejecting treaty that does not include developing countries or that would harm the us economythe two major objections to the kyoto protocol that president bush has identified therefore the provisions that state the united states should

first introduced by sena tor biden in s 1803 in late 2001 similar measure with the same objectives hr 3836 was introduced in the house by rep ellen tauscher on march 4 2002 and referred to the hous international relations committee see crs report rl30617 russias paris club debt and us interests by john p hardt iran nuclear proliferation prevention act of 200223 the iran nuclear proliferation prevention act of 2002 is virtually identical to bill introduced in the 106th congress hr1477 which passed the house by vote of 3831 but did not receive senate floor action similar bill hr 3743 passed the house in the 105th congress by vote of 40513 and did not r eceive any senate action the legislation seeks to prohibit the use of us voluntar contributions to the iaeas technical cooperation fund for use in iran the vehicl for this is an amendment to section 307 of the foreign assistance act althoug h iran and several other state sponsors of terrorism cannot receive us funds through internationa l organizations under section 307 c the iaea and unicef are exempt from those restrictions the amendment would allow the restriction to apply if the secretary of state determines that iaea programs in iran are inconsis tent with us nucl ear nonproliferation or safety goals or provide iran w ith proliferationrelevant trai ning or are used as cover for proliferation activities the bill requires the secretary of state to assess iaea projects for their consistency with us nuc lear nonproliferation nd safety goals and conduct an annual review of all iaea programs secti on 1344 requires the secretary of state to submit detailed report to congress each year for 5 years on irans bushehr reactor project and iaea technical assistance to iran in separate provision section 1306 the security assistance act amends the iran nonproliferation act of 2000 by specifying in greater detail the content of the reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31046crs24 to the congress that are required under that act it also makes clear person is not exempt from sanctions if heshe only tr ansfers conventional weapons rather than weapons of mass destruction between 1995 and 1999 the iaeas tech nical cooperation fund provided over 15 million in technical assistance to iran s civilian nuclear power program including reactor being built by russia near the iranian port city of bushehr most of that assistance is nuclear safety training iaea assistance programs on the bushehr reactor date as far back as 1985 us voluntary contributi ons approximately 18 million in 2002 provide almost 27 of the technical cooperation fund us assessed contributions to the iaea which w ould not be affected by the legislation provide about 25 of the to tal annual iaea budget there is precedent of the us withholding its share of funding for proj ects in cuba for the past several years members and outside expert s who support the legislati on maintain that cut in us voluntary contributions would not pr event the iaea from continuing work in iran but that us funds should not be voted to nuclear pr oject the united states fundamentally opposes an alte rnate view is that reducin g us contributions would limit us influence over iaea assistance to the bushehr project an iranian civilian nuclear power project at the city of bushehr iran according to critics this could hinder the us ability to monitor the bushehr project to ensure it is not serving any nuclear weapons program others believe that the united states should support iaea assistance to the bushehr project becau the iaea will contribute to its safe operation and because iran according to th iaea is abiding by its commitments as party to the nuclear nonprolifer ation treaty and therefore qualifies for assistance supporters of the legislation note that it provides for waiver of the contribution reduction if the conditions s ought by both advocates and opponents are met for further reading see crs report rl30551 iran arms
