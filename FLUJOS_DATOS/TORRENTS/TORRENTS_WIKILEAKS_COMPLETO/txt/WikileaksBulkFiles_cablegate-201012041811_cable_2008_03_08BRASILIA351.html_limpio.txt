washington brasilia 00000351 0012 of 003 classified by ambassador clifford sobel 1 c minister of defense nelson jobim will travel to norfolk and washington from march 1822 2008 on counterpart visit he will meet with secretary gates in an office call on march 20 june minister jobims objectives for the visit are to enhance prospects for bilateral cooperation and explore possibilities for access to us defense technology 2 c summary minister jobim is the first strong minister of defense in brazil he is working to centralize civilian oversight of the brazilian military and hopes to learn from the us military in this regard he has also clearly indicated desire to pursue military cooperation agreements despite objections from the ministry for external affairs such as in the case of concluding sofa with france he has also expressed his desire to pursue defense cooperation agreement with the us and to have it approved directly by the president jobim has also been helpful in making progress on general security of information agreement which requires approval by brazils ministry of interior and office for institutional security although the us and brazil share the basic goals of fostering hemispheric stability preventing terrorist activity and strengthening international nonproliferation regimes usbrazil cooperation is hindered by difficulties in completing bilateral defense cooperation agreement providing protections for us personnel involved in training and joint exercises and taking proactive steps to address countries of proliferation concern such as iran brazil has maintained its leadership role in the haiti peacekeeping force minustah under the active advocacy of the foreign ministry jobims visit comes at an important time as brazil is formulating new national defense strategy and beginning to make decisions about acquisition of new military systems and technology other military issues of interest include service relations with the fledgling civilian defense ministry and the necessity of negotiating further agreements with the us in order to enhance our already strong militarytomilitary relationship end summary politicoeconomic overview 3 sbu president luiz inacio lula da silva was elected in 2002 in large part on promises of promoting an ambitious social agenda including generous handouts to the poor on the strength of the popularity of these measures he was reelected in 2006 although with diminished support from the middle class the publics top concerns crime and public security have not improved under this administration the lula administration has been beset by grave political crisis as interlocking influence peddlingvotebuying scandals plagued elements of lulas pt party but the presidents personal popularity has not suffered even after many of his closest associates have been caught in corrupt practices mod jobim is perhaps among the most trusted leaders in brazil former supreme court justice he maintains strong reputation for integrity that is rare among brazils leadership friendly cooperation but not strong friendship 4 c brazils democratic institutions are strong and stable after more than 20 years of civilian rule return to military dictatorship is today unthinkable as brazils armed forces pursue professional nonpolitical identity with steady exportled economic growth having become the norm in the recent past brazil has been supporter of reasoned foreign policy goals and has been steadfast in its support of democracy in the hemisphere it has strong interest in hemispheric security issues that largely mirrors our own and actively cooperates with us on the operational level in the fight against terrorism brasilia 00000351 0022 of 003 5 c while relations between the us and brazil are generally friendly often the usg encounters major difficulties in gaining the cooperation of senior policymakers on issues of significant interest to the united states the difficulty is most apparent in the ministry for external affairs mre which maintains an antiamerican slant and has tried to block improved dodmod relations in planning for jobims visit the mre actively campaigned to limit jobims time in washington to one largely ceremonial day with little substance 6 c the current leftofcenter administration has studiously avoided close cooperation on polmil issues important to us and has kept us at arms length on most securityrelated issues specifically the mre has dragged its feet on completing defense cooperation agreement general security of military information agreement gsomia acquisition and cross servicing agreement acsa or article 98 agreement the gob traditionally maintained that such agreements particularly the sofa were against brazilian law but reversed itself over mre objections and signed sofa with france earlier this year we are exploring the possibility of using the french sofa as starting place for usbrazil agreement 7 c brazil has stayed the course as leader of minustah in haiti despite lack of domestic support for the pko the mre has remained committed to the initiative because it believes that the operation serves fm amorims obsessive international goal of qualifying brazil for seat on the security council the brazilian military remains committed as well because the mission enhances its international prestige and provides training and operational opportunities so far president lula has backed the foreign ministrys position and brazil will likely continue to provide leadership and troops to minustah for the conceivable future despite the success of the minustah deployment brazil has not shown any interest in undertaking further peacekeeping operations although brazilian contributions to operations in such places as darfur have been requested ct and nonproliferation 8 c the desire not to be identified with the us is borne out as well in the gobs approach to counterterrorism cooperation remains excellent at the operational level especially between law enforcement agencies however the gob political leadership has refused to endorse us counterterrorism initiatives publicly and has insisted that official communiques of the 3 1 mechanism note that there is evidence of terrorist operations in the triborder area where brazil paraguay and argentina meet wary of its large prosperous and influential arab population the gob makes every effort to downplay in public even the possibility of terrorist fundraising going on inside brazil 9 c the gob has good record in nonproliferation efforts but has been slow to join international consensus in favor of sanctions on iran brazil has also not yet signed the npt additional protocol although it has not ruled out signing it in the near future military issues 10 c brazil established ministry of defense mod for the first time in june 1999 uniting the three services army navy and air force under single minister jobim became minister last year when the disastrous crash of brazilian airliner highlighted weaknesses in the civil aviation system which comes under mod purview organizationally the mod still faces challenges managing the individual services each service is still fairly autonomous and controls its own budget and acquisition programs in addition the lula administrations focus on social reforms brasilia 00000351 0032 of 003 and programs has meant decreases for military budgets leading to fewer training opportunities and equipment purchases this situation is changing as there is now near consensus among brazils leadership that the military is underresourced and under equipped to accomplish its missions 11 c to address this situation the lula government has tasked new national defense strategy to be completed by this fall this paper will set the framework for military modernization and theoretically drive decisions on acquisition of new equipment in reality such decisions will be made largely for political and economic reasons brazils defense industrial base has atrophied since the end of the cold war and it is major objective of the government to reinvigorate it decisions on major systems will be influenced much more by access to foreign technology and opportunities for brazilian industry than by the capabilities such systems will add to brazils military general points to make 18 sbu our core message for jobims visit should be reinforcing and underscoring the importance of these agreements in support of brazils interest to reequip and modernize its military with technology transfer is critically important it would also help to define how we the anchor of the north america and brazil the anchor of south america may be able to work more closely in the future to enhance hemispheric defense cooperation we recommend secdef also emphasize the following points in conversations with minister jobim we want to continue improving our defense relationship this is an imperative given the difficult global security situation in which we live today and the importance of brazils role in the americas we are serious about our partnership in brazil we see strong possibilities for joint research and production exchanges of military personnel and training as you make important decisions about the modernization of brazils forces later this year keep in mind that partnership with the us can help both our countries realize our common goal of preserving stability in the western hemisphere as we continue to develop our partnership we need to have in place several standard documents to assure smooth cooperation the defense cooperation agreement is the first of these we understand your ministry has approved the current draft and hope the rest of your government will also next we hope to complete an agreement on information security and status of forces agreement to protect the forces of both countries during joint exercises the united states would like to congratulate brazil for its efforts in haiti the improving situation there is in small measure due to the professionalism and dedication of brazilian troops and leadership we hope brazil is resolved to continue to contribute to the success of minustah sobel
