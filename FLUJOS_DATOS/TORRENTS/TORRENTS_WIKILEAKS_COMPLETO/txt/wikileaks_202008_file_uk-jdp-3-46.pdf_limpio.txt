support to joint operations is written for the joint commander comd and his lega l adviser legad it aims to brief the comd on what he can expect from his legad and the legad on what his comd expects of him it concentrates on the joint headqua rters and joint operations nevertheless by process of analogy and inference the reader will be able to translate the principles if not the material into any operational envir onment whether maritime land or air thus component comds ccs and othe r subordinate comds and their legads should find the publication of practical be nefit the publication is not national manual of the law of armed conflict1 nor is it service legads handbook of operational law it is better to describe it as an introducto ry guide to the role of law and the role of the legad in operations this modest aim belies the importance of the legad in todays armed for ces in statement to the american bar association journal in 1991 general colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in the 1991 gulf war and later to be secretary of state during the 2003 gulf war said decisions were impacted by legal consider ations at every level lawyers proved invaluable in the decisionmaking process2 speaking to group of international lawyers lieutenant general robert fry3 said legal advice is essential at all levels and an awareness of the legal framework for operations is crucial part of the commanders professiona l understanding 2 structure jwp 346 comprises 2 chapters chapter 1 legal dimension to joint operations chapter 1 sets out the legal basis and framework for

manner lega l advice is essential not only in the strategic decision to commit uk armed forces but also in the interpretation of that decision and its application at the operational and tactical levels1 legal advisers legads have an important support role2 in joint operations the focus in this publication is on the operational leve l and more specifically on the joint task force headquarters jtfhq and national contingent headquarters nchq however it is also directly relevant to component commanders ccs and their lawyers to lawyers in the permanent jo int headquarters pjhq and to commanders comds and lawyers outside the joint envir onment it must be recognised that in legal matters as in other aspects of operati ons tactical activity can have strategic and operational effect and vice versa 3 102 operational law oplaw is wider than the law of armed conflict loac or international humanitarian law ihl it encompasses all legal aspects of operations from routine service discipline th rough local purchase contracts abroad to the use of force and everything in between this publication provides only the general legal framework the relative importance of wh ich will vary

legisla tion employment law general law27 and most importantly in the context of this pub lication operational and international humanitarian law in this last area dgls provides stra tegic legal advice to the government as well as operational lega l advice to pjhq dgls and his staff liaise as required with the legal staffs of other government departments eg the foreign and commonwealth offi ce fco and the department for international developmen t dfid service lawyers and the governments law officers c legal services of the armed forces all 3 services have uniformed lawyers who provide operational and tacti cal level commanders and their staffs with legal advice including legal aspe cts of operations the availability of appropriately trained service lawyers who are used in support of operations is the responsibility of each of th 3 heads of the legal services 1 the director naval gal services dnls 2 the director of army legal services dals 3 the director of lega l services

milita ry lawyers is earma rked for deployed operations and assigned to the collocated joint force headquarters jfhq however operations often require augmentation so the legal cell in pjhq will liaise with the single service heads of legal services to source augmentees augmentation of the deployed jfhq lega l cell may come from any of the 3 services and assumes the availability of number of lawyers trained for joint operations most formations of brigad and equivalent size and above which are deployed for specific operation w ill be provided automatically with lawyer of appropriate seni ority to

section iv the legal basis of joint operations 111 so far this chapter has set out the fact that uk armed forces deploy on expeditionary operations and that the strategic decision to deploy them along with its dissemination and implementation at the operational and tactical levels is accompanied by legal advice provided by civilia n and service lawyers this section focuses on the legal bases of operations ie the ove rarching legal mandate or justification for operations 112 use of force in international relations the legal grounds for the use of force are derived mainly from the char ter of 1945 security council resolutions and customary international law the star ting point is the general principle of non intervention whereby all members of the united nations are to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations28 this general principle is subject to number of exceptions these are detailed below national or state selfdefence states have right of individual or collective selfdefence if an armed attack occurs until the security council 28 charter article 24 16 jwp 346 sc has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security29 individual selfdefence not only means the protection of states own territorial integrity but may include the rescue of nationals where the host state in which they live is unable or unwilling to do so collective selfdefence can either be under collective security treaty such as nato or by one state asking anothers help to defend itself ag ainst an aggressor it should be recognised that states often differ in their interpretations of the legal definition of selfdefence and legads must establish from the outset the legal constraints governing the activities of other national forces assigned to multinational operations differing nationa l interpretations of the law will have an effect on what other national fo rces are permitted to do and will shape their rules of engagement roe30 b united nations security council authorisation under chapter vii of the charter31 the sc may make determinati on that there is threat to the peace breach of the peace or an act of aggression it may then make recommendations or decide what measur shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and secur ity the sc may employ measures not involving the use of armed force eg economic sanctions or if these would be inadequate authorise action using the ar med forces of memb er states sc authorisations can also be applied to regional organisations eg nato as well as individual member states c humanitarian intervention the uk recognises that the use of force is justifiable in exceptional circumstan ces to support purposes laid down by the united nations security council unsc even without the councils express authorisation when that is the onl means to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe the principle of humanitarian intervention is not universally accepted as being ground justifying the use of force but it may be developing into rule of customary international law 113 there is variant of selfdefence and variant of the chapter vii authorisation of which comds and legads should be aware since they often feature in academic writings and policy statements anticipatory selfdefence the principle of an ticipatory selfdefence derives from the caroline case 1837 32 both sides agreed that the party relying on the principle had to show the necessity of selfdefence instant 29 this customary international law right is reaffirmed in charter rticle 51 30 for example uk and us asse rtions of the right of anticipatory selfdefence see paragraph 113a are t universally accepted even within nato 31 charter articles 3942 32 29 brit for st papers 1137 in 1837 during an insurrection against british rule in canada us ship the caroline was being used to ferry supplies from new york to group of insurgents in canada the british destroyed the ship claiming that they had acted in self defence 17 jwp 346 overwhelming leaving choice of mean s and moment for deliberation from this statement emerge the 2 prin ciples which underpin the legality of using force in selfdefence necessity and imminence the meaning of imminence today has been reinterpreted by some in the light of the gravity of 21st century threats and the means by which attacks can be conducted however anticipatory selfdefence is not the same as preemption see below the latter being us principle which is not accepted by the uk today article 51 of the charter preserves the inherent right of selfdefence if an armed attack occurs this begs the question of whether state has to wait to be struck before it can defend itself the uk strategic defence review new chapter endorses the doctrine of anticipatory selfdefence it is much better to engage our enemies in their backyard than in ours at time and place of our choosing and not theirs and again experience shows that it is better wh ere possible to engage an enemy at longer range before they get the oppor tunity to mount an assault on the uk not only is this more effectiv than waiting to be attacked at point and timing of an enemys choos ing but it can have deterrent effect anticipatory selfdefence must be dis tinguished from preemption which is us principle that has r ecently gained currency in the context of terrorist threats weapons of mass effect wme and socalled rogue states the us national security strategy says we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations bydefending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders and again while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not he sitate to act one if necessary to exercise our right of self defence by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them doing harm against our people and our country the uk takes the view that the us principle of preemption which is based on the notion of taking preemptive action does not meet the requirement that 18 jwp 346 force used in self defence be di rected against threat which is imminent accordingly the uk does not recogni legal right of preemption33 b chapter viii regional organisation regional organisations that use force other than in collective selfdefen ce or with the consent of the host nation are required to obtain prior chapter vii authorisation from the unsc however there have been instances of regional organisations using force without awaiting unsc appr oval but gaining retrospective authorisation nato is regional organisation the uk would not expect nato to operate outside the terms of its treaty unless it had unsc mandate 114 peace support operations 34 this paragraph deals with peace support operations pso pso undertaken without mandate are considered under one of the other legal base s in international law such as collective selfdefence pso have express basis in the charter however they have been core activities of the for over 50 years having been developed by the security council as pragmatic solution to the deadlock wroug ht by the cold war period pso are considered to derive their legal mandate from the char ter the 2 main types of operation recognised by the uk are pe acekeeping and peace enforcement35 peacekeeping peacekeeping is thought to be rooted in chapter vi of the charter but there are grounds for saying that its doctrinal basis is in chapter vii somewhere between article s 41 and 42 of the charter these considerations have prompted th somewhat ironic commentary that peacekeeping is chapter vi ½ ope ration the basic principles of peacekeeping derived over many years are the consent of the host nation or of the parties involved in the earlier conf lict the impartiality of the peacekeeping force the use of force by peacekeepers being limited to selfdefence and the clear existence of peace or ceasefire to supervise the key point is that the legal mandate for the ope ration does not extend to the use of force under article 42 of the charter b peace enforcement peace enforcement by contrast does not require the consent of the host nation or the par ties involved in conflict and forces may use such force as is consistent w ith the mandate of the security council resolution peace enforcement opera tions will usually make an explicit reference to chapter vii and genera lly include the phrase all necessary measures conventionally this has been the form of words adopted to authorise article 42 measures which allo w the sc to take such action by air 33 speech of attorney general to house of lords on 21 april 2004 34 uk doctrine articulates the meaning of pso more comprehensively discussion

legal advisers legads rving in the uk armed forces are qualified solicitors or barristers whether r ecruited from civilian practice or trained as lawyers within the services it is likely that they have specialised in criminal law given the armed forces staple diet of service di scipline and courtsmartial some however may have further specialised in another area of law such as international law the strength of the operational legad on the joint jt staff is not only his specialist skill but his generalist skill to advise across the breadth of operational law it was noted in paragraph 102 that operational w is much wider than the law of armed conflict loac it embraces the whole range of legal issues that impinge on operations law of armed conflict training 202 notwithstanding the emphasis that has been placed on generalist skills the operational legad must have thorough groun ding in loac it is the responsibility of the single service heads of legal services to ensure that legads are properly trained in international law since most gads will not have any or any adequate academic training in loac prior to joini ng the armed forces certain international and uk academic institutions run courses that are well designed for the operational legad these courses should be supplemen ted by inhouse training provided by the heads of legal services the services also provide focused training on specialist areas such as targeting since the legad at the operational and tactical level may play an important role in the targeting team he must complete training in this field in essence the legad must be professi onally current to perform his duties knowledge and experience 203 the legads academic trai ning needs to be fused with his knowledge of the service environment beca use operational legads are rving officers in the armed forces they bring general service knowledge and experience to bear on their role with the battle staffs like all officers they have singleservice roots the joint environment however requires an understa nding of all 3 environments maritime land and air so the legad must understand the basic principles and practices of joint operations planning and execution1 and also have an appreciation of weapon and platform capabilities at the disposal of the command comd it is axiomatic that there is shortcut to experience like other jt staff officers the legad should be joint 1 jwp 500 joint operations planning and jwp 300 joint operations execution jdp 01 joint operations 21 jwp 346 trained be experienced at working in an operational level hq and preferably also have had multinational experience2 component commanders ccs legads too need to understand the basics of how each cc operates within the joint operations area joa professional qualities 204 the operational legad must be an experi enced staff officer but particular professional qualities stand out as important quality of advice the legad must give dvice that is certain and clear the comd who trusts his lega d and takes his advice seriously neither needs nor wants advice that is longwinded complicated to understand or equivocal so leaving him none the wiser about what the legad really thinks legal advice must be proactive as we ll as reactive if legitimate operational options are to be exploited legal c onstraints pinch soon enough the legad must provide robust advice against the pote ntially illegal options but also make clear the existence of any alternative approaches in the form of operational suggestions to the comd if he does this he will be seen as positive contributor and not negative influence someone who enables operations to proceed legitimately rather than someone who stifles tactical endeavour to do this the legad needs to be aw are of the comds campaign plan3 finally the legads relationship with his comd and other staff officers rests on his ability to speak out when necessary while understanding that he is there to advise not to make the decisions d ecisions are for the comd while the legad is subordinate providing pr ofessional service to the comd the comd will expect to hear what the legad really thinks and not what the legad thinks the comd wants to hear the legad should therefore have the moral courage to provide unpopular advice and be able to justify it b judgement the successful legad will have good legal judgement this quality transcends pure academic knowledge and can be described as the ability whether instinctive or gained through experience to identify the key legal issues that bear upon the circumstan ces prevailing at the time it is the sensitivity to policy issues th at bear upon legal advice and vice versa it is common sense that influences practical workable legal advice that the comd understands and can readily use it is also the quality that enables the legad to make up for lack of experience in the early days and to learn from the experience of others 2 jwp 300 paragraph 215a 3 jdp 01 paragraph 330 jwp 500 chapter 2 22 jwp 346 c respect for law the legads conduct and conversation should cultivate positive respect for the rule of law on operations legal advice to the comd is the obvious vehicle for ach ieving this end but the legad is likely to have to work closely with the policypolitical adviser polad and press spokesman to explain the comds commitment to following the legal mandate of the operation the joint ta sk force commander jtfc will wish to cultivate positive and open image of the joint task force jtf4 respect for law is part of this image section ii professional links 205 this section explains the legads mo st important professional links 206 position of legal adviser the operational legad is part of the command group comd gp whether on the staff of the jtfc cc or contingent comd this ensures the legads ready availability to the comd and his accessibility to the comds key staff officers the legads re sponsibilities are likely to cut across the staff divisions the formality of his placement in particular divi sion is less important than the reality of his influence as member of the comds immediate staff5 the comd should ensure that the legad is empower ed to act effectively on the jt staff the legad will need to have security clearances and access to information commensurate with his responsibilitie s as command legal adviser 207 command support the legads most important link is to the comd himself the comd needs gal advice to ensure that his operational decisions are in accordance with law it is for that r eason that the operationa l legad is deployed the uk has ratified additional protocol 1 which states the high contracting parties at ll times and the parties to the conflict in time of armed conflict sh all ensure that legal advisers are available when necessary to dvise military commanders at the appropriate level on th application of the conventions and this protocol and on the appropriate instruction to be given to the armed forces on this subject6 therefore the legads overriding duty is to provide the comd with accurate relevant and robust legal advice 208 reach back where operational circumstances permit reach back arrangements may be put in place reach back gives the deployed comd access to hq legal advice when legad is not deploye d with the comd or can be used to 4 jwp 300 paragraph 108 5 in the uk pjhq the legads are in j9 their output falls just as much in j3 and j5 6 1977 additional protocol 1 to the 1949 geneva conventions article 82 23 jwp 346 provide the deployed legad with additional legal support typically legad in nondeployed hq will be designated as th deployed comds point of contact for advice on emerging legal issues where re ach back arrangement s are envisaged and have been agreed by the comd care must be taken to sure that reliable secure communications remain available throughout the operation the legad providing the reach back legal advice must be suit ably qualified

ideally be resolved by the close cooperation of staff officers and before they reach the comd the legad must so ensure that he is present at every cpt and ot that he ma kes himself available to the j2 and j3 ops sp teams and that he always remains appr oachable the legad also needs to be aware of the legal implications associated with longer range planning and should liaise early with j4 and j5 to identify and resolve such issues see paragraphs 215217 210 uk legal chain of command links it is very important that legads within the chain of command are in close and regular contact throu ghout an operation the jtfhqnchq legad has pivotal role in joint operation feeding information up and down the legal hierarchy at the various levels of command and co ordinating the discussion management and re solution of legal issues within the joa7 legads work for their comd and not for othe r lawyers so there is legal chain of command as such however as staff officers they are expected to have desk level links with their counterparts in different ar eas of the joint force structure and there need to be channels of communication be tween legads in particular the legad at every level cc jfhq permanent joint headquarters pjhq and director general legal services dgls needs to be awar of the uk national position on given issue whether that is dictated by the w by government policy or by combination of both it is important that the legad ensu res that his advice to the comd takes due account of the uk position this applie s not only for ukled operations but also for operations where the uk is participati ng nation the linkages between pjhq the 7 the legad contributes to daily reports and returns eg assessment re ports and down reports see jwp 300 paragraph 349 24 jwp 346 25 nchq and the various uk contingents within the multinational components are just as important as the lines of communicati on from pjhq to the jtfhq and the ccs for ukled operation cc nd contingent comd legads should highlight important legal issues for the jtfhq nchq legad even if they are full command issues that are strictly outside the legal jurisdicti on of the jt force comd who exercises operational command opcom only this is to enable clear picture to be compiled in the joa and to improve comm unications back to pjhq and the mod 211 alliance and coalition legal advisers alliance and coalition operations are highly likely to have multin ational legal presence arrange d on case by case basis to take into account the command structure the contributing nations and the nature of the operation legads need to establish close links with each othe r from an early stage in the planning of operations in order to achieve common unde rstanding to resolve ambiguities and to highlight legitimate differ ences that need to be taken into account in the execution of operations embedde d uk legads in coalition hqs may work to nonuk rules and procedures where there is conflict with uk domestic law or policy 212 links to humanitarian advisers and nongovernmental organisations the legad versed in intern ational humanitarian law ihl is well placed to understand the humanitarian interest s and objectives of nongovernmental organisations ngos and to liaise with the comds humanitarian adviser humad if one is deployed on humanitarian issues although not an ngo the international committee of the red cross icrc is an important actor in the area of many operations ranging from peace support opera tions pso to armed conflict the uk values good working relationship with th icrc and the legad should be one of number of principal points of contact on the jt staff section iii role in operations planning implementing and interpreting the legal mandate 213 one of the fundamental building blocks of campaign planning8 is the clear identification of the endstate the iden tification of the military endstate and the focus of operational activity on that end state are not only essential to operational success but also to its lawfulness although the decision to resort to force will not usually involve operational legads but will be taken at the strategic level with advice from the law officers and other govern ment legal advisers there is clear correlation between the legal ba sis for an operation and the us of force at the tactical level for example scr authorising the use of force will require interpretation in order to ensure that the force used to accomplish the missi on does not exceed that authorised even when action is taken in the absence of specific authority 8 jwp 500 paragraph 219 jwp 346 military operations must still have clear legal basis in international law for example operations mounted on the basis of the inherent right of the state to defend itself from attack may justify such use of fo rce as is reasonably necessary to achieve the objective whether it be to repel the att ack recapture invaded territory or otherwise stop the infringement of the defending states right the operational legad in the planning process has key responsibility to guide planners on the principles of necessity and proportionality in the use of force and on the means and methods of warfare adopted to achieve th declared endstate this can only be done with an understanding of the legal basis for the operation multilateral coherence 214 the uk will rarely operate one mostly it will operate as part of the nato alliance or in coalition it is importa nt for uk legads to liaise closely and early with counterparts in order to harmonise their understanding of multinational legal issues and where differences exist to und erstand them and make them clear to the comd to resolve differences where possibl and mitigate their effect on operations9 it should be borne in mind that it is entirely possible for 2 states to undertake multinational operations in support of shared missions which seek the same endstate but which rely upon completely different legal bases for the use of force this affects not only roe force allocation to missions nd the like but can dictate the tempo of operations raise political concerns and cr eate considerable friction in the multinational arena the proactive legad should keep himself sufficiently well informed to anticipate potential legal diffic ulties and keep his comd aware of any and all emerging issues early involvement of legal advisers 215 legads in the operational command ch ain from those in permanent divisional and battle staff hea dquarters to those deploying in units should be identified and involved at an early stage of the pl anning process information should flow readily among them so that there is common understanding of the legal basis for the operation and an ability on the part of all legads in the operation to contribute to relevant legal briefings and loac traini ng for deployed forces with respect to loac training the operational legad shoul d ensure as minimum that focused refresher briefs are offered and loac aidemémoire10 to complement pre deployment training provided to servicemen deployed on operations the bulk of the training and education should already have been delivered as matter of routine during new entry and career c ourses with appropriate continuation training the geneva conventions place an oblig ation on parties to teach loac 9 see footnote 39 to jwp 300 paragraph 225a national constraints restrictions legal issues political nuances and sensitivities must all be clearly articulated ideally during work up training well before operations commence it follows the fewer of these there are the better 10 eg extant jsp 381 or missionspecific adaptation 26 jwp 346 the high contracting parties undertak in time of peace as in time of armed conflict to disseminate th text of the present convention as widely as possible in their respectiv countries and in particular to include the study thereof in their programmes of military and if possible civil instruction so that the principles thereof may become known to the entire population in particular to the armed fighting forces the medical personnel and the chaplains11 loac syllabus should be convincing re levant built round practical examples and tailored to the target audience identification of legal issues 216 legads should be involved in planni ng and mission rehearsal for this provides the best opportunity to id entify or refine targeting roe12 or combat legal issues legads should think through the di fferent phases of an operation and prepare to deal with foreseeable legal questions that might arise sovereignty of states affects mounting aspects of an operation such as ssistance and basing overflight rights air and seaports of disembarkation informati onintelligence gatheri ng and general access to areas adjacent to the joa13 in armed conflict issues such as prisoner handling refugees and combat search and rescue opera tions will arise equally if occupation is contemplated the legal implications of th is for the uk will need to be examined along with careful consideration of the laws of the occupied territory these considerations should inform the planning process the pjhqjoint force headquarters jfhq legads have pla ce in the joint command group jcg the role of which is to prioritise the planning effort and provide direction and guidance as required14 legal consultation 217 the legad will typically be appr oached for advice by j3 j5 and contingency planning teams depending on how far campai gn planning has advanced the planning phase of the operation will gene rate number of actions and issues and it will be necessary for service lawyers to seek clarification on legal issues from the chain of command or mod legal

arise during operations so the legad has comprehensive responsibility in operations execution fo r example the use of force crossing the threshold of armed conflict brings into play the body of loac an armistice15 cease fire16 capitulation17 or surrender18 can all suspend hostilities but each does so in way that imposes different legal obligations on the uk these are terms of art the agreements must be clear precise ideally in writing entered into by the competent authority and followed scrupulously19 because the uk meets its rights and obligations what follows are some of the most impo rtant practical issu facing the legad during the course of an operation basic principles in use of force 219 operations entailing the use of force must conform to some basic legal principles20 and these must be at the forefront of the legads mind when force is used21 military necessity and humanity just because something is military or has military use it does not mean that it should be attacked to be legitimate target it must be judged according to the operational and tactical objectives sought these should flow from the legitimate purpose of the conflict eg the complete or partial submission of the enem at the earliest possible moment with the minimum expend iture of life and resources lawful force should be proportionate and necessa ry to achieve the legitimate aim the principle of military necessity is of ten counterpoised with the principle of humanity which imports general duties ch as avoiding inflicting superfluous 15 armistice suspends military operations by mutual agr eement between the belligerent parties hague regulation 36 16 ceasefire in practice ceasefire has been temporary suspension of military operations negotiated by opposing commanders for humanitarian purpose such as the collection of the wounded r the exchange of prisoners of war ceasefire may also be arranged either in consequence of political dialogue or as prelude to it jsp 383 paragraph 10151 17 capitulation capitulation is an agreement entered in to between the commanders of armed forces or belligerents concerning the terms of surrender of body of troops of defended town or place or of particular district of the theatre of war they are both in character and purpose purely and exclusively military agreements involving the abandonment of resistance by portion of the enemys forces which capitulates and result as rule in members of the force becoming prisoners of war jsp 383 paragraph 1030 18 surrender surrender may be distinguished from capitula tion in that there is usually agreement stipulating the terms of the surrender it may range fr om an individual soldier laying down his arms to the unconditional surrend er of nation jsp 383 paragraph 1033 individual co mbatants who surrender are entitled to pw status 19 jsp 383 paragraph 1013 20 jsp 383 chapter 2 21 the same legal considerations arise not only in relation to the use of kinetic force but ap ply equally to the application of nonkinetic force eg in the context of information operations suc h as the jamming of media broadcasting or degrading an adversarys computer networks 28 jwp 346 injury or unnecessary suffering22 or protecting those rendered hors combat23 such as the wounded sick or shipwrecked b distinction offensive action must only be directed against military objectives they are those objects whic h by their nature location purpose or use make an effective contribution to m ilitary action and whose total or partial destruction capture or ne utralization in the circumstances ruling at the time offers definite military advantage24 civilians and civilian objects25 must not be attacked the attacker is to be judged on the quality of information available to him at the time if he makes reasonable efforts to gather intelligence reviews it and concludes in good faith that he is attacking legitimate target then he does not au tomatically violate the principle of distinction if it turns out to be civilian person or object c proportionality the principle of proportionality requires that the collateral damage resulting from military action should not be excessive in relation to the expected military advant age this can be broken down into 2 duties 1 avoidance of excessive civilian losses the duty not to cause incidental loss of civilian life inju ry to civilians damage to civilian objects or combination thereof wh ich would be exce ssive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated26 2 feasible precautions the duty of attackers to take all feasible precautions to discriminate in pla nning or deciding upon an attack even to the point of cancelling or susp ending an attack and warning the civilian population that may be affected by an attack27 feasible precautions are those precautions which are practicable or practically possible taking into account all th circumstances ruling at the time including humanitarian and military

targeting 221 compliance with the law of armed conflict targeting operations are subjected to careful scrutiny to ensure that they are necessa ry to achieve the objectives of the campaign that they involve the use of necessary and pro portional force and most importantly that they meet the strict requirements of international law governing the conduct of military operations34 the operational legad will need to have thorough knowledge of the legal rule s governing kinetic nd nonkinetic actions35 and bring this to bear on the targeting process for example restrictions relate to cultural historical and religious sites and medical facilities also there are rules which protect objects indispensable to the populations surviv such as foodstuffs agricultural areas and drinking water and pr ohibition in most cases on attacks that would cause widespread longterm and seve re damage to the natural nvironment whether state of international armed conflict exists or not when engaged in targeting uk armed forces are to apply the provisions of the 1977 additional protocol 1 to the geneva conventions of 1949 222 aspects of targeting process the legad n eeds to be conversant with the

undetermined and may be subsequently dealt with as either tst dt or as ta rget planned in the deliberate cycle 228 target approval in the joint operations area 42 the degree of delegated authority given to the jtfcncc to enga ge targets will depend on the operation and can be politically sensitive however it is inevitable that there will be targets that require clearance at the strategic level in order to meet this imperative the jtfhq targeting cell must support timely target clearance procedure in close cooperation with all other agencies involved where th uk is in support of multinational jtf an important advisory duty for the ncc is to appraise the jtfc of the reality of the uks approval process at cc level the cc legad s hould be advising cc target boards on the lawfulness of the targets being nominated for inclusion in the jtl the 40 jwp 300 paragraph 2e17h 41 jwp 300 paragraph 2e110 42 jwp 300 paragraph 2e19 214 jwp 346 215 cc legad should appreciate the questions and issues which the jfhq is likely to ask and advise on resolving such targeting issues at an early stage 229 whilst the jtfcncc may only act w ithin the bounds of his delegated authority he is not absolved of his responsib ility to clear targets in theatre at the time of the attack notwithstanding any prior sifting of target folders handed down from higher authority this necessarily follow s from the principle of distinction which places legal duty on those who plan or decide attacks to discriminate between military and civilian objectives and to take all feasible precautions43 it is also matter of common sense because until cam paign is underway it is not possible to state with any degree of accuracy what th collateral damage will be and what military advantage is to be gained fro m attacking particular target the practical implication for the operational legad is that he needs to raise the awareness of the targeting cell that they should not work on assumptions outdated information or superficial reports instead they should drill down fo r uptodate relevant information and understand the intelligence basis on which ta rget proposals are made the targets status as military objective and th military advantage in attacking it need to be determined at the time that the attack is authorised which will be some time after it has passed scrutiny at the higher level targeting boards 230 it should always be remembered that the decision to undertake kinetic or nonkinetic attack lies with the commander the legad will advise and assist the commander in making that decision setting out the legal principles for him and ensuring that the decision is within the acceptable boundaries of military necessity distinction humanity and proportionality however the legads role is just that advisory the legad is not the decision maker practical legal issues 231 as every operation is different the legal issues arising from one operation to the next will differ nevertheless experien ce during armed conflict has shown that the legad will face certain complex recurring issues eg the status treatment and handling of detainees internees or pws44 disciplinary administrative and war crimes investigations information operations45 the question of who comprises an enemys armed forces46 for targeting purposes or the pref erred method of neutralising targets which carry potentially high risk of collateral damage in pso or belligerent occupation the legad will face different t of issues with the emphasis being on law and order the drafting or interpretation of laws and agreements or the legal rights 43 ap 1 article 57 44 see jwp 110 prisoners of war handling 45 for example info ops must not terrorise imply territorial control when there is none suggest that quarter will be offered contain an illegal ultimatum or suggest that legal rights will be denied on capture 46 jsp 383 chapter 4 jwp 346 and obligations of visiting47 or occupying forces the intent of this publication is not to address all these issues rather it is to set out the correct approach the point for the deployed legad is that whilst these issues belong to the execution phase of an operation they need to be t hought through at the planning st age in respect of uk operations and uk areas of responsibilit pjhq legads drawing help from mod dgls should scope the legal issues study ssons identified from previous operations and brief the legal issues down the chain of command before decisive operations start whilst the jtfhqnchq legad is likely to be familiar with the specific legal issues of an emerging operational plan owing to his organic link to pjhq this may not be the case for other legads th pjhq and jtfhqnchq augmentees on the one hand and cc legads on the other may well have different backgrounds and have come to the operation at late stage of the planning or even execution stages therefore assumptions should be made should complex issues arise unforeseen during the course of an operation it is esse ntial that the deployed legad coordinate with pjhq to obtain high level mod or uk government direction 47 the legal position of uk armed forces operating in the sove reign territory of another nation will usually be regulated by status of forces agreements sofas or memoranda of underst anding mous legads should liaise with pjhq
