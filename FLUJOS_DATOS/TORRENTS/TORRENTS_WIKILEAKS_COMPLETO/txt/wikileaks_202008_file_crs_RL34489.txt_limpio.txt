in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division climate change costs and benefits of s 2191s 3036 summary this report examines six studies that project the costs of s 2191 s 3036 to 2030 or 2050 it is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030 much less beyond the already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled longterm cost projections are at best speculative and should be viewed with attentive skepticism despite models inability to predict the future cases examined here do provide insights on the costs and benefits of s 2191 first the ultimate cost of s 2191 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill the potential for technology to reduce s 2191s costs is not fully analyzed by any of the cases nor can it be technology development is not sufficiently understood currently for models to replicate with confidence likewise it is difficult to determine if available incentives are directed in an optimal manner the cases suggest that s 2191s carbon capture and storage ccs bonus allowances would encourage deployment of ccs accelerating development by 510 years second considerable amount of lowcarbon generating capacity will have to be built under s 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement how much capacity will be necessary depends on new and replacement capacity needs along with consumer demand response to rising prices and incentives contained in s 2191 third offsets could be valuable tool not only to potentially reduce costs but also to buy time to permit further development of new more efficient technologies cost could be lowered further by greater availability of offsets and international credits and with broader definition of eligible international credits fourth the carbon market efficiency board could have an important effect on the cost of s 2191 through its power to extend the availability of offsets and international credits in this sense the boards powers could mesh with the previous insight about the potential effect of offsets on the bills overall costs fifth the low carbon fuel standard could significantly raise fuel prices and limit supply the effects will depend on what fuels are included the emissions reductions achieved by alternatives and the ability to produce those alternatives finally s 2191s climaterelated benefit is best considered in global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort the united states and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases ghgs and to take the lead in reducing ghgs when they ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc this context raises two issues for s 2191 1 whether s 2191s ghg program would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely and 2 whether s 2191s reductions meet us commitments under the

report are published as presentations with limited documentation making comparative analysis difficult each presentation has selected features or impacts it is particularly interested in highlighting the more comprehensive analyses are the work by epa eia and mit in order to increase the comparability of the various cases examined here crs has converted all publicly available data presented by the cases to 2005 dollars where appropriate and interpolated missing data where possible likewise where studies have stated they used specific projections as base case such as eias annual energy outlook 2007 or preliminary 2008 projections crs has assumed those assumptions have not been altered except as specifically stated by the study this analysis considers the bill as ordered reported by the senate committee on environment and public works incorporating the proposed deficit reduction amendment s 3036 is identical to that version including the deficit amendment other proposed amendments are likely if the bill moves to the floor and these amendments if adopted could affect the costs and benefits of the overall bill overview of the major provisions of s 2191 s 3036 s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 was introduced october 18 2007 by senator lieberman on december 5 2007 the senate committee on environment and public works ordered reported an amended version of the bill that would establish mandatory capandtrade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from most sectors of the economy11 as ordered reported s 2191s emissions cap is estimated by its sponsors to require 71 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 from covered entities estimated by the sponsors to account for 87 of total us greenhouse gas emissions overall the sponsors estimate that s 2191 would reduce total us greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66 from 2005 levels by 2050 s 2191 would establish an absolute cap on the emissions from covered sectors and would allow trading of emissions permits allowances among covered and 10 for more information on the mrnneem model see httpwwwcraicom uploadedfilesrelating_materialspublicationsbcenergy_and_environment

rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucci crs4 noncovered entities12 the bill achieves its broad coverage through an upstream compliance mandate on petroleum natural gas and fluorinated gas producers and importers and downstream mandate on coal consumers such as electric generators specifically the bill would limit greenhouse gas emissions from all petroleum producersimporters all natural gas processors all facilities that use more than 5000 tons of coal per year and entities that produce or import more than 10000 tons annually carbon dioxide equivalent of fluorinated gases and other greenhouse gases s 2191 does not have safety valve an alternative compliance option that permits covered entities to pay an excess emissions fee instead of reducing emissions instead the bill creates carbon market efficiency board with authority to temporarily adjust the availability of allowances through borrowing and other techniques however it is zerosum game allowances borrowed must be repaid so the emissions cap is maintained the bill limits the availability of domestic offsets to 15 of the allowance requirement with allowances bought in an eligible international allowance market also limited to 15 both percentages may be increased by the carbon market efficiency board if market conditions suggest such action the bill would permit banking of allowances for each year 2012 through 2050 the bill specifies the total number of allowances available then explicitly states the percentage of those allowances that will go to covered and noncovered sectors13 as well as the share that will be auctioned see table 1 over time an increasing share of the allowances are auctioned while the allowances to covered sectors decrease to zero auction proceeds are allocated for various purposes including technology development and deployment transition assistance adaptation and program administration14 see table 2 under proposed amendment to make the bill revenue neutral percentage of allowances starting at 61 increasing to 1599 would be auctioned offthetop for deficit reduction deficit reduction fund after the deficit reduction allowances are allocated the rest of the allowances remainder allowances are allocated according to the bill as reported for example in 2012 61 of the total number of allowances are auctioned for deficit reduction and an additional 215 of the remainder allowances are auctioned for program management technology deployment adaptation and other purposes 12 see common terms box for definitions for more detailed definitions see crs report rl33846 13 in addition to allowances given at cost to covered sectors the bill also allocates allowances to states and tribes for various policy objectives to local energy distribution companies to reduce costs to low and middleincome energy consumers to the us department of agriculture to fund sequestration projects and other purposes noncovered entities must sell their allowances for fair market value within one year of receipt and use the proceeds from those sales for specified purposes 14 for more detailed description of the allocation of allowances and auction revenues under s 2191 see crs general distribution memo allocations of carbon allowances and auctions under s 2191 as ordered reported by the senate committee on environment and public works dated may 13 2008 crs5 common terms allowance limited authorization by the government to emit 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent although used generically an allowance is technically different from credit credit represents ton of pollutant that an entity has reduced in excess of its legal requirement however the terms tend to be used interchangeably along with others such as permits auctions auctions can be used in marketbased pollution control schemes to allocate some or all of the allowances auctions may be used to 1 ensure the liquidity of the credit trading program andor 2 raise potentially considerable revenues for various related or unrelated purposes banking the limited ability to save allowances for the future and shift the reduction requirement across time capandtrade program an emissions reduction program with two key elements 1 an absolute limit cap on the emissions allowed by covered entities and 2 the ability to buy and sell trade those allowances among covered and noncovered entities coverage coverage is the breadth of economic sectors covered by particular greenhouse gas reduction program as well as the breadth of entities within sectors emissions cap mandated limit on how much pollutant or greenhouse gases an affected entity can release to the atmosphere caps can be either an absolute cap where the amount is specified in terms of tons of emissions on an annual basis or ratebased cap where the amount of emissions produced per unit of output such as electricity is specified but not the absolute amount released caps may be imposed on an entity sector or economywide basis greenhouse gases the six gases recognized under the united nations framework convention on climate change are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o sulfur hexafluoride sf6 hydrofluorocarbons hfc and perfluorocarbons pfc leakage the shift in greenhouse gas ghg emissions from an area subject to regulation eg capandtrade program to an unregulated area so reduction benefits are not obtained this would happen for example if ghg emitting industry moved from country with an emissions cap to country without cap offsets emission credits achieved by activities not directly related to the emissions of an affected source examples of offsets would include forestry and agricultural activities that absorb carbon dioxide and reductions achieved by entities that are not regulated by greenhouse gas control program revenue recycling how program disposes of revenues from auctions penalties andor taxes revenue recycling can have significant effect on the overall cost of the program to the economy sequestration sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide from emission streams or from the atmosphere and then storing it in such way as to prevent its release to the atmosphere crs6 in addition to the capandtrade program s 2191 has other key provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions title vi imposes an international reserve allowance requirement on certain covered imported goods as prerequisite for entry into the country15 unlike importers of covered fuels that create greenhouse gases when used which are directly controlled as covered facilities under s 2191 title vi would affect certain bulk goods manufactured in processes that generate greenhouse gases eg iron paper etc that would not be allowed into the country if the allowance requirement were not met the amount and allocation of international reserve allowances would be determined by epa and separate allowance trading system could be established international reserve allowances could not be used for domestic compliance title viii on carbon sequestration16 requires 1 epa to amend regulations under the safe drinking water act to allow commercial scale underground injection of carbon dioxide for sequestration and to monitor such activity to reduce adverse impacts from such injection 2 the department of the interior to assess us capacity for geological sequestration 3 the department of energy to assess the feasibility of co2 pipelines and 4 epa to establish task force to study the issues related to federal assumption of liability for sequestration sites title ix permits the president to temporarily adjust or waive any regulations promulgated under the bill if national security emergency exists and it is in the paramount interest of the united states to modify the requirements in response to that emergency in addition to the limits under the capandtrade program title x requires epa to establish program limiting us consumption of hydrofluorocarbons under separate hfc allowance program title xi amends the clean air act in three ways 1 it requires epa to establish program to limit emissions of greenhouse gases not covered under the program 2 it limits the sale and use of certain motor vehicle air conditioning fluids and 3 it establishes low 15 for further discussion of title vi see jeanne grimmett and larry parker whether import requirements contained in title vi of s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 as ordered reported are consistent with us wto obligations congressional distribution memorandum march 27 2008 available from the authors 16 for more information on carbon sequestration see crs report rl33801 carbon capture and sequestration ccs by peter folger crs7 carbon fuel standard lcfs requiring perunitenergy reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels17 earlier versions of the bill bill as introduced s 2191 originally titled americas climate security act of 2007 as introduced october 18 2007 by senator lieberman would cap greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation industrial and transportation sectors for facilities that emit more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent as introduced the cap was estimated by the sponsors to reduce emissions to 15 below 2005 levels in 2020 declining steadily to 63 below 2005 levels in 2050 the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunities for costeffective reductions credits obtained from increases in carbon sequestration and acquisition of allowances from foreign sources could be used to comply with 30 of reduction requirements the bill also establishes carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary bill as reported by subcommittee on november 1 2007 the senate committee on environment and public works subcommittee on private sector and consumer solutions to global warming and wildlife protection reported out revised version of s 2191 as reported from subcommittee s 2191 was estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 19 below 2005 levels by 2020 up from 15 as introduced and 63 below 2005 levels by 2050 the increase in the estimated reductions in 2020 is the result of amended text that includes greenhouse gases from all natural gas uses under the overall emissions cap other amendments approved included modifications to eligibility requirements for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program and the advanced coal generation technology demonstration program modifications were also made to the proposed allocation of allowances to help tribal communities respond to climate change and to encourage international forest carbon activities along with 1 of allowances reserved for rural cooperatives and corresponding reduction in allowances allocated to the rest of the electric power industry the revised bill also added two new recipients of auction revenues bureau of land management emergency firefighting fund 300 million and forest service emergency firefighting fund 800 million 17 this lcfs provision is discussed in more detail in the section below under transportation sector crs8 table 1 allocation of allowances under s 2191

on december 5 2007 the full committee ordered reported revised version of s 2191 by an 11 to 8 vote the revised bill expands the greenhouse gas reduction program coverage by replacing the previous definition of covered facility based on the electric power transportation and industrial sectors with an upstream definition for oil refineries and natural gas processing plants and downstream definition for coal consumers among the amendments agreed to by the full committee were new low carbon fuel standard lcfs that would require the carbon intensity of transportation fuel to be frozen in 2011 and then reduced by 5 in 2015 and 10 in 2020 other amendments agreed to would increase incentives for states to modify their utility regulatory structures to encourage energy efficiency and would broaden the ability of states to use their allowance allocations to mitigate adverse economic impacts resulting from the bills implementation deficit reduction amendment finally in april 2008 proposed amendment to s 2191 was submitted by the committee to the congressional budget office cbo to be included in the scoring of the bill the amendment would provide for some of the auctioned revenues to be put aside for deficit reduction purposes introduction models cannot predict the future costs of climate change program lessons from so2 cap and trade program during the clean air act debate in 1990 on the title iv sulfur dioxide so2 capand trade program crs found it difficult to analyze the cost of the bill beyond the first 10 years 19902000 and considered any breakdown of even 2000 data on statebystate basis as not useful for any more than illustrative purposes18 as stated in 1990 it is difficult and some would consider it unwise to project costs up to the year 2000 much less beyond the already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic and other unforeseen events such as electric utility deregulation loom as critical issues which can not be modeled hence cost projections beyond the year 2000 are at best speculative and are more function of each models assumptions and structure than they are of the details of proposed legislation projections this far into the future are based more on philosophy than analysis19 emphasis in original the history of resulting so2 capandtrade program costs has proven illuminating as indicated in table 3 the 2010 cost estimates for the so2 capand trade program made in 1990 proved to be substantially higher than what is now estimated to be the programs actual costs indeed the epaicf low estimate the 18 see crs report 9063 acid rain control an analysis of title iv of s 1630 by larry parker january 31 1990 p 13 available from the author 19 ibid p 16 crs11 estimate closest to the projected actual number is both 50 higher than the actual number and the estimate least focusedon in the original icf report20 it is interesting that none of the analyses were willing to speculate with assumptions that would have created 2010 cost estimate lower than epas current projection21 equally interesting is that the best 2000 estimate was off by almost the same 50 that the 2010 estimate was22 like the 2010 estimates the assumptions either underestimated the ingenuity and creativity of companies in responding to the so2 requirements or misread the economics of the capandtrade process as explained below by chestnut and mills in 2005 the gross overestimates are essentially the product of the models failure both to fully incorporate the flexibility that the cap andtrade program provided participants and to employ sufficient imagination to explore the potential for technological breakthroughs and enhancements costs are lower than originally predicted primarily because flexibility occurred in areas that were thought to be inflexible and technical improvements were made that were not anticipated factors contributing to the lower costs included lower transportation costs for lowsulfur coal attributed to railroad deregulation productivity increases in coal production leading to favorable prices for lowsulfur and midsulfur coal cheaper than expected installation and operation costs for smokestack scrubbers and new boiler adaptations to allow use of different types of coal it appears that title iv has worked as expected to provide the flexibility and incentives for producers to find lowcost compliance options footnote omitted banking opportunities also induced early reductions in emissions for some facilities harrington et 2000 compared estimates of actual costs of many large regulatory programs to predictions of those costs made while the regulatory programs were being developed and found tendency for predicted costs to overstate the actual implementation costs especially for marketbased programs such as the so2 trading program they cite technological innovation and unanticipated efficiency gains as key factors leading to lower than predicted costs they noted that unit costs are often more accurately predicted than total costs because predicted emission reductions are sometimes overstated but they report that predicted unit costs and total costs were both overstated for title iv23 20 the only 2010 national utility cost estimate mentioned in the summary of findings is for the high case longerterm costs reach about 5 billion 1988 dollars per year by 2010 under both the high house and senate cases due to the provisions requiring new source emissions to be offset the low house and senate cases for 2010 are not mentioned see

july 1990 p 21 21 the implementation of the so2 provisions of the clean air interstate rule cair will significantly increase the stringency of the so2 cap for 23 states and the district of columbia and will likely prevent epa from estimating actual title iv compliance costs in 2010 because of program interaction 22 in its 1990 analysis crs agreed with the range of estimates provided by the epaicf analysis for 2000 as suggested above crs did not estimate the costs for 2010 see crs report 9063 acid rain control an analysis of title iv of s 1630 by larry parker january 31 1990 p 56

analyses of s 2191 there is reason to believe that cost estimates for greenhouse gas reductions will be any more accurate than the 1990 so2 estimates indeed they are likely to be more unreliable this is not to say that they will be too high they may be too low to illustrate crs examines some results of the modeling efforts with respect to the costs of s 2191 to frame this illustration we focus on the three primary drivers of greenhouse gas emissions 1 population growth 2 incomes measured as per capita gross domestic product gdp and 3 intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities measured as metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per million dollars of gdp as shown in the following formula countrys annual greenhouse gas emissions are the product of these three drivers population x per capita gdp x intensityghg emissionsghg this is the relationship for given point in time over time any effort to change emissions alters the exponential rates of change of these variables this means that 23 continued us acid rain program journal of environmental management 77 2005 p 255 crs13 the rates of change of the three lefthand variables measured in percentage of

widens for two of the three drivers the 2050 reference case population remains constant in the three models not surprisingly the range widens for the projected 2050 greenhouse gas emissions estimates 53 billion metric tons for epaadageref crs14 41 billion metric tons epaigemref and 38 billion metric tons for miteppa 40 difference in particular the models assumptions about the flexibility and responsiveness of the us economy resulted in some interesting reversals 1 the miteppa model which has the closest relationship between ghgs and gdp in the reference case has the most responsive assumptions resulting in the greatest reduction in ghg and ghg intensity under s 2191 2 in contrast the epaadageref model which has the lowest ghg intensity assumption in its reference cases has the highest ghg intensity result under s 2191 the miteppa model assumes more economic growth per capita and more responsiveness by the economy to ghg constraints the epaadage model assumes the most ghgefficient economy but the least amount of flexibility to respond to ghg constraints and the epaigem model assumes the fastest growth in population the result of these different views of the economy is that the economic impact is less than the differences in the models reference case assumptions as indicated in table 4 the miteppa model projection of the countrys 2050 gdp per capita under s 2191 is greater than the basecase projections of either of the other models according to the miteppa model the 2050 gdp per capita of the country is reduced by only 075 under s 2191 the reduction under the other two models is 69 for epaigemref and 24 for epaadageref well within the variability of the reference cases the result is not significantly more consistent for projections for 2030 particularly with the addition of the eia baselines24 the catfnems analysis uses the eia baseline published in its annual energy outlook 2007 for its analysis25 the eianems analysis uses preliminary version of eias upcoming 2008 aeo baseline26 as indicated in table 5 the basecase assumptions for per capita gdp vary by greater percentage for 2030 than they do for 2050 the introduction of the eia 2008 baseline is responsible for much of the increase in gdp per capita variability it would be 7 without it similarly the inclusion of the 2007 and 2008 eia baseline increases the variability of the greenhouse gas intensity driver it would be 9 without it likewise the gdp per capita impact of s 2191 is within the noise of the reference cases as the estimated gdp per capita reduction under s 2191

three driver illustration presented above in its analysis of s 2191 epa presents eight pages of bullets identifying various limitations on its modeling exercise and four pages of additional qualitative considerations27 this is good indicator of the modeling complexity in attempting to estimate the impact of greenhouse gas reduction bill these modeling limitations reflect the inherent complexity of such strategies that cannot be quantified or predicted complexity of the problem compared with the complexity of implementing greenhouse gas capand trade scheme the so2 program was trivial conceptually co2 tradeable permit program could work similarly to the so2 program however significant differences exist between acid rain and possible global warming that affect current abilities to model responses for example the acid rain program involves up to 3000 new and existing electric generating units that contribute twothirds of the countrys so2 this concentration of sources makes the logistics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable the imposition of the allowance requirement is straightforward the acid rain program is downstream program focused on the electric utility industry the allowance requirement is imposed at the point of so2 emissions so the participant has clear price signal to respond to the basic dynamic of the program is simple although not necessarily predictable comprehensive greenhouse gas capandtrade program would not be as straightforward to implement greenhouse gas emissions sources are not concentrated although over 80 of the greenhouse gases generated comes from fossil fuel combustion only about 33 comes from electricity generation transportation accounts for about 26 direct residential and commercial use about 8 agriculture about 6 and direct industrial use about 1628 thus small dispersed sources in transportation residentialcommercial agriculture and the industrial sectors are far more important in controlling greenhouse gas emissions than 27 us environmental protection agency epa analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 march 14 2008 pp 96102 108115 28 us environmental protection agency us inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks 19902006 april 2008 p es8 crs17 they are in controlling so2 emissions this greatly increases the economic sectors and individual entities that may be required to reduce emissions it also affects the operation of capandtrade program as the diversity of sources creates significant administrative and enforcement problems for tradeable permit program if it is meant to be comprehensive downstream approach is impractical for comprehensive greenhouse gas program where the transportation sector and dispersed residential commercial and agricultural sources emit almost half the total emissions one alternative is to move the imposition point more upstream in those sectors as is done by s 2191 this complicates the economics of the program as the price signal has to work its way through multiple paths to the particular entities utilities consumers industry that are the ultimate sources of the greenhouse gases arguably the primary purpose of an economic mechanism such as capandtrade program is to put price on greenhouse gas emissions in the case of comprehensive capandtrade program the impact of that price signal will not be simple or straightforward with unintended consequences likely29 in addition attempts by analysts to capture the general equilibrium effects of the programs interaction with the overall economy add layer of assumptions and opaqueness to the analysis that can hide insights the analysis may have on program design and implementation flexibility of capandtrade program the flexibility envisioned by most capandtrade programs exceeds that of the so2 program acid rain is regional problem that resulted in independent responses by the united states and canada the united states chose capandtrade program that included important flexibility mechanisms like banking canada chose variety of approaches and the entire process was later codified by treaty offsets emission reductions made by entities not directly covered by the program are not major component of the so2 program uncovered industrial entities that want to participate in the program must become covered entities with their own baselines and monitoring equipment the bill also sets up small reserve of allowances to reward reductions through conservation and renewable energy efforts with the sulfur dioxide capandtrade system being limited to the united states there is international trading in the acid rain program in contrast most ghg capandtrade proposals expand the supply of available allowances by permitting offsets from wide variety of sources including agricultural practices forestry projects sequestration activities and alternative energy projects these diverse sources multiply as the trading extends globally and as other nonco2 greenhouse gases are included in the supply mix finally the interaction of these various supply sources and the demand of other countries also reducing emissions or who may decide to reduce in the future provide for an almost infinite number of possible scenarios crucially the availability of offsets may have significant impact on compliance costs particularly in the shortterm 29 this is particularly true if allowances are allocated to upstream entities at cost see sergey paltsev et assessment of us capandtrade proposals mit joint program on the science and policy of global change april 2007 p 5 crs18 importance of technology to future results the three driver analysis illustrated the importance of reducing the greenhouse intensity of the economy to reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions the other two drivers population and economic growth are generally not elements targeted for reduction under greenhouse gas reduction programs indeed by any federal program the key factor in reducing the intensity driver over the long run is technology development this is recognized in most greenhouse gas reduction bills including s 2191 with substantial funding incentives and price signals to encourage both accelerated deployment and the initiation of efforts to develop new generations of technology the effectiveness of these initiatives and price signals would be pivotal to the ultimate cost of any reduction strategy particularly in the long term as stated by houghton technology change is particularly critical component of the climate change debate for example the cost of meeting stabilization levels is very sensitive to assumptions about future technologies if assumed technology improvements lead to relatively low emissions then it is relatively inexpensive to meet stabilization levels and vice versa furthermore technology research and development is very significant policy instrument in the portfolio of options30 increasing problems with ceteris paribus31 analysis as was the case with analyses of the so2 capandtrade program current studies of greenhouse gas reduction proposals assume that in the absence of new legislation epa would take action in this area between now and the year 2050 and future initiatives would be enacted in related areas such as energy policy this seems unlikely indeed the potential for future requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emission may already be having an effect on decisions by industry and consumers as noted by eia while forecasting policy change is beyond eias mandate an argument can be made that all else being equal public and industry awareness of climate change as major policy issue can potentially impact energy investment decisions even if specific policy change actually occurs any adjustment to reflect the influence of climate change as an unresolved policy issue while raising costs in the reference case would generally reduce the estimated incremental impact resulting from the full implementation of given policy response32 changing baselines by changing laws that the policy baseline for greenhouse gas emissions can be shifted significantly through new initiatives has 30 john houghton introduction energy economics 28 2006 p 535 31 from latin roughly meaning all else being held the same in analysis this refers to the practice of holding certain variables constant to isolate the effect of the variable being analyzed 32 energy information administration energy market and economic impact of s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 april 2008 p viv crs19 already been illustrated by enactment of the 2007 energy independence and security act eisa on december 19 2007 president bush signed eisa pl 110140 eisa contains many energy provisions that could lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions including33 more stringent fuel economy cafe standards for passenger cars and light trucks higher efficiency standards for appliances and lighting higher efficiency requirements for government buildings and research and development on renewable energy the american council for an energyefficient economy estimates that the efficiency provisions in eisa will save roughly 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by 203034 most of this savings would come from tighter cafe standards in addition to these indirect reductions eisa also directly addresses climate change issues in several ways first eisa expands the renewable fuel standard rfs established in pl 109 58 the eisa amendments to the rfs significantly expand the mandated level further the new law requires that an increasing share of the rfs be met with advanced biofuels defined as having 50 lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuels further conventional biofuels from new refineries must have at least 20 lower lifecycle emissions this is the first time that congress has enacted national policy addressing the carbon content of motor fuels second title vii of the new law focuses on research development and demonstration of technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide doe carbon storage rd is expanded and is to include largescale demonstration projects the department of the interior must develop methodology to assess the national potential for geologic and ecosystem storage of carbon dioxide and must recommend regulatory framework for managing geologic carbon sequestration on public lands in addition to the above programs eisa also requires the establishment of an office of climate change and environment in the department of transportation dot this office is to plan coordinate and implement research at dot on reducing transportationrelated energy use mitigating the causes of climate change and addressing the impacts of climate change on transportation 33 for more information on eisa see crs report rl34294 energy independence and security act of 2007 summary of major provisions by fred sissine 34 american council for an energyefficient economy energy bill savings estimates as passed by the senate december 14 2007 crs20 the practical result of this is the necessary reworking of eias aeo 2008 baseline to reflect the energy and environmental impact of the new laws more changes are likely over the 40year time frame of s 2191 changing baselines by changing regulation35 the stringency of the so2 capandtrade is being changed by epas clean air interstate rule cair the baseline may also be influenced by future epa initiatives not requiring new authority the clean air act is powerful tool that could be used to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from mobile sources of all kinds their fuels with the exception of jet fuel and both large and small stationary sources the possibility for regulation through existing clean air act authority was recently outlined by epa in congressional testimony36 the key to such regulation is that the epa administrator issue appropriate findings on whether greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that is reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare it is difficult bordering on impossible to determine where such finding would lead the administrator has substantial discretion in defining what emission limits should be set once he or she makes such finding and what sections of the act he or she might use greenhouse gases could be defined as criteria air pollutants or not they could be controlled in mobile sources of all kinds they could be subject to new source performance standards nsps prevention of significant deterioration psd or maximum available control technology mact requirements each of these has its own standardsetting process and criteria to some extent the important question may be how an administrator would define the source categories if all power plants were considered in the same category then the acts authority could be used to require the use of natural gas or cleaner fuels or at least to set emission standards based on the emissions from plants using such fuels if coalfired plants were their own category or technological approach were taken the best technology could be carbon capture and storage ccs how the sources would be categorized would be at the discretion of the administrator the administrator would also get to make technical judgments concerning whether technologies were available or achievable these judgments could be crucial in determining how much technologyforcing the regulations would do 35 this section prepared by james mccarthy specialist in environmental policy 36 robert j meyers principal deputy assistant administrator office of air and radiation us environmental protection agency testimony before the subcommittee on energy and air quality committee on energy and commerce us house of representatives april 10 2008 crs21 measuring the noise web of cost measures because of the economic complexities and interactions noted above analysts have generally chosen to focus on estimating the macroeconomic effects of proposals such as gdp impacts there are two components of macroeconomic cost measures 1 the direct abatement or compliance cost of greenhouse gas reduction program and 2 the general equilibrium effects of greenhouse gas reduction program ie the interactions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy the most common measure presented is gross domestic product gdp gdp measures the total value of goods and services produced within nations borders37 although it is commonly used as measure of quality of life this application is problematic generally it includes only those items for which there is value defined in market and does not take into account some activities that have economic value but market valuation eg leisure time environmental quality etc gdp is intended to be measure of economic activity not quality of life second measure sometimes presented is consumption effects sometimes called welfare effects unfortunately the models do not measure consumption or welfare effects in consistent fashion the primary advantage of measuring gdp for example the miteppa analysis presents welfare effects in terms of changes in aggregate market consumption plus leisure measured as equivalent variation the change in welfare represents the amount of income needed to compensate for the change in contrast the eianems model presents real consumption impacts in terms of consumer expenditures this makes comparisons difficult and lessens the utility of the measure for example when analyzing proposed legislation the welfare effects of legislation under the miteppa are usually less than the gdp effects while the real consumption impacts under eianems are usually greater than the gdp effects on percentage basis in addition like gdp none of the definitions of consumption or welfare currently employed quantify any environmental effects third measure generally presented is allowance prices these generally reflect to some degree the aggregate marginal cost of the program as estimated by the models marginal cost is the cost of reducing the last ton and therefore the most expensive of greenhouse gases required by the program at specific point in time marginal costs are very useful to affected entities in choosing what reduction strategy would be the most costeffective in achieving their assigned reduction requirement they are not an average cost and therefore cannot be simply multiplied by the greenhouse gases reduced to estimate total compliance cost they also need to be put into the context of the overall reduction achieved at the given point and time being examined 37 it has four basic components private consumption including most personal expenditures of households investments by business and households in capital including new house purchases government expenditures on goods and services but not transfer payments such as social security and net imports crs22 however allowance prices in most analyses are actually different from marginal costs because of program provisions such as banking banking activity reflects the assumed foresight of affected entities to the likelihood of increasing allowance prices in real terms as the cap tightens as indicated by the experience with the so2 program entities will bank substantial allowances early and use them later as the programs requirements tighten this results in allowance prices being higher than marginal costs in the early years of the program and lower in later years for example the nmacra international analysis of s 2191 has 2050 allowance price of about 352 under banking assumptions but an allowance price of about 195 with banking in contrast 2015 allowance prices are estimated at 51 for the banking scenario but only 38 under the banking scenario38 this ability to timeshift reduction requirements and compliance costs means that allowance price projections reflect the assumed foresight of affected entities as much as they do actual marginal costs in presenting cost measures most analyses overemphasize aggregate welfare indicators such as gdp as illustrated above aggregate macroeconomic cost results for s 2191 fall into the noise of uncertainty about future conditions in addition aggregate macroeconomic measures reduce the transparency of the analyses compliance strategies and as result make them easier to dismiss for example figure 1 below shows 1997 scatterplot by world resources institute wri of 162 predicted impacts estimates from 16 different economic models of the us economy as result of co2 abatement program as indicated the vast majority of estimates fall with range of 04 of gdp regardless of the reduction requirement over emphasis on gdp or other aggregate cost measures can obscure fundamental technological economic or behavioral insights the analyses may have in helping policymakers craft legislation instead the analysis becomes black box exercise with little enlightenment function 38 w david montgomery and anne smith economic analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 using cras mrnneem model cra international april 8 2008 p 18 prices are in 2007 crs23 figure 1 predicted impacts of carbon abatement on the us economy 162 estimates from 16 models source robert repetto and duncan austin the costs of climate protection guide for the perplexed world resources institute 1997 crs24 this fog is inherent when analysts choose to include the general equilibrium effects of program in their cost measure fog that can limit the explanatory value of the analysis while supporting use of aggregate welfare cost measures mit notes ge general equilibrium effects can stem from interactions with preexisting distortions eg taxes from externally induced termsoftrade effects from the fact that the domestic policy itself creates termsoftrade effects and from other rigidities in the economy many aspects of model structure produce ge effects that are not easy to separately measure because of the inherent interactions in the economy39 generally the cases examined here have not chosen to separate the two components of macroeconomic cost measures 1 the direct abatement or compliance cost of greenhouse gas reduction program and 2 the general equilibrium effects of greenhouse gas reduction program ie the interactions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy40 the availability of compliance cost estimates would allow policymakers to put current greenhouse gas reduction proposals in the context of other environmental initiatives be they acid rain or toxic air pollutants and indeed to the overall environmental agenda and greatly increase the transparency of the analyses insights it would also help relieve confusion between compliance costs average costs per ton reduced and the other commonly presented costs such as allowance prices41 it is argued that an aggregate macroeconomic cost measure provides more complete view of the economic impact of proposed legislation and helps identity potential unintended economic effects of compliance strategies this may be true particularly if for example auction revenues are being recycled via reformed tax code however as indicated here aggregated macroeconomic cost measures such as gdp can also be interpreted to merely show that the united states has massive economy that can absorb substantial shocks with limited longterm effect three perspectives getting out of the noise breaking through the fog of analyses and cost indicators cost estimates to reduce co2 emissions vary greatly and focus attention on an estimators basic beliefs about the problem and the future in addition to simple technical differences in economic assumptions in previous report crs identified three lenses through which people can view the global climate change issues and their influence on cost 39 sergey paltsev et assessment of us capandtrade proposals mit joint program on the science and policy of global change april 2007 p 27 40 the compliance cost estimates provided by epa in its analyses are flawed as noted by epa they are overestimates of actual costs worse the overestimation increases as the tonnage reduction requirement and marginal costs increase nmacra provides an estimate of the net present value of s 2191s total costs 41 for good discussion of the confusion that can arise from mixing cost measures see anne smith jeremy platt and denny ellerman the cost of reducing so2 its higher than you think public utilities fortnightly may 15 1998 pp 2229 crs25 analysis42 these are summarized in table 6 none of these perspectives is inherently more right or correct than another rather they overlap and to varying degrees complement and conflict with one another people generally hold to each of the lenses to some degree table 6 influence of climate change

perspectives by larry parker and john blodgett crs26 however different combinations of these perspectives lead to very different cost estimates classic example of this is the contrast between the s 2191 results obtained by the clean air task force catf and the american council for capital formationnational association of manufacturers accfnam using the same model eias nems model table 7 summarizes the general approach of the two analyses according to the three perspectives identified above in its analysis catf expresses confidence in s 2191s various technology and efficiency provisions and models the bill assuming eias best available technology bat case banking and offsets in contrast accfnam states that it is unlikely that technology new energy sources and market mechanisms eg carbon offsets banking will be sufficiently available to achieve s 2191s emission targets accordingly accfnams assumptions differ substantially from catfs and other studies by excluding

results 1 the efficiency of the economic response46 2 availability of noncarbon technology47 3 availability of the kyoto mechanisms48 4 method of revenue recycling 5 method of incorporating technological advancements 6 inclusion of nonclimaterelated environmental benefits and 7 inclusion of climaterelated benefits as none of the models reviewed in this report quantify any environmental benefits in their analyses all models results can be considered worstcase scenarios results for s 2191 impact on greenhouse gas emissions figures 2 and 3 present greenhouse gas emissions under s 2191 as estimated by the ten cases relative to their baseline assumptions the range might seem surprising given the emission cap defined in the bill the cause of the range is largely twofold 1 estimated emissions growth in the 1015 of the economy not covered under the bill 2 estimated use of international credits to meet emission reduction requirements that do not reduce domestic emissions 43 continued research july 2006 and terry barker and katie jenkins the costs of avoiding dangerous climate change estimates derived from metaanalysis of the literature briefing paper for the human development report 2007 may 2007 44 httpwwwclimateyaleeduseeforyourself 45 as defined by repetto on the see for yourself website the metaanalysis was based on more than 1400 policy simulations performed with the various models it used statistical regression analysis to ascribe differences among models in the predicted economic cost of given percentage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to differences among models in specific assumptions though some of the models related only to the us economy others to the world economy the metaanalysis found that both sets of models produced the same results 46 in this regard computable general equilibrium models cge generally assume efficient economic responses to programs while macroeconomic models allow time for the economy to adjust resulting in higher shortterm costs 47 some models include backstop technology in unlimited amounts at specified high price 48 credits from the clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation

nmacra crs31 the most stringent interpretation of s 2191s emissions cap is by nmacra the resulting emissions estimates could be attributed to three factors 1 nmacra does not allow any international credits to be used to achieve reductions 2 nmacra uses the preliminary aeo 2008 baseline which may project lower emissions growth by noncovered sectors because of eisa or other factors and 3 nmacra also analyzes the effect of the bills proposed low carbon fuel standard which reduces emissions further as discussed later the highest emissions permitted under the bill are estimated by the two epaadage cases this higher emissions level is probably the result of the substantial use of international credits and percentage of uncovered entities assumed by adage interestingly the two accfnamnems cases do not present any estimates of their total greenhouse gas emissions baseline or the reduction calculated by their analysis the closest they come to presenting emissions reductions is chart with assumed increases in energyrelated co2 emissions and their interpretation of the reductions s 2191 would require on the energy sector impact on nongreenhouse gas emissions the only estimates of nongreenhouse gas emission reductions under s 2191 are provided by epaipm those projections are for the electric power sector only assume implementation of the clean air interstate rule cair rule currently in litigation and only go to 2025 the projections also reflect the interaction of co2 reductions with the banking provisions of the acid rain and cair rules this interaction results in the shortterm changes to 2015 in emissions being overstated as indicated in table 9 below onethird of the so2 reductions and onesixth of the nox reductions are achieved in the last year of

figures 6 and 7 show percentage reductions in gdp per capita from s 2191 relative to the models respective reference cases according to the ten cases presented here with the exception of the igem model all projections for all years between 2020 and 2050 fell into range between 03 eianems for 2020 and 2030 and 27 accfnamhigh for 2030 as indicated in figures 6 and 7 the epaigem cases produced 2050 estimates that were more than twice those of the other models the high estimates for gdp per capita reduction by the epaigem cases result from its structure and assumptions contained in the model for example the assumption about the relationship between leisure and consumption in igem is quite different from the other models essentially as prices for goods and services increase igem assumes highly responsive relationship with people deciding to work less and buy less as result small increase in prices will produce relatively large loss of consumption resulting in larger impact on gdp and other cost measures in contrast other models are less responsive assuming people will absorb higher prices without changing their work or consumption habits very much50 other factors influencing igems results include 1 somewhat higher emissions baseline 2 the lack of some less carbonemitting technological alternatives such as carbon capture and storage 3 usonly context that affects the models estimates of exports and 4 elasticities that are calibrated based on historical data the only year for which gdp per capita estimates were presented for all cases is 203051 once again the estimates from the igem model are substantially higher 36 and 38 than the seven other cases for reasons noted above the other cases fall into two categories the largest category is six cases that estimate 2030 gdp effect at about 1 or less these cases are epaadageref epaadage tech catfnems eianems miteppa and nmacra the other category is the two accfnamnems cases where the gdp effect is 26 and 27 in 2030 thus despite their restrictive assumptions the accfnamnems cases do not exceed the 04 range of gdp effects common to reduction programs 50 see janet peace and john weyant insights not numbers the appropriate use of economic models pew center on global climate change april 2008 pp 1819 this is an additional warning to readers about understanding the assumptions and limitations of models as stated later by peace and weyant the sensitivity of modeling results to single assumption in this case the elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure also serves to illustrate that important differences between models are not always obvious most casual users would never dive deep enough into model documentation to ascertain that igem and adage utilize different assumption about the tradeoff between consumption and leisure for this reason it is very important that model developers make transparent their assumptions and inputs as jorgenson goettle and poss do and b to the

cases examined here in addition we have included the congressional budget offices estimates used in scoring s 219152 it is clear from the figures that the banking assumption of the different cases has fundamental influence on projected prices for example as noted earlier the accfnamnems cases do not include banking an expressed decision by accfnam and not an inherent part of the nems model as evident by the catfnems and eianems cases this assumption has clear effect on the trajectory of their allowance prices in contrast the adage igem mrnneem and eppa models assume discount rates that tend to encourage banking53 as noted earlier banking tends to increase allowance prices in the early years of the program and lower them in the outyears this flattening effect results in the gentler slope of the allowance price curves evident in figures 8 and 9 below for these cases of the 2030 estimates for the eight cases that include s 2191s banking provision four cases project allowance prices in the range of 4561 catfnems eianems and the two epaadage cases while the other four cases project allowance prices in the 7386 range miteppa nmacra and the two epaigem cases the spread of

10 200854 therefore crs has provided the following estimates based on two cases high revenue case based on the miteppa study and low revenue case based on the epaadagetech case figure 10 in each case the auction revenue estimates are calculated by multiplying the estimated allowance price in given year by the number of allowances auctioned by the program for deficit reduction deficit reduction fund and the number of remainder allowances allocated for auction general auction as the number of allowances for auction in given year is set by the bill the total auction revenue for that year becomes function of the allowance price higher allowance price will lead to higher auction revenue as shown in figure 10 using the lower allowance prices in the epaadagetech case total auction revenues start in the tens of billions of dollars 2005 and increase to over 100 billion before 2030 using higher allowances prices such as the miteppa case total auction revenues exceed 100 billion before 2020 in comparison currently the federal government spends roughly 5 billion annually for the climate change science program the climate change technology program and international climate change assistance combined55 as indicated in table 10 after the firefighting deficit reduction administration expenses and other funds have been allocated substantial amount of auction revenue would remain available annually for technology deployment even in the low revenue epaadagetech case for example the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program sec 4405 would provide grants to automakers and parts manufacturers to develop the capacity to build plugin hybrid and other advanced vehicles and parts funds could be used for engineering integration of vehicles and retooling old plants to produce advanced vehicles using the lower allowance prices in the epaadagetech case this program would provide over 1 billion 2005 annually in 2012 increasing to more than 7 billion by 2040 in comparison doe currently spends between 200 million and 400 million for advanced vehicle and hydrogen fuel rd56 as noted in the next section the effectiveness of these funds in accelerating

administration cost csa management fund is based on epas estimate of 1 of total allowance value issues raised by the models technology issues frontier area in model development is creating fuller representations of technology advancement substantial amount of technological change occurs within the economy without direct policy intervention the free enterprise system provides significant rewards for those who develop costeffective alternatives and introduce them into the market57 however technological change is very complex subject and can also be induced through variety of policy levers including prices such as allowance prices subsidies and technology mandates or standards along with both publicly and privately funded research and development58 this induced technological change itc is not fully represented in the models used here although it is critical part of s 2191 observing that single source dominates the process of technology change process that includes roles for research and development learningbydoing and spillovers from other industries engaged in these activities l clarke et states the lesson from these observations is to be cautious in interpreting the policy conclusions of models that assume only single source of technological progress or that neglect critical factors such as spillovers this includes virtually all formal models in use today implying need both for more comprehensive treatments of technological change and more research to understand the nature and magnitude of any distortions of policy conclusions from models with limited representations of technological change59 that models used to project ghg reductions costs are deficient in treating technology change is likely major source of error that will only become cognizable as the future unfolds s 2191 includes numerous incentives for technology development incentives for which model has or could be expected to have estimated the collective effect 57 generally expressed in terms of autonomous energy efficiency improvement or aeei those effects are generally estimated using historical data 58 for an overview of induced technological change see lawrence h goulder

evidence energy economics 28 2006 p 593 crs44 electric power sector most of the analyses examined here focus on technological alternatives in the electric power sector availability of technology when and how quickly technology will be available is difficult but critical issue indeed the models examined here do not agree on the availability of current electric generating technology such as nuclear or wind power much less emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage ccs or the potential for breakthroughs over the next 40 years the general lack of detailed technology descriptions in the cge models does not help in this regard for example the epaigems presentation of the energy sector and technology options is too aggregated to be analyzed in terms of technology development under s 2191 current technologies several currently available technologies emit less greenhouse gases or none compared to conventional coalfired facility those technologies include electric generation from wind biomass landfill gas nuclear geothermal and natural gas some of these sources such as biomass and natural gas have some repowering potential with respect to coalfired generation the models do not provide much insight on the likely mix of these technologies under s 2191 some cases like the accfnamnems cases strictly define the availability of these technologies while others like the catfnems and eianems cases allow the model to meet the requirements without any additional constraints table 11 identifies some of the technologyavailability limits assumed in the different model runs along with the resulting capacity built to meet electricity demand from 2010 to 2030 because the accfnamnems cases heavily constrain the availability of most alternatives to naturalgas generation it is not surprising that substantial amount of natural gas capacity is assumed to be built under these cases during this time period this result is confirmed by sensitivity analysis conducted by eia that shows movement to natural gas if the availability of nuclear power renewable power and coal with ccs are constrained in contrast the epaipm catfnems and two epaadage cases indicate little or new

for renewables and 85 for natural gas crs46 in some ways the interplay between nuclear power renewables and coalfired capacity with ccs is proxy for the need for lowcarbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid to longterm as indicated considerable amount of lowcarbon generation will have to be built under s 2191 to meet the reduction requirement the amount of capacity constructed depends on the models basecase assumptions about future supply and demand and need for capacity replacementretirement under s 2191 along with the degree of consumer response to rising prices and incentives contained in s 2191 to put these numbers into historical context from 1963 to 1985 78 gw of nuclear power were ordered constructed and began operation60 for the 19year period of 1966 through 1984 the country added 464 gw of total generating capacity including 210 gw of coalfired capacity 38 gw of hydropower 27 gw of natural gas capacity steam technology 46 gw of oilfired capacity and 54 gw of peaking capacity to improve system reliability after the 1965 blackout in addition to new additions between 1965 and 1972 about 400 coalfired generating units were converted to oil to meet environmental requirements after the 1973 oil embargo this trend was reversed with 11gw of capacity converted back to coal by 198361 for more recent time period from 2001 through 2005 the united states added about 180 gw of new capacity almost all natural gasfired62 beyond construction of new facilities and repowering of existing ones conservation is likely to play an important role in reducing the need for new construction under s 2191 in general the models estimate 1030 reduction in projected demand for electricity from the 2030 basecase level due to s 2191 emerging technologies the emerging technology receiving the most attention in the models is carbon capture and storage ccs this is not surprising the models generally agree that the longterm viability of coalfired electric generation is dependent on developing ccs system indeed the models various projections of coal consumption are direct result of the models assumptions about the introduction and commercialization of ccs of the numerous provisions in s 2191 designed to promote emerging technologies the ccs bonus allowance provision is the only one that received substantial attention by the models table 12 indicates the various assumptions and limits the models placed on ccs deployment under s 2191 as indicated the cases that included the ccs subsidies contained in s 2191 generally assumed that the technology would be available earlier and in increasing amounts over the cases that did not include the subsidies for example the epaipm sensitivity analysis on s 2191s ccs bonus allowance subsidy indicates that the subsidy along with sufficiently high allowance prices results in the technology emerging in the commercial market in 2015 with full 60 compiled from eias reactor status list

discussion focuses on current perspectives on technological alternatives alternatives that mostly rely on the construction of new facilities be they nuclear power biomass power or coalfired integrated gasification combined cycle igcc with ccs many existing coal facilities are assumed to be retired early because in the words of eianems retrofitting them crs49 with ccs technology is generally impractical66 as suggested by mit this points out both need and concern the need to phase out coal without ccs indicates the potential value of ccs technology that could be used to retrofit existing generation plants extending the life of existing investment and limiting the number of completely new plants that were needed the capital intensity of these technologies are concern as we find that the investment demand needed for such expansions crowds out investment in other areas of the economy and thus increases the welfare cost of the policy67 such retrofitable postcombustion technologies are in development for example an ammoniabased regenerative process for co2 capture from existing coalfired facilities is being developed by powerspan68 called eco2 two commercial demonstrations 125 mw and 120 mw have been announced with projected operations to begin in 2012 and 201169 second chilledammoniabased postcombustion capture process is being developed by alstom in collaboration with

capital investment projected by the models could be significantly misstated effectiveness of research development demonstration and deployment efforts one factor that will determine the availability of emerging and future technology is research development demonstration and deployment funding the potential for such subsidies to accelerate deployment is suggested by the previous discussion of ccs

discussed later in addition nmacra states that s 2191 deployment subsidies would be fully utilized by cras projected technology investments nmacra does not state whether they assumed that the technology subsidies had any effect on deployment schedules or amounts basic question about s 2191 technology development funding is how much is enough the amount provided by the bill dwarfs current

above in table 13 and table 14 combined roughly 2 billion annually several organizations including epri and the pew center for global climate change have called for at least doubling of does current funding of advanced coal options 2008 funding 438 million74 this is not to say that s 2191s allocations are optimal only that s 2191 funding would appear to fill projected need for public funds to promote technology milestones to encourage the future availability of useful technology at the appropriate time effectiveness of economic and regulatory incentives in addition to the ccs bonus allowance provision s 2191 contains funding for zero or low carbon energy technology advanced coal and sequestration technology fuel from cellulosic biomass advanced technology vehicles such as plugin hybrids and sustainable energy technology including distributed energy systems in addition the bill calls for new appliance and building efficiency standards some of which were included in eisa as discussed earlier as noted earlier the catfnems case attempted to model partially the effect of these incentives through proxies specifically catfnems simulated the incentives for low and carbon power technologies by using production tax credit 74 see john bewick cultivating clean tech new models for energy rdd public utilities fortnightly may 2008 pp 4248 crs53 for ccs and extending the wind production tax credit to 2030 catfnems also used eias best available technology case as proxy for the appliance and building standards included in the bill the results are some of the lowest overall cost estimates of any of the cases along with substantial development of coalfired ccs nuclear power and renewables other innovative approaches were taken by eianems to attempt to mimic the impact of energy efficiency incentives by reducing the incremental cost of the most energyefficient residential appliances by half simulating rebate for buying more efficient appliances likewise eianems mimicked the incentives for stronger building codes by tightening the residential codes in the model by 30 in 2015 and 50 in 2025 compared with basecase levels these proxies come in addition to the eisa provisions that are contained in the preliminary aeo 2008 basecase used by eianems the proxies contribute to some of the lowest cost estimates of any of the cases the only other model to incorporate these initiatives was mnacra which incorporated the preliminary aeo 2008 baseline that includes the eisa provisions however the nmacra results do not separate out the efficiency standards from the new corporate average fuel economy cafe or renewable fuel standard rfs requirements see next section on transportation sector transportation sector the transportation sector presents particular problems for capandtrade system first the sheer number of motorized and aviation vehicles effectively necessitates an upstream regulation of transportation fuels it would be impracticable to place emissions monitors on the hundreds of millions of cars trucks motorcycles offroad vehicles boats trains and aircraft in the united states75 likewise requiring each motorist to submit allowances for his or her fossil fuel use would greatly increase the administrative costs of an emission reduction program therefore any regulation of transportation especially motor vehicles would likely occur upstream of the emitting source as is the case with s 2191 emissions reductions from transportation generally must come in one of three ways 1 reduce fuel consumption through more efficient vehicles or through reduction in vehicle miles traveled eg mass transit carpooling etc 2 reduce the carbon content of transportation fuels through the blending of lowercarbon fuels in conventional fuels 3 switch from conventional fuels to alternatives with lower lifecycle emissions current federal policy attempts to address numbers 1 and 2 the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standards as amended by eisa require increasing fuel economy for new passenger cars and light trucks76 the renewable fuel standard rfs also amended by eisa requires an increasing amount of renewable 75 the european union has proposed downstream reduction program for the aviation industry whereby airlines would need to submit allowances to cover their own emissions however the number of aircraft is considerably smaller than the number of passenger and freight vehicles in either the eu or the united states 76 for more information on cafe see crs report rl33413 automobile and light truck fuel economy the cafe standards by brent d yacobucci and robert bamberger crs54 transportation fuel and that an increasing share of that fuel have lower greenhouse gas emissions77 both of these programs should help reduce the number of allowances needed by the petroleum industry by reducing the amount of fuel consumed and the carbon content of the fuel supplied the capandtrade restrictions on petroleum would most likely be felt by transportation users through higher prices users would receive the price signal and decide whether to invest in new capital eg purchase new car use less fuel and drive less or change fuels if possible low carbon fuel standard one key feature of s 2191 and its impact on the transportation sector is the low carbon fuel standard lcfs in section 11003 the lcfs requires 5 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels from 2008 levels by 2015 and 10 reduction from 2008 by 2020 this is similar to the proposed low carbon fuel standard established in california by governor arnold schwarzenegger78 major question on the effects of the lcfs is the definition of transportation fuel in discussions over the california program most stakeholders including california air resources board staff argued that aviation fuel and bunker fuel should not be included in the standard79 simply put the more fuels included in the program and the greater the volume that must be displaced the more stringent the standard becomes this is especially true for aviation fuel since there are currently few or options to reduce jet fuel lifecycle greenhouse gases80 therefore the more jet fuel included in the program the greater the reductions necessary from other fuels for example eia projects 1579 million barrels per day of transportation fuel demand in 2020 or roughly 240 billion gallons annually81 to meet 10 reduction requirement 24 billion gallons of zerocarbon fuel would be needed assuming equivalent energy content per gallon however many lowcarbon fuels have less energy per gallon than petroleum fuels and all have some associated carbon emissions if cellulosic ethanol is found to have 90 reduction in lifecycle emissions and the fuel has 23 the energy content of gasoline then roughly 40 billion gallons would be required this is considerably more than the existing rfs mandate 77 for more information on the rfs see crs report rl33290 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci 78 governor arnold schwarzenegger executive order s0107 the low carbon fuel standard january 18 2007 79 see the california air resources board page on the lcfs httpwwwarbcagov fuelslcfslcfshtm 80 further epa currently does not have the authority to regulate aviation fuels under the clean air act that authority rests with the federal aviation administration since this provision would amend the clean air act epa may not have the authority to include aviation fuel in the definition of transportation fuel 81 eia annual energy outlook table 11 crs55 of 30 billion gallons of renewable fuels82 in the same year if however only motor gasoline and diesel fuel are considered then the total volume is reduced to 1347 million barrels per day or 206 billion gallons annually the equivalent amount of cellulosic ethanol required would be roughly 35 billion gallons still significant target the assumptions for the amount of lowcarbon fuel available the expected emission reductions for that fuel and the total amount of fuel subject to the requirements would significantly affect the costs and feasibility of the lcfs program the way the provisions are written in s 2191 the lcfs program is separate from the capandtrade program and there is way to purchase credits or offsets from other sectors if the necessary amount of lowcarbon fuel is not available then under the program fuel providers must reduce the amount of fuel they sell or pay civil penalties in its analysis of s 2191 nmacra states that in 2015 the lcfs can only be met by decrease in gasoline consumption to allow the limited supplies of low carbon biofuel to meet the averaging requirements of the standard83 further the model estimates that because of the decrease in supply motor fuel prices increase 140 in 2015 over the baseline case84 the nmacra analysis suggests that if the lcfs is construed to include all ground transportation fuels without exception then it may be difficult to achieve it without reducing fuel demand depending on the design of the program and what fuels are included the effects on fuel supply and prices could be dramatic however if plugin hybrid vehicles or large amounts of cellulosic biofuel are available earlier than expected or if certain fuels such as aviation fuel and nonroad fuels are excluded from the mandate the costs could be lower impact on fuel prices given the divergent projections by the various cases about future electric generating capacity illustrated in tables 11 and 12 and with the exception of nmacra detailed modeling of the transport sector it is not surprising that their estimates of the fuel price impacts of s 2191 vary widely also perhaps more than any other results the cases were very selective in terms of the results they chose to highlight in their studies and how they chose to present them hence crs highlighted general themes coming out of the cases to focus on the insights this wide variety of assumptions and calculations has to offer further discussion of the impact of energy costs on households and energyintensive industries is presented later natural gas prices some of the most confusing results presented by the cases are for natural price prices besides different baselines indices and target 82 it should be noted however that the rfs mandates only require 15 billion gallons of advanced biofuel with 50 reduction in lifecycle emissions as opposed to the 90 reduction in the example the remaining 15 billion gallons of the rfs mandate are not required to have any emissions reductions 83 cra international economic analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 using cras mrnneem model april 8 2008 p 29 84 ibid p 22 crs56 categories eg utility industrial residential average some prices presented include allowance costs while others do not likewise some cases include the free allowance allocations provided under s 2191 others do not in general the cge models present natural gas prices without the added cost of allowances nems cases present natural gas prices that include allowance costs in general the incremental impact of s 2191 on natural gas prices depends on the degree to which natural gasfired generation is used to back out existing coal fired capacity and to meet future demand as discussed above the cases fall into three categories with respect to future natural gasfired generation 1 little or increased generation 2 modest increased generation or 3 substantial increased generation of the three cases included in the first category the epaadageref and epaadagetech cases project declining natural gas prices that do not include any allowance costs this compares with the catfnems case that projects natural gas prices increasing only 3 in 2030 over baseline levels with allowance costs included the potential modest impact on natural gas prices would be consistent with future generation mix that is not heavily reliant on natural gas the three cases that project some additional natural gasfired capacity miteppa eianems and nmacra vary in their results for the two cases that do not include allowance costs the miteppa case projects substantial decline in natural gas prices through 2050 while nmacra projects wellhead natural gas prices increasing over basecase levels about 20 by 2020 then declining to increase by 2035 and declining steadily afterwards to about 25 below baseline projections by 2050 for delivered natural gas nmanems projects prices with allowance costs at about 20 above basecase levels around 2025 and accelerating rapidly after 2040 for the eianems case that includes allowance costs prices for natural gas delivered to electric generators are projected to increase about 23 in 2020 and 40 in 2030 the price for natural gas delivered to residential consumers increases about 14 in 2020 increasing to 26 in 2030 compared with basecase in contrast to the cases above the two accfnamnems cases which project substantial increases in natural gasfired capacity estimate natural gas prices with allowance costs increasing 108 low case and 146 high case by 2030 for both residential and industrial consumers this result is consistent with the assumptions used by accfnam in its analysis as identified in tables 7 8 and 11 petroleum prices with the exception of nmacra the cases examined here do not model the transportation sector in detailed manner as noted in the transportation sector discussion perhaps the most important impact on petroleum prices under s 2191 may come from the low carbon fuels standard lcfs at least in the short term for the cases that did not model the lcfs three cases the two epaadage cases and the miteppa case project either modest increases or declines in petroleum prices compared with basecase projections substantial decline in the case of miteppa these models are all global in scope with the petroleum price reflective of what they see as occurring in the international oil market and do not include the increased cost of carbon allowances the other four cases the two accfnamnems cases eianems and catfnems focus on gasoline prices and the price increases from the allowance crs57 requirement the catfnems case estimates gasoline price increases reaching about quarter 025 per gallon by 2030 while eianems estimates 2020 gasoline price increase of about 022 per gallon and 2030 price increase of about 040 per gallon eianems also provides estimates for other transportation fuels including diesel and jet fuel the two accfnamnems cases project more dramatic gasoline price increases of about 325 high case and about 170 low case per gallon by 2030 2005 electricity prices electricity price calculations by the various cases include allowance prices however like the presentation of natural gas prices the cases use confusing array of different baselines indices values and target categories residential industrial average etc this can lead to some misleading conclusions when comparing different cases for example the miteppa case estimates 2030 electricity prices under s 2191 at 57 above 2005 prices compared with epaadagerefs 2030 estimate under s 2191 of 29 above 2005 prices however reflecting the critical role of basecase assumptions the miteppa basecase 2030 electricity price estimate is 39 above 2005 prices thus the incremental difference between the basecase and the s 2191 estimate is 18 percentage points in contrast the epaadageref basecase 2030 electricity price estimate is an 11 decline below 2005 prices thus the incremental difference between the basecase and the s 2191 estimate is 40 percentage points the only metric for which the cases provided sufficient data was percentage increases from basecase levels for the epaadage cases the basecase assumes decline in electricity prices from 2005 levels in 2030 1115 this compares with 29 increase in basecase prices for miteppa 56 increase for the eianems nmacra and accfnamnems cases and 05 decline for catfnems relative to 2005 prices it should be noted that several cases do not state precisely what the 2005 electricity prices refers to residential industrial all users or something else85 relative to their respective baselines three cases estimate electricity price increases under 15 catfnems eianems and miteppa and three cases estimate price increases between 3545 the two epaadage cases and the nmacra case in contrast the two accfnamnems cases project prices substantially higher 101 low case and 129 high case in 2030 85 electricity prices vary substantially by sector and region for example in 2006 eia reports residential rates of 3052 per million btu compared with industrial rates of 1797 2006 crs58 economic issues availability of offsets along with technology development the availability and price of offsets is one of the critical factors determining the costs of s 2191 particularly in the short to midterm as noted by eia the highest prices in the first 5 years of the capandtrade program occur when international offsets are not assumed to be available86 as stated more forcefully by epa from the various scenarios analyzed the use or limitation of offsets and international credits has larger impact on allowance prices than the modeled availability or constraint of key enabling technologies87 however this conclusion is not obvious from first read of the cases in its heavily constrained cases accfnamnems notes that the purchase of relatively inexpensive offsets significantly constrains allowance prices until the early 2020s when the available offsets run up against the limits contained in the bill or in the models assumptions88 in contrast the nmacra finds such relief stating that since the limit on domestic offsets is projected not to be reached until after 2025 allowing greater use of domestic offsets does not reduce near term costs89 obviously there is significant disagreement on the availability and costeffectiveness of domestic and international offsets90 critical factor in this uncertain situation is the availability of international credits the epaadage epaigem and eianems cases assume the availability of substantial international credits at reasonable prices sensitivity analysis by epa indicates that if domestic and international credit availability were unlimited 2050 allowance prices would fall by 71 it should be noted that subject to changes in the international framework for international

the kyoto protocol it is not eligible to continued crs59 via substitutions of cdmstyle credits for eligible allowances such as those used by the euets by other controlled countries and then sold to us companies the epaadage epaigem and eianems cases assume this interpretation of section 2502 of course given the long time frame of s 2191 projecting the availability and prices of international credits is an uncertain business for example the european commission ec has not decided on the status of credits from the clean development mechanism cdm for the postkyoto period given the indirect arrangement necessary for those credits to impact s 2191 compliance costs this uncertainty can not be readily resolved nmacra disagrees that substantial international credits would be available at reasonable prices nmacra argues that since the countries involved must have programs of comparable stringency the allowance prices are likely to be similar to us prices and excludes them from its analysis as suggested by sensitivity analysis conducted by epa eia and mit restrictions on international credits substantially increase the cost of s 2191 eia estimates that the unavailability of international credits would increase allowance prices 39 in 2030 for 2050 mit estimates an allowance price increase of 15 while epa projects that increase at 34 the impact of domestic offsets in reducing costs is projected to be less dramatic than for international credits although the incentives available for domestic offsets could alter this epa sensitivity analysis indicates that unlimited domestic offsets would reduce allowance prices by 26 p 692 impact of banking experience with the acid rain program strongly indicates that participants bank allowances in the face of price uncertainty in the case of greenhouse gas reductions the availability of offsets and international credits also interacts with the banking provisions as noted earlier the accfnamnems cases do not include banking this fact helps explain their dramatically increasing allowance prices all other cases include banking the models suggest two important results from banking first as noted earlier banking has flattening effect on allowance prices as participants buy more than they need early raising prices and use them later lowering prices from the levels they would be otherwise second and perhaps more critically banking allows participants more control over the scheduling of reduction efforts given the pivotal nature of technology development to the ultimate success of any greenhouse gas reduction program the ability to delay making major capital investments is very important in the epaadage and epaigem cases entities bank allowances until around 2030 depending on the scenario this is possible

proxy to reflect allowance needs in the post2030 period eianems does not project beyond 2030 impact of carbon market efficiency board the models generally do not consider the carbon market efficiency board established by title i subtitle f however one can infer from the models results that the most important power that the board may have is the ability to increase the availability of domestic offsets and international credits as noted increasing the availability of domestic offsets and international credits could have significant effect on overall costs if the board chose to loosen the limitation on offset and international credit availability the cost reductions could be substantial as indicated by the epa cases in addition if the board determined that technology development was not occurring on schedule and causing volatility in the allowance markets loosening constraints on offsets and international credits could allow covered entities to bank more allowing more time for technology development if necessary however the board is primarily designed to deal with shortterm volatility due to episodic events in the allowance market and has only shortterm powers whether it could coordinate longer term strategy if necessary with its proposed authority is not known impact of revenue recycling as indicated in the auction revenue estimates section s 2191 could redirect hundreds of billions of dollars annually through the economy only the nmacra case states it captured the effects of this redirection the other models generally assume the effect on the economy is similar to lumpsum adjustment to taxes designed to keep s 2191 deficit and revenue neutral international leakage international leakage is the shift in ghg emissions from country subject to regulation eg capandtrade program to an unregulated country so reduction benefits are not obtained this would happen for example if ghg emitting industry moved from country with an emissions cap to country without cap only the epaadage cases looked at the international trade aspect of title vi of s 2191 epas sensitivity analysis indicates that if countries without legally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gases commit to maintaining their 2015 levels beginning in the year 2025 and to returning their emissions to 2000 levels by 2050 international emission leakage occurs p 82 imports of energy intensive goods are projected to fall under this scenario while exports expand as developing countries cope with their new emission limits in worst case scenario epas sensitivity analysis looked at nointernational actionsto2050 scenario in this scenario the international reserve allowance provisions of title vi are assumed to be triggered because of the lack of international action emissions from countries without legally binding commitments are estimated to rise by 350 million co2e by 2030 and 385 million by 2050 less than 1 of their basecase levels under adage it would be equivalent to us emission leakage rates of approximately 11 in 2030 and 8 in 2050 these emissions compare with crs61 increases of 361 million and 412 million for 2030 and 2050 respectively if title vi is not implemented epa describes the impact of title vi on leakage as minimal93 the impact on imports is more significant without the international reserve allowance requirement imports from countries without legally binding commitments are projected to increase 54 in 2030 rising to 7 in 2050 in contrast under title vi imports are estimated to increase about 1 in 2030 and decline about 5 in 2050 us exports decline in both cases as countries use more of their domestic manufacturing p 85 if the epa projections are reasonable the differential effect of title vi on trade versus emissions leakage could present problems if the title is brought before the world trade organization wto94 ecological issues climate change benefits none of the cases examined here attempt to quantify or monetize the benefits of reducing greenhouse gases indeed with the exception of mits overall study of capandtrade proposals the environmental benefits of reducing greenhouse gases are generally not discussed95 this hole in reports designed to discuss the impacts of s 2191 is not surprising like the cost estimates discussed above benefit estimates are fraught with uncertainty thus this discussion should be considered illustrative more research and resources devoted to benefits analysis are necessary before more comprehensive reports will be available monetizing benefits some illustrations monetizing benefits from reducing air pollutants has been attempted for decades for example during the debate in the 1980s on controlling sulfur dioxide epa conducted an illustrative analysis of the health benefits of promulgating 1hour sulfur dioxide national ambient air quality standard naaqs as part of its regulatory impact analysis ria96 based on partial analysis of health impacts epas illustrative

park 1987 appendix b crs62 partial estimate of welfare benefits from reducing sulfur dioxide that exceeded 4 billion 1985 annually97 because climate change is global problem monetizing benefits from reducing greenhouse gases is difficult indeed some consider the effort impossible bordering on the unethical the complexity of the global response is magnified by the need to value benefits that accumulate over 100 years or more discount rates economics approach to valuing time used in attempts to value longterm damage from climate change range from 0 to 45 in the literature98 indeed the effect of discounting is so great on longterm marginal damage estimate of climate change that using standard assumptions about discounting ie 45 and aggregation the marginal damage costs of carbon dioxide emissions are unlikely to exceed 50 tc 14 tco2 and probably much smaller99 indeed estimates of the social cost of carbon scc the marginal damage resulting from the addition of one more ton of co2 span over three orders of magnitude from zero to over 500 ton100 however most current attempts to monetize environmental benefits are incomplete the matrix presented in table 15 illustrates the problem most studies that attempt to monetize benefits focus on the market impact of predictable average changes in climate the easiest to measure box of table 15 only few attempt to value nonmarket impacts or extreme events and fewer still consider catastrophes or socially contingent impacts101 in reviewing 28 studies the uk government had analyzed in reexamining its estimate of an appropriate social cost of carbon ackerman and stanton observed that is all of the studies that estimate the social cost of carbon base their numbers on an incomplete picture of climate risks often encompassing only the simplest and most predictable corner of the vast troubling canvas that has been painted by climate science there is of course way to assign monetary values to the global response to the possibility of widespread droughts across large parts of asia or an increase in the probability of sudden change in ocean currents that would make the uk as cold as canada but in the understandable absence of such impossible monetary values it is important to remember the disclaimer from the defra department for environment food rural affairs review all estimates of the scc social cost of carbon

government attempt to put price on climate change the uk house of commons select committee on environmental audit stated furthermore given the inherent difficulties in putting price on climate change the governments first priority in deciding on the merits of potential policies and construction projects ought to be deciding how they affect uk carbon budgets and only secondly on what the monetary value of resulting carbon emissions would be103 102 ibid p 26 103 the united kingdom parliament select committee on environmental audit third continued crs64 besides moral considerations ones valuation of the social cost of carbon is dependent on ones assumptions about the emissions path the world is on104 this is due to the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of ghgs and radiative forcing ie the higher the atmospheric concentration the less the effect of one more ton on warming the relationship between climate change and economic impacts ie the higher the damage the less the effect of one more ton on that damage and discounting impacts occurring earlier are valued more than impacts occurring later105 this phenomenon is illustrated in the stern review on the economics of stabilizing climate change106 as shown in table 16 the scc declines as the path of emissions is projected to result in less severe damages such estimates would increase over time as the damage got closer and closer table 16 the stern review estimates of social cost of carbon for three emissions paths social cost of carbon stabilization scenario per metric ton 2005 businessasusual

is shadow price of about 43 ton in 2012 2005 rising 2 annually thereafter in real terms using this shadow price of carbon and the uk green book discount rates of 35 for the first 30 years and 30

case estimates the net present value of the total cost of s 2191 presumably not including general equilibrium effects of about 45 trillion 2005 p 18 nmacra did not disclose the discount rate used in making this estimate not surprisingly the estimates illustrated here have been criticized by some including the uk parliament for being too low and incomplete likewise others have criticized the estimates as too large and inflated for example in its recent assessment of new average fuel economy standards the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa chose to value carbon reductions at 7 ton and employ 7 discount rate108 applied to the reduction estimated under s 2191 the resulting npv would be about one order of magnitude lower than the uk shadow pricebased estimates thus reminiscent of epas illustrative calculation of the health benefits of 1hour sulfur dioxide standard the illustration here results in range of climaterelated benefits from reducing greenhouse gases under s 2191 at between zero and 200260 billion annually 2005109 as illustrated with the longterm cost estimates presented in this report attempts to monetize climaterelated benefits currently reflect much about the philosophies and assumptions of the people doing the estimating as stated in the stern review it is very important to stress that such estimates npv of climate change policy 108

years 20112015 notice of proposed rulemaking april 2008 pp 216222 109 zero or nearzero estimate could result from one of three lines of thought 1 denial that climate change is occurring 2 belief that the potential benefits of warmer climate cancel out the damages from that change or 3 the damages will not be great at least for the united states and are far in the future justifying low damage evaluation and high discount rate it appears that nhtsa employed the final line of thought in its proposed rulemaking as stated by nhtsa although estimates of benefits to the us itself that are likely to result from reducing co2 emissions are currently available nhtsa expects that if such values were developed the agency would employ those rather than global benefit estimates in its analysis nhtsa also anticipates that if such values were developed they would be lower than comparable global values since the us is likely to sustain only fraction of total global damages resulting from climate change department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration average fuel economy standards passengers and light trucks model years 20112015 notice of proposed rulemaking april 2008 p 220 crs66 benefits reflect large number of underlying assumptions many of which are very tentative or specific to the ethical perspectives adopted110 putting emission reductions under s 2191 into context it is difficult to put the actions of one countrys emissions reduction plan in the context of fragmented global effort to address climate change one useful perspective is provided by mits general study of cap and trade bills111 using the mit integrated global system model igsm mit explored the climate response to different stabilization goals being discussed in the international community it developed parameterizations of igsm that represented each of three major atmosphereocean general circulation models ao gcms that would help illustrate the uncertainty in translating emission trends into an estimate of climate change those of the goddard institute for space studies cisssb the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl21 and the national center for atmospheric research ccsm3 mit simulated the climate effects of six different policy scenarios through 2100 four of these are of interest in exploring s 2191 1 reference scenario that assumes specific global climate policy reference 2 global participation scenario global participation 203 bmt case 3 global participation scenario where abatement efforts in developing countries are delayed until 2050 developing countries delayed and 4 partial participation scenario where abatement efforts occur in developing countries developed only under scenarios 2 3 and 4 developed countries including the united states are assumed to have reduced emissions by 50 below 1990 levels by 2050 and held them there through 2100 this assumption is in the ballpark of us reductions anticipated under s 2191 for developing countries scenario 2 assumes their emissions reductions begin in 2025 with emissions returning to their 2015 levels and with additional reductions beginning in 2035 with emissions returning to their 2000 levels and are held there scenario 3 assumes emissions reductions are delayed until 2050 at which point they return to 2000 levels and scenario 4 assumes developing country emissions are not stabilized at all the climate effects of these scenarios as simulated by mit igsm replication of the three ao gcms identified above is shown in figure 11 as indicated by the red line the impact of s 2191 combined with that of the other developed countries all of which have ratified the kyoto protocol is to reduce by 05 degrees c the projected 35 degrees c to 45 degrees c increase in global mean temperatures suggested by the simulations if the united states chose not to reduce the impact would be to move the red green and blue lines closer to the reference case line with respect to the red line it should be noted that in 2000 the united states greenhouse gas emissions were about 40 of the developed worlds total emissions in terms of the effect of any us reductions on global mean temperatures that is about all that can be said in isolation as noted by mit 110 sir nicholas stern the economics of climate change the stern review 2006 p 304 111 sergey paltsev et assessment of us capandtrade proposals mit joint program on the science and policy of global change report 146 april 2007 readers are urged to consult the report for details on the analysis discussed here crs67 it is not possible to connect specific us policy targets with particular global concentration or temperature target and therefore the avoided damages because any climate gains depend on efforts in the rest of the world if cooperative solution is at all possible therefore major strategic consideration in setting us policy targets should be their value in leading other major countries to take on similar efforts112 instead s 2191s climaterelated environmental benefit must be considered in global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort it is in this context that the united states and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases when they ratified the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc this global context raises two issues for s 2191 1 whether s 2191s greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely and 2 whether s 2191s reductions meet us commitments to stabilization under the unfccc and occur in timely fashion so that global stabilization may occur at an acceptable level 112 ibid p 55 crs68 figure 11 global mean

benefits as noted earlier only the epaipm study included any estimates of emission reductions from nongreenhouse gas air pollutants only two pollutants were analyzed and the resulting estimates reflect shortterm interactions between s 2191 and existing cap and trade programs however it should be noted that values have been assigned to these pollutants from time to time for example in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the new average fuel economy standard the department of transportation assigned emission damage costs of 3900 short ton for nitrogen oxides 16000 short ton for sulfur dioxide and 164000 short ton for particulate matter all pollutants that are also emitted from coalfired generating facilities113 this is an incomplete set of pollutants that would be reduced by s 2191 other benefits may occur from reductions of pollutants such as mercury and carbon monoxide impact on behavior the impact of any price increases from s 2191 on households industries and businesses would depend on their responsiveness to the price signal the distribution of safety net funds under s 2191 and the impact of various other provisions of the bill that encourage or could be used to encourage conservation and new technology development simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism114 for at least two reasons first baseline forecasts are even less accurate at sector level than they are at an aggregate national level as noted by winebrake and sakva sector level baseline forecasts have significantly higher errors compared with aggregate estimates nor have sector estimates improved over the past two decades we find that low errors for total energy consumption are concealing much larger sectoral errors that cancel each other out when aggregated for example 5year forecasts made between 1982 and 1998 demonstrate mean percentage error for total energy consumption of 01 yet this hides the fact that the industrial sector was overestimated by an average of 59 and the transportation sector was underestimated by an average of 45 we also find evidence that forecasts within each sector have improved over the two decades studied here115 second particularly with respect to industry the effect of s 2191 is likely to be very sitespecific particularly as the primary impact will be indirect in terms of added energy costs not direct compliance costs an industrybyindustry approach masks the interplay of companies that would be affected differently by s 2191 most industries face competitive market sometimes international in scope both in terms of producers of the same products and producers of substitute products 113 department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration average fuel economy standards passengers and light trucks model years 20112015 notice of proposed rulemaking april 2008 p 182 114 as noted by crs with respect to acid rain costs estimates in 1990 see crs report 90 63 acid rain control an analysis of title iv of s 1630 by larry parker available from the author 115 james j winebrake and denys sakva an evaluation of errors in us energy forecasts 19822003 energy policy 34 2006 p 3475 crs70 also in some cases an industry may face fairly elastic demand for its product thus most industries are price sensitive and therefore any increase in manufacturing costs hurts the competitiveness of firm this complex situation is further complicated for energyintensive industries in the case of s 2191 as competitors within the same industry may experience different energy price increases particularly for electric power depending on their individual energy needs and power arrangements thus individual facilities within the same industry will be affected differently by s 2191 and other unforeseen events in the future for example an aluminum plant receiving power from hydroelectric facility may not be affected the same way as similar plant with power contract with coalfired power supplier this differential effect on individual companies under s 2191 could have several potential impacts first as noted above it may affect the competitive balance of specific facilities in the united states second investment decisions by industries could be affected particularly with respect to technology new more efficient technology is emerging for some processes the combination of current price signals being sent from the energy markets and potential ones from s 2191 could speed their development if commercialized new technology would reduce the impact of s 2191 and indeed improve competitiveness not surprisingly none of the cases presented here have sufficient industry sector detail to examine this possibility nor did any attempt to develop proxies to explore the possibilities for industrial technology over the next 40 years s 2191 attempts to ameliorate these effects somewhat by providing subsidy for such industries facing international competitiveness issues the degree to which the subsidy could address the issue was not examined by any of the cases presented here likewise the sufficiency of the funds was not examined interestingly such an approach to exposed industry has some parallels to recommendations that have been made with respect to carbon intensive industries in europe facing reduction requirements and increased fuel cost from the eus kyoto protocol and postkyoto commitments for example one such recommendation by the uk carbon trust suggested the following for very small number of carbonintensive internationally exposed activities headed by steel and cement production governments should establish transitional compensating rate of free allocation on an activityspecific basis based upon the likely degree of cost passthrough given international trade conditions the scale of free allocation to electricityintensive activities in the euets notably pulp and paper should also take account of their electricity consumption whilst manufacturing of fertilisers and basic chemicals might benefit from being brought into the euets on similar basis together with aluminium smelting these constitute four tradeexposed electricityintensive activities for which additional measures linked to redistribution of auction revenues or equivalent downstream allocation of electricityrelated allowances could be considered however focused measures to facilitate direct longterm crs71 investment in low carbon electricity generation may offer the best longterm solution116 for households the interplay of price signals conservation and regulations is difficult to separate in the cge models such as adage igem and eppa nems does break down the residential sector into both residential energy consumption and residential prices by fuel however any estimates from such breakdown can only be considered illustrative at best for example the catfnems analysis illustrates that if s 2191 results in only moderate increase in electricity and natural gas prices then households could on average respond with sufficient conservation and efficiency improvements to overcome the projected price increases and reduce their monthly bill compared with business as usual levels if allowance prices are higher this become more difficult an effort by keohane and goldmark to estimate the monthly increase in residential electric bills based on miteppas higher allowance prices resulted in 6 increase in those bills in 2030117 impacts on residential monthly natural gas bills would follow similar pattern the catfnems analysis indicates that an aggressive demand response by consumers almost eliminates the projected modest increase in natural gas prices in contrast keohane and goldmark calculations based on the higher allowance prices of the miteppa analysis result in 14 increase in monthly natural gas prices in 2030118 as with the energyintensive industries discussed above s 2191 attempts to ameliorate the impact of projected energy price increases for low and middleincome households by providing funds for states to provide electricity and natural gas impact assistance the eianems analysis breaks out the estimated impact of the electricity impact assistance funds in its calculation of household impacts assuming the value of the allowances allocated would be passed on to all consumers not just lowincome eianems estimates the reduction at onehalf cent per kilowatthour kwh or about 5 reduction in rates if the money were directed toward low income consumers the impact would be greater including the effects of the impact assistance eianems estimates the average monthly household energy bill excluding transportation under s 2191 would increase about 3 month in 2020 rising to about 6 month in 2030 overall eianems estimates that the consumer price index cpi for energy in 2030 would be 18 higher for residential consumers and 29 higher for industrial consumers than basecase levels to put these potential increased costs into context eianems compared its estimated incremental consumer and industrial energy prices increases under s 2191 with those of the past 5 years as indicated in

assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic and other unforeseen events such as technological breakthroughs loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled hence longterm cost projections are at best speculative and should be viewed with attentive skepticism in the words of the late dr lincoln 119 eia energy market and economic impacts of s 2191

the future but they can indicate the sensitivity of programs provisions to varying economic technological and behavioral assumptions that may assist policymakers in designing greenhouse gas reduction strategy the various cases examined here do provide some important insights on the costs and benefits of s 2191 and its many provisions first if enacted the ultimate cost of s 2191 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill the bill provides numerous price research and development deployment and regulatory incentives for technology innovation the potential for new technology to reduce the costs of s 2191 is not fully analyzed by any of the cases examined nor can it be the process of technology development and dissemination is not sufficiently understood at the current time for models to replicate with any longterm confidence in the same vein it is difficult to determine whether the various incentives provided by s 2191 are directed in the most optimal manner second in some ways the interplay between nuclear power renewables natural gas and coalfired capacity with ccs among the cases is proxy for the need for lowcarbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid to long term considerable amount of lowcarbon generation will have to be built under s 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement the cases presented here do not agree on the amount of new generating capacity necessary under s 2191 or the mix of fuels and technologies that would be employed the estimated amount of capacity constructed depends on the cases assumptions about the need for new capacity and replacementretirement of existing capacity under s 2191 along with consumer demand response to the rising prices and incentives contained in s 2191 third the cases suggest that the ccs bonus allowance allocation under s 2191 is effective in encouraging deployment of ccs accelerating development by 510 years however the cases disagree on whether the bonus amount provided by s 2191 is sufficient or needs to be extended additional years fourth the cases generally indicate that offsets could be valuable tool for covered entities not only to potentially reduce costs but perhaps more importantly to buy time to further develop new more efficient technologies the availability of offsets could be complemented by the bills provisions permitting banking allowing companies more time to develop longterm investment and strategic plans and to pursue technology development cost could be lowered further by allowing greater availability of offsets and international credits and with broader definition of eligible international credits more direct path for permitting international credits from mechanisms such as the cdm would also reduce one of the more important cost uncertainties revealed by the cases varying interpretations of international credit eligibility requirements and their projected price 120 lincoln moses administrator energy information administration annual report to congress 1977 volume 2 1978 crs74 fifth the carbon market efficiency board could have an important effect on the cost of the program through its power to increase the availability of offsets and international credits the cases generally do not consider the board in their analyses however one can infer from the cases results that the most important power that the board may have is the ability to increase the availability of domestic offsets and international credits although not the authority to change the eligibility requirements for domestic offsets and international credits in this sense the boards powers could mesh with the previous insight about the importance of offsets and banking to the costeffectiveness of s 2191 however the board is primarily designed to deal with shortterm volatility due to episodic events in the allowance market and has only shortterm powers whether it could coordinate longer term strategy if necessary with its proposed authority is not known sixth the low carbon fuel standard could significantly raise fuel prices and limit supply the effects will depend on what fuels are included in the lcfs the level of emissions reductions achieved by alternatives and the ability of suppliers to produce those alternatives if plugin hybrid vehicles or large amounts of cellulosic biofuel are available early or if certain fuels such as aviation fuel are excluded from the mandate the costs could be lower only one case provided any analysis of the lcfs seventh s 2191s climaterelated environmental benefit is best considered in global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort it is in this context that the united states and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases when they ratified the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc this global scope raises two issues for s 2191 1 whether s 2191s greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely and 2 whether s 2191s reductions meet us commitments to stabilization under the unfccc and occur in timely fashion so that global stabilization may occur at an acceptable level for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489
