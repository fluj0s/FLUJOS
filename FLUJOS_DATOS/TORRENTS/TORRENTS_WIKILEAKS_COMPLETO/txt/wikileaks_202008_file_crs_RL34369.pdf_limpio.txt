due process claims appear less relevant to the question the report considers the test court would likely use in assessing whether federal foreclosure moratorium would oﬀend the takings clause while pointing out that courts could apply diﬀerent test in this situation it also suggests that courts analyses could vary according to whether they focus on the impact that foreclosure moratorium has on whole mbs trusts or speciﬁc investment tranches of those trusts where the focus is on tranches of mortgagebacked securitized trusts federal foreclosure moratorium in minority of cases potentially could be considered taking requiring just compensation for the purpose of the fifth amendment such ﬁnding would be even less likely where the focus is on the impact to whole

summary the us housing market began to slow in early 2006 this downturn has likely played role in the rise of late mortgage payments and foreclos ures occurring across the country over the past year many belie ve that the problem will get worse the joint economic committee estimates that around 2 million foreclosures of subprime mortgages will occur from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 as way to slow the decline some in congress have suggested passing legislation that would impose temporar nationwide moratorium on foreclosures in order to give mortgage market participants such as borrowers servicers lenders and investors time to refinance or otherwise adjust the mortgage terms of borrowers who would not likely be able to keep up with their scheduled payments such measure would

the number of likely successful claims and the overall potential liability of the federal government for those claims and the litigation costs of unsuccessful claims are not possible to assess at least within the scope of this report3 legislative authority to pass foreclosure moratorium the constitutionality of legislation that imposes foreclosure moratorium may be affected by the context in which it is raised and by extension the authority by which congress passes such statute for example piece of legislation providing general regulatory reform of the housing finance market is more likely to fall under congresss commerce clause authority whereas legislation that is more tailored to asset allocation between debtor and her creditors is more likely to be considered an extension of congresss bankruptcy clause authority the parame ters of congresss authority pursuant to these two clauses are addressed in turn the constitution grants congress vast authority to enact laws involving interstate commerce article i 8 clause 3 of the us constitution states congress shall have the power to regu late commerce with foreign nations and among the several states commer ce among the several states must by necessity include commerce between the states4 the power extends beyond the borders of individual states because it woul d not be possible for congress to regulate commerce that takes place exclusively on states borders while there was time when the courts interpreted the commerce clause more restrictively the melding of 50 different economies into si ngle national economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs3 5 new york v united states 505 us 144 158 1992 the volume of interstate commerce and the range of commonly accepted objects of government regulation have expanded considerably in the last 200 years and the regulatory authority of congress has expanded along with them as interstate commerce has become ubiquitous activities once considered purely local have come to have effects on the national economy and have accordingly come within the scope of congress commerce power 6 united states v morrison 529 us 598 617 2000 united states v lopez 514 us 549 561 1995 the criminal statute by its own terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise and is not an essential part of larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated it cannot therefore be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with commercial transaction which viewed in the aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce 7 id at 55859 citations omitted 8 id at 561 9 quoting id at 549has played significant role in its expansion5 indeed the us supreme court has only twice since the 1930s invalidated fe deral legislation because congress had exceeded its commerce clause power in both of those cases the court held that the statute being challenged was not economic in nature and therefore did not have substantial effect on interstate commerce6 the court has said that statutes that regulate one of three categories of commercial activities are within congressional authority first congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or thin gs in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities finally congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce7 the last of these categories allows courts to examine the cumulative effect of commercial activity on the economy as whole this is the category within which foreclosure moratorium likely would fall while foreclosure law generally has been left to the states foreclosure moratorium designed to reduce the eff ects of slowing national housing market seems to pertain to financial transactions that viewed in the aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce8 even if viewed as entirely intrastate such law also would likely be considered part of larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme c ould be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated due to the fact that the seconda ry market links local real property into national market9 although not beyond debate it seem s likely that court would find statute imposing foreclosure moratorium to be within congress commerce clause authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs4 10 us c onst art i 8 cl 4 one important difference between the commerce clause and the bankruptcy clause is that laws passe d under by the bankruptcy clause must be uniform railway labor executives assn v gibbons 455 us 457 465 1981 the court in gibbons held that bankruptcy statute that pplied to only one debtor was not uniform id at 471 the court also explained the difficulty in distinguishing congressional exerci of power under the commerce clause from an exercise under the bankruptcy clau although we have noted that the subject of bankruptcies is incapable of final definition we have previously defined bankruptcy as the subject of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying or fraudulent debtor and his cred itors extending to his and their relief congress power under the bankruptcy clau contemplates an adjustment of failing debtors obligations this power ex tends to all cases where the law causes to be distributed the property of the btors among his creditors it includes the power to discharge the debtor from his contracts and legal liabilities as well as to distribute this property the grant to congress involves the power to impair the obligation of contracts and this the states were forbidden to do id at 466 internal citations and quotations omitted 11 hanover natl bank v moyses 186 us 181 1938 in re klein 42 us 1 how 277 1843 12 this deference probably would increase the foreseeability of foreclosure moratorium which is important to an analysis under the i mpairment of investmentbacked expectations prong of the takings test that court is likely to apply to the legislation in question for more information on this prong see the impairment of investmentbacked expectations subsection of the application of penn central to foreclosure moratorium section of this report 13 measures such as hr 3609 the emergency home ownership and mortgage equity protection act as it was ordered to be reported favorably by the house judiciary committee likely would be valid extension of congresss authority to pass uniform laws on bankruptcies because those bills seek to am end how certain debts secured by the debtors continuedcongress also has broad authority conc urrent with its authority under the commerce clause to enact uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies10 the supreme court has approved of congresss use of this authority to impair contracts and even to avoid liens11 in fact the modification of c ontract rights is one of the main purposes of bankruptcy for these reas ons if court finds such legislation to be valid extension of congresss bankr uptcy power then that court may provide congress greater deference under takings analysis than it would for legislation passed pursuant to the commerce clause12 whether or not foreclosure morato rium would fall within the bankruptcy clause likely would depend on the scope nd nature of specific proposal as well as congresss intent for its passage the more limited the application of moratorium is to debtors who meet the qua lifications to file for bankruptcy probably the more likely court would find the legislation to be valid extension of bankruptcy power such determination also may be contingent upon courts interpretation of the breadth of cong resss power under the bankruptcy clause which cannot be predicted13 as is discussed below in the overview of takingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs5 13 continued primary residence are dealt with in chapter 13 bankruptcy reorganization plan it is less clear if piece of legislation that places foreclosure moratorium on all mortgages originated nationwide or certain group of mo rtgages that

winstar corp 518 us 839 87576 1996 16 pbgc 467 us at 733clause jurisprudence section of this report there is precedent for the passage of federal foreclosure moratori legislation pursuant to the bankruptcy clause which was deemed compliant with the fifth amendment regardless of which of these two sources of authority are applied the legislative proposal in question would still be subject to certain constituti onal protections such as those provided by the fifth amendmen ts due process and takings clauses contract clause and s ubstantive due process before discussing the relevant portions of the fifth amendment some common misconceptions regarding the contract clause should be addressed article i 10 clause 1 of the us constitution states state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts this clause prohibits state from passing legislation that makes certain changes to the terms of existing contracts in fact the supreme court in home building and loan assoc v blaisdell 14 assessed whether state foreclosure moratorium law violated the contract clause the language of the contract clause is expressly limited to the states additionally the court has held that the principles of the contract clause are not incorporated against the federal government by the fifth am endments due process cause15 the court explained we have never held that the principl embodied in the fifth amendments due process clause are coextensive with provisions existing against state impairments of preexisting contracts rather we have contrasted the limitations imposed on states by the contract clause with the less searching standards imposed on economic legislation by the due process clauses16 therefore the contract clause and by extension blaisdell do not apply to federal legislation federal legislation on the ot her hand is subject to the protections of substantive due process substantive due process p revents government power from being used for purposes of oppression or abuse of government power that shocks the conscience or action that is legally irrational in that it is not sufficiently keyed to anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs6 17 torromeo v town of fremont nh 438 f3d 113 118 1st cir 2006 prior to 2005 there was great deal of confusion among courts in how to properly delineate between takings law and substantive due process analysis which was partially alleviated by the supreme courts 2005 lingle v chevron usa inc decision 544 us 528 2005 see eg agins v city of tiburon 447 us 255 1980 kavanau v santa monica rent control bd 941 p2d 851 cal 1997 while some confusi on remains the court has clarified that substantive due process and takings law address unique concerns 18 see eg eastern enterprises v apfel 524 us 498 1998 19 it also is possible for one to claim an equa l protection clause violation especially if the claimant believes that she was treated unequally see eg village of willowbrook v olech 528 us 562 2000 an equal pr otection clause violation is not likely to result from generally applicable foreclosure moratorium 20 mortgages and the contract rights to mort gagebacked securities investments are private property for the purpose of fi fth amendment protections 21 lingle 544 us at 538 22 id 23 506 us 1003 1992legitimate government purpose17 foreclosure moratorium that is implemented for the purpose of providing lenders and servicers time to initiate loan modifications and loss mitigation in order to strengthen an ailing market would not likely be violative of substantive due process in light of the vast deference courts provide the government in the contex t of economic regulation18 consequently this report focuses on takings law analysis19 overview of takings clause jurisprudence the fifth amendment concludes with th words nor shall private property be taken for public use without just comp ensation the takings clause requires striking balance between the government s public goals and the burdens suffered by private property owners as the government takes measures to meet its goals the courts have recognized relatively few governmental infringements of private citizens property as constitutional takings where outright seizure or permanent physical occupation of the property occurs the infri ngement must rise to certain severity or be of particular kind before courts will say taking has occurred only then must the government provide just compensation to the property owner20 the courts have developed an arra of tests rules and factor s to determine what does and does not constitute taking four types of takings the proper test to appl depends on the type of governmental action involved there are four broad categories of takings recognized by the supreme court21 two of these tests are clearly not applicable to foreclosure moratorium one is landuse exaction taki ng such as mandatory set aside for certain portion of new housing development to be green space22 the other is type of regulatory taking as described in lucas v south carolina coastal council 23 where the government deprives an owner of all economically be neficial use of her property this type of infringement is c onsidered per taking and is commonlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs7 24 lingle 544 us at 538 25 see eg hawkeye commodity promotions inc v vilsack 486 f3d 430 441 8th cir 2007 it appears that lucas total takings test protects real property only unity real estate v hudson 178 f3d 649 674 3rd cir 1999 to date the categorical approach has only been used in real property cases such as lucas v south carolina however at least one federal circuit case has applied total takings analysis to personal property though it did not find taking had occurred maritr ans v united states

agree that lucas total takings only apply to land not personal propert such as contract rights25 foreclosure moratorium could be assesse d pursuant to one of the other two tests one is physical taking or appropriation wher the government requires an owner to suffer permanent physical i nvasion of her property26 the final test is for all regulatory takings other than total takings which are analyzed pursuant to the test originally set out in penn central transp co v city of new york 27 physical takingappropriation vs regulatory taking plaintiffs would likely argue that foreclosure moratorium resulted in permanent physical occupation of their property as these are considered per ta kings warranting just compensation while on the contrary the government would likely argue that foreclosure moratorium should be an alyzed under penn central where the government usually wins one ta kings law commentator explains the courts decisions using per physical taking analysis typically involve physical invasions in the literal sense invasions by aircraft flood waters the boating public government personnel cable boxes and mobilehomepark tenants but in some factual contexts physical and regulatory takings have proved difficult to keep separate the tendency to blur the two is enhan ced by the powerful incentives plaintiffs have to urge physical versus regulatory theory in case first there is the lesser showing needed for plaintiff to win on permanent physical occupation claim second is the extremely narro w range of application for the total taking test leaving the physical occupation rule as the only per rule left to plaintiff in many cases one example of where this line is blurred is where government program causes physical in vasion but affects the property owner in way more or less akin to an appropriation here the takings analysis may go either way regulatory or physical the issue played out at length in cases involving state demands that small interest amounts on lawyers trust accounts be paid to staterun program funding legal services for the poor and was ultimately resolved as physicaltype taking28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs8 29 300 us 440 1937 30 295 us 555 1934 31 see id at 59899 32 id at 58990it is possible that court would consider foreclosure moratorium physical taking or an appropriation of mbs investors rights to the income stream lost due to the moratorium and therefore pe r taking more probable scenario especially in light of the fact that the income lost as result of foreclosure moratorium would not directly accrue to the government as was the case with the interest from the lawyers trust accounts is that court would consider such moratorium as possible regulatory taking to be analyzed pursuant to penn central historical precedent vinton branch and radford while it seems most likely in light of recent jurisprudence that courts would address takings claim raised in respons to foreclosure moratorium under the parameters set out in penn central it is possible that court might be influenced by the similar fact patterns of two supreme court cases from the 1930s wright v vinton branch29 and louisville joint stock land bank v radford 30 congress enacted the frazierlemke act of 1934 which amended the bankruptcy act to provide farmers five year mortgage foreclosure moratorium allow farmers to keep possession of real property for reasonable rent and allow them to pay judicially appraised purchase value at the end of the five years for the purpose of preventing widesp read farm foreclosures31 the supreme court in radford held the frazierlemke act to be in violation of the fifth amendment and thus unconstitutional32 the decision in the radford case did not question the power of congress to offer to distressed farmers the aid of means of rehabilitation under the bankruptcy clause sic the original frazierlemke act wa s there held invalid solely on the ground that the bankruptcy power of c ongress like its other great powers is subject to the fifth amendment and that as applied to the mortgages given before its enactment the statute violated that amendment since it effected substantial impairment of the mortgag ees security the opinion enumerates five important substantive rights in specific property which had been taken it was not held that the deprivation of any one of these rights would have rendered the act invalid but that the effect of the stat ute in its entirety was to deprive the mortgagee of his property without due pr ocess of law the rights enumerated were 1 the right to retain the lien until the indebtedness thereby secured is paid 2 the right to realize upon the security by judicial public sale3 the right to determine when such sale shall be held subject only to the discretion of the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs9 33 vinton branch 300 us at 45657 internal citations ommited 34 id at 470 35 id 36 as one court explai ned whether or not

emphasis added4 the right to protect its interest in the property by bidding at such sale whenever held and thus to assure having the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt either through receipt of the proceeds of fair competitive sale or by taking the property itself 5 the right to control meanwhile the property during the period of default subject only to the discretion of the court and to have the rents and profits collected by receiver for the satisfaction of the debt33 however the radford decision was called into question by the vinton branch court just three years later in which slightly modified version of the frazierlemke act which was found to long er deprive three of the fi ve above listed substantive rights was deemed in accordance with the fifth amendment34 the court stated the power here exerted by congress is the broad power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies th roughout the united states the question which the objections raise is not whether the act does more than modify remedial rights it is whether the legislation modifies the secured creditors rights remedial or substantive to such an extent as to deny the due process of law guaranteed by the fifth amendmen t for the reasons stated we are of opinion that the provisions of subsection s of the frazierlemke act make unreasonable modification of the mortga gees rights and hence are valid35 while it is possible that current court would look to vinton branch as authoritative on the question of takings claim raised as result of federal foreclosure moratorium because it pertains to similar facts as those addressed in this report and because it has not been expressly overruled it seems more likely that court would analyze such taking s claim under the test outlined in penn central first of all the vinton branch decision came down more than 40 years prior to penn central in those 40 years and the subsequent 30 much has changed in takings jurisprudence36 most notably vinton branch was delivered at time in which the courts did not delineate between the fifth amendments due process clause and the fifth amendments takings clause this point is emphasized by the varying language used in the radford and vinton branch cases the radford decision states that the ultimate question to be addressed is whether the frazierlemke act as applied has taken from the bank without compensation and given to radford rights in specific property which ar of substantial value37 whereas the vinton branch opinion characterizes the ultimate question as whether the act modifies the securedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs10 38 vinton branch 300 us at 470 emphasis added 39 lingle 544 us at 54243 the substantially advances formula suggests meansends test it asks in essence whether regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose an inquiry of th is nature has some logic in the context of due process challenge for regulation that fails to serve any legitimate governmental objective may be so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul of the due process clause but such test is not valid method of discerning whether private property has been taken for purposes of the fifth amendmen t test that tells us not hing about the actual burden imposed on property rights or how that burden is allocated cannot tell us when justice might require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation the owner of property subject to regulation that effectively serves legitimate state interest may be just as single d out and just as burdened as the owner of property subject to an ineffective regulation it would make little sense to say that the second owner has suffered taking while the first has not likewise an ineffective regulation may not significantly burden property rights at ll and it may distribute any burden broadly and evenly among property owners the notion that such regulation nevertheless takes private property for public use merely by virtue of its ineffectiveness or foolishness is untenable emphasis original internal citations omitted 40

process of law guaranteed by the fifth amendment38 it was not until the 2005 supreme court decision lingle v chevron usa inc that the high court made it clear that the tests to be applied under takings claims are distinct from those analyzing potential due process violations39 the lingle court confirmed that plaintiff seeking to challenge government regulation as an uncompensated taking of

standards set forth in nollan and dolan 40 while penn central is likely to govern this does not mean that piece of legislation crafted to meet the test set out in vinton branch could not also pass the three balancing factors of penn central these three factors are analyzed in great detail below but as an example foreclosure moratorium statute that lasts for relatively short period of time and that requires borrowers to make reasonable monthly payments in order to qualify fo r the moratorium will reduce the economic impact of the legislation on mbss mortgag ebacked securities investors property rights thus diminishing the strength of their takings arguments application of penn central to foreclosure moratorium penn central overview before beginning any analysis it should be noted that takings clause jurisprudence is highly amorphous and an everevolving area of the law additionally the penn central test is as the supr eme court has stated an essentially ad hoc and factual inquiry41 finally the mortgagebacked securities industry is highly complex ye t largely unregulated industry which makeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs11 42 it should be noted that the supreme court s

ourts have assessed each of the three penn central factors and highlights certain contexts or facts that courts emphasize as triggering takings cl ause protection that may be implicated by foreclosure moratorium legislation targeting private contracts usually survives takings attacks under penn central analysis42 however this does not mean that court could not find takings under certain circumstances nor does it mean that secondary market investors would not bring suits claiming takings had occurred which comes with its own costs to the government it seems plausible as discussed in greater detail below that statute imposing foreclosur moratorium could have significant enough effect on minority of mbs tranches as to rise to the level of taking the penn central test consists of three factors that are designed to determine whether the government regulatory acti on has resulted in th deprivation of property right sufficient to violate the takings clause the three factors are 1 the economic impact of the government action 2 the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investmentb acked expectations and 3 the character of the government action43 the supreme court has shed little light on the content of these three factors or on how to balance them and each factor raises vexing subsidiary questions44 economic impact the penn central inquiry turns in large part albeit not exclusively on the economic impact factor45 in assessing the economic impact courts evaluate the proportion of the loss caused by the regulation to the parcel as whole46 this means that in weighing the economic impact the courts look athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs12 46 continued products inc v construction laborers pension trust 508 us 602 644 1993 and mortgage restrictions

claim continuedentire property rather than exclusively at the portion of the property affected by the legislation in isolation the supr eme court explained it this way claimants parcel of prope rty could not first be divided into what was taken and what was left for the purpose of demonstrating the taking of the former to be complete and hence compensable to th extent that any portion of property is taken that portion is always taken in its entirety the relevant question however is whether the property taken is all or only portion of the parcel in question47 the parcel as whole concept has three different dimensions physicalspatial functional and temporal in the context of takings claim raised by investors of mbss compelling arguments could be made to define the physical parcel as either the tranches of each trust or the securitized trust as whole this report focuses on the tranches as the physical parcel interpretation because such definition would result in the strongest arguments for taking thus emphasizing potential legal issues that foreclosure moratoria legislation may raise which is the purpose of this report the other option would make successful takings claim less likely because the impact of moratorium would be spread out over the hundreds or thousands of other mortgages within each trust to address the functi onal dimension courts would look to how the governmental interference affects the entire bundle of rights as opposed to single right within the bundle48 in the mbs context an investors bundle of rights would include everything provided in the gove rning psa including rights to certain income stream and contract claims fo r violations of the psa the temporal dimension requires an assessment of the physical parcel for the entire time period during which the plaintiff has an interest in that property49 for example if an investor owned tranche that consisted of the 12month income stream of group of mortgages and 90day foreclosure moratorium was imposed in the middle of that period the court would analyze the econo mic impact to that investor in relation to the whole 12 months not just the 90days during the moratorium courts vary in how they determine the economic loss caused by regulations most courts look to either the propert ys diminution in value or diminution in return caused by the regulation50

significant the supreme court has in past cases found diminutions in property upwards of 75 to not by themselves be enough to be considered taking51 determining the severity of the lost value or return caused by the legislation in question would be an tirely factsp ecific inquiry the complexity of the secondary market coupled with its lack of governmental oversight hamper the ability to fully assess how many and to what extent tranches of mortgagebacked securitized trusts would be affected by foreclosure moratorium when mortgages are sold in the secondary ma rket they are often lumped in trust and then separated into tranches on the basis of certain common characteristics mortgages can be left intact or they can be diced into pieces for example tranche could consist entirely of 30year fixed prime rate mortgages that do not include prepayment penalties or tranche could consist of only the income stream of certain subprime mortgages during the six m onths prior to the end of prepayment penalty period or tranche could be co mprised of 25 of the first group and 75 of the second group there are virtually limits to what can comprise tranche it is conceivable that there are or would be tranches that represent in whole or in part the income of mortgages sold at foreclosure during the period of time in which federal foreclosure moratorium is imposed even more likely are tranches that invest in group of mortgages in come stream exclusively during the period which coincides with foreclosure moratorium in these cases moratorium could result in up to 100 diminution in value or diminution in return of the tranches where tranche loses its entire value due to foreclosure moratorium taking likely has occurred it is unclear where court would draw the line in cases where some but less than 100 loss results though lmost certainly the percentage would be quite high for intermediate percen tages the other two prongs of the penn central test likely are to be of importance impairment of investmentbacked expectations when examining whether congressional impairment of privat contracts interferes with investment backed expectations courts typically ve focused on whether it was reasonable for the harmed party to assume that the impairment would not occur52 the critical question is whether extension of existin g law could be foreseen as reasonably possible53 to do so courts generally look to the type and level of regulation the claimant faced prior to imple mentation of the regulation in question if for instance the subject of the regulation was part of heavily regulated field prior to the additional legislative impairment then additional regulation is more likely to have been foreseeable to the harmed party the courts have concluded for example

not57 the proposals for legislation addressed in this report while potentially affecting the largely unregulated securities industry would directly regu late mortgages and foreclosures the mortgage lending indus try would likely be considered heavily regulated mortgage lenders understand that each mortgage they provide could end up in foreclosure which is also highly regulated however even in highly regulated area one might have reasonable expectation that new laws will not significantly depart from the norm federal foreclosure moratorium arguab ly would be departure from previous mortgage and foreclosure regulations in part because historically foreclosure law has almost exclusively been governed by the state because of this investors in mbss that are heavily invested in income streams related to foreclosures would be more likely to account for possible changes in state laws that might affect their investment such as by ensuring that mortgages represented in their tranches come from multiple states than they would for more unusual federal change in foreclosure law on the other hand ther is some history of similar types of regulation that cuts against this argument one example which is described in more detail in the historical precedent vinton branch and radford subsection of this report is the frazierlemke act that amended the bankruptcy code to impose foreclosure moratorium on farms anothe r example is when the department of housing and urban developm ent hud in the wake of hurricane katrina imposed temporary foreclosure moratorium on some homes owned by those living or working in the disaster area whose mortgages were insured by the federal housing administration fha58 another factor that may strengthen foreseeability argument and thus augment the governments defense against takings claim is if the legislation in question is considered to be valid extension of congresss authority to pass laws on bankruptcies because the modification of contract rights is such an integral part of bankruptcy and because mbs i nvestors should be aware that all mortgages could end up in bankruptcy these investors arguably s hould be less surprised by change to the bankruptcy laws that impose some form of moratorium on foreclosures than morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34369crs15 59 for more information on congresss power s pursuant to the bankruptcy clause see

section of continuedbroadly applicable statute passed pursuant to the commerce clause59 for these reasons it is unclear how court woul d view the impairment of reasonable investmentbacked expectations cau sed by foreclosure moratorium character of the government action the third factor the character of the government action is arguably of diminis hed importance in light of the supreme courts lingle v chevron usa inc decision where the court stated that inquiry into whether regulation advances some public purpose is not relevant to the question of whether taking occurred fo r fifth amendment purposes60 the effect lingle will have on how future courts will apply the nature of the government action factor is presently unclear historically courts used this factor to assess whether regulation that impaired private contracts directly benefited the governme nt disproportionately imposed the costs of public benefit on small class or was somehow the result of governmental bad faith61 it is doubtful that foreclosure moratorium would take rights from investors and ppropriate them to the gove rnment or would be enacted as result of bad faith rather such legislation likely would be an attempt to help stem the current economic downturn that is affecting the entire housing market in the absence of specific legislative language to delineate which mortgages would be covered by moratorium it is unclear if such legislation would impose disproportionate amount of liab ility on small number of inve stors the nature of the government action authorized by these gislative proposals would not appear to greatly augment takings claim but more information would be needed to know for sure conclusion in sum it is unlikely but possible that court would assess foreclosure moratorium pursuant to the test outlin ed in the 1937 supreme court decision vinton branch courts would be more likely to ssess foreclosure moratorium as regulatory taking under the penn central formula if analyzed as regulatory taking it is unclear how court would decide an asapplied takings claim especially without specific facts that would allow an assessm ent of the severity of the regulations economic impact on an individual investors property rights which seems to be the most important penn central factor62 in such an analysis court could define

mortgages for safety and soundness by edward vincent murphyphysical parcel as either the securitized trus t in its entirety or the investment tranches of each trust if court adopts the tran che as the parcel interpretation it is not difficult to envision some tranches being significantly if not entirely diminished in value by foreclosure moratorium due to the great diversity of investments in the mortgage securities market the economic imp act in some of these situations could be substantial enough to be considered regulatory taking finding taking would be far less likely if court accepts the ar gument that the physical parcel should be defined as an entire trust it is impossible to predict at what vel of economic impact court would hold that taking has occurred though in the pa st it has almost always been quite high the impairment of investmentbacked expect ations as well as the nature of the government action do not appear to wa rrant takings concerns on their own especially if court determines the legi slation to be passed pursuant to congresss bankruptcy powers however because ar guments can be made on both fronts that would strengthen takings argument it is possible that these two prongs could push court to find taking where the economic impact is strong if taking were found then the legislation would stand but the government would be required to provide claimants just compensation for their losses there is way to predict how much if any the government would be liable for in just compensation claims but in an industry va lued at more than 1 trillion in 2006 the potential liability could be large63 investors who lost large sums of money due to foreclosure moratorium could sue the gove rnment and regardless of the outcome of these cases the litigation itself would likely be costly
