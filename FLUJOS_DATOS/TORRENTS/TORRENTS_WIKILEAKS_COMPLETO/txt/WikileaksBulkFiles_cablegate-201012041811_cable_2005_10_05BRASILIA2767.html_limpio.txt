bisola ojikutu for reasons 14 b and d 1 u this is an action cable please see paragraph four for action request 2 u on october 13 poloff delivered reftel talking points to marcelo bohlke at brazils ministry of external relations united nations division dnu poloff also provided points to marcia ramos at the ministrys human rights division ddh and marcelo fagundes at the international organizations division doi on october 14 3 c ramos told poloff that the gob cannot accept guantanamo bay migrants because it is illegal to designate someone not on brazilian soil refugee according to the brazilian national committee for refugees conare refugee status in brazil for an applicant abroad is not usually granted until after the refugee has received refugee status from the country where the refugee is located when petitioning for status in brazil in this case the us the gob and conare believe that the migrants at guantanamo bay do not fit into this category because the usg has not formally recognized them as refugees if they were formally recognized the usg would allow resettlement in the us conare representative told poloff during similar discussion in may conare also told poloff that the gobs position on accepting refugees from guantanamo bay regardless of nationality has not changed since 2003 and will likely not change in the foreseeable future 4 sbu action request bohlke said he understood the urgency of our request he told poloff that the gob would probably not be able to resettle the uighurs due to brazilian regulations however bolhke told poloff that before providing definitive response to our request he would like an explanation as to why uighurs are not eligible for refugee status or resettlement in the us post would appreciate guidance from the department regarding bohlkes request comment 5 c post has discussed the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees on numerous occasions and at variety of levels including us grossman since 2003 given brazilian legislation and conares and the gobs comments it does not appear that the gob will accept uighurs detainees if they are not granted refugee status by the usg and even if the uighurs were granted such status by the us we expect the brazilians would argue that they should then be resettled in the us danilovich
