years is changed to minimum of five years the bea of 1990 had put in place temporary requirement set to expire at the end of fy1998 that budget resolutions cover five fiscal years this change effectively makes that requirement permanent the budget committees however may recommend that the budget resolution cover period longer than five fiscal years second section 10105 makes op tional rather than mandatory the inclusion of total direct loan obligation and total primary loan guarantee commitment levels in the budget resolution and the accompanying re port these elements of the budget process effectively were made obsolete by the enactment of the federal credit reform act of 1990 which was incorporat ed into the cba of 1974 as new title v by the bea of 1990 under the federa l credit reform act credit activity is controlled primarily by th appropriation of budget aut hority for credit subsidies decisions regarding the levels of such budget authority are enforced in the same manner as for other spending programs under the congressional budget process however credit subsidy levels are influenced greatly by executive branch estimates of interest rates and default risk consequently this section retains the option for congress of setting credit leve ls in the budget resolution should these interest and default estimates become subject to significant error in the future third section 10105 further modifies the optional contents of the budget resolution to include special payasyougo procedures in the senate pertaining to the use of reserve funds effectively ratif ying recent senate practice reserve funds enable committees to pursue increased funding for specified programs within their jurisdiction when such increases are not assumed in the budget resolution adjustments are made in committee allocations and other levels so that points ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97931crs11 order under the cba of 1974 may not be raised as long as the committees
