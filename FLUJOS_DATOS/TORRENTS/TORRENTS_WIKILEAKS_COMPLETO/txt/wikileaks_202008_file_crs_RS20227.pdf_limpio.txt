reconcile the differences between house and senate versions of measure passed by both congress usually uses conference committee to resolve such disagreements on the more important controversial or complex measures the members of each chambers delegation are known as its conferees or more formally managers this report discusses how house conferees are selected for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml g6g146g156g140g155g142g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g21g153g142g138g148g142g155g561 house rule i clause 11 empowers the speaker to appoint the house delegation to each conference committee the speaker usually does so immediately after the house has voted to request or agree to conference the rule sets out some general guidelines for appointing conferees but the speakers exercise of discretion in doing so cannot be limited by motion or challenged through point of order once appointed names of conferees can be found in the congressional record for the date of appointment as well as in the calendars of the house and the online legislative information system lis g21g146g163g142g561g152g143g561g6g142g149g142g144g138g157g146g152g151g561 the speaker determines the size and party ratio of the house delegation but usually consults with leaders of the reporting committee and perhaps with party leaders before doing so the majority party always has majority of conferees and the total number is usually odd there is fixed or required size for each chambers conferees vote as unit in conference so that neither side can outvote the other in the 109 th congress 20052006 house conference delegations averaged 22 members most appropriation bills had 1519 conferees but delegations on other bills were either smaller 313 or larger 2170 g5g152g150g153g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g561 rule i permits the speaker to appoint delegates as well as members as conferees it directs the speaker to name members primarily responsible for the measure in question it also requires that majority of house conferees should support the chambers position on the measure but permits the speaker to determine for this purpose what the house position is normally the speaker names members of the reporting committee based on lists submitted by its chair and ranking minority member these lists generally reflect committee seniority but not always strictly and they generally include the members who managed the measure on the floor the speaker however does not always restrict the appointments made to the lists submitted provision of rule i has the effect of encouraging the speaker to name sponsors of major floor amendments as conferees even if they are not members of the reporting committee the speaker may exercise this authority particularly when the committee was hostile to the amendments in question also the speaker sometimes appoints conferees from committees that were not responsible for measure especially when the matters in conference include senate provisions not germane to the house bill or other provisions that fall within those panels jurisdiction appointments of this kind create jurisdictional precedent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20227g10g152g158g156g142g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g142g156g497g561g21g142g149g142g140

g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g142g156g561 for measures that were referred to more than one committee the speaker frequently names panel of conferees from each committee of referral so as to represent the interest of each house practice p 314 usually the speaker authorizes panels from additional committees to negotiate only on specified matters or on provisions falling within the jurisdiction of that committee conferees whose authority is restricted in this way may be called limited conferees those authorized to negotiate on the entire bill general conferees in the 109th congress most conferences on other than appropriation bills especially the larger ones had this structure and most panels from other than the primary committee consisted of just three members

general conferees on the specified matters for example member might be named an additional conferee only for floor amendment he or she had sponsored member may also be named in lieu of another conferee only for the negotiation of specified matter third possibility is that limited conferees be named as sole conferees on the matters specified in this case the other conferees authority must also be limited in such way that they cannot negotiate on these matters this form of appointment may occur when the committee from which the panel is drawn has jurisdiction over limited portion of the bill or over nongermane senate amendment sometimes also separate panels of conferees from the same committee may be named to negotiate on different portions of the bill especially in this case different panels may have overlapping memberships g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561g146g151g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561g6g142g149g142g144g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 under rule xxii clause 7c the house may entertain motion to discharge an entire delegation of conferees or alternatively to instruct th em the motion is in order only with one days notice and only after house conferees have been appointed for more than 20 calendar days including 10 legislative days normally equal to days of session during the last six days of session they must instead have been appointed only for more than 36 hours conferee may resign only with the consent of the house often given by unanimous consent pursuant to written request to the speaker or by request of another member typically leader of the conferees the speaker however may fill vacancies on conference delegation and also possesses discretion to remove conferees or name additional ones at any point the speaker may also at any time alter the grouping of limited conferees or further specify the subjects they are authorized to address if second conference becomes necessary because the first conference cannot agree or its report is rejected the speaker usually reappoints the same conferees but may also at discretion alter the makeup of the delegation
