ealth education bor and pensions higher education accreditation how can the syst em better ensure quality and accountability hearings 108th cong 2004reauthorization issues there are several key issues related to accreditation that may arise during the reauthorization of the hea these issues include but are not limited to the use of accreditation as gauge of institutional qua lity the elimination of accreditation as prerequisite for participa tion in hea title iv programs accreditation and distance education accreditation and tr ansfer of credit and due process requirements that apply to accrediting agencies accreditation as an indicator of institutional quality one question that may be raised during the reauthorization process focuses on whether accreditation can be equated with the provision of quality education accreditation is used as an indicator that an institution or program has met at least minimal standards and as evidence of fiscal stability nearly all institutions that have lost their accreditation or have been put on probation by their accrediting agency have been cited for fiscal mismanagement or lack of fiscal integrity based on testimony provided before the senate health education labor and pensions committee few institutions have lost their accreditati on due to poor educational performance4 the accreditation process while required to assess institutions with respect to student achievement primar ily bases accreditation decisions on the inputs eg curricula and faculty rather than the outcomes eg gradua tion rates and job placement rates of higher education in light of the increased congressional emphasis on accountability for outcomes in education programs congress may revisit the extent to which accrediting agen cies focus on student outcomes in making accreditation decisions in order to better ga uge the educational quality of institutions granted accreditation if congress does decide to require accred iting agencies to increase their focus on outcome measures there may be debate about what outcome measures to use and how they should be measured for ex ample would student grades be valid indicator of the quality of an institution would students standardized test scores eg graduate record ex am graduate management admission test be useful indicator of institutional quality would graduation rates or job placement rates be valuable measures outcomes such as these have various measurement problems such as grade inflation po ssible biases on standardized tests differences in how graduation rates might be cal culated or which jobs s hould constitute successful placementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32989crs3 5 see for example hr 838 introduced by rep petri during the 108th congress on feb 13 2003 the bill proposed eliminating accreditation and preaccreditation requirements for participation in title iv programs 6 for more information see crs report rl31926 institutional eligibility elimination of accreditation as prerequisite for title iv eligibility another possible issue is the elimination of accreditation as prerequisite for title iv institutional eligib ility some argue that the current accreditation system is poor indicator of educational quality nd therefore should have bearing on institutional eligibility decisions5 others argue that if the accreditation system were eliminated the federal government would have to develop its own measures of educational quality potentially costly and controversial action or the burden would fall on states leading to 50 different sets of standards for accreditation currently ed plays an integral role in determining ins titutional ligibility to participate in title iv programs throug h the eligibility and certification process6 some have suggested that it would be appropriate and possible for ed to extend this role to specify student outcome data that institutions must provide and ed would collect accrediting agencies and organizations would continue to play role in evaluating or assisting institutions if the in stitutions wanted their input others have suggested that accrediting agencies conti nue in their current role but another organization such as ed be responsible for evaluating student outcomes detractors of this proposal question whether increased ed involvement or the involvement of any organization trying to impose specific student outcome criteria on institutions would undermine the autonomy of postsecondary institutions they argue that this autonomy is critical component to providing high quality education distance education and accreditation another possible issue that may be deba ted during hea reauthorization focuses on accreditation and distance education key issues center on whether accrediting agencies that accredit distance education programs s hould meet additional requirements and whether accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering distance education programs should be requi red to examine specific measures related to distance education such as student achievement for students enrolled in distance education programs the deficit re duction act pl 109171 added new requirement that distance education progra ms must be evaluated by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education as having the evaluation of distance education programs within its scope of recognition transfer of credit congressional debate during reauthorization may also focus on the issue of transfer of credit and how to encourage institutions to accept transfer credits while still recognizing that not all institutions offer the same level of quality education and not all courses may merit recognition of credit based on study of

stolldegree recipients in 19992000 59 of stude nts attended more than one institution in their pursuit of an undergraduate degree7 currently when student transfers from one institution to another the receiving institution determines which courses taken at another institution will be accepted as cr edit toward degree at the new institution recent gao study found that receiving in stitutions base their decisions on which credits to accept on the type of accreditation held by the sending institution whether academic transfer agreements have been tablished with the sending institution and the comparability of coursework8 the study also found that many institutions that are accredited by regional accrediting agencies would not accept credits earned at nationally accredited institutions9 the credit review process can be labor intensive and costly as institutions must evaluate the quality of educa tion received by the student at previous institutions in addition for each course that the receiving institution awards transfer credit students may take one less cour at the new institution translating into loss of tuition for the new institution thus institutions may not have incentives to recognize transfer credits and may even have disincentives to recognize them for students this may result in additional time and money require d to complete degree some students may also reach limits on their federal student aid eligib ility ie available federal student loans prior to completing their program of study if credits are not accepted or not accepted in the students major10 for the federal government this could translate into wasted tax dollars if students using federal student aid to pursue postsecondary education ve to retake courses supporters of efforts to establish transf er of credit requirements argue that any institution that is accredited by an agency or association recognized by ed should be acknowledged as providing an educati on of an acceptable level of quality or presumably they would not have recei ved accreditation opponents of these requirements however argue that the fede ral government should not be involved in determining whether an institution should accept credit for course work from another institution and that federal recognition of an accrediting agency establishes only minimum level of quality that some institutions may find unacceptable in addition arguments have been made th at if institutions are requi red to analyze each transfer students courses for course compatib ility and quality as opposed to

statutes due process requi rements under section 496a6 of the hea12 accrediting agencies recognized by ed must meet certain requirements with respect to due process that is an accrediting agency is required to implement specific procedures to re solve disputes between th accrediting agency and any institution that is subject to the accreditati on process under current law accrediting agencies are required to provide an ihe with at minimum the following adequate specification of requirements and deficiencies at the institution of higher education or program being examined the opportunity to have hearing the right to appeal any adverse action against it and the right to be represented by counsel13 during the reauthorization process congress may consider revisiting statutory language relevant to due process some proponents of altering the current due process requirements have for example pr oposed changes that include requiring that hearing records be kept and that ihe app eals be heard by panel of three outside arbitrators14 when considering such proposals congress may wish to weigh the benefits that would result from additi onal protections for ihes against the administrative burdens for accrediting agen cies that would result from additional procedural requirements although the due process re quirements that apply to accrediting agencies are statutory in nature the concept of procedur due process has its origins in the us constitution both the fifth amendment pplicable to federal agencies and the fourteenth amendment which incorporates certain guarantees in the bill of rights and is applicable to the states prohibit government action that would deprive any person of life liberty or propert without due process of law15 the premise behind due process is that the government for reasons of basic fairness must provide certain procedures before taking any of these important interests away from protected partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32989crs6 16 brotherton

due process violation challenger must show deprivation b of protected interest and c state acti on either federal or action under the color of state law whichever is applicable16 additionally the petitioner must show that the action was not random act but one cause d by established procedure17 the supreme court has stated that due process is flexible concept that varies with the particular situation18 thus the degree of procedural protection afforded is determined on casebycase basis w ith the amount of procedure due increasing as the importance of the interest at stake becomes greater for example in lassiter v dept of social services the court held that the termination of parental rights represented sufficiently high interest such that increased procedural protections were necessary19 in mathews v eldridge the court established balancing test to determine the procedural protections requi red in particular case identification of the specific dictat of due process generally requires consideration of three factors first the private interest that will be affected by the official action second the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the pr obable value if any of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally the governments interest including the function involved and the fi scal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail20 in applying this test the court has gene rally held that due process requires some type of notice and some kind of

trial type hearing in subsequent cases howev er the court has made it clear that trial procedures are not essential for every governmental decision that might affect an individual and that something less than full evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action23 other procedures that courts have at times recognized as required by due process include the presentation of evidence and witnesses legal representa tion an impartial decisionma ker written decision and administrative andor judicial review of the agencys action ultimately however the court has recognized as constitutionally sufficient many different types of procedures depending on the nature of the individual nd governmental interests at stake and federal agencies currently provide wide range of procedural protections as noted above constitutional due process requirements apply only to governmental actors not private entities since accrediting ag encies are private organizations the courts have generally held that they are not bound by the due process clause of the constitution24 nevertheless most courts reasoning that accrediting agencies serve qua sigovernmental function in their role as the gate keepers that determine whether ihes will be eligible to participate in title iv student financial aid programs have ruled that accrediting agenci are subject to common law due process principles25 under these principles c ourts evaluate whether the decision of an accrediting agency was arb itrary capricious an abuse of discretion or reached without observance of procedure required

gives ihes private right of action to sue accrediting agencies28 and courts have split on this question for example in thomas m cooley law school v american bar association the court noted that nearly every court to consider the issue in the last twentyfive years has determined that there is express or imp lied private right of action to enforce any of the heas provisions and thus held that the heas jurisdictional provision did not give the ihe in question the right to enforce the statutes due process provisions by suing its accrediting agency directly29 on the other hand other courts have suggested that the heas jurisdictional pr ovision could be interpreted to confer private right of action on ihes but have not definitively ruled on the point30 regardless of how the courts have ruled on the question of whether the statute grants private right of action to sue accrediting agencies they have generally noted that the lack of such right is not significant given that ihes still have the ability to sue accrediting agencies under principl of common law due process31 recent court case between uburn university and its accrediting agency southern association of colleges and schools sacs provides good illustration of how courts approach due process di sputes between ihes and their accrediting agencies in the case auburn alleged th at sacs violated the hea common law due process principles and the due process clause of the constitution by not following its own procedures for planned investigation32 although the court declined to rule that accrediting agencies were governmental actors for purposes of applying constitutional due pro cess requirements the court di d find that accrediting agencies in their role as quasigovernmental entities that act as the gatekeepers to title iv student financial aid are subject to common law due process principles33 applying those principles the court held that aubur n is entitled to some kind of due process at this stage in the accrediting process34 since the investigation was in an early phase the court concl uded that the university did not require strong due process protection at that stage as result the

of the information collected by accreditors is kept private the information that is made public tends to focus more on the results of process reviews rather than providing information about learning outcomes and costs to meet the needs for increased accountability quality and transparency accreditation must change they also argued that accreditation and federal and state regulations impede innovation in higher education which diminishes the ability of ihes to address national workforce need s and compete globally in addition the commission noted that it needs to be easier for students to transfer between different kinds of institutions current institutional policies with respect to the transfer of credit are often not clear and result in lost time and money for students and create the need for additional federal student ai d the commission also noted that while accreditation once represented private relationship between an accreditor and an institution it is now public policy issue and the process needs to be made more transparent to the public the commission made several recommendations regarding changes to the accreditation process for example th commission recommended that accreditation agencies move more quickly to accredit new institutions and new programs at already accredited institutions and increase their focus on results and quality rather than prescribing requirements for process input s and governance that perpetuate the current models of evaluation and imped innovation in higher education the commission also recommended that accr editing agencies make performance outcomes the priority over measures of input s or process accrediting agencies need to create framework to align and expand existing standards to permit comparisons across institutions on performance and outco measures to encourage innovation and continuous improvement and to require institutions based on their specific missions to move toward world class quality and demonstrate progress in relation to national and international peers finally the overall accreditation process must become more transparent and the final findings of the accreditation process must be made publicly available since the release of the commissions report the secretary has continued to focus national dialogue on issues relate d to accreditation in november 2006 the secretary convened repres entatives from accrediting organizations and other key stakeholders to address the commission s recommendations she has also scheduled higher education summit for march 2007 accreditation w ill

2006 it was not considered on the senate floor during the 109th congress both the house and senate bills would have made several changes related to accreditation issues for example bot h bills would have altered accountability requirements that accrediting ag encies must use in evaluating institutions adding new requirement that accrediting agencies consider the stated mission of the institution including religious missions wh applying and enforcing standards to ensure the courses and programs offered by an institution are of sufficient quality to achieve their stated objective both bills would have added new requirements related to distance education including requiring accrediting agencies to have standards that adequately evaluate distance education programs in the same areas as regular classroombased programs43 and requiring accrediting agen cies to ensure that ihes had implemented process whereby the institution could determine that the student who registered for distance education cour or program was th same student who participated in completed and received credit for the c ourse hr 609 and s 1614 would also have prohibited ihes from denyin g the transfer of credit based solely on the accreditation held by the sending ins titution and would have required ihes to publicly disclose their transfer of credit policies finally both bills would have modified existing due process requirements for example both bills would have prohibited the appeals panel from includi ng current members of the accrediting agencys decisionmaking body that made the adverse decision and the appeals panel would have been subject to conflict of interest policy
