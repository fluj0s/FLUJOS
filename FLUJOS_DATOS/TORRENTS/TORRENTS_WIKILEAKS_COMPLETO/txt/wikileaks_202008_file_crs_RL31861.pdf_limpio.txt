industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31861highthreat chemical agents characteristics effects and policy implications summary terrorist use of chemical agents has been noted concern highlighted after the tokyo sarin gas attacks of 1995 the events of september 11 2001 increased congressional attention towards reducing the vulnerability of the united states to such attacks highthreat chemical agents which in clude chemical weapons and some toxic industrial chemicals are nor mally organized by military planners into four groups nerve agents blister agents choking agents and blood agents while the relative military threat posed by the various chemical types has varied over time use of these chemicals against civilian ta rgets is viewed as low probability high consequence event highthreat chemical agents depending on the type of agent used cause variety of symptoms in their victims some cause death by interfering with the nervous system some inhibit breathing and lead to asphyxiation others have caustic effects on contact as result chemical attack treatment may be complicated by the need to identify at least the type of chemical used differences in treatment protocols for the various high threat agents may also strain the resources of the public health system especially in the case of mass casualties additionally chemical agents trapped on the body or clothes of victims may place first responders and medical professionals at risk protection from and detection of chemical agents is an area of much concern the range of protection and tection equipment available to first responders has led to questions regarding equipment standard ization and state and local preparedness whether terrorist groups are capable of using chemical agents as weapons of mass destruction is unclear some have asserted that the volumes of chemicals required to cause mass casualties would make that scenario unlikely they claim that chemical terrorism is more likely to be small in scale others have suggested that there has been an increase in terrorist interest regarding chemical agents and that this interest could lead to their use in terrorist attacks current policies seek to reduce the proliferation of chemicals that could be transformed into chemical weapons prev ent unrestricted access to large amounts of toxic chemicals provide federal assistance to locations that are affected by chemical terrorism and support research and developm ent activities it is expected that the department of homeland security will take major role in federal policy efforts additional measures suggested for addressing potential chemical terrorism vulnerabilities include further restricting domestic access to precursor chemicals and technologies required to manufacture high threat chemical agents directing continued research and development into selective sensitive chemical agent detectors implementing air monitoring equipment to detect chemical releases in for example public transportation or urban sp aces and overseeing further research into protective equipment prophylaxis and treatment against highthreat chemicals this report will be updated as

since the terror attacks of sept ember 11 2001 policymakers have been attempting to decrease the vulnerability of the united states to the terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction this report describes the di fferent types of highthreat chemical agents it also discusses thei r availability treatment and detection and possible policy approaches to reduc ing the threat posed by them terrorist use of chemical agents is widely believed to be an event that has low probability but potentially high consequences while there is still debate over whether terrorist groups have an increased interest in chemical acquisition and use the domestic vulnerability of the united states to chemical attack remains high policy approaches to reducing chemical vulnerability have generally treated chemical agents as group rather than addressing specific agents additionally military and civilian chemical agent detection have developed with little coordination so that civilian toxic industrial chemical kits and military chemical weapons detectors having varying sensitivities and detection capabilities treatments for chemical exposure vary as well depending on the type of chemical and so must be addressed on chemical by chemical basis because comparatively few individuals have been exposed to modern chemical weapons prac tical experience in tr eatment of chemical casualties is limited especially among civilian health care providers while national efforts to reduce vulnerability to terrorist chemical agent use continue it is not clear whether specific agents that pose the greatest danger are being adequately addressed as general vulnerabilities are being reduced what are highthreat chemical agents highthreat chemical agents are for the purpose of this report chemicals posing exceptional lethality and danger to humans1 some may have been developed and used for commercial purposes others may have been used or developed by militaries as chemical weapons

their victims because of this range of pot ential symptoms it can be difficult to know what treatment will be most effective for victim until the chemical or chemical type has been identified also chemical wea pons may produce their effects by different exposure routes for example by skin cont act or by inhalation as consequence depending on what chemical is encountere d different protective equipment must be employed for example gas mask alone is not sufficient protection against chemicals which can damage through skin contact types of chemical agents military planners categorize such agents into four classes nerve blister choking and blood agents2 this categorization groups chemicals by the effects they cause to those exposed to them while th nerve and blister agents are predominantly only manufactured and used by militaries as weapons both choking agents and blood agents include chemicals widely used in industrial processes nerve agents chemical weapons affecting the nervous system are called nerve agents nerve agents do not occur naturally rather they are manmade compounds that require manufacture and isolation for high toxicity and purity most nerve agents belong to group of chemicals called organophosphates organophospha tes have wide range of toxicity and some are commercially employed as insecticides though these are significantly less toxic than thos developed as chemical weapons3 nerve agents are mainly liquids production the first nerve agent devel oped for military use called tabun or ga was made in germany in the 1930s4 following this discovery series of nerve agents similar to tabun were developed this series know n as the gseries include the weapons sarin gb and soman gd in the late 1940s another series of nerve agents the

the extreme toxicity of these compounds nerve agent pr oduction re quires the use of toxic chemicals during synthesis and specialized equipment to c ontain the nerve agent produced of the nerve agents vx has been identified as the most difficult to manufacture7 effects nerve agents are extremely dang erous and can enter the body through the lungs or by skin contact though for the gseries nerve agents the inhalation toxicity is significantly greater than the dermal toxicity of the nerve agents vx is the most deadly and tabun is the least deadly though all are exceedingly toxic nerve agents interfere with the ne rvous system causing overstimulation of muscles victims may suffer nausea nd weakness and possibly convulsions and spasms at high concentration loss of musc control nervous system irregularities and death may occur the action of nerve agents can be irreversible if victims are not quickly treated treatment two drugs atropine and pralidoxime chloride are used as antidotes for nerve agents8 atropine prevents musc spasm and allows the body time to clear the nerve agent pralidoxime chloride limits the effects of nerve agent exposure by reversing the agents action bo th of

by blister agents requires fu ll body protection against these chemicals militarily blister agents produce casualties and reduce the combat effectiveness of opposing troops by requiring them to wear bulky protective equipment11 the most common blister agent is mustard agents which includes nitrogen and sulfurbased compounds mustard agents are oily liquids which range in color from very pale yellow to dark brown depending on the ty pe and purity and ve faint odor of mustard onion or garlic12 these liquids evaporate quickly and their vapors are also injurious blister agents are not naturally occu rring compounds mustard agents for example were first developed in the late 1800s during world war i both sides in the conflict used these weapons against thei r enemies and the mu stardtype blister agent produced the greatest number of chemical casualties during world war i though fewer than 5 of these casualties died many countri have stockpiled blister agents in their chemical wea pon inventories mustard agent was also reportedly used in the iraniraq war13 the united states is currently destroying its stockpile of blister agents production production of blister agents is considered less complicated than that of nerve agents14 like nerve agents it requires the use of some toxic chemicals and specialized equipment to contain the agent produced the most common

causing burns in areas that were covered by cloth while blister agents react quickly upon skin contact their symptoms may be delayed in the case of mustard agent damage occurs within 12 minutes of exposure but symptoms do not manifest for several hours16 as even low concentration of vaporized blister agent quickly causes damage it is unlikely that agents will be removed from the skin prior to injury the initial symptoms of blister agent exposure are reddening of the skin resembling sunburn combined with pain in th effected area swelling blisters and lesions may then develop pending on the degree of exposure systemic symptoms such as malaise vomiting and fever may also develop in extreme cases17 exposure to large amounts of liquid mu stard agent may prove fatal18 the eyes are also very sensitive to blister agents at high vapor exposures great pain corneal damage and scarring between the iris and lens may occur the most severe eye damage is often caused by liquid agent either from contact with airborne droplets or by selfcontamin ation of the eyes from contaminated clothing or body parts19 victims inhaling blister agents may suffer damage to their lungs while single lowlevel exposure will likely produce only temporary impairment high concentrations or repeated exposures may cause permanent damage inhalation victims may have symptoms ranging from mild bronchitis to blistering of the lungs20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31861crs6 21 chemical casualty care division field management of chemical casualties handbook second edition us army medical research institute of

respiratory tract injuries victims who suffer severe lung damage may require mechanical ventilation an additional co mplication after exposure to large amounts of mustard agent is general weakening of the whole immune system because of these systemic effects special precauti ons must be taken against opportunistic infections in the case of exposure to high concentration of mustard agent21 choking agents chemicals that act on the lungs causing difficulty in breathing and potentially permanent lung damage are known as choking agents examples of choking agents include chlorine ammonia and phosgene choking agents have historically been used during wartime and are sometimes encountered during industrial accidents22 choking agents are generally gases that have marked odors and may color the surrounding air production many choking agents are dual use chemicals with both civilian and military purpose chlorine and ammonia are both used in large quantities for commercial applications wh ile phosgene is used within the chemical industry methods for producing choking agents are well known but may be technically challenging choking agents require sp ecialized equipment to produce compress and contain them choking agents were so manufactured for wartime use and were extensively used during world war i the first major successful chemical attack of the war used chlorine gas at ypres in 191523 chlorine gas was later supplemented by phosgene use which caused greater casualties24 effects choking agents injure their victims through inhalation with comparatively mild effect on the skin exposure to low chemical concentrations causes chest discomfort or shortness of breath irritation of nose and throat and tearing eyes high agent concentrations may quickly cause swelling of the lungs respiratory failure and possibly death sy mptoms of lung damage can occur up to 48 hours after inhalation of moderate concentrations and often do not manifest themselves until the lungs are aggravated by physical effort25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31861crs7 26 chemical casualty care division field management of chemical casualties handbook second edition us army medical research institute

symptomatically because lung damage may be exacerbated by exercise victims are kept at rest until the danger of fluid in the lungs is past symptoms such as tightness of the chest and coughing are treated with immediate rest and comfort shallow breathing and insufficient oxygen may require supplemental oxygen26 swelling and accumulation of fluids in th lungs are likely after exposure to high dose of choking agent adminis tration of cortic osteroids has been recommended in cases of fluid accumulation but their beneficial effects have not been proven27 rest warmth sedati on and oxygen are still the primary treatments even in the case of marked edema blood agents blood agents are chemicals that interfere with oxygen utilization at the cellular level hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts are agents in this group hydrogen cyanide is very volatile gas smelling of almonds while cyanide salts are odorless solids hydrogen cyanide was considered for use as chemical warfare agent but was rarely used in military situations because its effectiveness was limited by its quick dispersion the french manufactured hydrogen cyanide as military agent during world war i28 hydrogen cyanide was used in ot her situations though the principle agent used to kill individuals in german world war ii concentration camps zyklon b used hydrogen cyanide as its active agent29 hydrogen cyanide use has been attributed to both sides during the iraniraq war30 production hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts are now used as industrial chemicals having application in the che mical electroplating and mining industries as with choking agents methods for producing blood agents are relatively well known however the gaseous nature of hydrogen cyanide complicates production and storage

chemical casualty care division medical management of chemical casualties handbook third edition united states army medical research institute of chemical defense august 1999effects blood agents act through inhalati on or ingestion and impair cellular oxygen use31 the central nervous system is especi ally susceptible to this effect and blood agents usually cause death through oxygen starvation of brain cells the symptoms of blood agent exposure depe nd upon the agent concentration and the duration of exposure in mild cases there may be headache dizziness and nausea for several hours followed by complete spontaneous recove ry higher concentration or longer exposure may additionally cause convulsions and coma very high concentrations may lead to powerful ga sping for breath violent convulsions and cardiac failure within few minutes32 treatment the effects of blood agents ar reversed through treatment with specific antidotes either amyl or sodium nitrite combined with sodium thiosulfate the combination of these two chemical s removes cyanide the active compound in blood agents from the body when sympto ms such as convul sion or depressed breathing are present ventilation with ox ygen and administra tion of anticonvulsants are used cyanide is metabolized more readily than most chemical weapons with prompt treatment victims may recover from otherwisefatal doses33 protection against chemical agents protection against chemical agents is predominantly achieved through physical rather than medicinal means physical protections limit exposure by protecting the eyes lungs andor skin from chemical contact physical physical protection against chemical agents includes gas masks and special protective clothing gas mask filters equipped with chemical filters are effective against inhaled chemical agents but may not provide sufficient protection against chemical agents active on skin contact such as vx or mustard agents or high concentrations of other nerve agents gas mask filters are normally constructed from layers of activated charcoal and fine porous material to remove particles and chemicals from the airstream the activated charcoal binds chemicals

chemical agents while the activated charcoal acts in manner similar to gas mask filter the combination of mask and suit provides fu ll protection against most chemical exposures medical there are few examples of medical prophylaxis against chemical weapons unlike some biological pathogens ther are vaccines to provide immunity from the effects of these weapons however some protection against the nerve agent soman can be achieved by the preex posure use of pyridostigmine bromide pyridostigmine bromide acts to supplement postexposure administration of the nerve agent antidotes atropine and pralidoxime chloride use of pyridostigmine bromide prevents permanent binding of nerve agents within the nervous system pyridostigmine bromide use is recommended only when there is high imminent threat of chemical weapon use as it has noticeable side effects36 as an added protection against chemical weapons which cause their effects through skin contact the us army medical research institute

academy press 2002 dilute bleach solution is an essentia l protection against secondary chemical exposure38 in addition to stopping the victims exposure to the chemical agent this procedure prevents those treating the victim from becoming victims themselves and avoids contamination of treatment facilities39 decontamination is especially important in those cases where victims have encountered liquid ch emical agents and may have significant amounts of chemical ag ent trapped in their garments in events with gaseous agents decontamination may be less critical after decontamination is completed treatment of the victims occurs in some cases with agentspecific antidotes while in others symptomatic treatment is performed detection of chemical agents chemical weapons detection has been predominantly an area of concern for military planners although the manufacture of some of these agents for commercial use requires detection capabilities at ma nufacturing plants and by hazardous materials first responders while some military units have equipment designated for chemical weapon detection civilian first responders use variety of commercial equipment to detect and identif wide range of chemicals because of the wide spectrum of chemical agents the development of portable integrated instrument which quickly detects all chemical agents remains an area of research and development the partment of defense currently employs series of technologies to detect and id entify chemical agents including personal sensors automated atmosphe ric sampling and fieldadap ted laboratory methods for battlefield use detection of chemical agents can rve many purposes one is to provide warning of chemical attack allowing additional time to react to terror event another is to identify the chemical agent us ed in an attack this might provide for better treatment and more ffective response finally determining when an area is clear of chemical agents after terror attack requires sensitive postevent detection there are techniques for detecting chemical agents that are based on sampling the local environment detection paper tickets and tubes are examples of such techniques detection paper is absorben t paper impregnated with special dyes when drop of chemical agent is absorbed by the paper it dissolves one of the pigments causing the paper to change color

laboratories for the identification of che mical agents as well as disease outbreaks49 chemical agents as weapons of terror rather than as weapons of mass destruction many experts believe that it would be difficult for terrorist groups to use chemical agents as weapons of mass destruc tion even vx the most lethal of nerve agents would require tons spread uniformly and efficiently to kill 50 of the people in 100 km2 area50 on the other hand chemical agen ts might be effectively used as weapons of terror in situations where limited or enclosed space might decrease the required amounts of chemical that is the use of the weapon itself even if casualties are few could cause fear that would magn ify the attacks effect beyond what would be expected based solely on the number of casualties

victims near the point of release might suffer grievously blister agents while not lik ely to cause mass destruction might cause mass terror and injury choking agents are longer consider ed to be useful military weapons as chemical suits and masks provide high pr otection as weapon of mass destruction used against civilians the comparatively w lethality of choking agents complicates their use as weapon of mass destruc tion since very large volumes would be needed53 on the other hand the industrial availability of some choking agents provides opportunities for acqui sition and subsequent use of potentially very large volumes of such agents for example the united states produces approximately 1 billion pounds of chlorine year for use in water treatment fac ilities the potential vulnerability of chlorinefilled rail tank cars by which chlorine is primarily transported has been noted54 terrorist attack on industr ial stores at chemical or water treatment facilities or during shipment has been raised as another potential source of concern55 blood agents may be difficult to employ as weapons of mass destruction for many of the same reasons as choking agen ts the quick dispersal of blood agents combined with the large amounts necessa ry to cause mass casualties make such agents difficult to use on mass scale even those blood agents which are industrially manufactured are often used onsite without being shipped however terrorist groups seem to be increasingly in terested in these agents perhaps because of criminal use of them56

developing reliable sensitive chemical agent detectors detection of chemical agents at low levels is challenging task which has not yet been uniformly achieved the current generation of chemical agent monitors is not capable of detecting chemical weapons at the acceptable exposure threshold limit93 this greatly complicates the efforts of hazardous materials first res ponders in assessing safety one of the tradeoffs in developing sensitive chemical detectors is the risk of detecting chemical similar to chemical agent and incorrectly registering it as an agent in civilian system such false positives may lead to great disruption and uncertainty94 in contrast false negatives where the detector signals the absence of chemical agent when one is actually present might endanger civilians environmental detection of chemical weapon release how chemical weapon detectors are to be employed in civilian society is open to question currently detectors are us ed on casebycase basis generally
