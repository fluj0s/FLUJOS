been significant interest in terrorist financing following the attacks the administrations strategy to combat terrorist financing was focused foremost on freezing terrorist assets according to the us department of the treasury the aim of us policy was starving the terrorists of funding and shutting down th institutions that support or facilitate terrorism2 in the months immediately following the attacks substantial funds were frozen internationally after this initial sweep however the freezing of terrorist assets slowed down considerably according to the department of the treasurys terrorist assets report as of december 2004 programs targeting assets of international terrorist organizations have resulted in the blocking in the ited states of almost 10 million of the 16 billion in state sponsors of terrorisms asse ts located in the united states 15 billion have been frozen by us economic sanctions of th at 15 billion the assets of libya which were blocked on sept ember 20 2004 made up all but 425 million3 according to many analysts these numbe rs are very small and seem to support the 911 commissions conclusion that the united states must expect less from trying to dry up terrorist money and more from following the money for intelligence as tool to hunt terrorists understand th eir networks and disrupt their operations4 as detailed in the march 2005 us department of

posed by rrorists however forced congress in 2001 to bring terrorist financing which ofte n is accomplished with legallyderived funds within the range of activities punishable under the federal m oney

seemingly unrelated areas protective and security duties for instance might uncover terrorist financin g arrangements behi nd potential assaults or examination of identity theft might disclose the use of credit cards by terrorist cells even though the secret rvice longer resides in the treasury department the agency is still connected to its previous departmental home and certain responsibilities this occurs because th secret services authority mandates functions and jurisdiction we re continued when it was moved intact to its new residence secret service involvement secret service involvement in combating terrorist financing is an outgrowth of its two principal missions protection and especially criminal investigations nd it is connected w ith several service responsibilities func tions and activities136 the agencys mission statement on criminal investigations summarizes these the secret service also investigates viol ations of laws relating to counterfeiting of obligations and

financial banking and telecommunications infrastructure137 flowing into this main stream are several tributaries from within the service including counterfeit division but th most relevant for combating terrorist financing is the financia l crimes division which am ong other matters covers financial institution fraud money laundering forgery and access device fraud138 the division has also been involved in num erous task forces consisting of other federal agencies as well as subnational government entities several of these task forces specifica lly target international organized crime groups and the proceeds of their criminal enterprises these groups are not only involved in financial crimes but inve stigations indicate that the proceeds obtained from financial fraud are being diverted toward other criminal enterprise139 the task forces can also extend to inte rnational components or connections task forces involving the financial crime s division include cabinet combined agency interdiction network interpol international criminal police organization the financia l crimes task force the asian organized crime task force and the west african task force140 caveats and their meaning several important caveats to any examination of secret service activities as well as efforts to combat terrorist financing are in order one is that authoritative detaile d and comprehensive information about the secret service and its operations in the public record is lacking this results from the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity rrounding them and agency operations in addition public submissions from the servi ce itself or from its adoptive parent the department of homeland security are usually general in scope limited in detail and short on specifics the secret service however does provide more information directly to members and committees of congress in executive session or otherwise in confidence through reports h earings meetings and briefings second qualification is that the fede ral involvement in combating terrorist financing has been and probably still is evolving involving number of different entities and c onnections among them as noted above for example treasurys office of terrorism and fina ncial intelligence emerged only recently changes over time have occurred affecting organizational structure agency duties and operations interagency coordinative arra ngements networks consis ting of federal along with subnational and private organi zations and informal relationships similar changes might occur again with the same impacthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33020crs35 141 this section was prepared by todd massedsp 142 see testimony of gary m bald acting assi stant director for c ounterterrorism division fbi before the senate caucus on international narcotics control march 4 2004a third caveat is that actual practice might not conform to expected practice and that formal institutional arrangements and procedures might differ from informal undertakings consequently some of the accounts in the public record might not adequately describe ongoing interrelationships activities and operations their scope and range their effectiveness and results or their comparative importance collectively these qualifications have meaning for the secret services role and responsibilities in combating terro rist financing these ar not specified in detail in the public record gap that leads to certainty and even some confusion about them in addition the roles may have been transformed since the services move into homeland security and out of treasury where the lead agency and several related bureaus are headquartered the roles or practices may continue to change under certain circumstances for instance if treasurys bureaus and offices increase their responsibility and operations if the revers occurs whereby tfi calls upon the secret service for additional i nvolvement or if the secret services own priorities are altered to elevate as an illustration the protective mission while reducing criminal investigations the federal bureau of investigation fbi141 the federal bureau of investigation is the lead agency in the department of justice doj for the dual mission of protecting us national security and combating criminal activities as statutory member of the us intelligence community it is charged with

bank twelve month pilot program of anti money laundering and combating terrorist financing of terrorism amlcft assessments joint report on the review of the pilot program march 10 2004 184 see william holder the international monetary funds involvement in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism journal of money laundering control spring 2003 pp 383387 185 this section was prepared by martin weissfdtbahrain and its president vice president and executive secretary are from lebanon egypt and saudi arabia respectively182 at the menafatfs first plenary meeting in april 2005 representa tives assessed and ev aluated progress in combating terrorist financing in the regi on and discussed the organizations budget action plan and working groups its next meeting is scheduled for lateseptember 2005 in beirut the international monetary fund imf and the world bank have also incorporated counterterrorist financin g activities into their work during 20032004 the imf and the world bank undertook twel vemonth pilot program that evaluated 33 countries and assessed their complian ce with the fatf 40 8 recommendations in march 2004 the imf and world bank ag reed to make the pilot program permanent experience under the pilot program with both ssessments and with technical assistance considerably deepened collaboration between the imf and world bank and fatf and the fatf style regi onal bodies fsrbs recommendations for the imf and world bank on how to improve monitoring include the need for close coordination with fatf and fatfstyle regional bodies on the timing of assessments more equitable sharing of the assessment burden among agencies and broadening the responsibilities of imf and world bank staff for the supervision and integration of assessment missions to insure comprehensive and high quality assessments183 in addition to the pilot program numerous imf products including annual economic reports article iv assessments and the reports on standards and codes and financial sector assessment program reports consider issues relevant to terrorist financing184 none of these reports constitutes binding agreement the legal basis for the imf and world banks work on these issues is through its technical assistance function the im f and world bank may offer advice and guidance but it is the responsibility of th national government s to implement and enforce any new laws suggested by fatfs imfs or the world banks recommendations conclusion policy issues for congress185 while the current campaign against terrorist finance reportedly has diminished terrorists abilities to gather and transmit fi nances significant funds still appear to be available efforts to further regulate and introduce transparency into the global financial system are welcome steps yet they will not completely reduce terroristshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33020crs52 striking capacity because most of the proposed measures cannot with certainty separate out terrorists from other types of lawbreakers terrorists ability to exploit nonbank mechanisms of moving and storing value as well as their d ecentralized selfsupporting network of cells represent additional challe nges to law enforcement these challenges and concerns lead to numerous policy questions that may be relevant for congress as it bates both us strategy to counter terrorist financing and to reorganize the us government in order to best implement this strategy among those questions are should the us strategy emphasi ze freezing assets or following financial trails in the wake of the 911 report this does not appear to be answered more importan tly who should author the us government terrorist financin g strategy although the current terrorist financing strategy is drawn up by the state department many would argue that treasury maintains more expertise on the issue and having prepared the previous antimoney laundering strategies would be be tter suited to draft national counterterrorist financing strategy does the current architecture of the us government display clear jurisdiction among the various fe deral departments and agencies involved in the fight against terro rist financing the preceding analysis points to many possible overlaps among the various investigatory agencies fbidoj and dhs as well as between treasury and state in policy setting and providing technical assistance to foreign allies to what extent has the administration analyzed each federal agency budg et allocation for combating terrorist financing to reconc ile duplication of efforts what future efforts can be put in place to further interdepartmental and interagency coordination on both policysetting and enforcement how well are the func tions of the panoply of new and legacy departments and agencies being coordinated who is best suited to coordinate these functions how well is the congressional oversight mechanism designed to assess federal performance on counter ing terrorist financing the senate banking and finance committees agreed to joint jurisdiction over the treasurys office of terrorism and financial intelligence several other committees have potential relevance in the overall fight against terrorist financin g reform of congressional jurisdiction is an historically tricky issue yet some argue that reevaluating how congress oversees the fight against terrorism and terrorist financing may lead to more effective executive branch action considering terrorists increased use of alternative remittance systems is there any way to regulate these practices what would the costs be to register all informal moneytransmitters and bringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33020crs53 them in line with usa patriot act requirements many small remittance services cater to immigra nt communities without reliable access to the formal banking sect or making alte rnative remittance systems illegal is likely impractical and could create swell of resentment among the immigrant population in the united states if the us government wants to license and regulate alternative remittance systems some say it may be necessary to offer funds and technical assistance to small remittance providers to help insure their compliance how effectively is the united stat cooperating with other countries and insuring their cooperation in implementing and enforcing national regulations to restrict terro rist financing if us bank charity or remittance system is based in the us or has us operations it is subject to us jurisdiction when such entities lie outside us jurisdiction the united states is often at the mercy of other governments to first enact legislation making terrorist financing illegal and more importa ntly rigorously enforce this legislation creating legal and regulatory system is likely meaningless if it is not enforcedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33020crs54 key acronyms aml antimoney laundering aphis animal and plant health inspection service atf bureau of alcohol tob acco
