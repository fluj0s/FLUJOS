what comes out of it the staff mem ber responded via email dated 29 january 2003 and stated that t hanks that i have been told this question was brought in the j ab in nairobi with few phone calls the case was shel ved the lady who broadcasted the message is the one who wro to white house and the vice presidents of the usa if the i nternal justice system had functioned every thing would hav been kept within the system my hope was negroponte being in the secretariat would do damage control and get somehow the boss to address the problem in the best interest of the cretary general the ladies will continue writing to human rights organizations especially those that are fired it may not produce immediate results but lot of damage will be done he added that he wrote to the ambassador to show the man that dialogue is the best option in life interview with mr dickson mzumara 17 mr mzumara recalled that in january 2003 the conc erned staff member who retired in november 2003 wrote to us

was contrary to regulations for him to commun icate with persons external to the organization in connectio n with this communication mr mzumara advised the staff member to tender letter of resignation f allegations of sexual harrassment 18 the allegation of sexual harassment made by one of the female staff members named in the anonymous letters was investigated by oiosid she had complained that h er contract was terminated after she had turned down the sexual advances of manager 7 19 the female staff member informed oios that during n office retreat held at the nazareth restaurant in 2001 th manager was at the coffee shop with two other staff members mr oluwatete olokodana deputy chief of security and mr vintzis lav stokykov chief facilities management section when the mana ger approached her saying why are you wearing this i ts too hot here whilst saying this he put his hand on her t shirt and tried to look and touch her breast 20 when interviewed mr olokodana said that he did t witness any sexual harassment at the retreat howev er in the presence of mr stoykov he recalled that the femal staff member complained to the manager that she was not f eeling well whilst they were having lunch 21 oios interviewed mr stoykov who said that such an incident did not occur however he recalled the female staf f member being in the company of the manager mr olokodana and himself when she came to complain that she had flu whilst t hey were having coffee 22 the manager told oios that he did not sexually hara ss the female staff member and that such allegations are m ade when staff members are dissatisfied with certain manager ial decisions he said that the female staff members contract was terminated because her performance was poor 23 when the female staff member was reinterviewed by idoios she maintained that she had been sexually harassed when asked why she had not engaged the various possible intern systems including ohrms to have the issue resolved she sta ted that she had not pursued the issue because she did not know how to approach it the female staff member explained that she thinks that her contract was not renewed because of the xual harassment the female staff member left the employ ment of eca some two years ago and has never taken any steps to engage any united nations system options to pursue her complai nt 24 in light of the above there is therefore insuffici ent evidence to support the female staff members alleg ation of sexual harassment both mr olokodana and mr stoy kov whom she claimed witnessed the incident deny that any incide nt occurred and reported substantially different exchange 25 ms bongoy mawalla chief general services sectio n explained to oios that she was the focal point for women until july 2003 she said that during her tenure she is sued 8 circular to create awareness about sexual harassmen t but incident was reported by staff members 26 during interviews with oios mr ali todaro specia l assistant to the executive secretary also denied xually harassing women staff members at eca as alleged in the anonymous emails because those women were not named and the staff member refused to identify them to idoios it was not pos sible to further pursue the allegations vi evidence findings of fact 27 as indicated above staff regulation 12 i stipul ates that staff members shall not communicate to any gov ernment entity person or any other source any official inf ormation that they know has not been made public except as approp riate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization b the secretary general these obligations do not cease upon separation from service 28 email messages sent to us ambassador negroponte pr esident bush vice president cheney senators and other per sons external to the organization by the staff member is vention of the above staff regulation the reason for so doin g especially in light of his refusal to identify the sources of the complaints he was ostensibly raising to the oio s investigators when asked appears evident in the s taff members reply to mr mzumara who told him his actions contr avened staff regulations the staff member had at the time indi cated that if the internal justice system had function ed every thing would have been kept within the system my h ope was negroponte being in the secretariat would do dam age control and get somehow the boss to address the problem in the best interest of the secretary general the ladies will continue writing to human rights organizations especially t hose that are fired it may not produce immediate results but lot of damage will be done 29 during interviews with the oios investigators by h is own admission the staff member confirmed communicating to persons outside the organization he did not inform eca ma nagement arguing that the eca internal justice system had co llapsed however he knew that the matter was being dealt wi th by the executive secretary as confirmed by him during his interview with the investigators 9 vii conclusion 30 in light of the above findings it is evident that the staff member contravened staff regulation 12 i he sought intervention from us ambassador
