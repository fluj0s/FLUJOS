13 u background ssi the common data receptor cdr is dntdesigned system to perform the data reception portion of what is commonly termed listening post the cdr supports common interface that dnt developers use for data formatting and reception in addition the common data receptor concept emphasizes the use of data receptor operations manager and network manager vice listening post ssix1 the introduction of the fashioncleft protocol is necessary because without the fashioncleft protocol the implanttocdr communication previously did not handle raw ip data packets in addition an implant previously had way to deal with the challenge of processing streaming data while minimizing the computing overhead associated with encapsulating and encrypting the data this new protocol provides the developer mechanism to specify the level of encryption implemented in the implant as precursor to data transmission ssix1 the fashioncleft protocol supports the passing of metadata securely and with authentication ssix1 the metadata is used to support the reconstruction of ip packets and when applicable to convey information about the session ___ roc last saved 4172013 090800 pm

configuration dnt has been working closely with the remote operations center roc to design and build figbuild an external mission network and opticpinch an internal mission network ssi figure 131 below shows the common data receptor architecture as described in the referenced flaxenprecept eicds ssi the interfaces supported by the cdr must also support the cdrs separation of classified and unclassified processing classified information such as egress data and metadata must be protected while on the unclassified network side before passing through the oneway link this interface also

fcrensics lab manual processing and swveeporuvard hog oh streaming packets 14 ufouo interface description ssi this interface provides tao developers low overheard solution to exfiltrate streaming data typically associated with implants that collect raw packets from the target environment while providing the appropriate metadata and authentication the basic design principle behind this low overhead approach is to redirect copy or clone of the original packet to another host or listening post in this case the cdr inorder to redirect packet features of the copy of the packet must be altered particularly the source and destination addresses and possibly the port numbers classification top secret comint xi fashioncleft_protocoldoc page 2 of 26 drv fm nsacssm 1232 dated 24 feb 98 declon xi last saved 4172013 090800 pm last printed 6152009 021500 pm classification top secret comint xi ssi this interface is designed to support the reception of cloned packets and their associated metadata originating from implants while supporting authentication of the egress data and correlation of received packets to the appropriate metadata to provide greater flexibility for the implant several configurable levels of encryption are supported ssi the following assumptions are made this interface supports egress of data and does not support command and control channel this interface is used by implants which for valid reasons are unable to implement egress methods that require greater resources from the target such as encapsulation egress data must be associated with encrypted authenticated metadata this interface may not be suitable for all boundary defenses that could be encountered within target environment extensibility has been designed to allow additional packet selection algorithms to be added such that future changes to skirt other defenses can be readily included ssi this interface implements four functions transmission of session announcements transmission of metadata transmission of data packets reconstruction of data packets using the metadata and reconstruction of sessions using metadata to track and collate data packets belonging to particular session ssi during session establishment an implant authenticates itself to the cdr and requests the cdr to begin reception of data packets that belong to this session as part of establishing the session metadata about the session is passed along with metadata that the cdr requires to assign data packets to the session and collate data packets within the session the session establishment function uses the fogynull protocol family to authenticate and securely pass metadata packet collation information and data packet encryption status ssi there are several methods that an implant could use to collate data packets to the appropriate session but only one method can be used in any session the implant picks the appropriate exfil type either packet or session and either exfiltrates one modified copy of source packet per source packet or assembles the source data payloads from several source packets into one packet to be exfiltrated the fashioncleft interface design allows these methods to be extensible so additional methods can later be developed and included to meet operational constraints imposed by boundary defenses ssi the data packets are generally copy of packet that was collected and had its destination address changed to send it to the cdr additional fields might have been altered to support one of the methods of assigning data packets to session and collating data within session if selected during the session establishment the payload section of the packet may be encrypted using the mode specified by the fashioncleft protocol encryption mode selection in the fogynull

announcement metadata announces the initiation of session describes the session and conveys data packet reconstruction and association information to enable data packets and sessions to be

using the exfiljd metadatatag and fogynull identifiers provided that more than fifteen 15 minutes between termination of the last session and the start of the next session with the same exfilid from the implant ufouo to insure separate session are not inadvertently joined by the cdr implants should allow at least sixty 60 minutes between the reuse of exilid values sending data packets to session announcement ports ufouo to minimize testing every packet for session announcements being sent to the fashioncleft receptor only certain destination ports will be monitored for session announcements these ports can be arbitrarily configured to address the needs of specific deployed implants if an implant chooses or is required to by conditions imposed by the target environment it may send data packets to these ports as well packets that match data packet selection criterion are not checked for session announcements therefore implants that desire to send announcements to the same port as data packets must choose packet selection criteria carefully duplicate data packets ufouo implants that desire to send duplicate data packets are permitted and may be desirable in some cases to insure that critical portions of the session are received by the fashioincleft receptor duplicate data packets will occur as an artifact of packet sniffing by default data packets that are either duplicated by design or by coincidence generally will be removed by post processing during session reconstruction simultaneous exfil of multiple sessions ufouo implants that desire to exfiltrate multiple disjoint sessions simultaneously or even sessions backtoback must utilize the exfilid in conjunction with the packet selection criteria the exfilid is used to identify disjoint sessions while packet selection criterion is used to associate data packets to particular session implants must choose both such that both are unique per session and the above conditions are met early termination

describes the methods used to associate metadata with non encapsulated egress packets that are transmitted independently from the data that is desired to be exfiltrated specifically it addresses allowable contents for the packetif selector and packetifdata fields of the fogynull infrastructure header infhdr the following table identifies the specific values for the packetifselector field to select which algorithm to be used to do an association this indicates whether the packetifdata field is used to convey parameters for the selected algorithm the packetifdata field can be up to 32 bytes in length table 311 packet interface algorithm interpretation value algorithm contents of data 0x00 none not used 0x01 generic pattern matching matching rules 0x02 fixed ip4 field matching matching rules ufouo all methods other than the null case contain associated packetifdata the number and format of the bytes comprising the packetifdata vary based on the value of packetifselector however to allow for cases in which data receptor may not understand particular packetifselector value the packetifdata field will always begin with 1byte field indicating the number of bytes in the packetifdata field excluding this 1byte length field so for the nonnull types specified above the corresponding packetifdata fields are as follows table 312 packetif data length 1 byte data 131 bytes ssi otherwise the contents of packetifdata should be left as random data 32 u algorithms 321 u none 0x00 ssi this represents the null case ie the case in which there is defined mapping association hence packets will be collected only the metadata is forwarded the content of packetif data is unused classification top secret comint xi fashioncleft_protocoldoc page 20 of 26 drv fm nsacssm 1232

pattern matching against specified bytes within the received packets the content of packetlfdata contains finite number of matching rules these matching rules allow pattern match against specified bytes following the start of an ip header thus they can include checks against bytes in the iptcpudp headers the rules could include checks against other bytes but the header checks would probably be the norm thus this selector would allow checks against the ip identifier field as well as elements such as ip addresses tcp window size tcp urgent data size ports etc this method is fairly general and should be able to cover any case in which portions of these headers contain fixed bytes the purpose of the data field is to specify the particular byte offsets and patterns to be used for matching against received packets nonzero number of pattern blocks must thus follow the length field which specifies the number of bytes in the pattern blocks each pattern block consists of three bytes as described below for this method received packet must match the criteria specified within all of the pattern blocks using 1byte length and 3 bytesblock implies there can be at most 10 pattern blocks within the 32byte packetlfdata field in addition using 7bit offset implies that the largest offset from the start of the ip header is 127 bytes the format of this field is lbyte length pattern block lpattern block n pattern block has the following format lbyte offset offset from start of ip header or transport protocol header bit 0 lsbit indicates start position if 0 use start of ip header if 1 use the start of transport protocol header bit 17 offset value multiply desired offset by 2 to shift into bits 17 lbyte mask mask to be used with pattern lbyte pattern pattern to be matched thus to perform pattern block check verify the following equality packet i r header_offset offset mask pattern mask the above assumes that enough packet bytes are available for error checking purposes the length field should always be multiple of the pattern block size ie 3 and pattern byte bltwlsed anded with the mask byte should always yield the pattern byte as an example suppose one wants to match any packet having an ip id field of 0x1234 the ip id field is 2 bytes long occurring at offsets 4 and 5 bytes from the start of the ip header then the following data field would be used lbyte length pattern block lbyte offset lbyte mask lbyte pattern pattern block 2 classification top secret comint xi fashioncleft_protocoldoc page 21 of 26 6 1 8 240 gxff 0x12 drv fm nsacssm 1232 dated 24 feb 98

ssi this method implements static pattern matching against specified subset of ip4tcpudp header fields this method is geared toward the use of the typical 5tuple of fields used by ip and tcp or udp in addition it has the capability to handle both sides of the traffic ie it allows the sourcedestination address and port fields to be toggled ssi note the twosided sourcedestination toggling described below should normally not be used normally only single sided pattern should be specified if togging is used there will be way for the shellgrey reconstruction tags to correctly reconstruct the ip or transport header since the same reconstruction tags would be applied for both directions ie ab and b would be received as ax and b x but would reconstructed using the same value for x the toggling mode can only be used if the ip and transport headers will be dropped ssi the contents of the data field are used to specify the subset of fields and associated patterns for matching against received packets the rationale for having this method is the belief that it may often be the case that collection can be done based on the standard 5tuple used for iptcpudp uniqueness for this selector the data field will always contain the following 24 bytes lbyte length number of bytes following this field 23 lbyte mask indicates fieldstoggles to be used bit 0 mask 0x01 if set match on protocol field bit 1 mask 0x02 if set match on destination ip address note there is only one destination ip address and this match is not useful when the destination ip address must be overwritten with particular forwarding ip address bit 2 mask 0x04 if set match on source ip address field use first source ip field if bit 5 of mask is unset use both source ip fields if bit 5 of mask is set bit 3 mask 0x08 if set match on destination port fields only use first destination port field if bit 6 of mask is unset use both destination port fields if bit 6 of mask is set note if set then theres an implied match of either udp or tcp on ip protocol field bit 4 mask 0x10 if set match on source port fields only use first source port field if bit 7 of mask is unset use both source port fields if bit 7 of mask is set note if set then theres an implied match of either udp or tcp on ip protocol field bit 5 mask 0x20 if set then allow source ip address to toggle between the two alternatives classification top

handle both sides of tcpudp connection given that the destination ip address will typically be fixed to be the forwarding ip address the only fields that can toggle are the source ip address destination and source ports this method allows any or all of those fields to toggle when toggling checks are being done only the corresponding toggling fields should be used eg srcipl dstportl and srcportl would be three values of the 5tuple if all are being used and all are allowed to toggle and srclp2 dstport2 and srcport2 would be the three toggled values of the 5tuple if all are being used
