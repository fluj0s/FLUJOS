usne0005b is revision of the base network usne0005a the modification incorporated in usne0005b pr ovides the e2cs transmit participation in npg 11 imagery e2c platforms must use th is network if required to participate in npg 11 all other platforms may operate from the base network usne0005a both networks are fully interoperable since the network for ec08 was already in di stribution prior to the decision by sentinel to participate and there will not be any uk nimrods participating in ec08 uk sentinel will be platform substituted acro ss the board for the uk nimrod allocations in the network uk sentinel is authorized id sets 19 and 20 per the inde file and ndd for network usne0005a supporting ec08 idsets 19 and 20 are available at uk sentinels discretion for sentinal load files to participate in ec08 four flight of f 16cj will be included the ndd will not change connectivity for the f16cj is similar to the f15e and the network f ile has been sent to the us af ndf for them to

ships must ter an air control op tion to successfully load and initialize the network therefore operators of model 45 uyk43 ships should enter air control option 1 while this w ill support the

dedicated slot reuse wh two data forwarders are employed simultaneously they must be odd and even sequence numbered units data may be lost if they both have odd or they bo th have even user sequence
