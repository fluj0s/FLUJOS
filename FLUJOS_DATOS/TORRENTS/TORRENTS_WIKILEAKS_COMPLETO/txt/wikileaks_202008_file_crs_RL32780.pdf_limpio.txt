110th congress summary enacted in 1966 after 11 years of inves tigation legislative development and deliberation in the house and lf as many years of such consideration in the senate the freedom of information act foia di splaced the ineffective public information section of the administrative procedure act the foia was designed to enable any person individual or corporate regardless of citizenship to request without explanation or justificati on presumptive access to existin g identifiable unpublished executive branch agency records on any topic the statute specified nine categories of information that may be permissibly exempted from the rule of disclosure disputes over the accessibility of requested records could be ultimately settled in court not supported as legislation or enthusiastically received as law by the executive branch the foia was subsequently refi ned with direct amendments in 1974 1976 1986 and 1996 the stat ute has become somewhat popular tool of inquiry and information gathering for various quarters of american society the press business scholars attorneys consumers and envi ronmentalists among others as well as some foreign interests the response to request may involve few sheets of paper several linear feet of records or perhaps information in an electronic format such responses require staff time search and duplication efforts and other resource commitments agency information management professionals must efficiently and economically service foia requests doing so of late in the sensitized homeland security milieu requesters must be

embodiment of the peoples right to know about the activities and operations of government the freedom of information act foia statutorily established premise of presumptive public access to information held by the federal departme nts and agencies enacted in 1966 to replace the ineffective public information section of the adminis trative procedure act apa the foia allows any person individual or corporate regardless of citizenship to request without explanation or justification existing identifiable unpublished agency records on any topic1 at the time of its enactment the foia was regarded as somewhat revolutionary development only two other nations sweden and finland had comparable law and in neither case was it as sweeping as the new american model the laws premise revers ed the burden of proof that had existed under the public information section of the apa under the previous arrangement requesters had to establish basis for thei r plea or need for the information being sought whereas under the foia accessibility was presumed and the agencies had to justify denying requester access in w hole or in part to information the foia provided clear exceptions allowing explicit ty pes of information to be protected from disclosure while the apa section which wa s vague had come to be interpreted so as to give the agencies broad discretion to withhold information sought by the public furthermore the apa section was silent regarding the possibility of the denial of request for information being pursued in court the foia specified this course of action after the exercise of an administrative appeal the foia was also revolutionary in nother regard the product of 11 years of investigation legislative velopment and deliberation in the house and half as many years of such consideration in the senate the statute was almost exclusively congressional creation ind eed department or agen cy head had supported the legislation and president lyndon b johnson had reluctantly signed the measure unceremoniously at the last possible mo ment under strong pressure from press organizations2 because it was not enthusiastically received as law by the executive branch the foia required close attention by congressional overseers during its initial years of administration and was subsequently refined with direct amendments in 1974 1976 1986 and 1996 while agency hostility to the statute diminished with the ensuing years there is occasional latent evidence that its requirements are sometimes regarded in some agencies as secondary to their mission programs also there may be some agency dislike of the fo ia because agency careerists consider the statute intrusive providing means for outsiders to ques tion secondguess or delay administrative actions and policymakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32780crs2 3 see us congress senate committee on the judiciary the power of the president to withhold information from congress committee print 85th cong 2nd sess

agencies of the federal executive branch this sc ope has been shaped by historical and constitutional factors during the latte r half of the 1950s when congressional subcommittees began examining government information availability the practices of the federal departments nd agencies were of primary attention complaints from the public and the press guided this focu s as did the experience of congressional committees and subco mmittees of being rebuffed when seeking information from these entities the president might have been of interest in this regard but his exercise of socalled executive privilege the withholding of information based upon his authority as the head of the executive branch was matter of some constitutional complexity and uncertainty and had not re sulted in widespread public protest3 the accessibility of federal court reco rds was not an issue congressional information practices might have been scrutinized but the subcommittees probing the executive branch in this regard lacked jurisdiction for the legislative branch in his inaugural 1955 hearing representative john moss chairman of the newly created special subcommittee on government information delineated the situation saying we are not studying the availability of information from congress although many comments have been made by the press in that field but we are taking long hard look at the amount of information available from the executive and independent agencies for both the public and its elected representatives4 eleven years after that hearing the remedying foia was made applicable only to the federal departments nd agencies the historical record underlying the foia and continuing executive privilege consid erations contributed to the president being left outside of the scope of the ne w law also while the historical record underlying the foia also contributed to both the legislative and judicial branches being left outside of the scope of the stat ute it was thought by some as well that in the case of congress glossings of the secret journal clause or the speech or debate clause of the constitution5 might be impediments to the effective application of the foia to congress6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32780crs3 6 continued 1979 washington gpo 1979 harold c relyea public access to congressional records present policy and reform considerations government
