site assistance visit sav is part of suit of vulnerability identification and assessment tools developed by the us department of homeland security dhs the sav is risk based assessment that has been applied to facilities across all 17 critical infrastructures and key resources in addition to collecting information on physical secu rity characteristics and vulnerabilities at critical infrastructure facilities two additional elemen ts of the sav methodology include enumerating commendable actions and options for consideration the commendable acti ons represent the sav teams observation of site specific best protective measures in place while options for consideration represent potential strategies for enhancing the security posture of the facility this paper provides insights or lesso ns learned gained from an indepth data mining effort of all sav reports and from an evaluation of the commendable actions and options for consideration taken from savs conducted at schools between october 2004 and november 2005 the sample of sav schools has th following general characteristics 35 schools five collegesunivers ities and 30 kindergarten through 12 th grade k12 schools statistical analysis is limited to elementary nd secondary schools due to the limited number of colleges and the diversity of the group 17 private and 13 public schools all of the private schools ve religious orientation 15 elementary kindergarten through 7th grade and 15 secondary schools grades 812 all but two of the schools are located within uasi districts limited geographic

protective measures the sav information includes physical security characteristics as we ll as threatspeci fic factors of susceptibility schools use variety of measures and pr actices intended to promote the safety of students and staff the appropriate level of security and ty pes of protective measures may vary widely depending upon number of factors some of th factors that impact the security decisions at schools are listed below age and type of construction layout of the buildings local demographics physical location urban suburban rural state and local regulations level of school elementary secondary postsecondary type of school public private secular nonsecular enrollment for official use only schools lessons learned infrastructure assurance center page 3 of 11 for official use only key statistics the following are some of the key findings based on the sav sample1 schools emphasize access control measures to maintain safe environment for students ninety percent of the schools in the sav sample use on or more protective measures to limit access to school buildings the following are some of the access control measures in place along with the percent of schools visitor signin procedures 60 studentstaff id badges 47 monitored building entrances 33 visitor signin procedures may in clude protocols such as id ch ecks visitor badging and escort requirements in addition it was generally found that staff was required to wear badges while students were only required to ca rry their schoolissued id access control to school buildings is top concern of school administrators with near ly 17 of the schools usi ng all three measures schools with higher enrollments are more likely than schools with lower enrollments to use access control measures using student enrollment data in conjunction with the sav sample data it is possible to determine the number of students protected by inplace protective measures in all cases the percent of st udents protected by one of the access control measures exceeds the percent of schools reporting th use of those measures relative to other protective measures schools ve not put an emphasis on vehicle control twenty percent or less of the sav schools employed measures to mitigate the vulnerability to or consequence from vbied as shown in figure 2 two types of vbied threat were considered parking an explosiveladen vehicl in close proximity to the targ et building and ramming into congested building or area possible protective measures for these two vbied threats include those that increase standoff distance such as bollards jersey barriers planters and parking restrictions and those that limit avenues of highspeed approach schools generally rely on staff emplo yees to provide security presence over 60 percent of schools in the sav sample have visible secu rity presence provided by employees contract guards or stationed local law enforcement the overwhelming majority of schools nearly 80 rely on staff employees for security only four of the schools in the sav sample used both an employee guard force and local law enforcemen t presence figure 3 show s the distribution of types of security personnel public schools are more likely than private sc hools to have visibl security presence the results of the sav sample indicate that security presence varies by type of school ie public vs private in the sav sample 85 of the public schools were protecte d by security force compared to 47 for private schools 1 findings are based on the 30 primary and secondary schools that participated in the sav program and are not representative sample of the population of primary and secondary schools for official use only schools lessons learned infrastructure assurance center page 4 of 11 for

typically are not monitore d and are primarily used for afterincident review rather than for preventionresponse schools use alarm and intrusion tection systems to provide pe rimeter and interior

measures such as access control protocols visible security presence and intrusion detection systems to provide safe school environment and protect school assets however because scho ols differ by type private vs public student composition primarysecondary size geographic locati on and building characterist ics there is single approach to security the commenda ble actions and suggested security enhancements are tools that school administrators can use in developi ng an appropriate combination of pr otective measures given the threat environment and funding constraints
