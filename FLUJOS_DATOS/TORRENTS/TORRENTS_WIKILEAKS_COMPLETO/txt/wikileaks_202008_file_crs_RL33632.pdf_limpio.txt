resources and environmental policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632clean air permitting status of implementation and issues summary the 1990 clean air act amendments requi re major industrial sources of air pollutants to obtain federal operating permits these permits authorized in title v of the act are intended to enhance envi ronmental compliance by detailing for each covered facility all of the emission control requirements to which it is subject title v also was intended to generate permit fees that would be used by state and local permitting authorities for administering the program implementation of these requirements affects nearly 17000 industrial sources of air emissions as well as state and local air pollution control agencies adding these provisions to the act was controversial and imp lementation too has ge nerated controversies the environmental protection agency pa issued title v regulations in 1992 aspects of those rules particularly concerning procedures to modify permits have been contentious since then epa has cons idered number of regulatory revisions but has not finalized any modifications ho wever epa has issued white papers and number of formal and informal guidan ce documents that together with the 1992 rules comprise the agencys current interpretation of statutory and regulatory requirements because of regulatory and program pproval delays state and local agencies were slow to begin issuing title v permits falling far short of statutory deadlines and epas goals as of march 2000 for exampl less than 45 of all required title v permits had been issued according to an epa inspector general report key factors that delayed issuance of permits included insufficient state resources complex epa rules and limited guidance and conflicting state priorities according to epa as of january 2008 99 of all required original permits had been issued and permit reissuance required after five years and modification have replaced issuance of initial permits as the major ongoing task of permitting agencies eighteen years after congress enacted title v the program has reached some maturity and most stakeholders agree that at least some of the benefits identified by congress have been achieved such as in corporation of applicable air pollution control requirements in sing document that is accessibl to regulators the public and industrial sources at the same time there also is widespread dissatisfaction with the programs complexity costs nd confusing requireme nts many believe that lack of epa guidance has contributed greatly to implementation problems congressional examination of title v has been limited since its enactment to several oversight hearings the most recent of which was

1990 clean air act caa amendments pl 101549 42 usc 7661 7661f was the co mprehensive per mit program established in title v of the act it was added to the caa to enhance compliance by detailing for each covered facility all the emission control requirements to which the facility is subject previously an industrial sources pollu tion control obligations ranging from emission controls and monitoring requi rements to recordkeeping and reporting requirements were scatte red throughout numerous of ten hardtofind provisions of state plans or various federal regula tions while approximately 35 states or localities had operating permit programs before 1990 they varied considerably and few were as comprehensive as the new title v program adding these provisions to the caa was controversial and implementation too s generated c ontroversies congress intent in creating the operating permits program was to 1 better enforce the requirements of the law by pplying them more clearly to individual sources and allowing better tracking of co mpliance and 2 provide an expedited process for implementing new control requirements benefits of the air permit program were expected to include clarif ication of pollution control requirements simplification of procedures for modifying sources control obligations augmenting state resources through permit fees and enhancing states ability to administer other significant new caa responsibilities ch as the air toxics and acid depos ition programs1 this report describes the statutory b ackground of the title v program and the status of implementation in terms of federal approval of state and local permitting authorities and permit issuance it also discusses broad policy issues identified by various stakeholders including program co mplexity and costs and inconsistencies due to lack of sufficient federal guidance major features of the op erating permits program prior to the 1990 amendments this law required individual fe deral permits only for construction of new or modified industr ial sources of air pollutants existing sources did not have to obtain permits unless they were subsequently modified and increased their air emissions title v which was modeled after similar program in the clean water act expanded the number of sources requiring federal permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs2 2 nonattainment areas are regions that have failed to attain and maintain one or more national ambient air quality standard naaqs epa has prom ulgated naaqs for six air pollutants sulfur dioxide particulate matter nitrogen dioxide carbon monoxide ozone and lead for background information see crs report rl30853 clean air act summary of the act and its major requirements coordinated by james mccarthy 3 new source performance standards establish nationally uniform technologybased maximum emission levels for categories of new major stationary sources such as powerplants steel mills etc the goal is to force the installation of new pollution control technology and thus prev ent new pollution problemsby stipulating that all major pollution s ources and other designated sources must obtain operating permits which permitting agencies will use to ensure compliance with the caa operating permits are now an important tool in the overall compliance and enforcement aspects of the caa because permits cont ain the plans and schedules for sources to reach attainment with pr ovisions of the act plus emission limitations and monitoring requirements further they are enforceable meaning that epa states or citizens may take action to require source to achieve compliance with the terms of its permit the environmental protection agency epa estimates that nearly 17000 industrial sources are subject to title v these specifically include major sources defined as stationary facilitie s that emit or have the poten tial to emit 100 tons or more per year of any regulated pollutant or co mbination of pollutants and sources subject to the acts acid rain provisions title v also covers sources in nonattainment areas2 that emit as little as 10 tons per year of volatile organic compounds vocs depending on the regions nonattainment status sources subject to new source performance standards nsps3 regulated sources of air toxics emissions any source that emits more than 10 tons per year of an indi vidual hazardous pollutant or more than 25 tons per year of any combination and sources required to have new s ource or modification permits under title i of the act permits compile in single document all of the enfor ceable emission limitations and standards plus inspection monitoring compliance certification and reporting requirements for the source but they are not intended to change or alter the existing underlying requirements or dd any substantive requirement s they are issued for fiveyear periods and must be renewed thereafter title v is intended to be primarily staterun program it provides two incentives in this regard 1 permitting agencies are able to use permit fees collected from sources to run their permit programs and 2 epa will implement federal operating program if state fails to do so in many cases states delegate to local programs the responsibility for implementin g the operating permits programs for example 34 local authorities implement the permit program in california rather thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs3 4 the fee amount considered sufficient to fund all permit program costs sometimes called the presumptive minimum has been adjusted for inflation by epa over the years the current presumptive minimum amount in eff ect through august 31 2009 is 4375 per ton of regulated pollutant states are not require d to adopt the presumptive minimum fee ratea single state agency in other locations for example tennessee arizona washington and idaho local authorities implement the prog ram in parts of state and the state regulatory agency has re sponsibility in the rest of the state permitting agencies are required to collect permit fees sufficient to cover the cost of the permit program and the fees may be used only for administering the program the act requires that the fee schedule be set so as to collect from all sources in the aggregate not less than 25 per ton of each regulated pollutant to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of administering the program4 regulated pollutants include vocs national ambient air quality standard pollutants except carbon monoxide and pollu tants regulated under the hazardous air pollutant and nsps provisions of the act epa regulations epa issued regulations to implement the permit program requirements in july 1992 40 cfr part 70 seven months afte r the statutory deadline the part 70 rules cover the minimum elements of state permit programs rules promulgated in february 1999 40 cfr pa rt 71 cover federal per mitting on indian reservations and in any state that fails to adopt or implement an approva ble title v program while state and local agencies primarily implement the title v program the caa provides for epa oversight of permitting programs and gives epa the right to review permit applications and object to proposed title v per mits defining the parameters of this oversight has been source of tens ion among epa states and industry one overarching issue has been the question of deve loping permits with sufficient flexibility to allow for the fact that industrial sources often change their operations thus affecting air emissions in response to marketpl ace signals and they want to be able to do so quickly wit hout needing revised permit for every such change the public also has an important role in the permitting process because citizens may submit comments nd request hearing on draf t permits further under caa section 505b any person may petition epa to object to issuance of permit and section 502b6 requires that there be an opportunity for judicial review in state court of final permit actions by the applicant persons who participated in the public comment process and any other person w ho could obtain judicial review of such actions under state laws the 1992 regulations were challenged by environmentalists states and industry mostly over details concerni ng permit revisions in response in august 1994 epa proposed modifications intended to addre ss some of the biggest issues those proposed changes were not widely accepted by states and industry however and epa took additional steps to streamline the permit programs since 1994 epa has worked with states industry and environm entalists to reach consensus on key issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs4 and has issued and redraft ed several regulatory pr oposals but has not finalized modifications to part 70 thus the 1992 rules remain in effect the focus of efforts to revise the rules has been on how to streamline aspects of the regulations concerning permit modifications and revisions according to epa officials the 1992 regulations give states ample flexibility to write permits that allow for minor operational changes by industry nd to process permit modifications still efforts to revise those rules have been driven by concerns of many permitting authorities and industrial sources that th current rules do not allow sufficient flexibility one issue that has been particularly contentious concerns the procedures and amount of public review required for re latively minor modifications at emissions sources at issue have been the definition and criteria for facility changes that are neither so minor that little or review will be required nor clearly so environmentally significant that full epa review and public comment will be appropriate epa tinued internal and external disc ussions on revising the part 70 rules for some time but by early 2005 agency officials apparently had ceased these activities however these efforts may be revived as epa considers and responds to recommendations for impr ovements to the permit prog ram made in 2006 by title v task implementation force discussed below during the lengthy consideration of po ssible part 70 rule changes epa issued guidance in the form of white papers to address some implementation issues that had been raised such as permit revisions epas role in reviewing permits administrative complexity etc the first was issued in july 1995 concerning streamlining to reduce costs and paperwork and the second in march 1996 concerning overlapping federal and state requirements third white paper concerni ng options for operational flexibility was drafted in mid2000 but wa s criticized by environmentalists and some state officials and was not issued in addition epa has issued some formal guidance on specific implementation issues status of the permit program and permit issuance under the caa all states and territories were to submit operating permit programs by november 15 1993 once st ate or localitys pr ogram was approved epa had one year to review the applica tion major industrial sources had 12 months to submit permit applications to the stat or local authority and permitting agencies had three years to issue permits to applicants as of june 1997 epa had approved pe rmit programs for all 114 submissions by states local agencies and territories epa gave full approval to some but the majority 99 programs were interim approvals meaning that the program substantially but not fully met the requi rements of the caa and epa regulations the law allows epa to grant interim approval for two years during which time the permitting agency must correct deficiencies but can otherwise operate the program and issue permits at the end of two year s the interim program must be replaced by fully approved program otherwise epa must implement federal permitting program for the state or locality despite the language of the statute epa administratively granted extensions of the interim program approva ls on four occasions between 1995 and 2000 and did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs5 implement federal program during this time the agency was considering changes to the part 70 rules and argued that it would be most efficient to allow permitting authorities to combine program revisions with those required by whatever new part 70 rules might be issued without extens ion interim authority would expire and epa would be required to take over the program situation not viewed as desirable by epa or states in ma 2000 epa issued final extension until december 1 2001 for 86 operating permit prog rams that still lacked full approval stating that further extensions woul d be approved but environmental groups which had criticized th multiple extensions challenged this acti on seeking to strengthen permit programs and to force epa to take over deficient state and local programs as the caa requires to settle this lawsuit epa modified its regulations to clarify that federal permitting program would apply in any area without fully approved program as of december 1 2001 when that deadline arrived epa gave final approval to all but few of the 86 state and local programs that still had interim approval in one case connecticut outsta nding issues were soon resolved and epa granted full approval in may 2002 in s econd case maryland further action by the legislature was required to resolve remain ing problems epa gave final program approval there in january 2003 epa took over these programs in december 2001 but it delegated permittin g responsibility to the states and did not actually issue any permits in the interim while federal approval was pending at the same time that it announced ttlement of the lawsuit december 2000 epa also announced 90 day period for public comment on program andor implementation deficiencies of operating programs rega rdless of approval status ultimately after reviewing comments on number of individual state and local programs epa issued notices of deficien cy nods to eight states 34 local air permitting authorities in california and the district of columbia directing them to correct regulatory program deficiencies within 18 months as the caa requires separately epa obtained commitment letters from nearly two dozen state and local permitting authorities that agreed to address certain actions relating to implementation issues identified by epa ie less significant than regulatory issues for programs that received nods acco rding to epa the identified nod issues have been resolved with all state and cal agencies in one case involving hawaii the deficiency was corrected but epa has not yet published federal register notice to that effect in may 2005 epa issued nod to maricopa county az for deficiencies related to pe rmit fees and permit processi ng this nod has not yet been resolved environmentalists believe that epa acted improperly in allowing programs to operate despite deficiencies but they we re unsuccessful in lawsuits challenging number of the epa program approvals in part because of the regulatory nd program approval delays state and local agencies were slow to begin issuing t itle v permits in early 1998 epa surveyed states and epa regions and found that onl about 2100 permits had been issued as of december 1997 compared with an estima ted 11000 that should have been issued in march 1999 epa proposed an ambitious go of resolving the permit backlog by the end of 2000 permit issuance increased but it continued to fa ll far short of the statutory deadlines and epas goals as of march 2000 42 of all required title v permits had been issued as of marc h 2001 57 had been issued while there were consequences for permitting author

receive title v permits due to state and local agencies delays the principal consequence was delay in attaining the policy objectives intended by congress when it established the title v program an epa inspector general ig report issued in march 2002 criticized epa and state and local agencies over the prog rams continuing problems the ig noted that as of december 31 2001 30 of require d permits had not been issued and only four state and 17 local agencies had issued all of their title v permits key factors delaying the issuance of permits included insufficient state resources complex epa regulations and limited guidance and conflicting state priorities the ig reported5 consequence of those delays is that th benefits that cong ress intended the permit program to achieve have not been realized according to the igs analysis according to epa as of january 2008 12 years af ter the first program approvals 99 of all original permits require d for 16726 title v sources had been issued after that initial process the ongoing task of permit reissuance required after five years and modification has become the focus of most permittin g authorities attention nationally every year ther are about 100 new sources required to obtain initial permits and about 3000 sources requi red to obtain renewal permits issues eighteen years after congress enacted title v the program has reached some maturity and most stakeholders agree that at least some of the objectives and benefits identified by congress have been achieved incorporating applicable requi rements in one document that consolidates duplicative and redundant requirements is beneficial to regulatory agencies the pub lic and regulated sources establishment of funding mechan ism provides resources to state and local

strengthened penaltyenforcemen t mechanism have improved public participation has improved at various stages of the permitting process at the same time there also is widespread dissatisfaction with the program as it exists today due to program complexity confusion and uncerta inty about some of its requirements and criticism of costs to regulated entities permit agencies and even the general public while many believe that the permit program has clarified requirements and fostered consistency and fairness in regulatory treatment of sources others argue otherwise saying that permits suffer from excessive length and increased complexity benefits are more likely to be observed in states and localitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs7 6 us environmental protection agency offi ce of the

questioned more vigorously where such program previous ly did exist likewise views are mixed on whether the title v program has resulted in air quality and health benefits arguably this was not an objective because title v is an administrative program and was not intended to have direct imp act on emissions permitting agencies however say that many major sources ve voluntarily restricted their operating conditions or installed pollution controls in order to reduce emissions below the title v regulatory thresholds thus becoming what is often referred to as synthetic minors see discussion on page 9 whic h is plus for the environment critiques of the title v program are refl ected in march 2005 report of the epa inspector general6 and in 2006 report by task force on title v implementation experience that was convened by epas clean air act advisory committee the task force consisting of state and local permitting agency industry and environmental advocacy group representa tives developed an extensive list of recommendations for improving the program which it believed c ould be implemented under current legislative nd regulatory authority7 complexity and cost prior to establishment of the title v program major sources of air pollution were not required to have federally enforceable operating permits regulatory requirements for these sources typically derive from multiple provisions of the caa and were often scattered among multiple documents thus complicating efforts to determine compliance and to provide effective enforcement of the law consolidating existing re quirements some dating from the 1970s into single comprehensive document while undoubtedly beneficial also has resulted in permits that are length and detailed making it diffi cult to read them without precise knowledge of the individual sources operations according to some stakeholders many issues have arisen including what level of detail must be incorporated in title v permit versus str eamlining or simplifying th permit how should small and insignificant emissions sources be treated and how will newly issued caa requirements such as hazardous air polluta nt standards be inco rporated another issue is the extent to which permitting agencies can adapt or update sources existing requirements particularly those that were established many years earlier so as to reflect its current operating conditions without resulting in changes that exceed the scope of title v since the permit program was intended to consolidate but not substantively alter regulatory requirements title v was not intended to affect the stringency of requirements incorporated into permit but stakeholders disagree on whether actions such as the addition of new monitoring or new compliance methods affect stringency or are sometimes tantam ount to creating new substantive requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs8 8 us environmental protection agency perating permit programs and prevention

concern for epa states regulated industries and environmen tal advocacy groups has been the issue of operational flexibility in operating permits the concept of allowing for operational change at facility while assuring compliance with applicable requirements and ensuring environmental protection epa addressed the issue in the 1992 part 70 regulations and subsequent guidance especially 2000 draft white paper also beginning in 1993 epa sponsored flexible permitting p ilot program with i ndustrial facilities in 13 states in an effort to evaluate opport unities to design air permits to accommodate operational flexibility epa evaluated the economic and administr ative benefits of flexible permits and documented seve ral environmental performance benefits including emissions reductions based on its assessment of the pilots in september 2007 epa proposed rule to formalize certa in permitting flexibility in the title v rules8 epa officials expect to promul gate final rule by november 2008 industry groups generally be lieve that the regulatory burden and costs of the title v program outweigh the benefits and far exceed epa s estimate at the time the part 70 rules were adopted of 15000 average cost per facility nnually in addition to permit applications facilities incur recurring costs related to staffing permit changescorrections report preparation gal reviews and ma nagement reviews of compliance also some stakeholders nvironmental advocates for example argue that program cost is not significant issue when viewed in the context of cost as percentage of companys operating cost and that companies often benefit from the additional information gain ed through the program costs are continuing concern for state and local regulatory authorities with regard to increasing paperwork requirement s and the sufficiency of current permit fees having adequate resources to ad minister federal envir onmental programs is always an issue for states and localities especially in light of increasing program demands the title v permit fee requirement was intended to address that by ensuring that sufficient resources woul d be provided epa has not conducted comprehensive audit of permitting agency resources but available information such as the 2002 epa inspector generals repor t suggests that number of states perhaps many are not collecting sufficient fees to cover their costs which contributes to problems in hiring staff and processing permits in march 2007 an environmental advo cacy group the environmental integrity project released report which concluded that more than lf of the states have fee structures that do not meet federal min imum standards the report focused on 18 states in which fees fell below the federal minimum either because the states set lower emission fees or set ceiling on th amount that could be collected from each polluter that was lower than the federal presumptive minimum on at least the first 4000 tons of emissions of each pollutant c overed by title v pe rmit it estimated that these 18 states are undercharging re gulated sources by at least 53 million less than is required by the federal minimum st

management programs but that additional funding for example fro m epa caa grants also is needed it recommended that epa undertake comprehe nsive evaluation to ensure that low emission fees are not weakening the caa permit program or its enforcement9 one factor affecting fee revenues is the large number of sources that have lawfully opted out of the title v progra m epa originally estimated that about 37000 facilities nationwide would be subject to title v today the universe of title v sources is nearly 17000 and the others often termed synthetic minors have installed pollution control equipment or taken other steps to ensure that their emissions are below the title v threshold of what is major source for permitting agencies the resource issue is twofold first most agencies initially calculated fee amounts and revenues based on larger number of sources but actual revenues have been less since more than onehalf of sources have lawfully avoided title v coverage second these sources still represent regulatory workload in terms of nontitle v permitting separate state require ments and tracking which is unlikely to be covered fully by other fee reve nues or available funding getting state legislatures to approve fee increases to address these concerns is politically difficult in most cases confusing requirements nd limited epa guidance critiques of the title v program including the epa inspector generals reports and the title v task force report identify insufficient epa guidance as major implementation issue the igs 2005 report based on review of permits issued by several states found that permit clarity varies widely from state to state permit requirements are often vaguely stated or identified by refere nce to other documents without narrative description or precise cita tion epa regulations require that the permitting authority prepare statement for each draft permit to t forth the legal and factual basis of the permit but the ig found that such statements often are inadequate or totally missing from its review the ig concluded that many of these problems stem from lack of epa guidance on key issues which results in permitting inconsistencies and contributes to permitting delays that adversely affect sources agencies and the public the ig strongly recommended that epa issue nationwide guidance on number of topics including requirements for the statement of basis in permits requirements for content of annual compliance certifications by corporate officials and applicability of sanctions for unresolved program deficiencies in order to achieve more national cohesion and consistency in title v permits epa has issued very limited formal guidance and rules on title v in the past several years in lieu of formal guid ance epa has relied on responses to citizen petitions and letters to regions and pe rmitting authorities to convey its position on key title v issues arguing that this strategy allows for flexibility that reflects differences in source complexity10 some stakeholders are concerned that rather than resolving program issues through rulemaking or nationally applicable

the petition process and other mechanisms not just to apply law to facts but to make law in the first instance the change away from issuing national rules or guidance occurred following federal court decision which vacated 1998 epa guidance document on periodic monito ring in that case the court ruled that the agency had exceeded its author ity by utilizing nonbinding guidance rather than national rulemaking to interpret regulatory requirements appalachian power co v epa 208 f3d 1015 dc cir 2000 the ig noted that permitting authorities may be unwilling to follow or be unaware of guidance that isnt national in scope one example of the issue of lack of epa guidance relates to incorporation of monitoring requirements in permits one of the most contentious issues in title v implementation the caa ma ndates that permits include monitoring and reporting requirements to assure compliance with permit terms and conditions in the 1992 part 70 rules epa required that permits include all monitoring and test methods detailed in the applicable underlying requirements eg in nsps or hazardous air pollutant standards incorporated in th title v permit in addition where an underlying applicable requirement does not require periodic monitoring part 70 requires that periodic monitoring be specified in the title v permit the 2005 epa ig report found that specifi cation of monitoring requirements was one of the most significant areas of inconsistency in permits and that number of stakeholders and epa re gional officials contend that more epa guidance on these issues is needed the title v monitoring rules and specifically the application of periodic monitoring requirements in permits have been subject to several epa interpretations the most recent is december 2006 interpretive rule11 and to litigation challenging those interpretations in cases asking the court to determine the meaning of the periodic monitoring rule and related regulato ry language and to determine the consistency of the rules as interpreted by epa with the statutory requirements in august 2008 federal appeals court vacated the 2006 rule as inconsistent with the clean air act12 according to the 2006 title v task force report stakeholders funda mentally disagree on the statutory and regulatory requirements and particularly on whether permitting authorities may or must depending on ones perspective specify new or revised emissions monitoring requirements in permits13 the 2006 rule which the appeals court struck down in 2008 had said that contrary to prior po licy state and local authorities could not require supplemental monitoring in cases wh ere existing monitoring is inadequate to ensure compliance with the clean air act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33632crs11 14 title v task force final

implementation of this program14 responding to the task force report in september 2006 epa officials id entified number of prioritie s and next steps over the next one to two years the agency will work with states to identify best practices such as standards for granting public h earing providing written responses to public comments and coordination of title i and title v process over the next one to three years epa will review existing guidance and issue new guidance as appropriate concerning clarification of the permit revision process and permit reopening and clarification of certain statements required in draft permits finally epa will initiate rulemakings to address several concerns such as clarifying when insignificant activities are exempt from permits and allowing alternatives to newspapers for public notice requirements rulemakings could take three years or more epa said other priorities incl ude improving online notice and access to documents and improving the epa petitions website15 in january 2008 epa officials reportedly told an industry group that the agency is working on proposed rule and guidance document in partial response to the task force report the streamlining pr oposal and guidance are expected to address number of issues but only small percentage of the task forces recommendations including the type of emission units that must be included in permit the effectiveness of the public notice process nd the complexity and length of the permits the proposed rule which is expected to be proposed early in 2009 also is expected to remove insignificant emission units from the title v permit process allow the use of online public tices instead of newspaper notices and clarify the use of administrative amendments and minor permit revisions congressional oversight of the title v program has been limited to hearings by house energy and commerce subcommittee and senate environment and public works subcommittee in mid1995 and nate environment subcommittee field hearing in 2000 that addresse d title v and other caa issu so far congress has not considered statutory changes that would affect the title v requirements these issues could draw greater cong ressional scrutiny in the future
