three strikes law to term of imprisonment of 25 years to life the california court of appeals for the second distri ct in an unpublished opinion rejected ewings argument that the sentence amounted to cruel and unus ual punishment and affirmed the judgment of the trial court people v ewing 2001 wl 1840666 calapp apr 25 2001 the united states supreme court granted cer tiorari to hear the case on

excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishment s inflicted usconst amend v iii the cruel and unusual punishments clause is binding on the states through the fourteenth amendment robinson v california 370 us 660 66667 1962 the court has experienced considerable difficulty in formulating test or series of tests for when punishment is cruel and unusual in the early 1980s the court attempted to clarify the question of when recidivist sentencing statute implicates the clause rummel v estelle 445 us 263 1980 found cruel and unusual punishment infirmity in the sentence of mandatory life imprisonment imposed under texas habitual offender statut for false pretense conviction involving 12075 and based on prior convictions for cr edit card fraud 80 and check forgery 2836 scarcely three years later solem v helm 463 us 277 1983 came to the opposite conclusion on seemingly comparable facts helm was sentenced to life imprisonment following his bad check conviction 100 on th basis of three prior burglary convictions and convictions for grand larceny false pret enses and driving while intoxicated the court determined that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the bad check conviction was cruel and unusual punishment 463 us at 292303 the difference between rummel and helm helm was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole rummel was sentenced to life but eligible for parole in 12 years at the latest 463 us at 297 another difference was the test the c ourt used to judge the sentence solem saw cruel and unusual punishments as punishments that were gro ssly disproportionate to the crime of conviction judged by i the grav ity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty ii the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction and iii the sentences imposed for commission of the sa crime in other ju risdictions 463 us at 292 rummel found limitations in these intrastate and multistate comparative analyses eg 445 us at 282 absent constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of federalism some state will always bear the distinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any other state in fact in later case justice scalia went so far as to say that rummel had rejected the three part test that solem embraced harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 962 1991 scalia j with rehnquist chj in any event harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 1991 soon made it clear that sentence without the possibility of parole is not per cruel and unusual and that gross disproportionality judged by the solem three part standard is not the sole means of surviving cruel and unusual punishment cha llenge harmelin was large scale drug trafficker with prior convictions who d been sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole majority of the justices rejected harm elins cruel and unusual punishment clause claim they could not agr ee on why justice scalia and chief justicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21346crs4 rehnquist refused to accept proportionality st andard gross or otherwise 501 us at 965 justices kennedy oconnor and souter who joined justice scalia and the chief justice in upholding harmelins sentence nd the statute under which it was imposed felt that the deference owed the legislative policy decisions of the states and the enormity of the crime precluded any finding that harme lins sentence might be cruel and unusual punishment 501 us at 1008 kennedy j with oconnor and souter jj andrade and ewing federal law limits review of state court decisions under beas corpus to instances where state court consideration of constitutional claim resulted in decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable app lication of clearly tablished federal law as determined by the supreme court of th united states 28 usc 2254d1 this doomed andrades challenge in the eyes of ma jority of the court in the opinion for the court justice oconnor explained that the only relevant clearly established law amendable to the contrary to or unreasona ble application framework is the gross disproportionality principle th precise contours of which ar unclear applicable only in the exceedingly rare and extreme case 123 sct at 1173 the facts in andrade fell between rummel and solem the california courts coul d not be said to have acted contrary to supreme court precedent for following rummel nor to have unreasonably applied it to andrade when they rejected his eighth amendment attack on the application of the three strikes law to him 123 sct at 1173 four justices dissented joining justice souters opinion they contended that the facts in andrade were virtually indistinguishable from those in the more recently decided solem 123 sct at 1176 the california decisions were contrary to and should have been controlled by solem like the life sentence without the prospect of parole in solem the 50 year sentence with the prospect of paro at age 87 should have been considered grossly disproportionate 123 sct 1176177 ewing split the five member andrade majority justice oconnor with whom chief justice rehnquist and justice kennedy join ed concluded that ewings sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment was not grossly disproportionate and consequently was not contrary to the demands of the eighth amendment ewing v california 123 sct 1179 1190 justices scalia and thomas agreed w ith the result but not the rationale 123 sct at 1190 scalia j concurring in the judgme nt 123 sct at 1191 thomas j concurring in the judgement justice oconnors opinion turned on the gravity of ewings offense grand theft of property valued at nearly 1200 weighed down further by his numerous misdemeanor and felony offenses 123 sc at 1190 jus tices scalia and thom as found application of the grossly disproportionate st andard unworkable moreove r for justice scalia the proscriptions of the eighth amendments cr uel and unusual clause speak only to modes punishment 123 sct at 1190191 for justice thomas the clause simply contains proportionality principle 123 sct at 1191 the dissenters justices breyer stevens souter and ginsburg joined in two opinions one by justice breyer 123 sct at 1193 and the other by justice stevens 123 sct at 1191 justice breyer found within the courts precedents twopart test for determinations of whether particular punish ment was grossly disp roportionate 123 scthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21346crs5 at 1194195 first comes threshold comp arison of the crime committed and sentence imposed taking into consideration the length of the prison term in real time b the sentencetriggering criminal conduct and c the offenders criminal history 123 sct at 1194 second comes comparison of how other jurisdictions punish the same offense and how the same jurisdiction punishes other offenses 123 sct at 1197 ewings sentence under the california three strikes law fails under both counts for its comparative harshness as far as dissenters are concern deficiency that is aggravated in their minds by the fact that its special severity cannot be ju stified special criminal justice concerns 123 sct at 11991202 justice steven s dissent takes specific issue with the concurrences of justices s calia and thomas in justi ce stevens view proportionality review is not only capable of judicial application but also required by the eighth amendment123 sct at 1191192
