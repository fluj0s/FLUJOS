what auditing is and what it isnt lecture given on 25 february 1964 thank you i like you too im the first survivor to return from the battle of the goals plot the casualties have been pretty heavy pretty heavy but fortunately it is mostly in terms of gpms i was just telling reg that there isnt anybody could have done it and then he suddenly looked at and he says he says but you did it and i said yes i said thats the thats the joke but the progress is going along youre very lucky thats all ive got to say if any one of you had gone into this flying blind with your hands tied behind your back why you would have come up mass of putty trickery the actual gpm contains trickery treachery its wonder they never came apart wonder and thats why we teach class vi at saint hill and few years from now when there have been lot of saint hill graduates and lot of successes and weve made lot of ots and so forth several years from now why well let central orgs teach this stuff the franchised auditor who is sitting out there right now waiting for the next bulletin on class vi you see hes going to be very upset because i would just as soon place in his hands hand grenade with the pin drawn see you know here here you are you know you see as long as we were in old r3 we werent deep enough to do anything to anybody that was perfectly all right you couldnt mess anybody up at r3 r4 we were still running at too shallow draft to upset anybody moved into r6 you see and all of sudden you stand there looking at the real tiger these things had enough charge on them so then you could take off surface locks to tremendous degree and just as in processing level by level you can take off surface locks well so in these goals actual gpm processes you see you could also take them off at various levels so at r3 you find goal and run terminal oh theres nothing to that fairly safe you could do any of those variations because you really werent handling anything dont you see then you finally get down to you finally get down to oppose why you can run whole gpm on oppose you can find seventy items pc has tremendous numbers of cognitions everything happy and matter of fact i might even hand it out sometime as process you see let anybody run it you see wouldnt do him any damage lots of charge comes off lots of ta action you see now the moment that its moved into the bracket of solve the moment that you move it down toward command like solve on an actual gpm youre between the devil and the deep blue sea youre close enough to the real tiger so that he can knock your head off but not close enough so that you can get back at him so it becomes at that point very dangerous process now you take r6 where youre handling nothing but purebred bengal type tigers starved for long time and you take somebody that could have run the oppose line you see you take somebody that could have run the oppose line very easily you know find goal doesnt matter really if its the wrong goal right goal that wouldnt have upset him too much and he goes along that type that type auditor see and then you just nonchalantly say all right well just go through that door all right and you find there on your right youll find rather flimsy chair pick that up oh is that what im supposed to do yeah thats all youre supposed to do and then you lift the cage door at the far end and in come the tigers you see honest im not exaggerating im not exaggerating i have found enough aberration you often want to know if you want to know what it takes to make thetan aberrated you have to find enough aberration to account for the fact that powerful being would now be unpowerful see how would he get in that state well actually its direct proportion it takes as much aberration as he was powerful and theres that much aberration on the gpm actual gpm lineup i guarantee you there is enough and theres also quantitatively and qualitatively enough actually then the whole of auditing is simply peeling down toward these things from the first time you have person sit in his chair you see and itsa hes taken off some of the top crust and its perfectly safe on up to iv service facsimiles so forth its even safe into as i told you its even safe into finding goal and running oppose on the items perfectly safe nothing to that now you really got to be an expert from there on well this is just prelude to this lecture this has nothing to do with it i was just saying hello and telling you about where the score was about now we got it we got it licked theres doubt about that but them tigers the them tigers have got some pieces of cloth in their teeth all right whats the date audience twenty fifth twenty fifth its the 25th kidding twenty fifth of february ad 14 saint hill special briefing course student lecture all right weve got weve got some business today weve got some business to transact these are data vitally necessary to the auditing of class vi and if youre very clever you cannot do without them at the lower levels the main problem with the data im giving you is until you get to class vi you can sometimes get away with it at about level class iv is the first time you could start teaching it and it would be terribly useful at class i but you cant teach it at class i you can teach it and then the fellow will think he knows it but by the time hes gotten up to iii or iv why he would have to be taught it again because it would have brandnew values by the time he gets to vi he cant audit without it and thats very peculiar then to go into this level and youre about to see some of the very fundamental fundamentals of auditing which will explain to you why auditing has or has not worked here there and so on and which will be very valuable to you at any level that youre operating at in scientology so this lecture actually is useful for all levels and would be quite good at the lower levels but probably could only be taught at about level iv with any real comprehension and by the time you get up to levels v and vi becomes vital not slight because omission of this data brings about catastrophe now let us take this up then in very rat tat tat fashion and if you get this down if you get this all squared away and get this all aligned in anything under fifteen or twenty hours of study why ill be very proud of you because the first moment that you see this youll all say yes yes yes and then youll go tanglefoot with it because its this type of data its too simple i was tanglefooting suzie belle the other day with it so dont expect to grab it at the first brass ring first thing i want to tell you though is theres something here to grasp you have to grasp it with your total comprehension and its so confounded simple that see i was using very cruel example with her ill give you the same example here we have ronson lighter in little hide case all right now the task is to put the ronson lighter there on that paper you see and then put it over here on these pencils and then put the ronson lighter in the center of the desk now thats the totality of the operation see heh got this object here and we want to put it on this piece of paper then were going to move it over on top of these pencils and im going to put it in the center of the desk hm now let show you what happens with this operation we put it over here and we say is that over there and somebody were trying to train says yes but thats got hide case and you say yeah well thats thats true however i want you to put it down over here on this piece of paper yes but hide you know i imagine the ronson company must have some kind of contract with the indians up in alaska and you say yeah im sure they do sure they do yes but i want you to put it down over here on this paper yeah but you know there must be terrific amount of trouble portaging skins you know theyve got skin there and they must have that it must come from alaska there and they must have terrific time trying to get these skins down the river and i wonder what design the indians have on their paddles and you say all right that thats fine but all we want you to do is put this object on this piece of paper yeah but the ronson company doesnt make paper so when i tell you about the design on the indians paddles with regard to this while im giving you this lecture youll know what im talking about because you can make more complexity whenever you try to hand out an absolutely simple datum in its complete naked purity it of course blows more confusion in more directions than you can shake stick at and you just have to keep working with it now this actually is coached material until person can take this and ask the question and get the answer and theres design on the paddles that are coming down the yukon see they put you youll youll youve got future here in just this now lets just go at it hammer and pound let give you first very brief outline of what were going to do im going to teach you the difference between auditing and assessing destimulating and erasing the difference between present time problem and an arc break its just terribly elementary propositions and the targets of the auditor what he what he fronts all right that doesnt sound like very much does it but brother i know all right lets take up right away quick the last one i mentioned which is targets of the auditor the auditor has two targets he has the pc and he has the bank when that auditor speaks he is speaking to either the pc or the bank thats just crystal clear data thats two targets he says how are you feeling or he says catterwump he says catterwump and the bank goes crunch see he says how are you feeling and the pc says well lets see im feeling soandso and so on you understand there are two things that an auditor talks to two things one is the pc the other is the bank auditing is addressed on the auditing cycle to the pc and assessment is addressed to the bank once more very very simple nothing to this at all and youre saying catterwump cat whiskers bat fur and so forth youre talking to the bank and reading the result on the meter or reading the result on the pcs eyeballs i dont care what youre reading the result on but youre talking to the bank now you understand then that when you are talking to the pc when the auditor is addressing the pc that he very often restimulates the bank and he very often has an effect or an influence on the bank very often but that as does not debar it at all sometimes when assessing the pc talks and the auditor has to acknowledge the origin and so forth but these are separate actions and i if you could only see them as separate actions you would save yourself great deal of complexity in the matter all right now two targets the auditor has the target of the pc thetan or the bank very good there are therefore two types of processes but they are not processes one of them is not process at all and youre about to get your first headache is not auditing now what is auditing auditing is an operation which culminates in destimulation or erasure it has only two end products destimulation and erasure you can get the pc to dust himself off or you can use the pc like you would an ink eraser to scrub off the piece of bank that youre heading for in other words you can get the pc out of it or you can use the pc to wipe it out many auditors have the custom of using the pc to wipe out pieces of the bank and then in view of the fact they cant wipe that bank out totally then using the pc to wipe out another piece of bank which they cant wipe out totally so they try to wipe out another piece of bank the pc comes to session hes got present time problem so they wipe out try to wipe out the present time problem but they already havent wiped out the service facsimile they were auditing yesterday so now theyve got this present time problem so theyre going to erase this present time problem and they cant really erase the present time problem because halfway through the present time problem the pc comes up with the fact that hes worried about his mother and when he was young he was very worried about his mother so now we try to erase mother and having in the process of erasing mother of course we run into the subject of father so we try to erase father and so forth this is what is known as this type of auditor is known as mudder all he wants to do is erase throw the pc into the heavy energy and use him as an ink eraser see thats perfectly legitimate on erasure and so forth as long as you complete your cycles of action but practically all of the early levels of auditing are destimulation which means you unrestimulate what has already been restimulated i refer you to earlier lectures on the subject of restimulation and destimulation what youre trying to do here is take the dogs that are barking at them and get them to lie down quietly erasure would be to go over and eat up all the dogs you see but all you want these dogs to do is lie down quietly and the pc to come away from there thats destimulation dont you see so we have this pc and he is got present time problem and therefore is not in the auditing room and therefore is not insession so we say what kind of problem what whats this problem all about and he says well its about so and so well its about my early life all right well what about your early life well i used to have an awful lot of trouble with boys in my early life well did you ever have any fight with boys in your early life all right thats good pick up that early fight that you had have an overt against boys when you were very young oh that thats good its go you got hurt huh like where wheres the somatic what are you doing the pc wasnt in the auditing room to be audited the pc was elsewhere so you send him else elsewhere now what do you think this pcs going to do means that you could never complete your cycle of action because the pc is elsewhere when he begins the session youve got to get the pc here before you can complete your cycle of action now therefore you never have chance of completing yesterdays auditing if you cant get the pc into the session today so if the pc has picked up new problems or new difficulties in life between sessions this is quite common i am told and if the auditor does nothing but plunge and qanda with this new situation which is arisen he of course never cleans up yesterdays cycle of action you follow that well destimulation is the only tool or the only action you can undertake to get pc oriented and located and if an auditor cannot destimulate pc he of course can never follow his own cycle of action do you see that the pcs restimulation takes charge so therefore you can never bring it up to point where you can finish that problems intensive you started last august and ever since that time he kept coming to session and we had other things to handle weve always got other things to handle if we cant destimulate the pc so therefore the destimulation of pc is very very important skill very very important skill there are various mechanisms by which one destimulates the pc running engrams matter what process you use to run the engrams running engrams running ris implant gpms ris actual gpms i say implant gpm ris and actual gpms all are under the heading of erasure nothing but erasure thats using the pc to eat up the dogs you see now theres always certain amount of erasure takes place even in destimulation tiny amount takes place you see let give you an idea of destimulation and erasure and how one operates somewhat with the other one pcs fallen down hurting hurt his knee and we use an oldtime assist we say where did you hurt it and where are you now and where did you hurt it and where are you now and what were trying to do there is simply destimulate it were trying to get the pc out of that area of time and that location and get him where he is now sitting you see thats destimulation were not trying to do anything about the injury were just trying to get the pc to sit there in front of us in the process of doing this you will notice pc quite commonly turns on somatics certain amount then of the incident or injury runs out in the process of destimulation most wonderful example of this i ever saw and i remember vividly happened at 42 aberdeen road with less person than burke belknap burke was having lot of trouble casewise and he was having lot of difficulty somehow or another and i straightwired him and it happened in the little office just inside the door any of you there were there and he was standing up against the wall and i gave him gave him bit of straightwire and gave him clip bing bang hit the locks the key ins of this little incident had to do with this and man he came straight up pt practically clear right there see you know terrific result you know bang you know five minutes worth of auditing and wow you practically got clear on your hands you see that kind of action see then i turned him right around into the thing and erased the top engram on the chain the second he hit it it all keyed back in again and he collapsed sliding down the wall and sat on the floor with his head in his hands he had never felt better and never felt worse in two consecutive seconds in his life the oh i got him out of it of course but the first action is destimulation see little straightwire where was it you know and when and who did you know who did you know that was like that see hes complained about condition you see well who did you know that was like that oh well yeah joe well well did you ever see him you ever see him acting like that you see oh yes i did yes yes yes yes well all right good does that have anything to do with the what youre going through right now hey you know it has lot to do with it and the guys right up in present time bang see all we hit was the keyin see we walked closer to the tigers cage than the outer perimeter of the bottom seats see we went nowhere close and yet he came away from there see now now we go and find what keyed in and we throw the pc into it and start erasing this well we can erase it weve had erasure technique since the word go you burn your finger you very often erase it sometimes you destimulate it sometimes you erase it and you sometimes you use combination of both on some light injury of this particular character you tur you go to the beginning of the incident and run yourself through to the end of the incident and so on and eventually all the pain turns off and youre fine you might however just do touch assist on it you know touch it for while and youll feel little pains come off of the thing so it is very difficult to do total destimulation see thats difficult thing to do because tiny little bit of erasure will occur in any event but you can do total destimulation from the basis of totally destimulate something im only saying the one thing you cant do is avoid erasure totally because just the pcs attention on the subject for that moment necessary you see to detach him from the subject may bring about slight amount of erasure thats reason then when you wish to destimulate to become professional eraser see it seems to be an invitation see there seems to be an invitation youre saying where were you where are you now where were you where are you now where were you where are you now where were you where are you now all right thats fine now how do you feel well i seem to be stuck with this knee here on the pavement and so forth oh yeah well lets use some effort processing you see the temptation see the temptation well the funny part of it is at that level you can get away with it you can take the whole injured knee out i did this just the other day i first did destimulation and got the pc feeling better and then ran the incident out oddly enough with nothing but effort processing way back when you know because it was serious concussion i didnt want this hanging around and so forth and knew the pc was perfectly capable of doing so so we actually then went into it and knocked the stuffings out of the incident you see and then did destimulation and so forth and it all worked out just fine one of the neatest assists ive done in many day but thats combination of two things and the auditor should be aware of the fact when he is combining two things see you made the fe we could make the pc feel better by destimulation you know where did it happen where are you now any such process destimulation now we got the pc feeling little bit better well we got him little bit better in control right little bit better in present time now we could go back and start at the beginning of the incident erase it right straight through as an engram or we can leave it alone and go on with the program which we started yesterday but it puts choice back into the auditors hands the auditor now has his power of choice over the pc it so happened with this pc i didnt have any cycle of action that was taking place yesterday see to engage upon there was reason not to do this you understand so these two things can combine but they are separate theres destimulation and theres erasure very very important to realize this youre going to have headache trying to work this out and then youll finally get through i dont mean to be bad teacher and tell you how confused it all is and how difficult it all is i tell you its very easy if youre just simply willing to grasp it and use it but along about this time we get into the paddles business you see you see its birch bark canoes and birch bark canoes are basically held together with gum arent they well does ronson have anything to do with wrigleys because what happens here what happens here the door seems to be wide open here that if you destimulate you can then erase and today were busy auditing our pc on prepcheck on see it gets more complicated in its applications but the same principles hold where were prepchecking this pc on the subject of mata haris see and its all very fine and were prepchecking him just dandy and were getting lot of tone arm action and everything is going along in actual fact were carrying about destimulative action prepcheck destimulation see synonymous well were doing all right here see and were going along and all of sudden the pc tone arm tone arms beautiful beautiful action on the tone arm you see were still getting nice action you see or maybe its come to momentary pause if we ran for five more minutes wed get five more divisions you see and all of sudden the pc unfortunately pc unfortunately for all concerned happens to remember in the process of doing this that he had goal to kitterwigit that was found on him in 1961 that has lot to do with this so the auditor says to himself well look how much more we could do for this pc you see if we found actually the basic reason so he says well what this goal to kitterwigit is that is that an actual gpm is that an implant gpm all right what number is it on the track is it upside down is it backwards well oddly enough the difficulty isnt doesnt arise in trying to find this gpm thats not the difficulty the difficulty is missing the difficulty is that you half destimulated the subject you were working on previously mata haris youve half destimulated and in the process of destimulating it you of course have somewhat restimulated it right you havent got it totally destimulated youve got it slightly restimulated in the process to destimulating it you see youre right in this condition where the fellow has fallen down and bruised his knee and the auditors trying to get him into the auditing room so that he can audit him see and then all of sudden gives up and puts him back on the roadway and starts erasing the knee you see well if hed just kept this up and brought him into the auditing room it would have been all right and he kept could have kept along with another cycle of action dont you see the cycle of action which you already have in progress but just in the process of doing this the fellows attention of course little bit more goes onto his knee so you take this pc whose attention is fairly heavily on mata hari were destimulating mata hari were not erasing her you see just bringing him out the process of coming out the door however hes still got his feet sort of tangled up with silk stockings and old german documents and then weve turned around and gone into this other activity which is never destimulative activity which is cannonball erasure process you dont destimulate goals you destimulate the whole track and the actual gpm or even implant gpms somewhat like taking somebody up to the top of springboard and telling him to dive in and halfway down you find that nobody put any water in the pool so you say go on back up top to the springboard see the destimulative activities which can take place now are minimal now it isnt just that if the auditor had simply made up his mind that it really wasnt mata hari it really wasnt mata hari it was goats milk that was the pcs trouble and has shifted his prepcheck to goats milk he would have done the same thing he would eventually wind up all these areas of restimulation which he was trying to destimulate he would have half restimulated them you see then not finished the job and so he would not have mata hari and goats milk and if he went on with that short time afterwards and got submarines mixed up into it hed now have submarines and mata hari and goats milk and this is why we would call that auditor mudder so theres three actions he can undertake there one of them is just to give up the destimulative action and say oh thats hopeless because he notices some restimulation taking place and then begin erasure see shift his target from destimulation to erasure or the next action which he could undertake was shift his target from that he was destimulating from target while it was restimulated to target b while it was restimulated or he could do proper action and the proper action is when you set out to destimulate destimulate when you set out to erase erase and in either event complete your cycle of action in either event complete your cycle of action if youre going to go into the destimulation activity here and you decide that you had better get this individual destimulated on the subject of home and mother so that you can audit him on the subject of something else or service facs or get someplace on the case because hes ptps ptps and hes always got ptps on the outer perimeter of the thing hes hes so introverted into his own living room that we can never get him into the auditing room and that sort of thing all right were going to give him prepcheck and were going to isolate what this is then his ptps that is very very rough were going to prepcheck this thing all right finish it finish it dont say well thats thats the thats good enough weve got the tone arm action down now weve got the tone arm action down now to two divisions ta down in ten minutes of auditing we got this cooled off now and he doesnt seem to be terribly frantic about it so now were going to shift over and do something else see yeow just practically murder you see by the time youve done that three or four times you have your pc stuck in the restimulation of destimulation and he doesnt know whether hes coming or going see what happens when you cross it all right lets take the other cycle of action were going to erase you never can erase single engram something we didnt know back in 1950 because we could occasionally erase single engram as matter of fact you apparently can erase single engram now let put it this way but you often cant our remedy in that day you see was to go find another engram that you could erase see or go earlier now that was what we knew we knew that you could go earlier you see so you couldnt erase this engram then there must be an earlier engram and you better go earlier and erase that that was the only remedy which we had therefore some engrams wont erase well why wont they erase because theyre on chains so engrams are always considered to be part of chain and new material on running of engrams which just came up last year is rather fantastic and my god if wed had engrams in 1950 the kind of running which youve got and this new technology on running engrams nobody would ever have any quarrel you can turn on anybody as long as you get the proper duration make mistake in the duration you always got visio in your pc the one thing and so forth and because youre working on chain you can always get it back to the point of erasure dont you see these are not difficulties but sometimes sometimes you run into an engram and you run into an engram and youre trying to erase this thing and it gums up on you or it gets stiff or solid or something weird happens with this thing and therefore you abandon the chain you dont carry on and get the earlier engram that underlies it you see that will erase and finally pull the pull the whole thing apart in other words half completed engram erasing cycle absolutely deadly and you can take person and half erase an engram and halferase an engram and half erase another engram and half all di on disrelated subjects particularly and half erase another engram and half erase another engram and the pcs stuck up like hes in molasses he whats happening well the thing about it is when you start to erase something erase it now we see this in class vi this way when you get your hands on something when you get your hands on something why you should finish it off this is an ideal situation the ideal is when you got your paws on gpm you erase it you finish it right there well this is debarred by the fact that it is held in relationship to the gpm above and below it by interlocking items so that you cannot complete its erasure without having the two adjacent engrams this is further complicated by the fact that theres vagary in the goals pattern that doesnt make it lie there neatly at all so its violated to that degree but look it doesnt have to be violated completely because you could actually take the guts out of the middle of the gpm this these days and you could leave four items in the gpm and take out the remaining you could take out the remaining twelve you actually could destimulate it to that i mean pardon erase it to that degree you see now the ideal then is to finish it up well really what you do is consider the whole of the first series of goals the whole series as the first action or some half of it or some portion of it and the more you have of it the better you consider that one action and then you go ahead and you erase everything youve got you see thats thats youre still dealing with the form of big cycle of action see you say well were going to find half of the first series were going to find all of the half first series that we can lay our paws on and were going to get it lined up as best we possibly can and then were going to erase that and then were going to finish getting the remainder of the first series then were going to erase all of those well thats completed cycle of action see now youre going going down the row here you see but in the process of doing that you can also foul up like mad by half completed little cycles for instance youve started to check out the goal to sneeze and all of sudden the pc offers the goal to row boat and so you drop that checkout and you you get this other checkout to row boat and now having gotten checkout to row boat and so forth thats inconclusive so you do goals list on the to row boat on represent goals list see if you can get the right wording of this thing but you cant really find that because goal fires after youve gotten the list done so you figure you must have something spotted in an incorrect numerical sequence in the series so you start correcting the series in its numerical sequence of one gpm to the next well that doesnt work out very good because the pc seems to be terribly nattery so the best thing to handle that is in the first place if you could just find number one gpm on the track you could always erase that couldnt you so lets start listing for it again the heart of certainty is arrival and the anatomy of uncertainty is failure to complete cycle of action nonarrival so you want your pc to get less and less confident doesnt matter whether its class vi or any other class you want to get less and less confident just never complete the cycles of action you set out to do and never complete your destimulative actions before engaging in new destimulative action let the pcs new restimulations get in your road you see and just qanda with his new restimulations and away we go and over the hills and far away and bingety bang and isnt life confusing and isnt the case confused in fair rapidity this then this then is the difference between restimulation and destimulation and in either case you complete cycle of action you get somebody into session by getting him into the auditing room if he comes into session and hes got lot of present time problems and then you decide to erase these present time problems just run lets run process see on problems every time he comes into the auditing room he seems to have an awful lot of problems so were just going to set aside the problems intensive which we are already doing and were going to get started now and really clean this case up so he doesnt have all these present time problems when he comes into session well lets see lets do now an assessment on his environment and lets find out what it is in his environment hes mainly having problems about and then we will run problems of comparable magnitude on that or something of that sort and well get this thing all set up but of course in the process of doing this we run into his lumbosis and this is sidetracked and there we go we have now started the deadly the deadly chase where in half completed cycle of action were going to get another half completed cycle of action and so forth all right what is the auditors answer to this the auditors answer to this is rapid destimulation rapide destimulation techniques of rapid destimulation what are these since mid ruds since last time i audited you has anything been suppressed see when was the last time i audited you why we dont give this guy chance we dont give him chance to have present time problems in the session and knowing pcs i would say that an awful lot of pcs who cant be audited without very expert handling of since mid ruds or something of the sort there are lots of them i dont care what good shape they appear to be in i dont care how they can live through this sort of thing and so on the auditor is going to be invited to qanda party before that session is very far progressed if the auditor has not destimulated the case first pcs been thinking about his service facsimile lets take somebody at level iv hes been thinking about his service facsimile and what weve actually been doing is weve been running how would chewing tobacco make the hall maid wrong you see or something like this or who would it make wrong and the pcs been thinking between sessions and we havent got that flat see and has realized has realized that when he was very young when he was very young there was hall maid and she used to hit him with brooms and so forth and it was because of the neglect of his mother and what the process is really all about is mothers neglect so really what hes trying to do is make everybody guilty because of mothers neglect and we hadnt we better prepcheck this see now actually he doesnt come out with all this if its destimulated what happens hes got present time problem of some kind or another minor small hes been suppressing hes been thinking hes got withhold or two from the auditor you see so when the auditor tries to take control of the session the pc is really elsewhere theres little tiny bypassed charge situation because he hasnt informed the auditor of things dont you see and that alone is enough to cause little bit of an arc break its not really an arc break but you see little alien ness in the session and that on the first slip of the auditor can evolve into an order from the pc see this is just setting it up so you say but my god at the beginning of every session i waste thirtyfive minutes getting in my since mid ruds well you waste thirty five minutes but you get back you get back an hour and fiftyfive minutes of auditing thats what you buy with your thirtyfive minutes of since mid ruds by not putting them in youve wasted two and one half hours of auditing flat not only that but you have invited mess because the pc isnt insession that is to say the pc isnt even in the auditing room the pc is not going to follow through the pc is going to open wideopen invitations to the auditor at every turn to do something else rather than what theyre doing now these are the fine ramifications of the thing but the point is is life is restimulative i dont know if youve noticed this or not but between sessions you get that sort of thing now this is not an advertisement just for the subject matter of get in since mid ruds im just giving you an example of destimulation now let show you let show case in point here pc were running class vi were running him pc comes up with the fact i i i dont know i kept all night long all night long i kept thinking about these i kept thinking about these creative activities that i should be engaged on and just all night long and i i i think i think there must be goal here to create i dont care what you said i i think there must be i dont care what you said last month while we were checking that goal i think there must be one i think we missed it and thats whats worrying well now youre not doing that at all youre trying to get youre trying to get whole sequence of goals having to do with understanding and the pc all of sudden throws this one at you now good auditor knows what to do he destimulates it and goes on doing what hes doing he doesnt neglect it he destimulates it anything that is not on his main line of action he destimulates right now gone you understand now the technique that does that is case analysis case analysis has really for its sole purpose handling the present time problems as they arise youll see case analysis has been misused as term in the past were breaking it out into its pristine purity theres been missing word which is track analysis which is where do the gpms fit that call that track analysis this other is just just case analysis but its destimulative its just got the exact steps that its got in the bulletin what it doesnt apply only to gpms god help us ive seen this used to class i pc trying to put his gpms into place its very broad any level proposition whats the pc sitting in all right the pcs sitting in present time problem whats the pc sitting in hes sitting in bad foot you understand your second action is get these considerations what considerations he had all right lets now get the bad foot related to something whether present time or other bad feet or hes come up to the time when he used to have bad ear youre just destimulating him you see and you relate it to something you now find the pc is sitting either elsewhere or in pt and you can actually just go on along by little concatenation getting his considerations of everything he is sitting in hes sitting in position one position two position three position four position five get his considerations each time get its relationship find out where hes sitting now very very elementary very elementary it actually consists of really two auditing commands its more complicated than that hey you dont have to strain your brain on this one see all right anything youre concerned with and so forth well im considered with the fact that i was up all night long on i was thinking about this this gpm to create and im sure ive got one im sure last month when you said soandso and soandso oh is that so all right what considerations have you had about that well soandso and soandso and the last month we checked it wrong and we didnt do it right and so forth and it all right good all right okay now you got any other considerations youd like to talk about with regard to that all right well fine now lets take up these goals that have to do with understanding the other course is completely fatal completely youre already taking goals that have to do with understanding the pc is suddenly shoves goal at you which is to create variety so you check it out again aw aw aw awaw aw aw aw aw you pushed him into the mud well listen if he was that worried there was nothing showing but few sparse hairs on the top of his head anyhow just about enough for you to pick up and grab out see why push him in an auditor not recognizing these things can get pc in serious levels now it isnt as apparent at level 1 the dangers of this are not apparent at level i at all you can get somebody to chewing and yapping about this or that or the other thing well because hes running at about one molecule depth you see and even when you get up to iv even when you get up to iv your processes are destimulative in the most part youre really not trying to erase very much theres great difficulty with this you could just get pc so he felt kind of thick and jammy and kind of upset in general and sort of nattery and so on you wouldnt practically kill him but you get to class level vi you might as well just take pistol out of your pocket and shoot him between the eyes it would be kinder well youve got him in one great big overpowering actual gpm mass that you are busy checking out and you all of sudden make him turn around while still stuck in that mass and get involved with another mass i had an example of this the other night i had goal i was trying to place goal and when i hit the right number in the consecutive sequence if i hit i hit the right position for that gpm i was trying to place another gpm in that sequence see this thing didnt bother this one that was hanging up until i tried to place another gpm in the proper number it belonged in dont you see id gotten to the number the original gpm that i was stuck in belonged in and tried to place another gpm there and like to knock knocked the top of my head off the gpm that belonged there of course rose up full armed you know joke of course but get out of here man this place is occupied its sleeper in other words youre in one gpm and you try to do something with another see or you tr in one series youre trying to do something with another series its just too much too much stress and strain thats all so you carry out and complete your cycle of action with regard to this sort of thing now i dont want to leave you in any difficulties with regard to this im talking lot about vi you can just forget what level im talking about because it applies to all levels you can destimulate or restimulate and when the auditor is restimulating why of course hes normally trying to erase something but an auditor always restimulates slightly restimulation in these factors enters into this very little very very little its whether you restimulate or not thats almost beside the point its whether or not you erase or destimulate what is your final target are you going to destimulate this thing or are you going to erase this thing see and you have to make up your mind what youre going to do with it and then stick by your guns complete the cycle of action thats the way you handle it all right very good what is auditing what is auditing this probably could take up an enormous lecture all by itself as matter of fact i could imagine somebody talking for several minutes on this subject without drawing breath what is auditing what is auditing well you think you know what auditing is but i dont think you know what auditing is auditing is the action of asking somebody else question getting an answer to that question and acknowledging it you go little more broadly its asking somebody question about himself or life which he can understand and which he can answer getting his answer to that and acknowledging the fact that it has been answered and then also when the person originates some observation with regard to that to understand and handle that origination tr 0 1 2 3 4 more less that is auditing when that occurs ta action occurs when that occurs sanity occurs when that occurs this occurs when that occurs that occurs in other words anything you want from this other that is that is auditing now you say well what is all this stress on this definition well you just never heard the definition thats all well i was auditing this fellow and we were assessing at the time what is wrong with that sentence you werent auditing you were assessing yeah but somebody says but assessment is auditing i felt lot better many times when ive been assessed on something auditing doesnt have anything to do with somebody feeling better the final ramifications of auditing have nothing to do with the definition of auditing thats what auditing is for its to make people feel better and so on but what is auditing that is all auditing is and any time you say anything else is auditing youre going to lay yourself an ostrich egg i mean this is one of these horrible things now ive told you simple datum and in actual fact the next immediate action of course is to discuss whether or not there ought to be british war vessels on the yukon to protect the indians as they bring their hides down thats all auditing is the technique is scientology scientology is the embracive word for all of these actions but auditing is this one peculiar action therefore when we use the word self auditing were using misnomer you cant have self auditing see its impossible now i tell you that theres solid gold at the end of this rainbow if you care to walk that definition out to its final conclusions if you care to understand your actions at any level as an auditor only in the framework of that exact definition theres gold at the end of the rainbow but if you think you understand it and you dont understand it youre going to get to the not the end of the rainbow youre going to get to the middle of it and fall off now this is one of those horrible definitions that admits of exceptions variations or anything else and if you accept it at practically an engineering level of precision youll have it and the next thing you know you got tone arm action you understand pcs you can handle pcs all this sort of thing everything starts moving together click click whir whir whir nothing is very difficult you start trying to hang on to the fact that the reason this pc doesnt get tone arm action is because the technique ah ah well yes we can say the technique we could say this we could say that but youre longer talking about auditing oh you can discuss technique you can say oh its this and that and so on but dont get it so fuzzied up in your skull that you think youre talking about auditing youre not talking about auditing auditing is one peculiar particular action its cycle of action and the odd part of it is that part of the cycle can be an origin on the restimulation of the auditors presence origin from the pc of something that then has to be acknowledged by the auditor but thats just comm cycle and that is the auditing cycle and that two terminal aspect which is what this physical universe consists of is what gives you tone arm action and is what makes the pc better its not technique that makes the pc better and it never will be as long as youre counting on auditing then auditing is that thing and when it doesnt exist you dont get it goes nowhere do you understand so you say now look this look let let give you the nonsense here see this is the this is the south sea islanders once used to boil sea water and it generated gas and they put this gas up in this thing because it got from volcanoes and then then ronson has has bottled this you see and and so forth and thats how you can so therefore the relationships with the south sea islander are very important see thats one of these data when youre asking the fellow simply to put it there see but whenever you go into this statement or make statement of this kind youre cutting your throat as pro auditor the reason we arent getting tone arm action is because he is being audited at too high level for his case this is not true because it isnt true that you shouldnt put people at one level or another of case but the error is you have introduced the idea of tone arm action independent of the auditing cycle see thats the error cant be done now you can do an awful lot of things with this auditing cycle see you can put an awful lot of television programs through telstar and they amaze and wonderfy the audiences that look at them but without any telstar they would never get there so auditing is the carrier wave as far as the pc is concerned that handles anything and everything in scientology that is it now it isnt that you cant teach pc it isnt that you cant inform pc it isnt that you shouldnt move your technology around it isnt that he shouldnt go up through levels its just that that has nothing to do with the definition of auditing auditing is simply auditing it is that action of the auditor asking question that the pc can answer you see or making command and the pc understanding it and responding to it executing it informing the auditor that he has done so and the auditor acknowledging that fact and thats all auditing is pc originates something of the sort well of course its result of an earlier cycle so he goes ahead and the auditor acknowledges it its the same thing so you could have somebody who was letter perfect on class vi but who never audited wouldnt that be wonder to behold it its one of these its one of these horrible things that it maybe someday you some of you have got it already thats its some of these days one of these days years from now somebody else will hear and they suddenly say well thats what hes talking about you know because unfortunately its one of these things that just shoots through everything you want to know how do i crack this case well define auditing well you say that isnt very informative all right but that puts us into another type of activity in which an auditor can engage there may even be an additional type of activity to this but there is one other principal form of activity in which the auditor can engage and its called assessment now auditing goes somewhat to the pcs bank or to the pc and it restimulates his bank and talks to the pc and so forth it isnt that auditing goes purely and entirely to the pc it goes mainly to the pc but assessment nnnnnever goes to pc and you cannot assess pc who thinks hes being addressed now you want to know what happens to all these wrong assessments well look at that definition how do you ever get wrong assessment how do you get your emeter going so flickety flock how does it tell you so many lies well youre auditing pc who isnt up the level on this particular subject he thinks somebodys talking to him the auditor says catburrs batfur caterwumps and the pc says oh batfurs yes batfurs yes yes i had batfur once so forth he thinks hes being addressed he thinks somebodys talking to him and nobodys talking to him man his views of the situation are about as useful but this must be somebody who is pretty restimulatable and rather easily restimulated to be so egocentric that he is always being addressed and he must have some fantastic protective mechanism into the middle of the auditing cycle to keep anything from going through anywhere he must use his present time problems to defend himself at every turn he must use this his rebuttals and so forth to keep it going forward lot of things must be going on here the like of which nobody ever heard of wrong with the auditing cycle so when the auditing cycle is out assessment cant occur but thats the about the only way that the that the assessment can occur by the way with the auditing cycle out pc can be madder than blazes and you can still assess the pc what i mean is that the auditing cycle is out and the pc thinks he is being addressed every time you say catterwump or batfur or any part of the list and answers it as question youre never going to find out youre never going to find any items or goals or anything else see because he is insufficiently insufficiently able on the subject of the comm cycle auditing you know auditing hes insufficiently able as far as auditing is concerned to be able to sit there relaxedly because he feels you know alert he feels nervous he he somethings wrong somethings wrong with the comm cycle his auditor he doesnt like the auditor somethings wrong with his ability he cant answer questions hes afraid of this or that some part of this thing is awry so you try to assess this guy you wonder why assessment was jacked up so high in these levels well im giving you why right now until the auditing cycle is very well remedied and the pc can sit there very very relaxedly indeed you havent got dogs chance of assessing anything on the pc because he crisscrosses in all directions and his mind is like darting sparrow or hummingbird its all over the place zip zip zip zip zip zip zip you call catterwump you know and my god you dont know whether the rocket read had to do with the with the pc thinking i dont like catterwumps hes now going to read catterwumps i know it you know never saying anything and so forth that auditing cycle is out so therefore assessment is difficult and you very often have to do assessment with the auditing cycle out and it will still stand independent to it because even so if you ask the right question even on thoroughly arc broke pc if you ask the question exactly where the mind not the pc where the mind is living that meter will read and of course the more the pc is calm and able to respond on the auditing cycle the more reliable reads the more the deeper the meter reads you see an arc broke pc himself doesnt read on the meter but you can always bang his bank into reading arc breaks that that i just told you is mouthful all in itself thats about fifteen or twenty hours lecture the difference between an auditing cycle and assessment and what isnt assessment and so forth that that thats thats all thats all very interesting stuff let give you an example r2h arc break straightwire thats assessment isnt it thats not assessment thats auditing how is it auditing youre assessing arent you you never assess for r2h what do you mean you dont assess for r2h you got list in front of you youre reading off to the pc arent you yeah but youre asking the pc the whole way now you could turn around and run it on an on an overt assessment just do an assessment but r2h is basically not an assessment but twoway comm with the pc concerning what parts of the comm cycle were out here and seeing which one agrees was the one out in that particular incident and youre asking the pc to remember the incident and youre asking the pc this and youre getting the data from the pc that and youre asking that what the hell has this got to do with assessment man you start looking over r2h its nothing but solid auditing from one end to the other whats the fooler is is theres an assessment sheet in it theres an assessment sheet in it but you actually in its purest state and as best used you do not assess with it well class vi look class vi full of goals lists and item lists and everything else theres all kinds of assessments to do in there yeah its nothing to do with auditing well wait minute it gives you tone arm action so therefore it must have something to do im sorry tone arm action doesnt have anything to do with auditing these indians you see when they come down often have grease paint and the ronson company doesnt have anything to do with it you see the point is here that assessment is assessment and auditing is auditing and you get somebody who is chittering away like magpie while while youre trying to assess because you cant keep your auditing cycle in youre in trouble also if hes in that state why youre probably going to get wrong assessment anyway lots of things are wrong but theyre just were not talking about the wrongnesses of it were just talking about the purity of definition theres two targets the pc and the bank assessment is addressed to the bank and is the one process that addresses straight to the bank and its just from the auditor to the bank it has nothing to do with the pc and theres the meter now sometimes you run an assessment procedure on pc while the pc is trying to put in the comm cycle and you get into trouble but thats why you get into trouble is youre trying to put in the an assessment you know youre saying is this wog is it bog is it dag wog is it eight years nine years eighteen years and so forth and next thing you know your pcs arc broke why is he arc broke well he actually originated and you didnt take up the comm cycle thats why hes arc broke its not the fact that youre talking to the meter you di he originated and you didnt take any attention to it and so forth thats the source of the arc break so you assess and audit and assess and audit and assess and audit and assess and audit and audit and assess at the same time sometimes but that doesnt make them any any the less two different actions they are two distinctly different actions you go bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark on list you dont want an auditor you dont want pc doing this or that or the other thing pc doesnt it doesnt matter he can be half asleep and youll still get the same results on your meter you shouldnt be assessing pcs in boil off because theyre in boil off because youve overlisted the list but they could be in boil off and you could still pull goal off of them see it hasnt anything to do with the pc it just has to do with the bank its between the auditor and the bank so that action is peculiarly between the auditor and the bank thats another part of auditing isnt it so if youve got auditing there and you see and in caught you hasnt anything to do with auditing you say yes but i got lot of benefit out of it that hasnt anything to do with auditing thats scientology yes i know but when you find an item you get this terrific tone arm action how do you account for that ill let you in on something when you find an item when auditing is present you dont get any tone arm action it is the auditing that gives you tone arm action always and the actual ri big and juicy as it is doesnt give you any tone arm action at all if theres auditing present isnt that interesting do you know that that happens to be an actual provable datum you can prove it yourself sometimes you dont get tone arm action you get little needle slash you find an actual ri great big juicy beast of an actual ri and you watch your meter behavior and if auditing were in progress you see you give it to the pc theres auditing hes in rapport with the auditor youve got an auditing cycle going so you get tone arm action because of the auditing cycle all right same pc lets put him on one hand electrode dont go anywhere near the room let him call out the next item that hes to find in the next bank that will give the auditor divisionanda half blowdown let him call it out and hell get little one inch needle slash and that tone arm goes exactly place theres enough residual auditing in the bank that he has had to give him that this is this is very interesting assessing doesnt give anybody tone arm action its only an apparency he he the auditing is going on the same time see so you get the tone arm action because the auditor finds the thing and he says catterwumps is that it well its catterwumps is that it its very funny thing you can you can actually see an item start to go and you cant make it go all the way until you say to the pc is that your item and you have immediately started the auditing cycle it isnt that any mystery about the pc put his attention on it my god how could he help but put his attention on it hes sitting in the middle of it see and you say is that your item and youll see pppssssswwwww and youll see the tone arm come down and so forth and you very often dont get any blowdown whatsoever you can find the item on the list youll see the needle slash if theres residual auditing present youll get little tone arm action but heres what im telling you its the auditing that delivers the tone arm action not the assessment the assessment is pure clean clear activity all by itself so therefore you should do case analysis during an arc break assessment shouldnt you well youve asked the pc you f you found you found that the bypassed charge of the thing was wrong goal so you you you ask him his considerations in an arc break assessment you ask him his considerations about this goal dont you like hell you do an arc break assessment is given in times of arc break the list is also useful for other forms of assessment but an arc break assessment is simply an arc break assessment and its very elementary thing all you do is assess the list find out where the needle reads its between you and the bank find out where the needle is and then you simply indicate what you have found to the pc thats all there is to an arc break assessment matter how hard you try you cant make anything more out of an arc break assessment than that and during an arc break you must not audit must not audit must not audit never audit yeah you say well how the hell can you audit possibly now wait minute this is an awful braincracker because if you cant audit if you mustnt audit during an arc break why how can you assess well an assessment doesnt happen to be auditing you must not audit during an arc break period all right the pc sets very poor goals for the session and seems little bit unhappy and says he has some problems does he have an arc break an arc break is an arc break an arc break is when the auditing comm cycle cannot take place and thats what an arc break is the pc is very accusative and hes talking and so forth and he isnt answering any of the auditing well that thats thats an arc break pcs screaming the pc wont talk you understand thats an arc break an arc break isnt anything else its just an impossibility of comm cycle if you force comm cycle at that time you will deepen the arc break you can practically kill somebody with this man an arc break is an arc break all right at the beginning of the session naturally you had to do an arc break assessment because the pc didnt set correct goals aw can he talk to you well what you doing an arc break assessment for hes not arc broke hes perfectly auditable got ptp do case analysis well whats been going on where are you sitting wheres your attention right now well im thinking about the wog wogs all right what are your main considerations about the wog wogs or any other little destimulative process on wog wogs anything been suppressed since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed anything like that whats your attention on all right lets do some case analysis and considerations so forth and so on ah about that now oh thats good thats fine okay now lets get on about our business see get the idea has nothing to do with an arc break assessment arc break assessment is an arc break assessment and what why it is called an arc break assessment is because it is given during arc breaks and auditing and auditing is never done during an arc break never audit pc during an arc break never but never but never but never elementary now this is some more of you put the lighter on the paper and you put it over on the pencils and you put it over on the desk do you see how the confusions can arise in these very precise definitions ive been giving you lot of confusions yeah but lot of these indians wear bear grease in their hair and and the shopkeeper down at the corner has awfully dirty fingernails when he tries to sell you hasnt anything to do with the price of fish what youve got to do is get these definitions terrifically clean terrifically clear what exactly are they exactly what are the purposes of these tools and exactly what do they do how broad can you apply them you can apply them awful broadly man yes you could use the arc break assessment sheet to help locate bypassed charge in the pc and audit the whole time you see but thats not an arc break assessment its mixed up your tools all right so you mixed up your tools the crime is not knowing you have mixed them up now there are other ramifications of this kind ive told you some of these very precise actions and they are very important if all you did was sit and remedy somebodys comm cycle and the auditing even to this point what could you originate to free and clear in session you see what chair would it be all right to sit in in an auditing session it doesnt matter what you ask them as long as youre addressing their points of disability on the comm cycle youre going to get yourself ta action youre going to get this pc insession and youre going to get pc whos whizzing and coming on upstairs but its all built in on the basis of knowing with great precision the exact definitions with which youre dealing and knowing exactly what those things are and if you know what they are why youre going to make it if you havent got them all split apart and figured out youre not going to make it one day the pc is wuba buba and you pick up the babba galog over here and you say now were gonna were gonna blah and all of sudden everything goes bling you wonder what in the name of god went on here well you picked up this hammer dont you see in order to fix the watch and it didnt work but theyre terribly elementary but you have to get them very straight so that at moment do you have moment do you have any confusion in your mind the arc break assessment you mustnt have an arc break assessment down so badly that you feel the thing to do in an arc break assessment is argue with the pc you see or if you read line two then indicate the charge that you found after youve read line two as line three these things are apt to cause difficulties when you have an arc break assessment occurring by reason of step six and then arc break it by reason of session arc break and you cant go on with your step six be smart enough to realize that you now have an arc break on top of the arc break and reach for your session arc break sheet you understand know your tools slippity slip slippity slip soon as you got the session arc break straightened out you got that found assessed indicated to the pc lets take the r6 one read it down finish it off properly bang there it is straighten it out destimulate the whole occurrence maybe with spat spat of mid ruds or something like this after the arc break is all occurred because mid ruds are auditing these are your various things now ive given you an awful hammer and pound in this lecture of very fundamental fundamentals and if you look them over very carefully all of sudden you will say that is why this that is why that that is why something else that is why when i audited josie belle i didnt and that is why when i audited george i did that is why i dont seem to make any progress on something or other and so on in other words all these things are figure out able at this basic level okay thank you very much
