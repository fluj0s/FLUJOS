maintenance for few days and in doing so i have caused quite stir i posted note to the site explaining some of my current thoughts misgivings etc about my time at leelanau and the time i have put into leelanau talk there was some good discussion from all sides which leads to why leelanau talk was started in the first place i had two goals when i started leelanau talk the first was to foster an uncensorable discussion about the leelanau school what had happened in the past where it was going and what people should be doing in the meantime my plan was to do this by releasing previously censored speech providing safe place for it and supporting those at leelanau who were under attack for their thoughts and words there is theory across most of the industrialized world that the mere existence of good idea would cause it to perpetuate itself the typical thinking of the hippieera in the 1960s was that by raising consciousness and by spreading ideas we could change the world in the third world its clear that people think about things differently one could spend endless hours debating whether this is because lives are at stake or that these people think about change differently regardless this leads into my second goal of starting leelanau talk which was to promote radical thinking among students and staff support those who thought about the school situation in revolutionary terms and use the evidence i had gathered to support my own arguments i dont mean radical as enforcing an anarchistmarxistetc perspective but radical in the sense that i was asking people to think outside the box of what they took for granted and to attack the roots of the problems they saw through direct action over the past few months i have had lot of time to think about my own philosophy the things i have been doing the things i have been working with and what it all means leelanau talk never became quite what i wanted it to be because i didnt put the energy into it that i had originally planned and because i was disillusioned when i took down the site i put up little note which talked about certain people and the groups those people belonged to i think some people who read this also read into deeper meaning which was that i saw little of myself in all of those groups during my time at leelanau my political ideology was challenged proven correct proven incorrect and changed quite bit i was hardcore communist when i came to leelanau but when i left i had turned into fledgling anarchist they seem the same to most mainstreamers but theyre actually opposite ends of the spectrum i think the main thing that happened to my ideology at leelanau was that it was hardened while this was good for getting through my last year of boarding school it wasnt so great in the real world mr friley said something to towards the end of the year that i think really sums up something important and it went along the lines of black and white decisions are easy to make its the decisions in the grey area that are hard and it is those decisions that ultimately decide our character i absolutely agree and that quote says much more than is originally apparent his words analyze the individual but they also apply to social interactions and systems diversity is what makes us unique challenges are what happens when those diversities meet the results of those challenges are varied and depending on the outcome beautiful doesnt it then make sense that we would want to foster diversity and create safe environments for those challenges to occur yes but thats not what i was doing here at leelanau talk after having put some of my ideas about liberation into action i wanted to help others do the same i got really excited about the prospect of helping organize radical thought on campus being able to finally speak my mind and helping others with their own liberation as often happens to people who are really excited about cause i tried to micromanage everything as people who checked the site regularly can tell you i made lot of comments and also corrected lot of people when i saw them saying something i didnt agree with this was not only beautiful display of my closedmindedness caused by the hardening of my ideology but also of my desire to micromanage everything ideologies are like living things they grow and try new things and explore and sometimes make mistakes by constantly pointing out what i saw as mistakes and trying to guide ideologies i ended up messing up that process you could say the same thing of how people grow up its all process of trying new things challenging yourself and learning from your mistakes this isnt to say that having third party analyze your thoughts about the world isnt helpful but that the best things happen when that third party steps aside and you have an opportunity to do it yourself that being said after having much time to think about my own ideology and its practice i have decided to take new approach to leelanau talk of course the cycle will continue and while down the road ill probably try something different until then ill try to stay out of discussions in the way that id been placing myself in them previously ill still be here to support those on campus who are persecuted for their views whatever they might be ill still write occasional articles keep an eye on the leelanau school and try and bring publicity to the cause and maybe ill finally get around to sending some of those care packages adb possibly related postsdecember 8 2008 bread barnovember 16 2008 how to beat the
