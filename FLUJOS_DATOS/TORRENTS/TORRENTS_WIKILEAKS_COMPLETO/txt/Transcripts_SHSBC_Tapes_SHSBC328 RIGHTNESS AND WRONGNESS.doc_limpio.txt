rightness and wrongness lecture given on 27 august 1963 thank you all right what is this audience august 27 twentyseven august ad 13 saint hill special briefing course all right if i can get the text written on it these two new students will be getting scientologya scientology i process known as acquaintance with saint hill were making strides here at an incredible rate of speed on lot of things and ive been working hard on getting processes arranged as to their exact uses and getting exactly what you can do with case and how to put pcs tone arm exactly under the auditors control so the auditor doesnt have to worry about it and so forth there have been quite few breakthroughs of great importance here recently and all this stuff is going down in bulletin form and i thought this morningi was sitting there i was thinking to myself well this morning here i should be putting it all down in bulletin ill probably go out there and put it indown in lecture dont you see and then having put it down in lecture then i wont bother to put it down in bulletin you see then youll all forget about it because it was just in lecture dont you see horrible so it left in between you see so i didnt know whether to give you lecture on the subject of what i was currently doing you see and what you needed to know or throw away the lecture and put it down in bulletin and it left in terrible confusion so i guess the best way to resolve the confusion is just tell you what i know about itand also write it down in the bulletin but you probably wont see the bulletin for long time so you better get it here very complicated are you sufficiently confused about it if i keep on this way you see you wont in moment know whether youre reading bulletin or listening to lecture and this is russian technology russian technology how to convince somebody that black is white and that hes somewhere else when he isnt lubyanka prison i think they practice this sort of thing guy is walking down to an interrogation woman dentist will step out from secret door in the hall and start examining his teeth see totally non sequitur the guy is trying to understand this you see and while hes busy trying to understand this something else unpredictable happens to him see guys come in looking tough with big rubber hoses and so forth and offer him cigarette and talk about his wife you know its all thth thththth see when he gets through he doesnt know what he is or where he is so he joins the communists the use to which mental technology is put in this universe remember is put that way and is put to the use it is put to in this universe because people dont know what theyre doing because there is mental technology now if you stop and think about it for moment the purposes of mental technology must consist of survival with its consequent domination necessity toand must therefore thereafter consist of being right and wrong it may be somewhat mysterious to you how these three things fit together in channel but they do this fellow is trying to be right trying to be right trying to be right why is he trying to be right hes trying to be right about the most aberrated things you ever heard of hes always trying to be right if you as an auditor look at this bloke who is suffering from alcoholism or dope addiction or something like this theres one thing that you can always be right about see it might be that it was made available to him while he was in high school and he was being blackmailed into it and he was this and that and it might be this and it might be that and it might be something else and it might be because his medulla oblongata has slippeda lot of mightbes mightbes mightbesbut in actual fact all hes trying to do is be right and if you want to be right about him then you should realize that the reason he is drinking or hitting dope or something like that or doing anything else hes doing or cooking bad dinners or anything elsewhatever else this person is doing which is apparently weird or contrasurvivalis in actual fact his effort to be right and you can always be right about somebodys aberrations when you recognize theyre trying to be right that is the lowest ebb of aberration sounds completely weird well thats because thetan cant do anything else but survive and in order to survive you have to be right more than youre wrong so you get obsessed in being right this is elementary my dear watson do you follow that if you go out here and make practice of being wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong youre not going to survive see if youre always going to be wrongyou go out here and you get on motorcycle and you turn the petrol on and you turn the spark on full advance it all the way and particularly one of these big boysand kick the kick starter and so forth you sail somewhat gracefully over between the handlebars because the machine kicks back well if you consistently do this why youre apt to be nonsurvival in the extreme you follow this so actually right and wrong are the tools of survival and nonsurvival in order to survive you have to be right in order to get somebody else to succumb they have to be wrong you follow this you see actually great military commander ever wins battle on anything else but the wrongnesses of the enemy and he compounds these wrongnesses up to total attack which really makes them wrong so even they realize they are wrong and of course at that moment they longer survive and the point you degenerate into succumb from survive is the point where you recognize you are wrong that is the beginning of succumb the recognition that you are wrong naturally then if that is trueand that is true thats not sensible its truenaturally this follows then that if person is surviving at all if they are thetaning at all matter inside of what mass there must be some residual rightness even if its only an insistence upon rightness so rightness goes hand in glove immediately with survival so this works itself back and forth into an aberrated if the individual is surviving he must be right it can even go toif an individual is undertaking an action it must be right action if he is surviving do you see how aaa this becomes in fact it becomes complete idiocy from the lucidity of its beginning because in actual fact there was reason for thetan to worry about survival in the first place see he has to enter this lie into the scene before he gets off into this other series of lies he starts worrying about his own survival now we can well ask how does he start worrying about his own survival well he worries about the survival of something else and then identifies himself with it you see he says this thing has got to survive and i am it so therefore and here he comes his next lie and he neednt make this fantastic lie at all but they manage itand that is i am now worried about my survival and actually it isnt until he takes that step that he goes halfway round the bend see hes practically finished now there is reason at all just because you have built bunch of sand castles and are protecting these sand castles from destruction by the tide or naughty boystheres reason at all that you cant go on protecting these sand castles ad infinitum and safeguarding their survival you dont have to take the idiot step of becoming sand castle see it isnt until the individual takes that idiot step of becoming sand castle that he himself becomes worried about his own survival but at the moment he becomes worried about his own survival he then enters into the necessity to dominate in order to continue to survive best way to protect your sand castles of course is to dominate anybody who would threaten to destroy your sand castles thats elementary isnt it you have to be tougher than the other tough boys on the beach in other words you have to dominate their behavior to the degree of restraining them from destroying the sand castles this makes domination necessity if youve already entered the game of survival see you dont even have to have become sand castle to start dominating now what happens now what happens now the game of domination consists of being right and making the other fellow wrong and that is all the game consists of there isnt any otheri mean out of this vast universe you finally shake out this one little tiny idiotic simplicity you know and it all makes everything look silly you know when you come to think about it russia and the united statesthe great game well thats silly the game is silly russia has to dominate the united states in order to survive therefore capitalism has to be wrong therefore communism has to be right the united states has to dominate russia in order to survive so communism has to be wrong and capitalism has to be right whats wrong with this well whats wrong with this is there isnt any capitalism to amount to anything and theres practically communism thats getting idiotic about that stage of the game you see anybody can see that one but lets go back to why does russia have to dominate the united states and why does the united states have to dominate russia well thats because russia is liable to destroy everything in the united states and the united states is liable to destroy everything in russia now lets look at this little more closely why are they liable to destroy everything in the united states and russia why is this liable to happen i dont think you have any more answer than anybody else does exactly why well thats because russia is threatening to destroy everything in the united states and the united states is threatening to destroy everything in russia and thats why the united states have to be very careful not to be destroyed by russia and russia has to be very careful not to be destroyed by the united states you see this is very elementary you work this thing out you dont need these ruskian idiocies pronounced at great length to explain the international situation to see actually what is taking place yes but russia is devoting so much of her production capacity to weapons and rocketry and other things in order to dominate the united states that communism is failing and the united states is devoting so much of its production capacityit actually amounts now to three quarters of the total production capacity of the united states and three quarters of the total engineers scientists and technicians of the united states are involved in this effortthat it is destroying capitalism because you see it has to in order to keep the effort going in order not to be destroyed well this is typical game and you start examining this game on the basis of survive dominate and right and wrong and wheres the right and wrong come inyou start to examine it or examine any game on the basis of just these things survival domination and rightness and wrongness examine the game and immediately the rightness and wrongness that you see residual in it appears to be pretty mixed up well the united states would be very wrong to destroy its economic stability and prosperity in order to destroy communistic economic dominance or prosperity see and reversely communism would be very wrong to destroy any benefit residual in any communistic system if there is any in order to knock out the capitalistic lines you see shed be wrong to do that but she is doing it and she is doing it on the supposition that she is right and the united states is doing all this on the supposition that it is right so youll see that aa enters into the situation where rightness becomes wrongness and people will defend the most fantastic wrongnesses on the basis that they are being right as you audit people if you specialize in this particular lineas you audit them you will sometimes be appalled by the justification of the persons own actions youre utterly appalled gauze is armor plate compared to the argument that they will put up dont you see i mean they put up this thin facade well you see the reason i left my wifereason i left my wife is because she seldom uhvery very seldom uhwas ever home you see to put out my bedroom slippers and therefore i had to leave her well why wasnt she home well she was working and supporting and you say end of scene rmrmrm and yet he will go right on leaving you see and staying left and perpetuate this action and defend it down to his last breath i can see it now the hammer and sickle flying over the white house you know and all of the arguments and press releases that are coming out from the white house saying down with russia you see down with russia we are absolutely right to continue to support capitalism then youll say finally well what is capitalism well capitalism is all the workers are told exactly where to work and exactly how much theyre going to get and all the property belongs to the government and capitalist gives you clenchedfist salute thats what and we are being right this is right action and its right what we are doing well maybe the actions were sensible if you look down along the line you see youll see some sensible actions beingtaking place and this is what throws you because you can see some sensible actions going forward through all this and you may understand some of this but what you dont understand is how right this is or why they dont recognize that the consequences of it are just wrongness and that they are actually being very wrong while they are saying they are being very right you go over to russia and say how come you got income tax these days bud how come your workers all get different rates of pay and status symbols seem to be entering in here and whats all this about some unions being organized and well whats all this going on here this doesnt look like communism to oh yes yes yeah oh thisthis is communism this is communism you see good communista good communist loans money at interest thats the definition of good communist and were perfectly right in everything we are doing and that is really correct communism and you look at this and it just becomes complete idiocy to you you dont see whether you are coming or going you see what is all this about well you see this sort of thing taking place on the international front its very very easy to recognize at that level of action very easy to recognize but its not quite so easy to recognize when you see this skidrow bum hes just all soiled from having spent the night in the gutter you see and you smell the canned heat on his breath you know and there he is you see hes about ready to hit the chutes now somebody tells you why is he doing it he is doing it because it is right action you say oh 4yes you say hes being right he is asserting the rightness of being skidrow bum and canned heat and all the rest of that and hes asserting that as rightness and that is why he is doing it well you see youve undercut the simplicity and youve left large zone of unreality because the society itself has worked out all kinds of rightnesses and wrongnesses on its own bat as to why hes cannedheat eater see they worked out this fantastic well they say after all he probably had few opportunities in his youth the guys who want more appropriation for the university say he never had chance to get university education you see the milk producers who want to sell more milk said didnt have enough milk and there wasnt enough strontium 90 in it everybody has got explanations for this so you come down to the final lastditch explanation which is the right one and nobody recognizes the rightness of the explanation he is asserting the rightness of eating canned heat why because everybody has always tried to make him wrong his automatic response is to be right so he has choice but to eat canned heat get the idea now if he at any given instant says i am wrong to eat canned heat hell collapse hes finished he may go into coma he may even die i mean its on that elementary basis its fantastically elementary situation what is it all about well behavior doesnt necessarily have everything to do with the whole track you understand behavior is behavior and then people have tried to aberrate it one way or the other and have tried to twist it around one way or the other and mess it up and make people do some other way but the science of life still remains the science of life the factors of life still remain the factors of life and if you were to delete all of the gpms and incidents and everything else you would not have removed the basic laws on which scientology is built thats interesting isnt it come to think about it you get so involved in erasing things these simply enforce and exaggerate and destroy freedom of choice they destroy freedom of choice over the exercise of the ability to be happy or powerful or normal or active or something of the sort they destroy power they destroy freedom of choice they destroy the ability to be selfdetermined or to be pandetermined about things they make person onesided about everything under the sun you see and they simply use basic and residual lawunwittingly by the wayto exaggerate certain things which then lead person to enslave himself and the basic mechanism of enslavement is survivalthe insistence upon surviving followed by the necessity to dominate followed by then the necessity to be right or wrong the necessity to be right or wrong then becomes as irrational as the original postulate to survive and these postulates go downhill and you will find in them the most incredible situations you will find you will blinki told you about this you look for it and one of these days you are really going to blink at what somebody is doing in order to be right they just become totally concentrated on the last way they can be right this is how they can be right and everybodys working all around them on top of them pounding them publicizing them kicking their head in on the subject and the more that people kick why there it is then the person will go more degraded youll see sometimes person who is only nominally degradedtheyre politician or something like that see and youll see this person go downhill and become covert criminal and slip little bit further and little bit further and youll see him out lecturing for the salvation army protesting against the very thing which they recently held to be right this individual has sort of died death now he is talking about going to heaven hes talking about being dead that is mainly what hes talking about you very often go intoyou go into church of one of these older faiths and youll find the minister up there haranguing and screaming you know about the evils of the demon rum or something like that to the congregation stay ye away from that pub bud you know yelling you know and he goes back to his study you see and he takes this little nip of medicine to fortify himself you see after the exertions of his lecture now these birds who are working this hard were working inevitably and invariable in the field and area of death because they are right down to the point where you get an aberrated rightness and wrongness cessation of survival is so threatened that it becomes imminent it actually gets dramatized before it happens and youll see somebody turning against religion because of the amount of hypocrisy in it you know the guy is saying well well the roman catholic church probably lost its grip on the world which its trying to reassert now by killing off the buddhist i beg your pardon the better interpretation is that its only those in charge in vietnam who are members of the catholic church that actually isnt everybody there are some presbyterians there too in the american troops and so forth i have opened up chapter here which is leaving you blinking just little bit im sure somebody is going to make the assumption sooner or later though that if the only government in the world being maintained in force actively by us arms is catholic government that that governments turning against another religion has something to do with something here that we havent quite put the finger on and we add to the fact that that same government is attacking the only other organization on the face of earth who doesnt believe in death forever we begin to ask interesting questions you probably hadnt linked the attacks on the buddhist up with us arms supporting the government of vietnam nor the attacks of the fda against the fcdc in washington dc yeah everybody else is all right criminals theyre fine and so forth everybodys all right but its just these two organizations on the face of earth plus one other the theosophist who talk about reincarnation and who talk about coming back to life again and who talk about these other things and its an oddity that just in the last two or three years all three of these organizations have been furiously attacked by the us government sort of an interesting puzzle isnt it well dont worry about it well get there before they do this is just an interjected thing now theyre evidently asserting rightness about death i know its mean of its cabalist its rabblerousing for to infer that the majesty of government is actually being used to further some foul religious end in some way and to cause everybody to be dead but im very interested in the fact that the church of england of all organizations right down here in the form of vicar who i think has had to move since this birdim looking at face or two here who were present in thiswas being very censorious about our giving death lessons to young children story went around the world what do you think this guy does every time he stands up there in the pulpit it gives one to wonder you know hes talking about going to heaven and all this sort of thing hes giving death lessons to little kids diana came home from school one day crying she was going to local school up here she wanted to know if all this stuff about poor christ was true and i gave her the hot dope andwell as matter of fact i did i was very reasonable about the whole thing i said native populaces have their religious beliefs and wherever you are you must remain tolerant of the current beliefs and so forth and she took this in but its interesting that this bird down here is asserting how wrong it is dont you see to give children death lessons while he himself is giving them death lessons only our death lessons are straight dopethis is what happens with regard to deathbut his are darn lie somehow or another this makes him right how does this make him right well you can just go round in circles trying to figure out whats the rightness and wrongness of this you see why should powerful state attack truthful philosophy you see why you know why some of the calmest and most decent people in asiathe buddhistswhy are these people being attacked and shot down and their pagodas burned and that sort of thing why what and you can go round and round and you can get real confused and you can get real upset well theres always one stable datum theres always one stable datum somehow whatever theyre doingno matter how mad the action may appearis undertaken by them to be right now you would actually have to get them on meter or get them to explain and put in long long itsa line on this subject and get off the automaticities until they finally told you the rationale and the reason it isnt rationale is because aaa along the whole line you just would not be able to believe how or why this guy had to you knowcanned heat you ask him question now how does it make you right to eat canned heat you say well he sure cant answer that you know becausehaha its ruining him everybody has been down on him the i will arise and everybody else is jumping him about this and hes been talked to by all the ministers and everybody hes read about how the evils that itll do and so forth so hehheh he cant defend this one so of course one would never normally ask that question say how does it make you right to eat canned heat see well brother only an auditor would be able to adventure this far because youre going to get screaming automaticity well it makes him right eat canned heat well thats makes him right because rahdadadadadadadadada and tadadadadada and that makes him right and tadadadada and that makes him right and eat canned heat and therefore this makes that right and its that right and that right and so forth and so on and so on and so on and so on and i mean you finally get through this thing has practically wound itself around the dial and you say all right now now how does it make someone else wrong oh hahahahaha soso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and my father and so forth and so on and i parked my bicycle on the church steps there one day and that old minister came out andand he actually had the police take away my bicycle and so forth and he always was lecturing on the lectures of drink you see the evils of drink and so forth and so onhaha there you are the guy says wait minute that isnt sensible and do you know whether he has understood it very well or not he will now have very hard time eating canned heat see heres sanitariums the keeler institutekeeley i think it is one has lie detectors and the other has alcoholism i always got them mixed hes been there hes been treated hes been biochemically injected you know hes been psychoanalyzed hes been everything you could think of see theyve given him stuff that when he eats canned heat it makes him sick he just goes right on eating canned heat there wasnt any stopping it because of this blockthis block he had and that intention is the strongest intention in the universe there is stronger intention than that at mental level above that of course you have the effort to dominate and above that level you have the effort to survive these things are very strong but im talking about mental activity mental activity thinking activity an intentional activitystrongest intention survivalthat just happens you see dominationthat just happens those are not intended things you get down along the line of intended and its right and wrong and thats where that lives this becomes very remarkable weve got this teenage girl weve got this teenage girl and shes running around and having an awful time and shes been arrested and lectured to and shown motion pictures and been horrified and hit over the head and defamed and threatened with kicking out of her homethat if she doesnt behave on the second dynamic you see and she goes right on misbehaving and that sort of thing and so on and so on and so on now this is an actual case history i had one in my office one day changed her whole lifealmost accidental one of the research cases that furnishes data that leads to data of this particular kind she was just trying to make her parents wrong she realized it that was the change of her behavior pattern right there we didnt even touch in that particular case on her trying to be right she was just trying to make her parents wrong well obviously how could you make them wrong well you could make them wrong by trying to make them change their mind on what they insisted upon the most and the diagnosis of how do you make person wrong is what does that person most insist upon therefore if that person most insists upon this particular factor then that is the one you must make them wrong on so the criminal tries to make the forces of law and order wrong you see the diagnosis taken from the viewpoint of the being involved is simply what are these persons insisting is wrong what do these people insist is wrong and then make them wrong on it its perfect q and see what they say is wrong make them wrong you cant get closer identification than that you see mother is saying be good girl daughter be good girl daughter be good girl daughter be good girl daughter daughter getting more and more antagonistic against the old ladyshe knows now exactly how to handle mama you make mama wrong how do you make mama wrong all you got to be is not good daughter elementary my dear watson see it isnt what aberration the individual is dramatizing its what aberration does the individual dredge up in order to make somebody wrong thats behavior it isnt the accidental thing that you think it is so weve got schoolteacher and he says children you mustnt chew gum children you mustnt chew gum children you mustnt chew gum well the characters that like him the least are going to chew gum dont you see thats how to make him wrong you cant destroy him overtly with 16inch guns but you can cave him in trying to make him wrong covertly and hell sit around and worry about those children chewing gum it does it serves to cave him in too little bit you knowa little bit little bit little bit he may even go away sometime and stop teaching school and leave the children alone you see this is fantastic so government which is trying to conduct decent law and order has worked against it continuously this factor that bringing about decent law and order is wrong now government with that force pushed against it continuously endlessly on and on and on will eventually come to the realization of exactly what keeping law and order is its being as criminal as possible see its been made wrong to the point where it now identifies the right label with the wrong action it knows how to be wrong to be decent government see on this broader perimeter you watch this thing as it works its way out if you can see that it gives you rather vast understanding of aberration now whether or not you can reach this aberration is not the subject this is simply can you understand it not whether or not you can reach it and do something about it with an emeter because this particular rationale although it is very true happens to have been boobytrapped by some very evilintentioned characters on the whole track who implanted goals which containand items and implants and gpmswhich contain in them right and wrong and you start running an individual very long on rightness or wrongness he is liable to collide with one of these implants and it goes into restimulation and the cure is therefore barred and youre unable to cure him of this particular thing because you cant audit him on the process necessary to resolve that particular facet of aberration this is barrier in other words thats been installed it is totally accidental that right and wrong are there and he is not acting the way he is acting because he has that gpm now get that through your head see hes not that just intensifies this action but it doesnt bring about that action that action would in any event exist whether or not there had ever been an implanter or not but unfortunately there have been some of these implants so you cant ordinarily say with complete securityoh yes you can without any security and often get away with itask this little girl now how does being sexually promiscuous make you right and who does it make wrong and how does it make them wrong9 see and get those two things worked out and all of sudden shes completely reformed she isnt doing this at all oddly enough shes longer able this isnt necessarily making her well shes just longer able to get the power into it that she had in it shes longer this interested in it shes longer this fixated on it because in any itsa line you will tend to trigger out enough to deintensify the force and power and concentration of the aberration its very interesting that aberration is very hard to maintain lets say this fellow ishes an accident prone he takes an automobile out and runs it into brick wall and he takes an automobile out and he runs it off the edge of an embankment and he takes an automobile out and he runs into another automobile and he takes an automobile out and he leaves it parked on the train track and so forth and you let him come anywhere near this automobilewell all of us have accidents to some degree but he is carrying it to excess and sooner or later somebody is going to notice the number of accidents this character has and if you as an auditor noticed this and you were just doing this job just for this thing in viewis just knock out the number of accidents this character was having with an automobileyou could first find out what he is having in other words he might be having wrecks or he might be having accidents dont you see you have to find out what is he having that is necessary because you sometimes are very sure you know what the fellow is having but that isnt what he is having see he might be having physical injury see not accidents at all he might merely be having physical injury so you have to isolate that factor and that would be the stage of analysis this doesnt take very long by the way this is nothing very laborious this is more or less off the cuff sometimes its enough to listen to him on the subject of these things and he labels it several times for you so you just use it you see thats the ordinary off the cuff assessment nevertheless you have to dignify it with an assessment its also the clarification of the auditing command you say all right now how would an automobile accident make you right or how has it made you right or any such thing as this and you expect hes going to have to sit there and fumble with this for quite while oh brother that is if youve spotted itthat is sitting right on top thats the easiest itsa line you ever had anything to do with brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and rrrrrrrrr and also rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr all right now youve got to keep this thing balanced because you might run into gpm so dont leave him on one side of it see you see the gpm would say just right and wrong youve personalized it so its how would it make you right and how would it make them or another wrong do you understand them wrong you right that is the way you bias this thing you understand the gpm is totallyit doesnt care theres just right and wrong so that you could also play this thing the other way to as far as the gpm is concerned but not as far as the aberration is concerned life is what has thrown this thing awry all right so we say to this fellow then when he runs down and starts to catch his breath on the subject and the automaticities are out of the wayyou have to sort of sit back and wait for the automaticities to roll on this kind of processyou say to the individual how would it make another or others wrong or who would it make wrong and how i dont care how you put it you see but its who wrong out that way you see and you right thats the way the question has to be designed and if the question is completely designed in this fashion you will get another rolling avalanche that will finally wind up with some earlier lifethat is thislife usually keyin cognition of some kind or another hell find the first person hes trying to leavemake wrong on it very often this happens you dont have to direct it very much hell do most of his direction on it then you turn around and you ask him again well how would it make you right and how would it make you wrong well it tends to make repetitivetype process out of it im not actually giving you repetitive process for instance im looking at student here thatll be going over to central organization soon theres two or three bad boys around that organization that have been raising hell with themselves and everybody else itd take in actual fact good itsa line and two questions to resolve the whole ruddy mess how does borrowing money make you right and half an hour later how does borrowing money make others wrong now it might not even be real to him and he might have an awful time doing it but thats the end of that behavior now this is processing actually below the level of recognition or cognition you can dig this one awful deep with pickax you can also do some weird things to case in changing its behavior going along this line but too much of good thing is too much of good thing and its huntandpunch process in actual fact contained in this is the answer to neurosis neurosis could be defined as an antisocial action or an antisurvival action which is compulsively undertaken by the individual we just wrapped up the work of sigmund freud its as elementary as that you understand we didntif you dont intend to make the person happy and dont intend to make the person cheerful dont intend anything except just to keep the personfit the person better into the social framework and if thats all that mental therapy is for why you got it wrapped up i think its faster than implanting now in the first place the only condition for this sort of thing is we have to be more capable of communicating perhaps we have to be able to communicate to the person in that we would have to listen to the person wed have to listen to the person wed have to ask the person question but wed also have to get our hands on the person in order to do that the cowboy in the black hat has to get his hands on the person to implant him too and they also have to do some communication too dont they and then they create hell of an arc break dont they i think they get twice as much aberrated behavior afterwards i dont think its solution i dont think the development of mental technology for the purpose of aberrating people down to level of powerlessness where they wont bother usi dont think thats successful approach well lets just be practical this has nothing to do with decency or overtmotivators or anything else lets just be coldbloodedly practical as coldbloodedly practical as these characters fancy themselves to be i dont think that its valuable i dont think its valuable technology its valuable to know about it of course from your point of view but as far as knowing how to implant people and calling that mental technology or knowing how to give somebody transorbital leukotomy and calling that mental healing knowing how to shoot somebody with some weird powder or something of the sort that makes them bounce about in the middle of the floor for an hour or two it looks to like all of those lines of action are unsuccessful i dont think theyre successful they always have hole in them and the hole in them is that survival can futurely be threatened suppose anybody ever undid it i wish i had nickel for every implant station thats ever been destroyed ive known thetans to make career out of it in fact ive known thetans to tilt planet ten or fifteen degrees with the equivalent avalanches and glacial epochs and so forth or pull the air cover of civilization just because it went on implanting in fact theres lot of things happen because of this why because somebody was implanting i dont think its sensible solution at all in fact i dont think its solution i just think its dramatization of rightness and wrongness i dont think theres any more intention behind it than that look at the amount of time and effort and energy expended why in any given day the appropriation of the us armed forces is probably less than the marcabian appropriation for the maintenance of implant stations i think its expensive i just think they do it because they are trying to be right i dont see any other reason for it at all theyre trying to be right and make others wrong thats all now you can add political significance just as you can on rusks pronunciamentos nato must be in accord with the francoberlin wall unity because the ruddy rods are all on the left side of the rifles you see and therefore all us turks must pull together with all us hungarians because the great entente of northern rhodesia must be maintained you see well its not quite as insane as that but in actual fact if you take it apart and examine it very carefully the aggregate sum total of it is insane it is not sensible whats the end product of it the end product of it is solution and worsening condition now whenever you see this rightnessandwrongness situation where somebody is acting simply to be right and making others wrong simply to make others wrongyou know theres more action to it than that more reason to it than thatwhenever you see that youll see worsening condition wherever that zone and area is youll see things worsening the young girl trying to make her mother wrong with sexual misbehavior that young girl is getting worse herself and is making her family worse dont you see in other words it isnt that status quo is being maintained youre getting dwindling spiral out of this sort of thing see its the last dregs of domination this whole action you see matter how covert it is its still an effort to dominate its like the guy lying on the ground with four knives in him hes still being right and the enemy is still wrong its still his final effort you see to dominate the enemy and many of these methods of dominating the enemy exist and its just an aberrated war which is in progress now we look over this implant situation as an implantation proposition and we cannot really assign to it any improvement of circumstances if any improvement of circumstances existed it existed for such short term as to render it relatively useless short term on the whole track might even go to hundred thousand years thats short term thats duration for an empire they might say well weve got it all licked here weve got it all solved but they havent theyve just got lid on and youll notice the situation deteriorates the situation gets worse gets worse gets worse so that any activity that enters in upon this type of rightness wrongness solutionwe are doing what we are doing simply to be right and simply to make somebody else wrongany time any solution is entered which has that sole rationale you can then expect continuous worsening not only of the person who is engaging in enforcing that solution but also the people in that persons vicinity so the whole thing becomes dwindling spiral this thing is going to develop leak sooner or later its going to blow out at the edges dont you see any such situation is going to go blingo someplace or another because it isnt solution its dramatization now you may not suspect it but you are looking at the final ranks not only of neurosis but psychosis that is the madman that is the madman he sees spiders on the wall medical treatment consists of telling him there are spiders on the wall this looks to like one madman handling another madman both with the same solution the madman is saying i am being right and you are being wrong and the person quote handling his case unquote is saying i am being right and you are being wrong because of this basic agreement you find many of these medicos winding up themselves in the padded cells first place they dont understand what they are doing and they dont understand that their solution is just as crazy as the patients assertions guy is having trouble thinking cut his brain up cant think well ding ding ding here comes the wagon man this is nonsense dont you see i mean there isnt anything to be gained in this i dont see anything happening on the subject of medical mental healing but more insane people the insane population of the world is going up up up up and the medical doctors say theyve got to have more people to take care of these insane and there have got to be more buildings to take care of them statistics are increasing statistics are going up there are more and more people going insane and therefore we got to have more doctors to make more people insane you begin to look at this after while you say what the devil is wrong with legislator who wont look over the fact the statistics are rising on insanity therefore the money we have been appropriating it for is being wasted obviously there is proper solution to this we obviously have the wrong people on the job but they never do this because theyre engaged themselves in rightnesswrongness type of piece of nonsense and most of government is how to be wrong convincingly so the end product of the thing is solution dont you see you want to know why they did this to you or why you ever did something to somebody else well in the final analysis the overt motivator sequence hinges basically simply upon this aberration concerning survival the effort to dominatewhich falls into contest of im right and youre wrong now both sides are saying im right and youre wrong and therefore you get doubleclashing sort of proposition you have saying im right and youre wrong you have b saying im right and youre wrong you get natural commingling of their ideas after while they dont know what the hell theyre talking about they dont know whats right they dont even know what they started out to say was right you see now mental technology so called which engages itself upon the worsening of people or making people wrong and making themselves right as an exclusive activity is not in essence very broad or very intelligent technology this is hardly worthy of the name technology yet it does have technology dont you see it certainly is not mental science which embraces very much understanding theres very little understanding involved in this thing something like the psychologist or pavlov if you put young man on the table and make dog bark the young man slavers im being sarcastic well i dont know im tempted to say on the subject you see well i dont know i look around and im not having any trouble with slavering dogs i mean why are we working on this problem its as idiotic statement you see as their own conclusions stimulusresponse mechanisms and so forth why be interested in stimulusresponse mechanism aw that tells us right there that somebody must be interested in being right and making the other fellow wrong dont you see the stimulusresponse mechanismthats as far as they ever advanced stimulusresponse mechanism well stimulusresponse be damned the consequences of the stimulusresponse is what isthe scientologist is interested in and that goes at once into the overtmotivator sequence you move right on upstairs from stimulusresponse you see into proper piece of technology they seem to have avoided that whole piece of technology why because theyre only interested in being right and making somebody else wrong dont you see now mental science cannot be worthy of the name mental science if it keeps dramatizing an unknown one of its parts see that outlaws anything which continues to dramatize one of its parts you see it outlaws it from the proper name of complete understanding you said science science would be complete understanding of something well if something is dramatizing one of its parts it certainly does not have complete understanding of life now the sciences of life are difficult just to this degree you are living see you have daybyday interrelationship with the laws of life and to rise superior to this in any way whatsoever is so phenomenal as not to have happened ever before its one of these tricks its by your own bootstraps dont you see and for while if you know all the aberrative angles you find yourself batting about in the bottle like bluefly see every direction you fly you run into something else if you started analyzing your own behavior in single day according to the basics that you know and if you had all of them available in scientology you see if you analyzed your behavior throughout any twentyfourhour period youd find out short period of that time somewhere along the line you were dramatizing something in fact you wouldnt have to do very much analysis in fact right now all these people out in front of are dramatizing breathing automaticity they think to stay alive they have to breathe you tell some doll that someplace and his jaw would drop you know you say well you cant live on exnoo because theres air thered be lot of beings that would look at you awfully blankly what you want air for whats the air supposed to do well you know air you know airyou got to have air you got to have oxygen what are you going to do on exnoo that you need oxygen for theyd try to figure it out how youre going to put it in bottles or sell it or you maybe you got new fuel for rocket ships has to do with oxygen couldnt make theyd finally understand what you were talking about theyd finally understand that you were peculiar you get the idea the total cessation of the dramatization of the game called life you see renders one at first glance in very confused situation since hes trying not to dramatize its various parts you see and yet he inevitably must dramatize certain of its parts and then he finally comes to the conclusion in order not to dramatize life you climb away to large cave on the side of very bare mountain and hope people will put crusts of bread outside while you sit and meditate and dont have anything whatsoever to do with life now by not having anything to do with life you have now rendered yourself free of dramatizing life and oddly enough theres enough workability to that you get away from all restimulative factors and your restimulation dies down you see get less restimulated you feel quite calm so you say well this is the way to do it you dont be any part of life the real challenge of science of life is to know it and be able to livebe able to live that life you see thats the real challenge and oddly enough if you know all the answers you can always do that it isnt necessary because you know half dozen lies you see that you think are answers it isnt necessary to go crawling off to some cave all by your lonesome you see you can stand out in the middle of life and live life dont you see the final challenge of science of life is does it produce life not does it produce death when you analyze this thing all the way on down itll leave you kind of buggy at first you get all sorts of weird ideas well maybe i ought to stop auditing maybe i ought to leave auditing and maybe i ought to get back to my knitting or whatever else i was doing dont you see and i ought to something or other and then you suddenly realize that what youre trying to do is drop part of what you were doing you see in order to get away from what you were dramatizing in order not to dramatize you can get into an awful confused state man you can sit around for days trying to sort something out along those lines well thats all right its enough to realize however that you are in situation where it can be sorted out and thats remarkable situation to be in very remarkable situation to be in myself ive had to groove off the importances of existencewhat are the important thingsbecause time making problem you see has made it necessary to concentrate on certain importances of existence and wrap these various things up well thats very proper solution to the thing but it certainly isnt inactive its flat out man flat out activity going along at very high rate i notice that theres more and more of tendencymore and more of tendency as one goes along the lineto recognize more and experience more life he doesnt have to work so hard to experience life thats one of the things person who cant experience very much has to work very hard to experience something and get all involved trying to experience existence existence is all around them walk down the street and theyre experiencing existence but to convince themselves that they are surviving they think they have to stand under truck and that is another way of going about it they have to suffer impacts they have to be in there living what is living to them well living to them you seefind to some degree is being right they have to be convinced that they are being right or convinced that they are surviving or convinced they are dominating something you see and you take some king of olden times why there he sat upon his huge throne and so forth and all of his courtiers are saying bogbog and bow bow and walking backwards three quarters of the entrance hall dont you see and bumping into the guards and messing it up all of which is simply designed to convince this fellow and convince others that he is dominating you see well id say he couldnt have had much of an impression on people if he had to work at it that hard thats simply the mechanisms of domination you find anybody who has to work at it that hard see hes practically dead man hed be gasping most of the time you find some teenager for instance out here going to dances and listening to music and diving and experiencing all sorts of weird new thrills and sensations and so forth theyre trying to convince themselves theyre alive dont you see theyre halfdead about ninetenths of the time but theyre having hard time of it but science of life should bring about living now there is level at which rightness and wrongness ceases to be analytical or comprehensible and when we speak of aberration its when it drops below that point it isnt that trying to be right is wrong its obsessively being right about something thats obviously wrong that goes loopy see thats when that mechanism goes astray and the level of neurosis is only reached when the individual is longer able to select his own courses of behavior when he is obsessively following courses of behavior in order to be right now everybody has few of these you can all try them on for size this fellow iseats salads he hates salads but he eats salads and you just get on this is there anything youre doing that you really dont like to do and this fellow says oh i just dont like to eat salads you say well how does eating salads make you right and how does it make somebody else wrong now youre going to get into an interesting situation where youre going to find out he has been already overwhelmed on the subject of salads this thing is going to cross back the other way its question of how was mother right in making everybody wrong on the subject of salads dont you see and that is not good processing question thats somebody elses aberration so were not particularly interested in that so we just bring him up to that point and this thing will snap youve got lot of these things but by and large they have value they have value it isnt until person reaches inability weakness stupidity and other suchlike things as way to be right that the dwindling spiral is entered now hes being right by being unable when you see that one loom over the horizon in any zone of behavior you have approaching neuroses if its not there already and when civilization goes all out for this watch it because its going to be dead tomorrow the dust is going to be moaning through its temples and the tumbleweed rolling down its freeways because that civilization has already entered in upon the necessity to be unable in order to be right the way to make somebody else wrong then is to be nutsincapable now dramatization any dramatization entering in upon this whole field of mental science which brings about further disability is wrong for that civilization matter how right that civilization thinks it is and anything which enters civilization into more life more livingness more arc and so forth is of course by basic definition right for that civilization so you see its also capablethis also renders itself susceptible to understanding what one should do as well as knocking out neuroses now anything that is mad in an individual at some higher level was okay all madness is simply an exaggeration of some ability or capability its some perversion or exaggeration of this let us take in the lower rungs of itwell lets take sexual misbehavior of some kind or another this of course is lowerharmonic enforcement of the ability to create see way upscale by the time you get this thing all mixed up and clouded up and this way and that way you get it down here you got some sexual disability of some kind or another and that is how the person is still being right about this upper thing you see so these things really enter along this line way up here it was right really rightyou see and then it came down little bit and it was method of survival and then it was method of dominating and then it was method of being right in order to make others wrong and then in that contest one got enough overtsthe communication line did switcheroo dont you seeso what was right about it is now wrong about it but what is wrong about it is now right about it and weve got this thing all the way down to the bottom of the scale its very recognizable where it came from but its gone through all of this switcheroo and down at the line its practically unrecognizable from its immediate state as far as persons behavior is concerned this fellow is an artist he could paint let us say he could paint side of house you see you know with beautiful scene you know prrrrrroooomnothing to it you know and you find this fellow down there nursing girls shoe you see to his chest you know and he hides this all the time its girls shoe and he sniffs it occasionally you know and it gives him kicks you see i mean its more or less the same channel but there the upperscale ability has become the lowerscale mockery and you get these lowerscale mockeries all the time get the upper scale abilities in trouble and once in while you go around feeling ashamed of yourself for having suddenly thought you could do something about the united states or something like that because some nut in the booby hatch is talking all the time about doing something for the united states dont you see well the difference is is you probably could and he couldnta slight difference of ability now when you look over this whole panorama of behavior and what person is trying to do you enter in upon an ability to understand much of the nonsense which at the present moment you may only be protesting against you just look around on it but this task is rendered very difficult by the fact that the explanations so obscure the kernel of insanity of the rightnesswrongness that its very hard to get at what they are really doing i dont know what the united states is doing today maybe its having revolution but its being right about something its being right about something and its making people wrong about something were not sure what it is but on careful analysis or on an auditing level we could discover those two points the moment we discovered them theyd all go unsnarl so science of life actually is science of examination of behavior and behavior is based upon lots of ramifications tremendous explanations in all directions but narrowed right on down to the middle looked at in its bare bones it comes down to survival dominate rightness and wrongness that becomes the main line of behavior i hope sometime when youre looking at somebody who is sitting there picking bugs off himself one after the other cockroach here and cootie there let us hope you dont jump back to keep them from getting on you and lets hope also you dont try to convince him that there are bugs there because you are now playing the one game which makes him make you wrong and at that moment you will cut your communication linejust like that so now he has only one purpose in view and that is to make you wrong and make himself right and you can cave him in you can deteriorate him you can put him further downscale but you cant bring him back up the line again its impossible because youve taken the one step to cut the communication line which could have made it all right you see that so dramatization of rightness and wrongness is not the answer to dramatization of rightness and wrongness and probably out of all the factors of science of life that one you would have to know otherwise you would simply get trapped into the dwindling spiral of everything you tried to do anything about anyplace it is the essential piece of understanding which is necessary to keep you free of going the chute okay thank you
