examines three main categories of tax reform fundamental tax reform tax reform based on the elimination of the individual alternative minimum tax and treasurys proposals for reforming the corporate income tax most proposals for fundamental tax reform involve the concept of replacing our current income tax system with some form of consumption tax usually with single or flat tax rate other proposals would significantly broaden the income tax base and lower tax rates proponents of these tax revisions often maintain that they would simplify the tax system make the government less intrusive and create an environment more conducive to saving critics express concern about the distributional consequences and transitional costs of dramatic change in the tax system most observers believe that the problems and complexities of our current tax system are not primarily related to the number of tax rates but rather stem from difficulties associated with measuring the tax base for those fundamental tax reform proposals involving shifting to consumption tax one or more of the following four major types of broadbased consumption taxes are included in these congressional tax proposals the valueadded tax vat the retail sales tax the consumedincome tax and the flat tax based on proposal formulated by robert hall and alvin rabushka of the hoover institution as of november 17

introduction tax reform has been of congressional interest in the 110th congress this report examines three main categories of tax reform fundamental tax reform tax reform based on the elimination of the individual alternative minimum tax and treasurys proposals for reforming the corporate income tax most proposals for fundamental tax reform involve the concept of replacing our current income tax system with some form of consumption tax usually with single or flat tax rate other proposals would significantly broaden the income tax base and lower tax rates proponents of these tax revisions are concerned about the administrative and compliance costs of the current income tax system proponents also believe that the current income tax system discourages saving reduces economic growth causes economic distortions and worsens the nations balance of trade critics question whether most of these proposals will improve macroeconomic performance express concern about equity issues and maintain that transitional costs will be prohibitive most observers believe that the problems and complexities of our current tax system are not primarily related to the number of tax rates but rather stem from difficulties associated with measuring the tax base in the 110th congress numerous bills have been introduced that would eliminate the individual alternative minimum tax amt and require major changes in the tax code arguably the most significant bill was introduced by house ways and means committee chair charles b rangel the tax reduction and reform act of 2007 hr 3970 temporary patch for the amt was passed in the first session of the 110th congress but the issue of amt reform continues to be debated in the second session the treasury released two reports that examined proposals for reform of the business income tax system fundamental tax reform most proposals for fundamental tax reform would change the tax base from income to consumption consequently the initial sections of this report examine topics concerning broadbased consumption taxation later in this report other tax reform proposals are discussed crs2 the relationship between income and consumption although our current tax structure is primarily an income tax it actually contains elements of both an income and consumptionbased tax for example the current tax system includes in its tax base wages interest dividends and capital gains all of which are consistent with an income tax at the same time however the current tax system excludes some savings such as pension and individual retirement account ira contributions which is consistent with tax using consumption base the easiest way to understand the differences between the income and consumption tax bases is to define and understand the economic concept of income in its broadest sense income is measure of the command over resources that an individual acquires during given time period conceptually individuals can exercise two options with regard to their income they can consume it or they can save it this theoretical relationship between income consumption and saving allows very useful accounting identity to be established income by definition must equal consumption plus saving it follows that tax that has measure of comprehensive income applies to both consumption and savings consumption tax however applies to income minus saving consumption tax can be levied at the individual level in form very similar to the current system an individual would add up all income in the same way as is done now under the income tax but then would subtract out net savings saving minus borrowing the result of these calculations would be the consumption base on which tax is assessed equivalently consumption tax can also be collected at the retail level in the form of sales tax or at each stage of the production process in the form of valueadded tax vat regardless of the form or point where consumption tax is collected it is ultimately paid by the individual doing the consuming it should be noted that consumption in the economy as whole is smaller than income thus to raise equal amounts of revenue in given year tax rates on comprehensive consumption base would have to be higher than the tax rates on comprehensive income base proposals to shift from an income tax to consumption tax differ in their treatment of the estate and gift tax some proposals would eliminate the estate and gift tax while others would not affect it what should be taxed should the tax base be income or consumption is one inherently superior to the other how do they stack up in terms of simplicity fairness and efficiency the three standards by which tax systems are generally assessed there appears to be insufficient theoretical or empirical evidence to conclude that consumptionbased tax is inherently superior to an incomebased tax or vice versa crs3 one issue associated with the choice of tax base is equity how the tax burden will be distributed across income classes and different types of taxpayers for example tax is progressive if tax paid as percentage of income increases as income rises although some types of consumption taxes can be designed to achieve any desired level of progressivity with respect to consumption alone their progressivity with respect to income could only be approximated also consumption tax would involve redistribution of the tax burden by age group with the young and old generally bearing more of the total tax burden than those in their prime earning years who have higher savings rate since savings are not subject to consumption tax and the transition from an incomebased tax to consumption based tax would have the potential for creating windfall gains for some taxpayers and losses for others definitive assessment cannot be made of the effects of taxing consumption on either economic efficiency or the aggregate level of savings although the current tax systems distortions of the relative attractiveness of present and future consumption saving would be eliminated to raise the same amount of tax revenue consumptionbased tax would require an increase in marginal tax rates since consumption is smaller than income these higher marginal tax rates in turn would increase the current systems distortion between the attractiveness of market eg purchased products and nonmarket activities eg leisure1 the net effect on overall economic efficiency cannot be ascertained theoretically in addition economic theory indicates consumption tax would not necessarily produce an increase in saving the increase in aftertax income might reduce saving while the increase in the return to saving may increase it the net result is uncertain2 positive aspect of consumptionbased tax is the ease with which the individual and corporate tax systems could be integrated in addition the problems introduced in the current system by separate provisions for capital gains attempts to distinguish between real and nominal income and depreciation procedures would essentially be eliminated it is doubtful however that consumptionbased tax would have much effect on the complexities introduced into the system to promote specific social and economic goals many of the same factors that influenced the design of the current income tax system could exert the same influences on the final design of consumption tax whether one prefers income or consumption one tax rate or multiple tax rates critical point to remember is that the benefits to be derived from tax revision would result from defining the tax base more comprehensively than it is under current law tax with base that is comprehensively defined would prove more equitable and efficient than tax with less comprehensively defined base 1 the loss in economic efficiency due to tax is referred to by economists as the deadweight loss or excess burden of the tax 2 for an analysis of effects of tax policy on saving see crs report rl33482 saving incentives what may work what may not by thomas l hungerford crs4 types of broadbased consumption taxes four major types of broadbased consumption taxes are included in congressional tax proposals the valueadded tax vat the retail sales tax the consumedincome tax and the flat tax based on proposal formulated by robert hall and alvin rabushka of the hoover institution3 valueadded tax valueadded tax is tax levied at each stage of production on firms value added the value added of firm is the difference between firms sales and firms purchases of inputs from other firms the vat is collected by each firm at every stage of production there are three alternative methods of calculating vat the credit method the subtraction method and the addition method under the credit method the firm calculates the vat to be remitted to the government by twostep process first the firm multiplies its sales by the tax rate to calculate vat collected on sales second the firm credits vat paid on inputs against vat collected on sales and remits this difference to the government the firm calculates its vat liability before setting its prices to fully shift the vat to the buyer under the creditinvoice method type of credit method the firm is required to show vat separately on all sales invoices and to calculate the vat credit on inputs by adding all vat shown on purchase invoices under the subtraction method the firm calculates its value added by subtracting its cost of taxed inputs from its sales next the firm determines its vat liability by multiplying its value added by the vat rate4 under the addition method the firm calculates its value added by adding all payments for untaxed inputs eg wages and profits next the firm multiplies its value added by the vat rate to calculate vat to be remitted to the government retail sales tax in contrast to vat retail sales tax is consumption tax levied only at single stage of production the retail stage the retailer collects specific percentage markup in the retail price of good or service which is then remitted to the tax authorities 3 for an overview of the economic issues relevant to broadbased consumption taxation see crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded tax and national retail sales tax overview of the issues by jane g gravelle 4 for comparison of the creditinvoice method and the subtraction method see value added tax methods of calculation general distribution memo by james m bickley available on request from the author crs5 consumedincome tax under this consumption tax taxpayers would keep their assets in an account equivalent to current ira individual retirement account net contributions to this account contributions less withdrawals would be deducted from income to determine the level of consumedincome in contrast to vat or sales tax policymakers would have the option of applying progressive rate structure to the level of consumedincome each individual would be responsible for calculating consumedincome and paying the tax obligation flat tax hallrabushka concept flat tax could be levied based on the proposal formulated by robert hall and alvin rabushka of the hoover institution their proposal would have two components wage tax and cashflow tax on businesses wage tax is tax only on salaries and wages cashflow tax is generally tax on gross receipts minus all outlays it is essentially modified vat with wages and pensions subtracted from the vat base and taxed at the individual level under standard vat firm would not subtract its wage and pension contributions when calculating its tax base under this proposal some wage income would not be included in the tax base because of exemptions under standard vat all wage income would be included in the tax base5 international comparisons there are two major distinctions between recent flat tax proposals for the united states that would change the tax base from income to consumption and the current tax systems of other developed nations first although the united states is the only developed nation without broadbased consumption tax at the national level other developed nations adopted broadbased consumption taxes as adjuncts to or replacements for other consumption taxes rather than as replacements for their incomebased taxes most of the congressional proposals would replace our current income taxes with consumption taxes second all developed nations with vats except japan calculate their vats using the creditinvoice method in contrast most of the current us flat tax proposals which include vat components use the subtraction method of calculation other types of fundamental tax reform two other types of fundamental tax reform are 1 reforming the current income tax by broadening the tax base and lowering tax rates and 2 tax plan that 5 for comprehensive overview of this concept see crs report 98529 flat tax an overview of the hallrabushka proposal by james m bickley crs6 gives taxpayers choice between the current income tax system and simplified income tax income tax reform base broadening income tax base broadening would involve eliminating most tax preferences increasing the standard deduction and personal exemption allowances and reducing tax rates proposals of senator wyden and representative emanuel are in this category option of the current or an alternative income tax system proposals of representative burgess and senator brownback would give taxpayers the option of either paying taxes under the current income tax or paying flat rate income tax proposal of representative paul ryan would include an option for each taxpayer to pay the current individual income tax or simplified income tax with two marginal income tax rates proposal by representative lamar alexander would give taxpayers the option of either paying taxes under the current income tax or paying flat rate tax individuals not engaged in business activity could elect to pay flat rate income tax individuals engaged in business activity could elect to pay cash flow tax legislative proposals for fundamental tax reform as of november 17 2008 in the 110th congress 13

hungerford crs16 during the first session of the 110th congress the treasury released two major studies concerning corporate tax reform business taxation and global competitiveness and approaches to improve the competitiveness of the us business tax system for the 21st century these studies may be the basis for legislation in the second session of the 110th congress report on business taxation and global competitiveness on july 23 2007 the us department of the treasury held conference on business taxation and global competitiveness the treasury released background paper which argued that the current business tax base includes an array of special provisions that reduce taxes for particular types of activities industries and businesses these provisions take the form of exclusions from income deductions allowed or enhanced from what otherwise would be allowed preferential tax rates income deferral and tax credits some of these provisions are intended to ease tax compliance and administration such as allowing cash accounting for small corporations but others were intended by congress to encourage particular types of activity the premise underlying many of the special provisions is that they promote activities that have spillover effects or address various externalities or market failures unwarranted tax subsidies may lead to the misallocation of capital as they encourage investment decisions based on tax characteristics rather than economic fundamentals and generally reduce economic growth together these provisions substantially narrow the corporate tax base which requires that tax rates be higher in order to raise the same tax revenue for example it is estimated that these special corporate tax provisions narrow the corporate tax base by roughly 25 percent if the tax base were broadened by removing these special provisions the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent could be reduced to 27 percent or as an alternative about 40 percent of investment costs could be written off immediately ie expensed by all businesses14 the treasury states that the united states has the second highest statutory corporate tax rate among countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an organization consisting of most developed countries15 the treasury maintains that broadening the corporate tax base and reducing the statutory corporate tax rate would improve the global competitive position of the united states16 14 us department of the treasury treasury conference on business taxation and global competitiveness

discussed in this report represent just some of the approaches that could be considered this report does not advocate any specific recommendation nor does it call for or advance any legislative package or regulatory changes18 the proposed business activities tax bat is subtractionmethod valueadded tax vat under this method each firm in the economy calculates its value added by subtracting
