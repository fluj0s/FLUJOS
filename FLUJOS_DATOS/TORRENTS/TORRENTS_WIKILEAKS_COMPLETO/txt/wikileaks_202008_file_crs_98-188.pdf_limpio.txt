uphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98188 order code 98188 updated july 17 2008 house committee markup vehicle for consideration and amendment judy schneider specialist on the congress government and finance division the markup begins with the chair calling up particular measure for consideration by the committee the next action depends on the nature of the markup vehicle ie the text that the chair intends for the committee to amend and report which may be different from the measure laid before the pa nel for consideration the vehicle can come before the committee in several different forms each of whic h has its own procedural and political consequences the chair may lay before the committee either bill that has been previously introduced and referred or the text of draft measure that has not been formally introduced in each case the text laid be fore the committee is itself the markup vehicle but in the second case at the end of the ma rkup process the text must be incorporated or converted into measure for reporting to th house alternatively the markup vehicle may be placed before the committee as an amendm ent in the nature of substitute for the bill or text initially called up for more informati on on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml introduced measure using an introduced measure as both the bill for consideration and the vehicle requires special motion or unanimous consent the chair notifies committee members that the vehicle for the markup will be the in troduced bill identifying the bill number and often the original sponsor if this option is selected the bill is normally read for amendment by section unless by unanimous consent the bill is open for amendment at any point and each section can be amended in two degrees the measure would then be reported to the house as amended if amended or alternately as clean bill incorporating the changes made in markup into new measure that would be introduced referred and reported back to the house without change subcommittee reported versioncommittee print most measures considered at the fu ll committee have already received prior subcommittee action when subcommittee reports its version of text to the full committee the product is often printed and referred to as committee print this committee print can then be laid before the committee for consideration and used as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98188crs2 markup vehicle most committees in choosin g this approach will notify their members of their intention to use the subcommittee repor ted version with this approach the chair will traditionally ask unanimous consent that the committee print be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment so that the measure will be read for amendment by section or by unanimous cons ent for amendment at any point and will be amendable in two degrees at the end of the process this text c ould either be offered as an amendment in the nature of substitute to previously introduced bill or reported as clean bill an alternative is for the subcommittee chairman to offer the subcommittee reported version as an amendment in the nature of substitute for the measure initially laid before the committee this approach limits amendments and allows the chair the option to terminate the process by moving the prev ious question on the amendment in the nature of substitute that option is not available on measures open for amendment by section until the final section has been read for amendment third approach is for the subcommittee chairman to introduce new measure in the house reflecting the subcommittees changes to the earlier measure this new bill which would carry the subcommittee chairm ans name as sponsor is referred to committee and then called up for considera tion the committee would use it as the markup vehicle as bill as introduced staff draftchairmans mark another option is for the full committee to mark up text that incorporates both changes made in subcommittee markup and dditional changes nego tiated afterward yet prior to full committee markup members fro m other subcommittees are often included in these negotiations the party leadership nd other members may also be consulted the product resulting from these negotiations is in corporated into committee print and is often referred to as staff draft varian t process occurs when the chairman prepares his own markup document typically with collaboration only from majority members of the committee that text is often referred to as chairmans mark these kinds of documents usually are circulated to committ ee members prior to the markup at the end of the process the text would either be conve rted into an amendment in the nature of substitute for previously introduced measure or reported as clean bill amendment in the nature of substitute oftentimes the chairman prefers to offer an amendment in the nature of substitute to the measure laid before the committee usua lly an introduced bill such an amendment need not be distributed in advance and usua lly is not provided prior to the markup the amendment may only be offered at the outset of the amendment process after the first section of the measure is read and can be amended in only one degree unless unanimous consent is granted to consider it as original text an amendment in the nature of substitute may also be offered at the very end of the amendment process but this is less common occurrence debate and additional amendments to the amendment in the nature of substitute can be cut off by moving the previous question at the reporting stage the committee can report either the introduced b ill with the committee substitute or clean bill
