breakthrough classified by ambassador john beyrle reasons 14 bd 1 c summary intel representatives recently briefed us on the waiver it received to import 1000 encrypted platforms for the development of software intel was able to bypass the cumbersome licensing process by engaging in highlevel lobbying and capitalizing on russias desire to become knowledgebased economy contrary to recent russian statements this waiver does not appear to represent breakthrough in the importation of commercial products with cryptographic content russia continues to operate under the old regulations proposed new regulations do not meet the terms of the 2006 us russia side agreement on cryptography end summary 2 c on october 28 emboffs met with xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx to discuss intels recent waiver on importing cryptographic goods intel believes this breakthrough is one that other it companies could piggyback on xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that the waiver allows intel to import 1000 development kits containing encrypted platforms necessary to design and develop software the waiver allows the importation without the required laboratory analysis and approval by the federal security bureau fsb however the waiver allows only 1000 units to be imported if intel needs to import more they need to request new waiver the waiver applies to only one specific customs code item with variations as well these cryptographic items can only be used in rd they cannot appear on the commercial market once intel is finished with the platforms they must be submitted to designated staterun industrial waste disposal company for their destruction background 3 c in 2006 russia signed side agreement to its wto bilateral working party agreement with the us in which russia agreed to streamline and simplify its procedures for the importation of items containing cryptographic information nearly three years later progress in meeting the terms of this agreement has been slow and its results minimal russias proposed new regulations do not meet the terms laid out in the side agreement or in wto regulations to date companies still must follow the existing cumbersome rules in applying for permission to import items containing any level of cryptographic information including cell phones this permission request usually involves submitting samples of the item to an fsb approved laboratory for analysis raising concerns about the violation of intellectual property through reverse engineering so far us firms have not voiced major concern over this last issue rather their focus has been on the time consuming process for the importation of cryptorelated products current procedures take six months to complete and must be done for each shipment what it took to get the waiver 4 c in order to get the waiver intel capitalized on the gors desire to develop russia as knowledgebased economy several highlevel intel officers including ceo craig barrett and other officials such as american chamber of commerce president andrew somers highlighted to their gor interlocutors including president medvedev the role intel plays in employing over 1000 russian engineers intels advocates emphasized that if intel could not quickly import these development kits there would be programming work available and intel would have to lay off over 200 engineers in addition rd work in russia would have to move to india or china this highlevel lobbying secured intel meeting with key fsb officials to explain its needs intel was able to demonstrate the reasonableness of its request and as result bypassed the current extensive licensing requirement but it does not solve the crypto problem 5 c xxxxxxxxxxxx highlighted however that this breakthrough does not apply to intels commercial products he stated that intel is currently evaluating options for approaching moscow 00002723 002 of 002 the gor on how to expedite importation of cryptographic commercial products significant source of intels sales revenue the procedures that russia agreed to change in 2006 remain in place three years later recently proposed new regulations do not appear to significantly reduce the need to apply for permission for each shipment of goods with cryptographic components 6 c during july visit ustr russia and eurasia director elizabeth hafner raised concerns with the fsb and the ministry of economic development med that the proposed new regulations if implemented without revision would set up russia to be in violation of wto regulations from the moment of its accession med understood the situation but felt that it might be more effective to implement the new procedures see where there are problems and fix them as they appear to date we have not seen more recent version of the proposed new regulations for the importation of cryptographic goods to see if the fsb took usg comments under advisement comment 7 c during several recent highlevel meetings between us and russian interlocutors the russians have highlighted the intel waiver as major breakthrough in russias trade regime dealing with cryptographic goods and thus step forward on their wto list the information from intel however indicates this is specific limited waiver only for use in rd while this does demonstrate some limited flexibility on the part of the fsb and thus step forward whether other us companies can receive similar waivers remains to be seen additional gor actions will be required to streamline russias procedures for the importation of cryptographic goods for commercial sale russia continues to lag in the timetables and provisions it agreed to in the 2006 sideagreement on cryptology embassy will followup with the fsb and med officials to urge implementation of the 2006 sideagreement especially with regard to commercial goods beyrle
