in the united states intelligence community to remedy what are r eal or perceived functional procedural regulatory systemic andor structural problems while it can be debated whether the events of september 11 2001 represent tac tical or strategic failure it has been widely cited as prima facie intelligence failure one potential remedy that has been suggested in response to the events of september 11 2001 is the establishment of domestic intelligence agency akin to the br itish security service also known as mi5 some analysts maintain that because the british have had more experience with terrorism on their own soil and have demo cratic form of government there may be value in emulating the mi5 organization and jurisdiction in the united states during recent visit to the united states the british home secretary david blunkett met with us homeland security secretary tom ridge and agreed to establish joint antiterrorism working group in part to leverage the united kingdoms anti terrorism experience while there may be lessons to be learned from the british experience with domestic intelligence there are also important differences between us and british governmental legal cultural and political norms at the political level one fundamental difference between the british and united states system of democratic governance is that while britain does not have written constitution which specifies the rights of individuals the united stat does moreover the british system focuses national political power in unitary parliament while in the united states power is shared through federalism such differences may have important consequences for how individual rights and freedom are weighed against nation states obligation to provide security for its population at the organizational level the united kingdom uk has chosen to separate its domestic intelligence entity mi5 from its various law enforcement agencies the united states however has chosen to combine both federal law enforcement and domestic intelligence within the federal bureau of investigation fbi an agency of the department of justice ach organizational approach is the result of complex interaction among societal cultures unique experiences with terrorism law enforcement and intelligence organizati onal cultures legal precedents and other factors core question involves the po ssible

dedicated to countering covertly organized threats15 according to the security service act of 1989 its function is the protection of na tional security and in particular its protection against threat from espionage terrorism and sabotage from the activities of foreign powers and from actions intended to overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political industrial or violent means16 the security service act of 1996 was enacted during time in which it was generally perceived that the service had excess capacity as result of the end of the cold war and the temporary irish republican army ira cease fire17 as it was thought that serious18 crime was an emerging threat to british national security the new law extended the servicess statutory authority to include supporting law enforcement agencies in combating serious crime given british concerns about not establishing secret police organization an important part of the act stipulates that the service was not to act as an

the services closes t counterterrorism relationships are with the special branches of the 56 police forces explicitly responsible for countering terrorism the division of labor between the service and the police forces generally is that the service gathers clandestine and open source intelligence information about covert terrorist activities assesses the threat resulting from such activities may take intelligence actions to prevent and deter rrorist events and shares information as appropriate with other uk agencies the police forces generally are responsible for pursuing counterterrorism investigati ons by collecting evidence for introduction into legal proceeding in which the desired end is cr iminal prosecution21 mi5 officers work closely with law enforcement authorities to ensure that intelligence information gathered in national security case may be used as evidence in court22 uk usa points of distinction differing democratic structure and tradition while there are clear similarities in functi on oversight and jurisdiction between the british security service and us approach to domestic intelligence there are also some distinctions which should be considered in any discussi on of the applicability of the british model to us society first there is clear difference in the british form of democratic governance unitary parliamentary democracy versus the united states presidentialcongressional system with strong tradition of federalism the essence of the difference lies in the powers of the executive which in the british system reside in the cabinet and in the us reside in the presidency the british prime minister is the leader of majority party in the house of commons and forms the cabinet as result of the primacy of the cabinet and parliament the british executive has fewer constraints in policy development and imple mentation than has the us president23 perhaps an even more fundamental difference betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31920crs7 23

ii and in the early years of the cold war the united states passed the national security act of 1947 and the central intelligence agency act of 1949 mindful of the totalitarian practices of its adversaries the united states was particularly careful in this legislation not to establish us equivalent of the german gestapo or soviet kgb these groups had substantial intelligence and law enforcement continueddemocratic forms of governance in the ited states and united kingdom is the fact that the former has formal written constitution securing certain rights for individuals while the latter does not nume rous acts of parlia ment standards and traditions that have evolved over hundred s of years form the basis of british governance the end result is that the supreme court in the united states has final say over the constitutionality of us laws including those involving governmental intrusion into the lives of us citizens in the name of security and domestic intelligence while in the united kingdom the parliament is the final authority24 unique counterterrorism expe rience and cultural factors ultimately how each country structures domestic intelligence is function of its unique experience with terrorism and the cultures acceptance of government intrusion into their daily lives in the interest of securing freedom each state strikes different balance between the twin pub lic goods of freedomcivil liberty and security and the balance between these goods invariably shifts with time and real or perceived threats to nationa l security due to their unique experiences with ira terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s the britis h intelligence agencies have dedicated substantial portion of their intelligence effo rts to counter both ira and international terrorist groups including those which bene fit from state sponsorship moreover the manner in which the uk has organized to combat terrorism and foreign intelligence activity eg espionage has differed from that of the united states as it reached different balance among the competing civil liberties and security goals tradition of maintaining separate law enforcement domestic intelligence and foreign intelligence services was established early on in the united kingdom this traditional evolved as result of predilection to guard against the establishment of police state and through competitive relationships between domestic and internationally oriented intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the early 20th century25 despite similar us predisposition to guard against the establishment of secret

currently many local and state police fficials participate in fbisponsored joint terrorism task forces some state and local law enforcement officials remained concerned about the lack of specific and timely sharing of terrorist threat information collected through national intelligence means one endemic i ssue is however that intelligence regarding terrorist attacks is rarely specific about dates

located within the justice department which also has as fundamental mission the protection of civil liberties relationship between domestic intelligence and related functions relationships between domestic intelligence and law enforcement on the one hand and between domestic and foreign intelligence on the other are another point of distinction between the uk and us approaches to domestic intelligence29 as mentioned above in the uk law enforcement and domestic intelligence are separate such separation can lead to challenges in coordinating national security cases of the highest consequence while these challenges may be manageable in britain country with roughly 56 police fo rces if domestic intelligence were to be separated from law enforcement in the united states such coordination may be more problematic particul arly if the13000 state and local law enforcement agencies30 become more directly and formally engaged in contributing to the implementation of national

between the uk and us approaches to domestic intelligence is the relationship between domestic and foreign intelligence this point is particularly salie nt in the wake of the events of september 11 2001 which starkly illustrated the need for closer integration of foreign and domestic intelligence with respect to terrorist threats to the united st ates as alluded to above the usic also has unique history and development that led to the creation of an environment in which intelligence activities both overseas and domestic are guided by distinct and relatively complex sets of rules regulations guidelines as well as by congressional oversight while the events of septem ber 11 2001 resulted in calls for intelligence reform analysts continue to differ over th type extent and magnitude of changes necessary beyond what has already taken place32 in general partly as result of the global position of the united kingdom visa vis the united states and partly as result of unique cultural affinities and historical experiences with terrorism the distinction between foreign and domestic intelligence is less pronounced in the united kingdom than it is in the united states prior to september 11 2001 with the exception of th first world trade center bombing in february 1993 and the bombing of the alfre d p murrah federal building in april 1995 the united states did not have to endur on its soil terrorist activities in which hundreds of americans were injured or k illed britain on the other hand battled with terrorism on its soil throughout much of the latter half of the 20th century when national security is frequently threatened at home by politically motivated violence the public policy pendulum tends to swing in the direction of closer integration of intelligence and possibly increased domestic surveillance security and law enforcement activities cultural attitudes toward intelligence and secrecy perhaps most importantly central theme of distinction between the uk and us in the conduct of domestic intelligence is the strategic cultu ral difference with respect to the publics attitude towards foreign affairs in general and intelligence in particular possibly as result of its historic geographic isola tion from the rest of the world many us citizens may view intelligence as subset of foreign policy as something that happens over there not necessarily an activity which must be engaged in domestically33 another cultural element of the differentiation between us and uk organization to conduct domestic intelligence in general is the

government employees and contractors to the british government to disclose information they have access to as result of their employment if such disclosure is deemed harmful to the national interest34 this law has broader jurisdiction than any us law regarding the protection of cla ssified information and consequences of sharing such information with unauthorized third parties35 moreover the european convention on human rights allows the br itish government the power to exercise prior restraint with respect to publication of any material which may be injurious to national security36 in general the doctrine of prior restraint in the united states for purposes of national security has been found unconstitutional as it has been judged inconsistent with the first amendment37 in short us citizens may have different level of tolerance for government intrusion in the name of national security than their uk counterparts although the balance be tween security and freedom likely shifted in the wake of september 11 2001 the exte nt and duration of this newfound societal tolerance for enhanced security and surveillance remains to be seen and will likely be driven by the presence or

part function of the presence or absence of future terrorist attacks on us soil if relative domestic tranquility characterizes the near future it may be unlikely that there will be any significant changes to the uss current organization for domestic intelligence that is the fbi may continue to have lead responsibility for domestic intelligence within the united states and may likely continue to have an activist international law enforcement role as well however should terrorism cat astrophic commonly defined as involving weapons of mass struction or otherwise become more prevalent on us soil the us congress may be confronted with the following fundamental issues the relationship between w enforcement and domestic intelligence as can be seen from brief comparison of the british and current us organization for conducting domestic in telligence there are different schools of thought on the appropriate relationship between dom estic intelligence and law enforcement in general this question is usually resolved as function of countrys unique experiences with terrorism and pred ilection to ensuring checks and balances on state power are there synergies between domestic intelligence and law enforcement that indicate that the two functions should be joined in one organization or are the two functions so dissimilar that in order for each to reach maximum effectiveness and efficiency they must be separate as counterterrorism is an endeavor that has both law enforcement and intelligence equities what organizational scheme relating these two functions is optimal have the traditionally different sets of law enforcement and in telligence consumers converged in such manner as to render the argument for sepa ration superfluous if as with the british security service decision is made to separate the two func tions what concrete actions can be taken or formal organizati onal processes can be developed to ensure close and cohesive case coordinati on when necessary and appropriate joining federal law enforcement and domestic intelligence has two primary benefits 1 at the most general leve l it contributes to the cooperation and coordination between the two critical functions necessary in national security cases39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31920crs12 39 continued decisions by elizabeth b bazan 40 the history of both the british security service and the us fbi indicates that

also william odom fixing intelligence for more secure america yale university press 2003 42 see crs report rs21283 homeland security intelligence support by richard best jrand 2 it can be argued that the coupling of these two functions within single organization creates check and balance system whereby common culture that respects the rule of law underlies each area the greatest potential danger in combining law enforcement and intelligence is that if appropriate and aggressive oversight is not conducted it is possible th at such service could become engaged in domestic political activities where the ba lance between dissent and subversion is nebulous40 treating dissent as subve rsion undermines democracy the separation of law enforcement and domestic intelligence also has benefits and drawbacks one primary benefit of paration is focus some observers argue because the cultures of law enforcement nd intelligence are quite different although each may have similar end goals separa organizations with unique hiring requirements and development of particular professional skill sets would likely enhance organizational performance41 one major drawback of separation is the coordination friction which may develop between the two functions as cases particularly those involving counterterrorism invariably move from intelligence to law enforcement or vice versa what are the legal and regulatory thresholds for transition of case from one function to nother if decision was made in the united states to separate federal law enforcement from domestic intelligence significant resources may be needed to in essence recreate the fbis existing national and international stru cture and to staff the new agency with professionals well versed and trained in exploiting all elements of the intelligence cycle to prevent terrorist attacks the relationship between fore ign and domestic intelligence given the unique evolution of intelligence in the united states there has always been fairly clear distinction between domestic intelligence and foreign intelligence cooperation and coordination particularly on the issue of counterterrorism have improved markedly over time yet the even ts of september 11 2001 indicate that more activist integration may be considered the formation of the terrorist threat integration center ttic and the department of homeland securitys information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate are geared toward integrating the domestic and foreign intelligence on terrorism to conduct comprehensive threat and vulnerability assessments and disseminate information to policymakers and first responders as appropriate42 how this relationship will evolve and the extent to which it will be effective in preventing fu ture terrorism either within the united states or directed against us interest overseas remains to be seen for manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31920crs13 43 for recent historical assessment of the relationship between us

the most challenging issues facing the country and the congress today it is clear that each society will reach its own balance between security and freedom which will be dynamic and shift over time fundamental question in this area is the extent to which the us populace is willing to tolerate over sustained period of time preventative law enforcement as practiced in the uk the uks antiterrorism crime and security act permits the home secretary to certify that an individual is suspected of being an international terrorist and as re sult detain that individual for what amounts to an indefinite period of time without trial44 this element of the law applies only to foreign nationals within the uk yet these indi viduals do not necessa rily have to have committed crime to be deta ined this preventative precedent may constitute deviation from the european convention on human rights45 some analysts have argued that the longterm deleterious effects of enhanced security in the uk in response to terrorism may have undermined the states political legitimacy at time it needed it most46 the united states is not however lacking either the law enforcement tools or the will to exercise these tools in its efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks against us interests indeed us officials ve argued that the enhanced tools provided in the usa patriot act pl 10756 among other initiatives have made americans safer because we have transformed the rules of engagement for investigating and prosecuting suspect ed terrorists within our borders47 the usa patriot act redefined and expanded in some cases the criteria allowing the attorney general to detain alien terror spects but only for period of up to sevenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31920crs14 48 see crs report rl31200

detention of material witness the efficacy of the exte nsive use of law enforcement tools to prevent terrorism raises the question of the appropria balance of law enforcement and intelligence techniques to deter detect disrupt and defeat terrorism directed against us interestsdays within that time period the alien in question must either be released or the attorney general must in itiate removal proceedings48 however the us administration has also taken the position that the president can make determination especially dur ing times of war that an individual us citizen or otherwise can be classified as an enemy combatant49 the administration bases this position in part on the executive powers vested in the president by article ii of the us constitution50 it has been argued that enemy combatants can be detained indefinitely and have right to legal counsel during detention51 this contentious issue and the administrations position on it have been challenged by the american bar associations task force on the treatment of enemy combatants52 concerns have been raised that this initiative particularly when applied to us citizens may undermine the constitutions due pro cess clause and result in the facto establishment of parallel legal system53 moreover the administrations expansive use of the material witness provision to detain indefinitely individuals who may know information that may be material to criminal proceeding has also raised legal questions54 conclusion in short each democracy has had unique evolution which directly affects its organization for conducting domes tic intelligence it is important to keep these political legal and cultural distinctions in mind when considering the adoption of foreign models of domestic intelligence particularly
