specialist in international trade and finance economics division summary since the initiation of economic and trade reforms in 1978 china has been one of the worlds fastest growing economies according to chinese data real gdp grew at an average annual rate of 10 between 1979 and 1996 increasing the real size of the chinese economy by five times its 1978 level and substantially raising chinese living standards much of chinas recent economic growth has been driven by high rate of capital accumulation and large productivity gains both largely the result of economic reforms foreign investment and trade have played major role in chinas economic growth uschina commercial relations have sharply expanded china is now the 4th largest us trading partner many analysts predict that chinas economy will likely continue to experience rapid growth in the near future especially if economic reforms are expanded and deepened as result the importance of china as us trading partner could be greatly enhanced uschinese economic relations have been major issue in the annual congressional debate on extending chinas mostfavorednation mfn status as well as congressional oversight of the administrations policy towards chinas application to join the world trade organization wto introduction chinas rapid rise as an economic and trade power has been of great interest to us policymakers especially because such growth has led to substantial increase in us china economic relations as well as friction over number of issues the prospect of future high levels of chinese economic growth could have important ramifications for us economic interests an overview of the causes of chinas rapid growth is useful in understanding the implications of chinas future economic development chinas economy prior to economic reforms prior to 1978 china maintained relatively centrally planned or command economy most of the countrys production industry agriculture etc was directed and controlled by the central government which set production goals and controlled prices for nearly all goods and services the chinese government sought to make chinas economy congressional research service the library of congress crs2 relatively selfsufficient as result it limited trade to obtaining only those goods which could not be produced domestically during the 1960s and 1970s the central government mobilized domestic savings and undertook largescale investments in physical and human capital in order to support rapid industrialization chinas massive investment in heavy industry helped produce an average annual gdp growth rate of about 53 from 1960 1978 however chinas economic policies kept the chinese economy relatively stagnate and inefficient mainly because these policies provided little or profit incentives for firms and farmers competition was virtually nonexistent and price and production controls caused widespread distortions in the economy chinas investment in heavy industry generally came at the expense of agriculture which lagged in production for much of the 1960s and 1970s chinas economic reforms beginning in 1978 china launched several economic reforms including the introduction of price and ownership incentives for farmers and the establishment of four special economic zones in china for the purpose of attracting foreign investment boosting exports and importing high technology products additional reforms which sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several economic sectors especially trade followed in stages economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free market principles rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones which allowed them to experiment with free market reforms and to offer incentives to attract foreign investment in addition state price controls on wide range of products were gradually phased out or eliminated the results of economic reforms chinas economic reforms are largely credited for spurring the rapid economic growth that has since occurred between 1979 and 1996 real gdp grew at an average annual rate of 10 see table 1 since 1991 it has averaged 1171 in real terms chinas economy in 1996 was more than five times its 1979 level chinas real per capita gdp doubled by 1987 and doubled again by 1996 indicating substantial increase in chinese living standards according to the world bank chinas economic growth raised nearly 200 million people out of extreme poverty table 1 chinas average annual real gdp growth 19601996 time period average annual real gdp 19601978 prereform 53 19791996

largescale capital investment financed by large domestic savings and foreign investment and rapid productivity growth these two factors appear to have gone together hand in hand economic reforms led to higher efficiency in the economy which boosted output and increased resources for additional investment in the economy high savings and foreign investment china already benefitted from high rate of savings at the beginning of the reform period domestic savings as percentage of gdp stood at 32 in 1978 nearly as high as japans at the time most chinese savings prior to 1978 were generated by the profits of stateowned enterprises soe which were used by the central government for domestic investment economic reforms which included the decentralization of economic production led to substantial growth in chinese household savings which now account for half of chinese domestic savings2 as result savings as percentage of gdp has steadily risen it was 423 in 1996 among the highest savings rates in the world chinas trade and investment reforms and incentives led to surge in foreign direct investment fdi and have been major source of chinas capital growth annual utilized fdi in china grew from 636 million in 1983 to over 40 billion in 1996 making china in recent years the second largest destination of fdi after the united states fdi accounted for nearly 13 of chinas total investment in 1996 about twothirds of fdi in china has come from hong kong and taiwan the united states is the third largest investor in china accounting for about 8 of total fdi foreign funded enterprises have been responsible for large part of chinas export boom according to chinese data the share of total chinese exports produced by foreign funded enterprises has risen from 01 in 1980 to 409 in 19963 productivity gains several economic studies have concluded that productivity gains ie increases in efficiency in which inputs are used were major factor in chinas rapid economic growth for example the international monetary fund imf estimated that from 1952 to 1978 capital accumulation accounted for 65 of chinas output increase productivity and labor input growth accounting for 18 and 17 respectively in contrast between 1979 and 1994 during the reform period productivity growth accounted for nearly 42 of chinas increased economic output while increases in capital and labor inputs accounted for 46 and 13 respectively the imf study concluded although growth rates in both capital and labor inputs rose significantly in 19791994 the productivity growth differential appears to explain the bulk of the difference in output growth between 2 the world bank china 2020 1997 p5 3 east asia analytical unit australian department of foreign affairs and trade china embraces the market achievements constraints and opportunities 1997 p 181 crs5 prereform and reform periods4 world bank study made similar conclusions estimating that chinas total factor productivity grew by more than 3 annually from 19851994 rate described by the world bank as exceptional by international standards and attributed onethird of the increase in chinas output to increased productivity5 the improvements to productivity were largely caused by reallocation of resources to more productive uses especially in sectors which were formally heavily controlled by the central government such as agriculture trade and services for example agricultural reforms boosted production thus freeing workers to pursue employment in more productive activities in the manufacturing sector6 chinas decentralization of the economy led to the rise of nonstate enterprises which tended to pursue more productive activities than the centrally controlled stateowned enterprises soes additionally greater share of the economy especially the export sector was exposed to competitive forces local and provincial governments were allowed to set up and operate various enterprises on market principles without interference or subsidies from the central government one study by fc perkins found that exportoriented firms in china have experienced significantly higher productivity growth than nonexporting firms and that nonstateowned enterprises firms have experienced higher productivity growth than the soes 7 perkins cites autonomy in decision making and exposure to freer domestic markets as the key factors in productivity growth by the nonsoes competition is often key factor in productivity growth because it forces firms to improve efficiency by adopting new technology and processes it also forces inefficient firms to restructure or exit the market freeing resources for more productive uses the future of chinese economic development and reforms drimcgrawhill private economic forecasting firm projects that chinas real gdp growth will average over 9 annually through the year 2000 and about 75 thereafter through the year 20158 at these rates china could more than double its gdp in less than 10 years the continued growth of the chinese economy and its trade flows will likely raise the importance of china to the united states as an export market and as source of imports although trade tensions will likely increase if chinas markets remain relatively closed and if the bilateral trade deficit continues to expand sharply 4 hu zuliu f and khan mohsin s why is china growing so fast international monetary fund staff paper vol 44 no1 march 1997 p 116 5 world bank world development report 1996 p 25 6 from 1978 to 1994 the proportion of the work force engaged in agricultural production dropped from 71 to 54 large share of agriculture workers found employment in locally controlled enterprises or foreign joint ventures 7 perkins f c export performance and enterprise reform in chinas coastal provinces economic development and cultural change v 45 april 1997 p 502 8 drimcgrawhill world market reports july 1997 crs6 many economists argue that capital accumulation will remain an important factor in promoting rapid economic growth in china chinas high savings rate and ability to attract large fdi should enable it continue expanding the growth in capital per worker however the relative importance of productivity gains to increased output is likely to grow and such gains will likely be largely dependent on the extent and pace of future economic and trade reforms exposing greater share of the chinese economy to market forces such as liberalizing its trade regime would likely lead to greater economic efficiency and hence higher output the chinese governments commitment to making substantial new economic reforms however remains uncertain on the one hand the chinese government announced in september 1997 that it would significantly restructure its soes system further reform its banking system expand the rule of law and cut average tariffs rates from 23 to 17 yet many analysts remain skeptical over chinas willingness to initiate significant new economic reforms due to the governments stated fear of massive bankruptcies by soes and stated plans to adopt protective industrial policies for certain pillar industries such as autos and electronics chinas offer of tariff reductions are viewed by some as insignificant in lieu of chinas widespread appliance of nontariff barriers and investment restrictions finally past announcements of major economic reforms by the chinese government have not always been followed by concrete actions congressional interest in chinas economic development chinas rise as an economic power has been of interest to congress in recent years due in part to the rapid growth in uschinese commercial relations several members have expressed concern over the surge in the us trade deficit with china 395 billion in 1996 widespread chinese trade barriers and inadequate protection of us intellectual property rights in china some members have sought to link these and certain other non trade issues to the renewal of chinas mostfavorednation mfn status supporters of continued mfn treatment of china have argued that terminating it would undermine forces in china pushing for greater economic reforms hurt certain us exporting sectors raise prices for several consumer products and lock us firms out of potentially lucrative market in recent years congress has given greater attention to us policy on chinas application to join the world trade organization wto to ensure that the administration presses china to makes extensive economic and trade reforms especially those which generate significant trade opportunities for us firms before obtaining membership one bill in the 105th congress hr 1140 representative gephardt would require congressional approval prior to us support of chinas wto accession
