selection evaluation board appointed by the cpa the evaluation committee would evaluate the bids and award three licenses one for the north one for the center and one for the south regions of iraq to

service ses position as senior advisor to the ministry of communications coalition provisional authority cpa baghdad iraq 8 between august and december 2003 as such senior advisor plaintiff was appointed to and served on the evaluation committee plaintiffs responsibilities included preparing confidential report to the source selection authority the thencpa administrator l paul bremer containing the evaluation committees analysis and recommendations for awards 9 plaintiff fulfilled these responsibilities strictly in accordance with his obligations under all applicable laws and regulations mo st particularly plaintiff daniel sudnick strictly obeyed acquisition regulations the us foreign corrupt practices act the us bribery and gratuities statutes and regulations as well as the us criminal and civil conspiracy laws each of which prohibited plaintiff from soliciting andor accepting directly or indirectly anything of value in consideration of past present or future official act or even otherwise taking an act that would give the appearance of impropriety 10 during the source evaluation process the evaluation committee recommended and source selection authority cpa admini strator bremer subsequently approved award of the mobile phone licenses to three different private sector consortia each of 3 which had proposed the use of the global standard for mobile gsm cell phone technology 11 one of the disappointed bidders liberty mobile team of companies that involved friends and acquaintances of shaw fr om the private sector and with whom shaw was communicating regularly during and after the iraq mobile telephone license competition had proposed code division multiple access cdma mobile phone technology 12 by using his official dod position sh aw learned before any mobile phone licenses actually were awarded of the evaluation committees recommendations and the source selection authoritys award determinations including but not limited to the identities of the three designated awardees and the fact that liberty mobile had not been selected for any award 13 from his official office within the ffice of the secretary of defense osd using his concurrent official position as deputy dod inspector general shaw then commenced an illegal scheme aimed at improperly discrediting the source selection decision and outcome through the release to media of dod inspector generalosd raw or incomplete preliminary investigative information and other investigative materials collected by shaw as part of the illegal scheme shaw knowingly created and released to the us and international print and broadcast media organizations on information and belief after receiving media organizations promises to shaw that he would not be identified as the source inaccurate misleading and false reports that defamatorily intentionally stated that various cpa officials involved in the mobile phone source selection process had asked for andor had received bribes all in violation of dod information program privacy practices dod regulations and applicable privacy laws all as further alleged in the paragraphs below 14 if shaws scheme was successful in discrediting the iraq mobile phone source selection of bidders other than liberty mobile the liberty mobile consortium would 4 have benefited from disqualification of th designated awardees and the reopening and thus reinclusion of onceloser liberty mobile in the iraq mobile phone licensing source selection process 15 commencing on or about 13 october 2003 and continuing through approximately 21 november 2003 thendeputy under secretary of defense john jack shaw who at times relevant to the allegations of this complaint also was dod deputy inspector general pursuant to an appointment made by the thendod inspector general hereinafter shaw violated dod priv acy regulations and practices by releasing protected dod confidential information to washington dc reporter for the financial times of london containing false and defamatory allegations that two british officials at the cpa who were participating in the evaluation of the mobile phone bids had been paid bribes by nadmi auchi british businessman who has been accused by shaw of links to the saddam regime these false allegations subsequently were published by the financial times of london the identity of shaw as the source of this illegal activity was not known to plaintiff until sometime after 12 april 2004 16 commencing on or about late november 2003 after shaw had used his official position to learn that the liberty mobile consortium would not receive an award from cpa of any of the three iraq mobile phone licenses and continuing through april 2004 shaw commenced course of improper conduc t directed at plaintiff daniel sudnick intended to interfere with proper cpa procurement actions and decisions being handled by the cpa head of contracting activity cpa project management office pmo and with the technical and policy support provided by the office of senior advisor to the iraq ministry of communications most particularly attempting to direct the improper expansion of the scope of first responder network frn telecommunications systems procurement to create business vehicle by which private sector friends and acquaintances of shaw then would possess the right to create build and operate an unauthorized iraqwide fourth cell phone network utilizing cdma technology for 5 private commercial gain of those acquaintances and friends among other things shaw from his official pentagon office communicated to plaintiff daniel sudnick as follows on 14 november 2003 shaw emailed plai ntiff sudnick stating have not had play back from acting assistant secretar of defense for networks and integration nii linton wells on wh meeting but co rruption scandal is growing and we should carefully strategize on using it to ensure your and our success am getting names of first class telecom iraqis that are outside the political mix that could be substantive deputy for sami sheikh sami almajoun who sh aw pushed to be appointed as minister of communications and who was member of the liberty mobile board and you the object is to position you to get the job done and have viable system in place in the fastest possible time even if the award system is thrown out and the minister sacked after talking with lin and ron jost cdma system tying tier i to the rest under the rubric of providing first responder emergency services but allowing you to graft onto the system all the state of the art telecom capabilities that the grouping you mentioned could develop would seem the best answer to getting system into place soonest the cdma system could then morph into commercial service with our having total control over it such system could be grafted onto the administrative epicenter idea and funded on fast track capability to be operational before the cellular bidding mess works itself out and would put you in the catbird seat be sure that all records pertaining to the cellular competition are secured and kept out of the hands of the iraqis and others who are under suspicion as it was all handled electronically i would suggest that you transfer the entire working files to for immediate transmission to igs office make sure that original submissions as well as the versions removing their identification are submitted also records of everyone who had access to files and dates this is important to assure that you do not become part of the problem keep in mind that the investigation will give you more latitude than you now have to deny haider access and authority over anything bearing on the telecom awards this may be the lever to give bremer the ability to 6 rearrange the ministerial bench to assure honesty and merit in the important appointments all best jack b on 26 november 2003 shaw emailed plai ntiff sudnick stating danfyi i am preparing memorandum for linbremer on the severity of the corruptionminister problem my recommendation wearing my ig hat will be that the minister be relieved of all responsibilities pending the completion of the investigation and that we insist on the appointment of neutral figure of minist erial rank whose honesty is recognized this should send message that we will not put up with inbred political attempts to control essential services ditto oil agriculture finance keep in mind that you cannot allow yourself to be set up for failure if bremer wants to roll over for these people tell him youll be leaving right after your press confer ence your only protection from the coming shit story is being the honest professional who will not compromise ethically or professionally in completing your mission dont apologize for that youll piss few people off but you will ensure that you will survive if there is an attempt to minimize the ig investigation in baghdad i will disabuse them of pursuing that line of thought we can either take the initiative and use the situation as catalyst for political control in an essential area or follow the state department formula for preemptive capitulation if you dont make stand on this you will set yourself up to become the scapegoat when the situation heats up will talk to you on the conference call tomorrow assuming you are back all best jack c on 29 november 2003 shaw emailed plai ntiff sudnick stating lin wells et had tuesday meeting with sen burns who is strongly supportive of creating for first responder911 cdma system country wide that have parallel militaryinterior system imposed on it along the lines we discussed believe we could concoct new confirguration of liberty cdma bid with emergency system grafted on top of it you could cut and add at will but we would have an essentially am erican contractor which is already to move and which we could bring aboard with little or fee to build out system and then 7 apply the 95 million of money from interior to embed everything else we need that move would probably assure an additional 35000 korean troops to provide security leave it to you to figure how to make it work but such move could be tied into the funding for the administrative city centers that has already been worked into the supplemental along with communications funding on sole source priority basis i have had several conversations with knowledgeable people with experience in this particular area in the building one excia with 17 years doing exactly this and with you whipping on the horses i think we ought to get this in place in two to three months and we will get credit earlier as it begins to go into place will follow up separately on the other problems thanks all best jack d on 22 january 2004 shaw emailed plaintiff sudnick providing copy of the mail to one of the principals of liberty mobile and also of second entity guardian mobile formed with substantially the ownershipprincipals as liberty mobile stating i think everyone is in agreement on the importance of the frequency allocations and i know dan is on top of the issue let him cut the path thru the forest re the additions to the overall system let the team in baghdad add whatever bells and whistles they want the mobile vehicles are already route to theater and will be an important part of an instant on the ground capability and perception i am not concerned that it be 100 integrated only that it be 100 acceptable to dan in providing nationwide first responder coverage on an expandable cdma core and that it be perceived as sequentially moving into place at warp speed the best is the enemy of the good and dan is the integratorinchief if this system includes everything that should be included in it including guardians needsit will genuinely be the ideal system thanks the shaws email to plaintiff sudnick also forwarded the following correspondence from representatives of the guardian mobile entity hi jack 8 we received this earlier clearly these guys are trying to push us awayfrom the 800mhz band name redacted cpa official also called qualcomm on this topic earlier the 800mhz band is where the best most readily available equipment exists during the earlier cell phone competition it was stated that this band would be available for cdma we will not be able to build commercial network unless we get the 20mhz of spectrum we asked for in the 800mhz band i am concerned that they will try to use this approach to push cdma out of the picture the use of wifis for moving vehicles is sheer lunacy and will not work cdma2000 evdo is the optimal solution here i will call you later to discuss regards name redacted original message from name redacted representative of guardian mobile sent 22 january 2004 1542 to name redacted representative of guardian mobile subject fw technology questions fyi just in original message from name redacted cpa official sent 22 january 2004 1516 to name redacted representative of guardian mobile cc name redacted us government official subject technology questions dear name redacted cpa official i am conducting preliminary investigation into possible technologies that could be used in the first responder network and the associated spectrum requirements i have several questions that you and your team may be able to answer in region 1 the 3g technologies use the paired bands of 19201980 mhz and 21102170 mhz is the 3g type of technology suitable for public safety first responder network 9 i am also researching the possible application of wide area wifi technology to bring high speed data to mobile units such as in automobiles i recently read product announcement by wilan inc on their model libra 5800 that they claim can achieve data rate of 22 mbps are you familiar with this type of technology and would you recommend it for first responder network i would appreciate your assistance with these matters thank you and best wishes name redacted cpa official commercial 1 78128058085809 on 3 march 2004 shaw emailed plaintiff sudnick stating danthe continuing contracting minuet has obscured wh at must be part of the nana an alaska native corporation that had met with shaw and had been encouraged by shaw to team with guardian mobile and then present solesource bid under section 8a of the small business act for cdma network an attempt later rejected by cpa administrator bremerguardian rollout 1that while this contract is only the first step it is intended to prove the workability of an interoperable cdmagsm system using cdma spine for the entire first responder system2 that this first step is the foundation for the build out of truly national frn using cdma and 3that nana by getting this first contract is assured by law of being the vehicle for all the addon contracts necessary to build out the national system the final step of allowing for the other change we discussed after the completion of the national frn over the next couple of years should probably be codified in the original contract as well but might be added in some follow up document before the handover on june 30 the urgency of the need hereespecially the area beyond the green zoneshould shelve any need to start this slowly given moreover the way that the cellular license competition was cooked both re technology and recipients and that investigation is continuing regarding american involvement there can be question that this effort is to establish through competition the superiority of this us technology these contracts as you pointed out are only tiny part of the 10 overall frn and can be facilitated by bechtel or any one of the other on the ground contractors but the national rollout has to be driven by cdma and nanas overarching contracting primacy the transparency of this effort should be in contrast to the corruption manipulation and opacity of the competition last year this is especially true as i gather the southern region winner is going through internal upheaval as the component iraqi fixers try to cover their investments and their tails and will doubt be anxious to kill any potential cdma entry into any part of the telecom picture now that we have finally educated the pmo and contr acting wallahs we have to ensure that nana implements its intended mission with the priority and organization primacy it was supposed to have that effort ought to be something you can report to the nsc when you return here several weeks from now lets roll on this all best jack f on or about 9 march 2005 shaw having received cpa rfp generated by the head of contracting activity with technical and policy input provided by the office of the senior advisor to the ministry of communications under plaintiff sudnicks supervision which accurately stated the requirements of the first responder network and accordingly did not provide for any commercial cellular service whatsoever either locally or iraqwide communicated with nana but not with the cpa that nana should include in nanas contract documents language that shaw had written without nana bringing such language to the attention of the office of senior advisor to the ministry of communications or the cpa contracting authorities as follows the frn shall be designed so that the operators of the network nanaguardian shall be able to offer nationwide commercial cellular service on nationwide basis throughout iraq g this attempt by nanaguardian mobile was rejected by plaintiff sudnick as being improper cpa administrator j paul bremer having been advised of shaws conduct and these developments determined that solesource contract for frn should be awarded to nanaguardian and directed cpa contracting officials to reject the 11 nanaguardian proposal as not conforming to the cpa request for proposal rfp and to cancel the rfp cpa contracting officials did so h on 12 march 2004 shaw emailed plaintiff sudnick stating dani think you got from all quarters this morning the sense of dissatisfaction with your structuring of the frn effort you could not however read the response to the inadequacy of your response what you reported was not substantively an advance on what you reported here two weeks ago and on specific questions you were evasive or nonresponsive you effectively confirmed the lack of adequate coordination that concerned everyone here until and unless there is agreement that you have been responsive to the expressed needs from every quarter for the frn plan of yours will go forward to be funded so that there is misunderstanding your proposal for gsm vs cdma pilot is nonstarter the spine of the frn will be the interactiv gsmcdma you have ostensibly worked to fast track as required by law and which now lies completed and ready for signature in contracting there are rumors of march 16 rfp for frn but if that is what you proposed i can tell you that will be doa ditto any move to have the entire effort absorbed by bechtel under its expanded contract the whole point of the anc alaska native corporation 8a process involving only the nanaguardian mobile entity was to accelerate project implementation without affecting quality or price contracting confirmed last week that inexperienced lawyers in baghdad created delay of nearly two months in the anc 8a initiatives and that any qualified anc 8a will have their automatic priority rights as the prime contractor in both the frn build out and in the umm qasr port development effort in addition the cpa contracting support group located here at the pentagon is ready willing and able to provide immediate turn around capabilities to successfully complete the taski ng any additional bechtel effort will have to be built on this foundation as senator stevens will confirm when he arrives in baghdad his office is not pleased with the way you have tried to manipulate the process to promote your own projects and threaten th eskimos instead of moving aggressively 12 on the port and frn buildout as originally planned your report on the licensed cellular system buildout was disingenuous you omitted or downplayed serious problems with the atheer third of the system and that display of partial truth connected with your pressure to hire for frn oversight number of people drawn from the winning circles of that corrupted process raises questions of whether you have personal agenda in play here we are equally appalled re the lack of movement on the haider front you were told of the exquisite timing of the tokyo trip and the imperative of not staffing the agreed upon solution around town it was an initiative that would be arranged by iraqis for iraqis and i hope you have not slow rolled and killed the opportunity for change in that arena as well finally i asked you again this morning at the request of the deputy secretary for signed copies of the three licen contracts the originals of which were maintained by the cpa office of general counsel for safekeeping just as the system was going down in baghdad i was told while the service was being restored that you had ignored multiple requests for them i responded that i knew there had been sequence of delays and attempts to change the terms of the contracts but that i believed that the process had been completed by the first of the year is there some reason why they are not forthcoming given the results of the tender it is reasonable that someone here reviews the dimensions of each of those contacts from your demeanor this morning it looked as though you are trying to use jerry bremer as shield to avoid facing the above shortcomings you have served him responsively and well to address some of his pressing needs but you selectively informed him of problems in much the same way you have dealt with your support here what is important here is completing the job in the most expedited way you can either help or hinder that effort make the right choice jack i on 9 march 2004 shaw again emailed plaintiff sudnick stating danthis is heads up the specific technology focus is not the cdma element try and get the nana omnibus contract and the properly scoped frn spine contract out asap as well 13 as whatever other initiates are coming from you we have wasted two months playing games with contracting am meeting with p mo director admiral ret nash in dc this am jas j on 9 march 2004 shaw again emailed plaintiff sudnick stating danyou should be aware that bremer freeze on contract s today was result of reuben jeffreys call to him this am believe that there is considerable frustration from military side re lack of coordinationresponsiveness and adequate implementation of surveillance and security concerns in frn planning and revision yr calculated diminution of the scope of work for nanaguardian rightly raised the concerns of the qualcom folks who correctly believed that they were building out the spine of the national frn one which could absorb any and all security taskings imposed on it everyone has understood for months that the fast path to that buildout was nana and the proven dual gsmcdma capability that guardian represents your changes to the scope of work for guardian together with your sub rosa attempt to force the hiring of group of individuals heavily involved in the tainted cellular license awards looks very much like an attempt to preempt the frn in much the same way that the earlier effort was compromised it is important for the integrity of the process that the joint gsmcdma effort be given fair hearing particularly as it is the superior technology developed in the us if you are incapable of playing an honest broker in that respect you should step aside and allow the c6 people to develop the nana initiative that should have been in place 4 months ago its time for some professionalism instead of empire building jas k on 10 march 2004 shaw emailed plaintiff sudnick in an attempt to forestall legitimate planned developments in the frn program that would have precluded the improper manipulations that shaw had set in motion so as to benefit the private interests of his liberty mobileguardiannana friends and acquaintances danwe are concerned that there is an ongoing attempt to insert nokia and cisco in the frn development in ways are intended to remedy major shortcomings of atheer in their 14 cellular contract in the south given the gamut of unanswered questions regarding the cellular licenses it seems extremely unwise to bring them anywhere near to frn rollout equally important now that all of the nana contracts have been through the contracting approval process any attempt to push them aside for bechtel sole source would roll out even further the frn timeline we are unable to reconcile your ostensible ongoing support to expedite the nana solution which is mandated by law misstatement of law with the slow roll and back room manipulations that their contracts have been subjected to over the past month or so in an unrelated matter i have been asked by senior level figure in this department for signed copies of the cellular licenses and would appreciate receiving copies by cob today thank you jas l on 11 march 2004 shaw emailed plaintiff sudnick stating danyour silence is deafening you complained months ago that you would not allow yourself to be set up for failure in the end you have set yourself up for failure as your principal supporter at dod let suggest that you step aside and become part of an immediate solution rather than continuing part of the problem you are close to receiving unanimous vote of confidence in your ability to manage with the cellular license award in shambles the frn is the last opportunity to install viable cellular network that is responsive to our needs and requirements your continuing unresponsiveness and calculated delays in its implementation have nearly killed the projected plan which may have been what you had in mind but if you cant lead or follow get the hell out of the way my office remains readyalong with everybody else hereto facilitate the plans for the frn but you have done more in the last week to undermine the frn than you have done since august to implement it we have time for only one last shot and failure is unacceptable jas 17 plaintiff sudnick made report of shaws misconduct to cpa administrator ambassador bremer the cpa general counsel the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction as well as to shaws supervisor in shaws capacity as dod deputy 15 inspector general the dod inspector general 18 the cpa then received demands originating

for liberty mobile andor guardian net the right to operate mobile phone network in iraq 21 after learning that plaintiff sudnick nd others had made such allegations of misconduct against him shaw sought both to discredit plaintiff sudnick and to further his scheme to have the three iraq mobile phone licenses cancelled so that liberty mobileguardian net then would have an opportunity to gain at least one iraqi mobile phone license by commencing series of illegal disclosures to various media reporters and outlets of privacy actcovered information pertaining to plaintiff sudnick that contained false and inaccurate allegations that plaintiff sudnick had been offered and or had received bribes during the time that plain tiff sudnick served as cpa senior advisor to the ministry of communications the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures consisting of among other things privacy act record pertaining to sudnick consisting of report of investigation that shaw had

act information disclosures shaw stated that he was deputy undersecretar of defense and dod deputy inspector general 16 23 the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures consisted of at least each of the following on or about 12 april 2004 to washington dc reporter for the financial times of london on 12 april 2004 the reporter stated to plaintiff sudnick that he had copy of an official dod report stating that plaintiff sudnick had accepted bribes and had been fired by the cpa b between about 1230 april 2004 to reporter for the angeles times the reporter stated to plaintiff

from the washington times contacted plaintiff sudnick and stated that he had received copy of the dod ig report and that the report states that plaintiff sudnick received bribes from auchi to corrupt the iraq mobile phone selection process 23 each such representation of bribes or other misconduct contained in the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures is false and defamatory and damaging to plaintiff sudnick 24 as consequence of the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures the following news reports appeared in the media each of which falsely reported that plaintiff sudnick received bribes in connection with the iraq mobile phone licensing process on 9 may 2004 in the washington times according to the defense official significant and credible evidence reveals conspiracy was organized by auchi to offer bribes to fix the awarding of cellularlicensing contracts covering the three geographic areas of iraq several american british and iraqi nationals are under investigation in addition to auchi for the reputed cellphone bid rigging us officials said two american officials working within the iraqi communications ministry resigned last month and accused penta gon official of improperly influencing another contracting process in iraq the matter involving all three officials is under investigation by the pentagons inspector general the implications of auchi having fixed the three tenders for the entire iraqi cellulartelephone system go beyond mere corruption and technical empire building the defense official said 18 b on 6 june 2004 in the washington times the preliminary probe was prompted by report by the pentagons international armament and technology trade directorate shaws office that stated that cash payments of up to 115 million were made to two iraqi officials two british contractors and two americans as part of the fix orascom the central iraq cell phone licensee was described in the pentagon report as auchis

to plaintiff sudnick that shaw was violating the privacy act as to plaintiff sudnick by making the illegal disclosure to the financial times described above plaintiff sudnick 19 reported this development to the office of the dod and asked the dod ig to intervene so as to preclude further violations of the privacy act and any further damage to his reputation 26 dod took action either to preclude shaws further violation of the privacy act with respect to plaintiff sudnick or to prevent any further harm to sudnicks reputation from the illegal defamatory disclosures 27 none of the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures constituted routine use under the privacy act and applicable regulations 28 each of the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures was prohibited under the privacy act and implementing regulations with the force and effect of law including but not limited to regulations establishing dod information practices applicable to dod ig

december 2004 the office of the dod ig reported that plaintiff sudnick was 20 clean and thus was cleared of any of the allegations 34 nevertheless although plaintiff has expr essed interest in being reemployed by dod in an appropriately seniorlevel position dod still has not done so stating that the allegations that appeared in the press were reasons why dod could not do so 35 to this day such defamatory and false allegations concerning plaintiff continue to appear and are republished on the internet and are accessible to the world through various commonlyused search engines in cluding google yahoo aol etc as direct consequence of the illegal dod sudnick privacy act information disclosures 36 dod has not made known to the public or the media the determination of the dod ig that the allegations made against plaintiff sudnick by shaw and released by dod and shaw to the press are without merit 37 dod failed to take any corrective or disciplinary action visàvis shaw at any time
