nonunion workers who object to the calculation of the agency fee they must pay to the union the agen cyfee objectors need not pursue and exhaust the arbitration remedy before challenging the unions calculation in federal court ordina rily arbitration is matter of contract and party that has not agreed to arbitrate cannot be required to submit dispute to arbitration the fact that the air line pilots association established the arbitration remedy as means of complying with the courts decision in teachers v hudson 1986 does not mean that exhaustion must be required indeed hudsons emphasis on speedy remedy might be undercut by ex haustion difficulties that could result from holding federal court adjudicati on without preparatory arbitration proceeding to flesh out issues may be avoided through conscientious management of the pretrial process and the interest in avoiding multiple proceedings does not outweigh objectors resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent 72

that makes employer polling an unfair labor practice unl ess the employer had good faith reasonable doubt about the unions major ity support is facially rational and consistent with the national labor relations act however the boards factual finding that allentown mack lacked such doubt is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as whole the boards adoption of the same reasonable doubt standard for employer initiation of boardsupervised election for unilateral withdrawal of recognition and for employer polling is not so irrational as to be arbitrar or capricious under the administrative procedure act rational fact finder could not have conc luded however that allentown mack lacked reasonable g oodfaith grounds to doubt that the union enjoyed the continuing support of majority of unit employees and for this reason the boards decision was not supported by substantial evidence doubt means uncertainty and inform ation presented to the employer 7 of 32 unit employees said they did not support the union and others voiced the opinion that most employees did not support the union created reasonable uncertainty about support for the union board precedents discounting unverified assertions by one employ ee about other empl oyees preferences provide justification for the boards refusal to weigh the probative value of the assertions in establishing the existence of

define parate crime but in stead is penalty provision that authorizes enhancement of sentence for recidivist subsection makes it crime punishable by up to two years imprisonment for an alien who has been deported to reenter the ited states subsection b2 provides that in the case of any alien descri bed in subsection whose deportation was subsequent to conviction for commission of an aggravated felony such alien shall be fined imprisoned not more than 20 years or both because subsection b2 does not define crime the fact of earlier felony conviction is not an element of crime that must be set forth in an indictment for violation of 1326 whet her statutory language defines crime or instead sets forth sentencing factor s is ordinarily matter of congressional intent here various indications ma ke it reasonably clear that congress intended subsection b2 to set forth sentence enhancement the relevant statutory subject matter recidivism is as typical sentencing factor as one might imagine the original nguage of subsection b added by amendment in 1988 along with the title of the 1988 amendments support this interpretation 1990 amendment that chan ged the language to parallel that of subsection was merely housekeep ing measure not intended to effect substantive change moreover the gislative history of the 1988 amendment speaks only about creation of new penalties the doctrine of cons titutionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98639doubt requiring that statute be constr ued in such way as to avoid grave doubts as to its constitutiona lity is inapplicable here the interpretative circumstances point significantly in one direction on the issue of whether the constitution requires that fact that substantially increases the maximum permissible punishment for crime be charged in the indictment and found beyond reasonable doubt by jury the constitution does not require congress to treat recidivism as an element of an offense although not all of the elements of the test set forth in mcmillan v pennsylvania 1986 are satisfied the fact that subsection b2 increases maximum penalty does not tip the scales against constitutionality 54 opinion of court by breyer joined by

broadcasting candidate debate the decision of public television broadcaster to exclude candidate from participation in televised candidate debate did not violate that candidates first amendment rights although public broadcasting as general matter is not subject to first amendment public forum analysis candidate debates present the narrow exception to the rule candidate debates differ from other public programming because the purpose is to present the candidates views rather than the broadcasters and because of the exceptional significance of debates in the electoral process however the deba cannot be classified either as traditional public forum property traditionally open to assembly and debate or as designated public forum governmentcreated forum open to designated class of speakers instead the deba was nonpublic forum for first amendment purposes forum open to designated class of persons who must also be individually screened by the government exclusion of person from nonpublic forum may not be based on the speakers viewpoint but otherwise need only be reasonable in light of the purpose of the property that test was met in this case the candidate was excluded not because of his viewpoint but because he had generated appreciable public in terest it was reasonable exercise of journalistic discre tion to determine that inclusion of all ballotqualified ca ndidates might undermine th value of the debates 63 opinion of court by kennedy joined by rehnquist oconnor scalia thomas and breyer dissenting opinion by stevens joined by souter and ginsburg att v central office

showing the classifications practices and regulations affecting such charges it is unlawful for carrier to extend to any pe rson any privileges or to employ any practices affecting charges that are not sp ecified in the tariff in this case the respondent purchaser of bulk comm unications services from the petitioner longdistance provider alleged that the petitioner had failed to provide various

the term reserve strengthening as used in the tax reform act of 1986 to except certain amounts from an exclusion made available to property and casualty insurers is reasonable because the term reserve strengthening was not define d in the act and had established meaning either in the property and cas ualty insurance industry or in prior legislation an administrativ interpretation that is reasonable must be upheld the commissioners determination that the term encompasses any increase in reserves and is not limited to increases that result from changes in the methods or assumptions used to compute them is reasonable the term is broad enough to encompass all increases in reserves for whatever reason and from whatever source the petitioners hypothetical allegedly illustrating the possibility of absurd results is unrealistic 90 opinion for unanimous court by scalia baker v general motors corp 118 s ct 657 66 uslw 4060 11398 full faith and credit judicial decree approving settlement agreement between two parties to civil litigation cannot determine evidentiary issues arising in lawsuit initiated in another state by parties who were not covered by the decree and raising issues the merits of which were not considered in the first proceeding the full faith and credit clause does not require that the first states decree be given such preclusive effect thus michigan decree approving settlement between general motors corp and former employee in which the employee agreed not to testify against gm in any litigation involving gm does not prevent ssouri court from requiring the former employees testimony in product liability action brought by plaintiffs who were not involved in the michigan litigation the michigan decree could operate to prevent the former employ ee from volunteering his testimony in such an action but cannot prevent the missouri court from subpoenaing the employees testimony 90 opinion of court by ginsburg joined by rehnquist stevens souter and

knowingly and willf ully to misapply student loan funds insured under title iv of the higher education act of 1965 and did not contain an explicit intent to defraud state of mind requirement moreover because 1097d does contai n such requirement it is presumed that congress intended different interp retation of the two provisions section 1097a does not penalize every unauthorized transaction and thereby set traphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98639for the unwary but instead catches only the transgressor who intentionally exercises unauthorized dominion over fede rally insured student loan funds for his own benefit or for the benefit of third party the rule of lenity is inapplicable since nothing in the text structure or history of the provision warrants importation of an in tent to defraud

limitations the sixyear statute of limitations gove rning withdrawal liability under the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of 1980 29 usc 1451f1 does not begin to run on the date an em ployer withdraws from pension plan but instead begins when an employer fails to make payment on the schedule set by the fund by its terms the limitations period runs from the date on which the cause of action arose this language incorporates the standard rule that the period commences when the plai ntiff has complete and present cause of action pension plan cannot mainta in an action against an employer until several things have happened first the plan trustees must calculate the employers debt set schedule for installment payments and demand payment and then the employer must default on scheduled payment at this point when the employer misses scheduled payment the plan can sue and consequently this is when the statute of limitations begins to run an action filed more than six years after an installment was due is barred as to that installment but is not barred as to subsequent installments that were due within the sixyear period 90 opinion for unanimous court by ginsburg beach v ocwen federal bank 118 s ct 1408 66 uslw 4263 42198 truth in lending act rescission borrower in consumer credit transaction may not assert right of rescission under the truth in lending act as an affirmative defense in collection action brought by the lender more than three years after the consummation of the tr ansaction the act creates right of rescission if the lender fails to provide the borrower with clear disclosure of credit terms but provides in section 1635 f that this right shall expire after three years this plain language does not create statute of limitation applicable only to the initiation of an action but instead cuts off the right altogether the provision talks not of suits commencement but of rights duration the acts diffe rent treatment of recoupm ent or setoff claims expressly permitted as defense to an action to collect the debt after the applicable limitations period has run on damages actions suggests purposeful distinction treating rescission differe ntly from recoupment makes perfectly good sense since statutory righ t of rescission coul d cloud banks title on foreclosure 90 opinion for unanimous court by souter bogan v scottharris 118 s ct 966

underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9863942 usc 1983 as are federal state and regional legislators the common law accorded local legislators the same absolute immunity it accorded legislators at other levels of government and this was the understanding at the time section 1983 was enacted the rationales for such immunity are fully applicable to local legislat ors their exercise of gislative discretion should not be inhibited by judicial interference or distorted by the fear of liability the challenged actions in this case city council members vote for an ordinance that eliminated the respondents offi ce and the mayors approval of that ordinance and introduction of budget were legislative in nature even though the mayor was an executive offi cial his actions were legislative because they were

pursue the issue in habeas ac tion if he can first demonstrate cause actual prejudice or actual innocence in this case claim of actual innocence may be predicated on an incorrect unde rstanding by court prosecution and defense counsel as to the scope of 18 usc 924c which penalizes use of firearm during commission of drug trafficking offense in 1995 the supreme court in bailey v united states interpreted this provision as requiring the government to show active employment of the firearm yet the petitioners 1990 guilty plea had not been based on that understanding and he did not raise that issue on direct appeal guilty plea must be knowing and intelligent if the petitioner can tablish that his guilty plea was based on misinformation about the elements of section 924c offense then his plea was constitutionally invalid petitioners cl aim is not barred under teague v lane as being based on new rule of constitutional law ce the requirement th at guilty plea be knowing nd intelligent is not new the courts 1995 interpretation of the statute stands on different footing since it creates the significant risk that defendant has been convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal this case is remanded to allow the petitioner to try to make showing of actual innocence ie that it is more likely than not that reasonable juror would have voted to convict him had the law been properly explained 72 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by oconnor kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer opinion by stevens concurring in part and dissenting in part dissenting opinion by scalia

enactment of stat utory language that has been given settled interpretation generally indicates the intent to inco rporate that settled interpretation separate issue is wh ether the petitioner ntist

petition for an original writ of habeas corpus from the supreme court and for stay of execution pending resolution of paraguays action against the united states in the international court of justice is denied by not raising the issue in state court proceedings the petitioner defaulted on his claim that the vie nna convention on consular relations was violated when arresting authorities failed to inform him that as foreign national he had the right to contact the paraguayan consulate the convention does not trump the procedural fault doctrine on the contrary the general principle of international law that procedural rules of the forum state nation govern implementa tion of treaty in that state is embodied in the vienna convention itself moreover the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act enacted in 1996 supersed the convention to the extent of conflict the aedpa denies an evidentiary hearing to habeas petitioner who failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in

in government investigation does not pervert governmental function the fifth amendment right to remain silent does not comprehend the right to lie the potential for prosecutorial abuse of 1001 is an issue best addre ssed by congress although application of background interpretive principles of assumed legislativ intent sometimes leads to narrowing of the terms of criminal statute there is general principle that allows courts to interpret every criminal statute more narrowly than it is written the supreme court is not bound to apply consensus that has developed among the courts of appeals 72

willfully dealing in firearms without federal li cense even though he was unaware of the federal licensing requirement the statute as amended in 1986 penalizes knowingly violating specified sections and w illfully violating others including dealing in firearms without license knowingly does not necessarily have any reference to cu lpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law but instead merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense willfully on the other hand requires knowledge that the conduct is unlawful it does not however require that defendant have particularized knowledge of the speci fic provision under which he is charged such particularized knowledge may be re quired if highly technical statute might otherwise ensnare an individual engaged in apparently innocent conduct but that danger is not present in this case contrary statements by bill opponents during debate on the legisl ation are not reliable guide to interpretation uniform

not require that capital sentencing jury be instructed on the concept of mitigating evidence generally or on particular statutory mitigating factors virginias pattern capital sentencing instruction was constitutionally sufficient that instruction permits the jury to fix the penalty at death if jurors find beyond reasonable doubt that th defendants conduct in committing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98639crime was vile but allows the jury to opt for life imprisonment if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified in the selection phase of sentencing complete jury discretion is constitutionally permissible although the pattern instruction contai ned reference to mitigating evidence it did not foreclose the jurys consideration of relevant mitigating evidence in the context of this case in which the ju ry heard two days of testimony about the defendants family background and mental and emotional problems there is not reasonable likelihood that the ju rors understood the challenged instructions to preclude consideration of relevant mitigating evidence 63 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by oconnor scalia kennedy souter

refuses the unwelcome and threatening sexual advances of s upervisor yet suffers adverse tangible job consequences can recover against th employer under title vii of the civil rights act without showing that the employ er is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisors actions the employ er may however raise an affirmative defense labeling such claims as hostile work environment claims rather than as quid pro quo claims does not settle the vicarious liability issue and title viis general language prohibiting disc rimination does not reach that level of specificity because the act defines employer to include an agent of the employer the general common law of agency as reflected in the restatement second of agency provides some guidan ce agency law recognizes vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory authority but it is not always clear that the agency relationship aids supervisors sexual harassment of an employee when tangible employment action eg discharge demotion or undesirable reassignment is taken agency principles of vicarious liability and title viis equally basic principles of encouragin g forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees may be harmonized by rule imposing vicarious liability on an employer for such sexual harassment of an employee by supervisor but allowing the employ er to assert an affirmative defense that defense has two components that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct an sexually harassing behavior and that the employee unreasonably failed to ta ke advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities proof that th employer had implemented an anti harassment policy with complaint proce dure is not always necessary but proof that an employee failed to use an available complaint procedure will normally suffice to satisfy the employers bur den under the second element of the defense the case is remanded for application of these principles 72 opinion of court by

abused its discretion in sua sponte recalling its mandate denying habeas cor pus relief to state prisoner in order to consider an banc rehearing although the terms of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act do not govern this case an appeals court must exercise its discretion in manner consistent with the objects of that act and also must be guided by the general principles underlying habeas co rpus jurisprudence an appeals court abuses its discretion in such cases unless its action is necessary to avoid miscarriage of justice miscarriage of justice occurs only if petitioner asserting actual innocence can show that it is more likely than not that reasonable juror would have convicted h im in light of new evidence presented in his petition or if pe titioner challenging death penalty can show by clear and convincing evidence that upon cons ideration of the new evidence reasonable juror would have found him ligible for the death penalty unless the petitioner can make

committee required to disclose information about its members contribu tions and expenditures the federal election campaign act authorizes any pe rson who believes violation of the act has occurred to file complain t with the commission and provides that any party aggrieved by commission order dismissing its complaint may obtain judicial review the test for prudential standing is met because the language of the statute and the nature of the injury lead to the conclusion that congress intended to authorize this kind of suit history associates the word aggrieved with congressional intent to cast the standing net broadly moreover the injury of which the voters complain their failure to obtainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98639relevant information falls within the zone of interests protected by the statute the three tests for standing under article iii are also satisfied there is injury in fact since the alleged inability to obtain information that the statute allegedly requires ai pac to make public is both concrete and particular cases on taxpayer standing do not n ecessarily control voter standing moreover the fact that the voters asserted generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or large class of citizens does not preclude finding of injury in fact if the harm alleged is concrete and specific rather than abstract the harm asserted is fairly

willful or innocent the court in its discretion may increase or decrease the amount of statutory damages the acts other re medies provisions use the word court to refer to judge rather than jury the provision authorizing recovery of actual damages confers the right to jury trial but does not use the word court finally section 504c lacks othe r language ordinarily associated with jury trials the seventh amendment which preserves the right to jury trial in suits at common law has been interpreted as requiring jury trial in actions to enforce statutory rights that are analogous to common law

state in which federal enclave is located literal reading of any enactment would dramatically separate the statute from its intended purpose of filling gaps in federa l criminal law if par ticular act constitutes both assault and murder for example federal prohibition on assault should not preclude the possibility of applying state mu rder law therefore if there is federal law that punishes the

petiti oner has not established inju ryinfact in this case although the record of parole revocati on could be used against the petitioner in future parole hearing it would simply be one factor among many that the parole authority could consider by avoiding future criminal conduct the petitioner is able to prevent the possibility that his parole revocation will be used to increase his sentence in future criminal proceeding and it is purely matter of speculation whether the petitioner will appear in future litigation in which his parole revocation could be used to impeach him as witness or as

manufacturer or distributor sets maximum retail prices for product is not per antitrust violation albrecht v herald co 1968 holding that such price fixing is per violation is overruled challenges to vertical maximum price fixing should instead be decided on casebycase basis through application of the rule of reason that normally determines what constitutes violation of section 1 of the sherman act per rule is appropriate for types of trade restraints that have predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effects but is inappropriate if the ec onomic impact of practice is not immediately obvious it is diffi cult to maintain that vertically imposed maximum prices could harm consumers or competition to the extent necessary to justify per invalidation albrecht rested on theoretical assumptions that longer justify the rule the court has since recognized that vertical maximum price fixing may have procompetitive interbrand effects and has also described the primary purpose of the antitrust laws as protecting interbrand competition although the court applying the principle of stare decisis is usually very reluctant to overrule deci sions resting on statutory interpretation in the antitrust law area there is competing interest in recognizing and adapting to changed circumstances and the lessons of accumulated experience the sherman act reflects congressional expectation that courts will draw on common law tradition in giving sh ape to the acts broad mandate 90 opinion for unanimous court by oconnor steel co v citizens for better environment 118 s ct 1003 66 uslw 4174 3498 standing to sue the plaintiff environmental gr oup lacked standing to sue for declaratory and injunctive relief under the citizen suit section of the emergency planning and community righttoknow

injury to the plaintiff the complaint thus failed one of the three irreducible requirements under article iii for standing to sue that of redressability declaratory judgment in this case is worthless there being controversy over the defendants failure to file reports civil penalties are payable only to the united states nd vindicate the undifferentiated public interest in implementation of the law although rec overy of investigation and prosecution costs would assuredly benef it the plaintiff as opposed to the public at large plaintiff cannot achieve st anding to litigate substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit the injunctive relief sought inspection authority and receipt of fu ture reports cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong the issue on the rits whether the

privilege survives the death of the client notes of an attorney for former white house deputy counsel vincent foster based on an interview with foster shortly before his death are protected by the attorneyclient privilege from disclosure in criminal investigation conducted by the office of independent counsel the privilege is intended to encourage full and fra nk communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broade r public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice with few exceptions courts have presumed that the privilege survives the death of the client cases making an exception in testamentary disputes are rationalized as furthering the clients intent but there is reason to suppos as general matter that grand jury testimony about confidential communications furthers the clients intent the independent counsels argument that only clients intending to perjure themselves will be chilled by rule of disclosure after death overlooks the fact that the attorneyclient privilege serves broader purposes than the privilege against selfincrimination attorneys are consulted for wide range of personal family financial and business matters having nothing to do with criminal liability moreover without the assuran ce of confidentiality protected by the privilege the client may not have made such communications in the first place and any loss of evidence may be more apparent than real an exception limited to information of importance to particular criminal case would introduce substantial uncertainty into application of the privilege arguments against survival of the privilege are based in large part on speculation and the independent counsel has not made sufficient showing to overturn the common law rule 63 opinion of court by

transporting out of the c ountry without reporting as required by federal law that he was taking out more than 10000 in currency violated the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment forfeiture of all of respondents currency was grossly dispropor tional to the gravity of his offense the forfeiture was imposed under 18 us c 982a1 which provides that anyone convicted of willf ully violating the reportin g requirement shall forfeit any property involved in such ffense such forfeiture constitutes punishment and is thus fine within the meaning of the excessive fines clause the forfeiture serves re medial purpose of compensating the government for loss since the govern ments only loss is of information precedent derives from the tradition of civil in rem forfeiture of property involved in crime since such forfeitures we re in theory directed against guiltyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98639property and were not considered punish ment the test for whether fine is excessive is one of proportionality and grossly disproportional to the gravity of defendants offense best reflects the constitutional standard the fine in this case was grossly disproportional the respondents crime was solely reporting offense it was lawful to take the currency out of the country if that action was reported the mone was lawfully obtained and the money was to be used to pay lawful debt the harm caused by the reporting violation was minimal and the maximum fine that could have been imposed under the sentencing guidelines was 5000 54 opinion of court by thomas joined by stevens souter ginsburg

the fifth amendments other protections each of which is implicated only by action of the government that it binds early interpretation of th clause established that probable incrimination under state law was not valid basis for asserting the privilege in federal court and also that state c ourts could compel testimony that might incriminate under federal law these inte rpretations were modified after the court ruled in 1964 that the selfincrimin ation clause applies to the states but the underlying rationale for the clause di d not change the clause applies the principle that the courts of govern ment from which witness may reasonably fear prosecution may not in fairness compel the witness to furnish testimonial evidence that may be used to prove his guilt for purposes of applying this principle federal and state jurisdictions are considered as one and the court created an exclusionary rule prohibiting federal courts from using testimony compelled by states there is parallel

if the corporate veil may be pierced through operation of common law principles nothing in cercla purports to alter this bedrock principle of corporate law but cercla liability may turn on operation as well as ownership the district court in this case incorrectly focused on whether the parent corporation operated the subsidiary the issue instead is wh ether the parent cor poration operated the facility in particular whether agents of the corporation managed or conducted operations specifi cally related to polluti on or to compliance with environmental regulations it is not enough to show that directors of the parent corporation also served as directors of the subsidiary rather the issue is whether these officers were acting in their capacities as officers of the parent company and not

barring unreliable evidence cases in which the court has held exclusion of evidence to be unc onstitutional as significantly undermining fundamental elements of the accuseds fense are distinguishable rule 707 did not prevent the accused from testifying on his own behalf and did not prevent him from introducing any factual evidence the rule merely operated to bar the accused from introducing expe
