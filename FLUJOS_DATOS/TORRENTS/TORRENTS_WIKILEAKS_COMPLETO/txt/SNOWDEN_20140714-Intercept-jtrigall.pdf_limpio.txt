tools and techniques are developed by various teams within jtrig we like to let people know when we have something that we can think we can use but we also dont want to oversell our capability for this reason each tool indicates its current status we may put up experimental tools or ones that are still in development so you know what we are working on and can approach jtrig with any new ideas but experimental tools by their nature will be unreliable if you raise expectations or make external commitments before speaking to us you will probably end up looking stupid most of our tools are fully operational tested and reliable we will indicate when this is the case however there can be reasons why our tools wont work for some operational requirements eg if it exploits provider specific vulnerability there may also be legal restrictions so please come and speak to jtrig operational staff early in your operational planning process edit current priorities capability development
