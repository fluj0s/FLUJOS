private schools are not eligible if the parent opts for scholarship to private school the parent must obtain the students admission to par ticipating private school and request the scholarship from the school district at least 60 days prior to the first scholarship payment in turn the school district must inform the parent of all options av ailable including enrolling in another public school within the district or enrolling the student in public school in an adjacent school district that offers the services th child requires and that has space available pa rents choosing either private school placement or placement in another school district are responsible for transporting the child to the new school parents also have the option of returning their child to the public school system

requirements comply with general florida laws pertaining to private schools and adhere to the tenets of its publis hed disciplinary procedures prior to the expulsion of scholarship student in addition the parent and the stude nt accepting scholarship must fulfill certain obligations and accept certain respons ibilities for example the student must attend the school throughout the school year unless excused for good cause such as illness and must comply with the school s rules of conduct the parent must participate in the schools parent involve ment activities unless excused perhaps of greatest importance the statute notes that in accepting scholarship the parent is exercising his or her parental option to place his or her child in private sc hool the us department of educa tion ed has concluded that if the state of florida and local educational agencies leas in the state have made free appropriate public education fape available to eligible children with disabilities as idea requires but their parents elect to place them in private schools through the scholarship program then such children are considered private school child ren with disabilities enrolled by their parents under idea such parentally placed private school students with disab ilities have individua l entitlement to special education and related services in connection with those placements12 ed also points out that federal nondiscriminati on laws with respect to indi viduals with disabilities do not apply directly to participa ting private schools because title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada does not apply to private schools13 and section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 depends on the acceptance of federal funds14 the amount of the scholarship is the sser of the private schools tuition and fees or the amount of state funds the student would have generated if attending florida public school if the value of the sc holarship is insufficient to cover the full cost of the tuition of the private school th shortfall must be covered such as byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31489crs5 15 this is unlike the florida opportunity scholarship program in which schools cannot charge tuition

the substantial growth in the number of particip ating students and schools to changes made in the program in 2001 one significant change llows private schools to charge parents the difference between

as model program for providing greater school choice to parents of children with disa bilities and by others as one under which parents sometimes unwittingly give up rights afforded by the idea some supporters of school choice w ould like to see the congress turn to the mckay scholarship program as an exampl of school choice provisions that could be incorporated into the idea during reauthorization18 some suggest that the congress amend the idea to allow states to opt out of idea requirements if they implement school choice prog rams similar to floridas19 others see school choice programs modeled after floridas as having the potential to undermine the protections and educational benefits currently afforded under the idea and as not holding private schools acc ountable20

educational opportunities av ailable to pupils such as those from lowincome families those who attend lowperforming schools and those whose families seek an education provided by an entity other than their local public school some proponents also have suggested that the availability of school choice will improve public schools through market compe tition some opponents have expressed concern about potential negative effects on public schools and their pupils including the redirection of public educa tion resources and an erosion of the ideal of common public education for all additionally so aspects of school choice have raised constitutional questions especially when involving religiously affiliated schools22 although detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this report the supreme court recently held that govern ment educational assistance program does not run afoul of the establishment clause if it is neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance to broad class of citizens who in turn direct the aid to schools of their choice which may incl ude religiously affiliated schools23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31489crs7 23 continued zelman v simmonsharris

funding 26 it should be emphasized that what is required under idea is the provision of free appropriate public education the supreme court in board of education of the hendrick hudson central school district v rowley 458 us 177 1982 held that this requirement is satisfied when the state provides personaliz ed instruction with fficient support services to permit child to benefit educationally from that instruction and th at this instruction should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to advance from grade to grade idea does not require that state provide sufficien t resources and services to maximize the potential of children with disabilities 27 for additional information on idea requirements see crs report rl31259 individuals with disabilities education act stat utory provisions and selected issues by nancy lee jones and richard n aplingoverview of idea school choice proposals could raise additional issues for children with disabilities and th eir parents to understand some of these issues it is necessary to have some unders tanding of the idea the central federal statute dealing with children with disabilities and special education the idea both authorizes federal funding for special ducation and related services24 and for states that accept these funds25 sets out principles under which sp ecial education and related services are to be provided the requirements are detailed especially when the regulatory interpretations are considered the ma jor principles include requiring that states and school districts make available free appropriate public education fape26 to all children with disabilities generally between the ages of 3 and 21 states and school districts identify locate and evaluate all children with disabilities regardless of the severity of their disability to determine which children are eligible for special education and related services each child receiving services has an individual education program iep spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her n eeds the parent must be partner in planning and overseeing the child s special education and related services as member of the iep team to the maximum extent appropriate children with disabilities must be educated with children who are not disabled and states and school districts provide procedural safeguards to children with disabilities and their parents including right to due process hearing the right to appeal to federal district court and in some cases the right to receive attorneys fees27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31489crs8 28 see 42 usc 12181 which defines public accommodation in part as nursery elementary secondary undergraduate or postgraduate private school or other place of education 29 42 usc 12187 30 343 fsupp 279 ed pa 1972 31 348 fsupp 866 ddc 1972possible additional issues with respect to idea because of the unique nature of idea as both grants prog ram and also civil rights act additional issues could arise with respect to federal voucher progra m for children with disabilities would students rights continue one set of issues with respect to potential idea voucher program involves the ex tent to which the rights of children with disabilities and their parents guaranteed under id ea would continue under federal special education voucher system apparently idea requirements and protections do not apply to the florida vouc her program because federal funds are not included in the voucher payments and because parents are determined to have unilaterally decided to place their childre n in private schools however under an idea voucher program federa l funds potentially could flow to private schools central question likely would arise concerning what student and parental rights and private school obligations would re main attached to those funds clearly any legislative language on this issue would be key in making the determination of what rights would apply however it should be noted that the student and parental rights at issue would include not only those delineated in idea but also those contained in other civil ri ghts statutes notably section 504 and the americans with disabilities act as well as constitutional rights although ed states that section 504 and title ii of the ada are not directly applicable to the florida mckay program the rationale for that conclusion is that the mckay program receives federal funds if federa l idea funds were involve d that rationale would longer apply in addition priv ate schools are covered under title iii of the ada28 however title iii specifically exempts tities controlled by religious organizations from coverage29 thus limiting ada coverage of relig iously affiliated schools hr 1373 provides that the authorization of pa rent to exercise private school choice would fulfill the states obligation to pr ovide free appropria public education the bill also would deem private schools accepting vouchers to be providing free appropriate educati on and to be in compliance w ith section 504 hr 1373 does not discuss compliance with title iii of the ada would state and local funding be included regardless of the receipt of federal funds certain cons titutional rights regarding an education for children with disabilities may apply the constitutional rights of children with disabilities to receive an education if education is be ing provided to childre n without disabilities were examined in two seminal cases parc v state of pennsylvania30 and mills v board of education of the district of columbia 31 in essence these cases found constitutional due process and equal protection violations when children with disabilities were denied education and were the impetus to the enactment of pl 94httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31489crs9 32 see 20 usc 1412a5a142 the original idea legislation althoug h there have been few interpretations of these constitutional rights since they were codified in the statute it is likely that courts would find some rights to exist even in the absence of idea although the exact parameters of these righ ts are difficult to determine one of the issues vouchers would raise in this context is whether stat and leas would be obligated to provide funds to follow the child with disability to private school in addition to voucher for federal idea funds it could be argued based on parc and mills that if state chooses to educate children without di sabilities it must also educate children with disabilities and the existence of federal voucher does not negate that responsibility on the other hand it could be argued that if the state was w illing to provide free appropriate public education and the parents opted to place their child in private school with the federal vouc her there are other obligations on the state how would voucher funding be structured other issues could arise with respect to the mechanism for providi ng vouchers and the amount of the voucher would states continue to receive their full idea formula allocation and then distribute some portion of that allocatio n to parents via vouchers or would the federal government estab lish separate source of funding to provide vouchers directly to parents what would be the amount of the voucher for example would each child receive voucher for the same amount or would the amount of the voucher be related to the ty pe of disability what c ould the voucher be used for for example the voucher could be limited to tuition or it could be used for other expenses such as transportation could private schools charge more than the amount of the voucher with parent s making up the difference or would tuition be limited to the amount of the voucher hr 1 373 would allow federa l funds allocated to states under section 611 of the idea to be used to supplement state voucher funds could least restrictive environments be provided to the extent that idea guarantees continued to be provided under an idea voucher program another set of issues could involve the student makeup of pa rticipating private schools as noted above basic principle of idea is that children with disabilities are to receive services in the least restrictive environment lre this means that to the maximum extent appropriate children with disabilities are to be educated with their nondisabled peers in regular classrooms only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and serv ices cannot be achieved satisfactorily can the child be placed in separate classr oom or in special school32 inclusion or mainstreaming with children who are not disabled is not problem for public schools at least in one sense since ch ildren with disabilities usually account for 10 or 12 of the overall enrollment in considering the effects of vouc her program one might look to the experience of public charter schools in serv ing students with disabilities according to the eds evaluation of the public ch arter schools program in many instances students with disabilities are attracted to charter schools which often offer programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31489crs10 33 lee anderson et decade of public charter schools evaluation of the public charter schools program 20002001 evaluation report sri international november 2002 pp 1618 34 one exception to the lre requirement in the st atute involves child with disability who has been convicted as an adult and incarcerated in an adult prison based on demonstrated bona fide security or compelling penolog ical interest that cannot otherwise be accommodated the iep team may modify this and other requirements of idea 20 usc 1414d6b 35 apparently the original statutory lang uage tied eligibility to students academic performance scholarship availability required that the students academic progress in at least two areas has not met expected performance levels for the previous year as determined by the students iep or absent specific performance levels identified in the iep the student performed below grade level on state or local assessments and the parent believes that the student is not progressing adequately towards hisher iep goals quoted in the littleknown case of americas largest school choice program by daniel mcgroarty in rethinking special educa tion for new century thomas b fordham foundation and progressive policy institute chester finn andrew j rotherham and charles r hokanson jr eds p 303targeted to such students33 however one also could imagine under voucher system private schools that specialize in serving childre n with certain disabilities such schools exist now for serving certain relatively severely disabled children these specialized private schools might ttract few if any nondisabled children thus children in such schools might not be educated with their nondisabled peers even if those childrens di sabilities were mild enough to permit their being educated full time in regula r public classrooms34 who would be eligib for vouchers another set of issues involves the criteria under which parents and students could participate in an idea voucher program as discussed above some fe deral public choice programs are linked to evidence over time of school failure for example the child left behind act would only authorize intradistrict public school choice for stude nts attending schools that had been identified for school improve ment after not maki ng adequate yearly progress for 2 consecutive years on the other hand the florida mckay scholarships are available to parents who express dissatisfaction with their childs educational progress35 the nature of participation criteria could significantly influence the popularity of an idea voucher program for example some could argue that the popularity of the florida program can be attr ibuted in part to the ease with which parents can demonstrate eligibility elig ibility for floridas other voucher program opportunity scholarships is based on school performance to be eligible to transfer to high performing public school

effects of funding incentives on special education enrollment manhattan institute for policy research dec 2002 http wwwmanhattanins tituteorghtmlcr_32htm this issue has been examined at the federal

authorized new funding formula for the grantsto states program which became effective in fy2000 prior to that year grantstostates funds were distributed based on states shares of children with

issues for parental idea voucher program include whether eligibility will be based on individual or sc hool performance or on parental dissatisfaction with the fape being provided in addition would children with disabilities previously placed in private schools by their parents be eligible under th mckay scholarship program such children are not eligible would sufficient choice be provided related issue is the extent to which private schools will choos to participate in an idea voucher program the mckay scholarship experience suggests that participation rates can be quite high if eligibility requirements are modest and schools are per mitted substantial flexibility indeed this is one argument for vouchers and other choice programs such as charter schools namely that by re ducing regulatory requirements schools are freed to be more creative and provide be tter education however the degree of freedom from legal requirements may be inversely related to the degree to which idea guarantees and protections follow the child and the id ea funding to the private school one can surmise that the greater the degree to which federal statutes and regulations are applicable to publicly funded children with disabilities serv ed in private schools the more likely some or many private schools will choose not to participate is there an incentive to overidentify children as having disabilities and would the provisi on of vouchers alleviate this problem recent study by the manhattan ins titute for policy research has argued that the increase in the enrollment of children
