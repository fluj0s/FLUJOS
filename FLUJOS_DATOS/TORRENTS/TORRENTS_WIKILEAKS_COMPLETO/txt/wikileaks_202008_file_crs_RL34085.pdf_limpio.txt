house commission on congressional mailing standards candidate is member whose name appears anywhere on any official ballot to be used in such election5 without regard to whether or not the candidate is running unopposed because state laws vary considerably in regard to ballot practices in primary elections this definition of candidate may impact house members differently depending on which state they represent in some states candidates running unopposed are not placed on primary ballots and therefore house member running in such state would not be subject to the mass mailing prohibition in other states unopposed candidates do appear on primary ballots in which case the mass mailing prohibition would apply to house members running unopposed senate rules define candidate as an individu who seeks nomination for election if that individual has either received campaign contributions in excess of 5000 or made campaign expenditures in excess of 5000 6 all senators are prohibited from franking mass mailings prior to the general election regardless of whether or not they are candidates in regard to primary elections senate rules exempt candidates running unopposed from the mass mailing restrictions7 uncontested candidacy is only established when the committee on rules and administration receives written certification from the appropriate state official hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 would amend election year mass mailing restrictions by altering the period of time during which members are prohibited from franking any mass mailing and the statutory conditions under which the prohibition applies if enacted members of both the house and senate would be prohibited from mailing any mass mailing during the period starting 90 days prior to any primary election in which such member is candidate and ending on the day of the general election the new statutory prohibition would apply only to members who were candidates for reelection to any federal office however members would still be subject to further restrictions found in house and senate rules

current law does not prohibit congressional committees and subcommittees from sending mass mailings during the election year period in which individual members are restricted from mailing any mass

s 936 and s 1285 that amend the election year mass mailing restrictions would generally increase the period of time individual members were restricted from mailing any mass mailings however because state laws vary in regards to the timing of primary elections both current law and the proposed legislation affect individual members differently based on when primary elections are held in the state they represent had the proposed legislation been enacted prior to the 2006 election some house members would have seen difference in the length of their restricted period others would have seen an increase of up to 155 days all senators would have seen an increase in the restricted period of at least 30 days some would have seen an increase of up to 215 days table 1 reports the 2006 primary date and the length of the massmailingrestricted period for the 2006 election by state it also reports the length of the hypothetical massmailingrestricted period for the 2006 election and the difference between the hypothetical and actual period if the election year mass mailing restrictions proposed in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 had been in effect for house members the restricted period would have been increased for all members whose states hold primaries more than 90 days prior to the general election in 2006 sixteen states held primaries fewer than 90 days prior to the general election thirtythree states held primaries more than 90 days prior to the general election 8 for example under current law in 2006 all house members seeking reelection were prohibited from sending mass mailings fewer than 90 days prior to the general electionaugust 9 2006 to november 7 2006 texas held its primary on march 7 2006 house members from texas were thus also prohibited from making mass mailings between december 7 2005 and march 7 2006 therefore members from texas were restricted from making mass mailings for two separate 90 day periods and total of 180 days 9 if the proposed legislation in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 had been enacted prior to the 2006 primary and general election house members from texas would have been prohibited from mailing any mass mailings from december 7 2005 90 days prior to the primary election until november 7 2006 total of 335 days there would have been increase for house members representing states that held primaries fewer than 90 days prior to the general election for example hawaii held its primary on 8 one statelouisianahas primary election runoff election if necessary is held following the general election current law restricts mass mailings by members from louisian in the 90day period prior to the general election and if necessary until the day of the r unoff election 9 the phrase fewer than 90 days has several plausible interpretations in interpretive rule 149 the senate ethics committee stated that the limitation is computed by excluding the actual day of the election whether it is primary general regular special or runoff and used the following example if primary election is scheduled for may 1 the moratoria restrictions would begin at 115959 pm on march 2 all dates listed in this report follow this guideline and cutoff dates are listed strictly the cutoff date for the example would be listed as march 2 because the proposed amendment to the restrictions describes period of time rather than using the fewer formulation it is not clear how the new restrictions would be interpreted in this report 9 0day period will be interpreted as fewer than 90 days as defined by the senate rules

making mass mailings between june 25 2006 and september 23 2006 because this period overlapped with the general election restrictions that began on august 9 2006 house members from hawaii were restricted from making mass mailings for single period of 135 consecutive days if the proposed changes in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 had been enacted prior to the 2006 primary and general election house members from hawaii would have been prohibited from mailing any mass mailings from june 25 2006 until november 7 2006 the identical 135 days prohibited under current law senators would be restricted for at least 30 additional days under the proposed legislation because of the provision which extends the restricted period from 60 days to 90 days prior to the primary election all senators who represent states that hold primaries fewer than 90 days prior to the general election would be restricted for 30 additional days for example under current law in 2006 senator who represented arizona was prohibited from mailing any mass mailing from july 14 2006 until november 7 2006 total of 116 days if the proposed changes in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 had been enacted prior to the 2006 primary and general election senator from arizona would have been prohibited from mailing any mass mailings from june 14 2006 until november 7 2006 total of 146 days under current law senators who represent states that hold primaries more than 90 days prior to the general election are restricted from making mass mailings for total of 120 days 60 prior to the primary election and 60 prior to the general election for example in 2006 senator who represented north dakota was prohibited from mailing any mass mailing from april 14 2006 until june 13 2006 and from september 8 2006 until november 7 2006 if the proposed changes in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 had been enacted prior to the 2006 primary and general election senator from north dakota would have been prohibited from mailing any mass mailings from march 15 2006 until november 7 2006 total of 257 days if enacted hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 would also make the election year massmailing restricted period identical for house members and senate members members of both chambers would be prohibited from sending mass mail during the period 90 days prior to the primary election until the date of the general election under current law as already noted election year mass mailing restrictions are shorter for senators than for house members

one question raised by the proposed legislation is how the new restrictions on mass mailing by individual members would apply to members from states and territories that do not hold primary elections currently one state louisiana and one territory american samoa do not hold primary elections instead each uses system in which the general election is an open contest if candidate receives more than 50 of the vote runoff election is held several weeks later with the date set pursuant to state or territorial law

primaries are clear candidates are prohibited from franking mass mailings fewer than 60 days 90 for house members prior to any primary or general election including runoff elections10 thus for example members who represent louisiana are prohibited from franking mass mailings fewer than 60 days prior to the general election as well as during the 60 days prior to any runoff election that might take place after the general election however under the proposed changes in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 the beginning of the restricted period is defined in relation only to primary elections members are prohibited from franking mass mailings beginning 90 days prior to the primary election this creates an ambiguity for states and territories that do not have primary elections arguably the intent of the proposed legislation is that the restricted period would begin 90 days prior to the general election in states without primaries however the legislation could be alternatively read to place restrictions on mass mailings in states and territories that do not have primaries in this case members from such states would be subject only to mass mailing restrictions in house and senate rules similarly the end of the restricted period in the proposed legislation is defined in relationship only to the general election with specific mention of runoff elections as with the beginning of the restricted period arguably the intent of the legislation is to restrict mass mailings in the period between the general election and runoff election in state without primary election however the legislation could be alternatively read to place restrictions on mass mailings between the general and runoff elections in this case again members from such states would be subject only to mass mailing restrictions in house and senate rules

another question raised by the proposed legislati on is how the new restrictions would apply to members seeking nonfederal public office under the current statute house members are subject to the election year mass mailing restrictions if they are candidate for reelection or for any other public office11 senators are subject to election year mass mailing restrictions for the general election regardless of their status as candidates and for primary elections if they are candidate for any national state or local office12 under the proposed changes in hr 1614 s 936 and s 1285 members are only subject to the restrictions if they are candidates for reelection to any federal offices candidates for nonfederal office would only be subject to the restrictions of house and senate rules current house rules reflect the current statutory laws restricting election year mass mailings 90 days prior to any primary or general election to which the member is candidate current senate rules also reflect the current statutory laws restricting election year mass mailings fewer than 60 days prior to any primary election to which the senator is contested candidate and fewer than 60 days prior to any general election 10 39 usc 32106ai 11 39 usc 32106aiiii 12 39 usc 32106c
