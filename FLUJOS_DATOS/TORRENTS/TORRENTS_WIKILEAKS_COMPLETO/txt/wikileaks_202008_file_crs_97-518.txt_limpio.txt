jonathan sanford analyst in international political economy foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress china and the multilateral development banks summary congress is currently considering appropriations for us contributions to the world bank and other multilateral development banks mdbs as well as separate legislation that would require us representatives to these institutions to oppose all concessional loans to china the world bank and asian development bank adb are together the largest source of foreign development assistance to the peoples republic of china in recent years the multilateral development banks mdbs have lent approximately 4 billion annually to china the adb makes only market based loans to china most world bank loans to china are also on nearmarket terms and lending from its concessional loan window the international development association ida is scheduled to end by 1999 the mdb marketbased loan facilities mainly finance the construction of infrastructure and industrial facilities agricultural development loans for social programs and funding to directly promote economic reform have accounted for only small portion of mdb marketbased loans environmentally oriented loans have become significant fraction in recent years ida concessional loans on the other hand have focused mainly on social programs and on agricultural projects in impoverished regions significant though smaller share has also gone for environment and economic reform programs mdb lending to china dipped substantially following the governments attack on protesters in tiananmen square in june 1989 the worlds largest industrial countries the group of seven g7 which control majority of the voting stock in the world bank and adb agreed in 1990 that they would support only mdb loans for basic human needs the united states still opposes unrestricted lending to china but most other countries have relaxed their opposition and now support unrestricted mdb lending to china the united states does not have veto or other capacity to block approval of mdb loans it does not support us relations with other ida donors have been strained in recent years over us arrears and efforts to impose us priorities on mdb lending policies in 1996 the other ida donors gave the united states chance to catch up on its payments to ida instead of making new contributions but it did not do so some have argued that us influence in the mdbs should be diminished if the united states is not willing to carry its share of their costs the prospects for the future of mdb assistance in china are uncertain in few years the world bank will have to cut its level of ibrd lending or waive its rule against lending more than 10 of its funds to one country if us influence in the world bank diminishes japan and some other countries may want to revisit the question of terminating ida assistance to china it is not evident what will replace ida as source of credit for social programs and noncommercial agricultural development since the chinese government has not shown that it is willing to borrow marketrate money to fund these activities

multilateral development banks should the mdbs lend to china the world bank and asian development bank adb have been large and growing sources of loans for china in 1985 the world bank and adb agreed to lend china 11 billion ten years later the annual total for their loan commitments to china had quadrupled to 43 billion in both 1995 and 1996 today many debate what role the mdbs should play in the worlds most populous country resources are scarce at the multilateral development banks mdbs and there are many alternative claimants for available funds china has one of the fastest growing economies in the developing world yet it is also the home of many very impoverished people some people ask whether the united states japan and other major countries should help finance the development of country that may be their international rival in the coming century should the mdbs stop making lowcost concessional rate loans to china should they make these loans only for activities that promote poverty alleviation environmental preservation and economic reform should they lend at all given chinas questionable record as regards official respect for internationally recognized human rights its military buildup and its apparent readiness to use force in settling international disputes alternatively can the mdbs justify not lending to china given its low per capita income the prevalence of poverty in its less developed regions and the chinese governments apparent orientation towards development this report does not attempt to answer these questions rather it provides brief analysis of chinas relationship with the mdbs to highlight some issues and help members of congress congressional staff and observers better understand the context for the current debates in congress and the

changed categorization of certain projects crs4 what is chinas per capita income there are two methods for calculating countrys per capita income both are valid but they are not interchangeable per capita gnp in dollars the first method which the world bank uses for determining ida eligibility calculates developing countrys per capita income in dollars through simple conversion process the per capita gross national product gnp is measured in local currency and converted to dollars using the average exchange rate for the past three years as adjusted for inflation chinas annual per capita gnp in 1995 was about 5200 yuan on the basis of this calculation the world bank said in 1996 that chinas per capita annual income the previous year was 620 this system is useful for comparing the income levels of countries when the ability to buy imported goods is an issue it gives an unrealistic picture of local living standards however since products not traded internationally services rent etc are valued by an exchange rate applicable only to traded goods actual living standards can be much higher than implied in this dollar figure the system is also subject to technical problems and relies on gnp calculations that may not be very accurate for example many transactions are outside the purview of official data collection the bank made adjustments in the base data for china in 1994 and 1995 earlier world bank data reported that chinas per capita gnp stood at 370 in 1993 two years later according to world bank figures chinas per capita gnp was 620 chinas economy was not twothirds larger in 1995 than it had been in 1993 technical changes in the method of calculation account for much of the apparent change in the banks figures for chinas per capita annual income the bank made similar recalculation of income figures for other countries purchasing power parity the second method seeks to establish purchasing power parity ppp using fixed market basket of goods and services to compare income levels in different countries peoples ability to purchase the items in the basket will vary from country to country however the items are valued according to common standard regardless of their local price the world bank says chinas ppp income in 1995 was 2920 slightly higher than those of salvador and the philippines the ppp system allows better comparisons of living standards among countries however it prices the income generated in countrys domestic economy as though it were useable in the international economy and it does not take the varying quality of goods sold in different countries into account thus it tends to blur the differences in countries relative capacity to purchase imported goods the world bank uses the per capita gnp in dollars method as its benchmark for determining countries eligibility for ida aid ida loans mainly finance the purchase of foreign goods the world bank has not specified an alternative measure using the ppp methodology for determining whether countries are eligible for ida loans affiliate lends on lowcost terms mainly to countries with per capita incomes below 869 annually3 most have per capita income levels below 400 the ifc mainly 3 ida loans for china are repayable over 35 years including 10year grace period the borrower pays 34 of 1 service charge on the disbursed balance crs5 helps private domestic firms in developing countries4 miga insures or guarantees foreign investors in developing countries against various noncommercial risks expropriation etc its exposure in china is about 112 million and is not discussed here in 1996 assistance to china comprised about 17 of all new ibrd loan commitments and 7 of all loan commitments approved by the ida loans or equity investments for china accounted for less than 3 of all new commitments by the ifc in 1996 china is what the world bank calls blend country that is it receives loans from both the ibrd and ida theoretically the projects the bank finances in china could be funded by either the ibrd or ida depending whether the bank decides china can afford to service additional nonconcessional debt in practice the world bank has used its marketrate loans and its concessional loans in china to finance activity in different sectors the ibrd has concentrated mainly on infrastructure or industrial projects whereas ida has focused much more on agriculture and social development activities figure 1 ibrd assistance to figure 2 ida assistance to china china types of activities types of activities between 1985 and 1997 as figure 1 indicates the ibrd targeted 68 of its funds it lent to china for the construction of infrastructure and 16 for industry mining or oil and gas production most of these projects were located in areas experiencing rapid economic growth mainly in urban or coastal regions another 4 ifc loans carry commercial interest rates ifc equity investments involve participation in management most ifc projects in china have focused on the industrial or mining sectors in some countries but not china the ifc also lends to or invests in private utility companies crs6 6 went for agricultural development5 these are represented by the four grey triangles having their widest points in 1988 1991 1993 and 1997 about 3 of all ibrd lending to china has financed social projects6 the main allocation of social sector lending occurred in 1995 represented by the striped triangle shown for that year projects oriented towards effecting improvements in the environment comprised almost 7 of the total loans to facilitate or encourage economic policy reform accounted for onetenth of 1 of all ibrd lending to china the 1995 loan for this purpose is represented by small black spot at the top in that part of the graph by contrast as figure 2 shows ida has used 9 of the money it lent to china for infrastructure and 2 for industry mining or oil and gas production the latter is represented by the four small white triangles centering on 1987 1989 1991 and 1996 most ida assistance to china went to finance agricultural development projects 43 of total ida lending mainly in the poorer or less developed regions another 33 went for social sector mainly health primary education or direct povertyalleviation projects environmental projects comprised more than 9 of the total loans to encourage or facilitate economic policy reform accounted for the remaining 4 of all ida aid to china the pattern of adb activity in china resembles that of the ibrd as figure 3 shows infrastructure accounted for 56 and industry accounted for 29 of adb lending to china the two agriculture loans in the figure comprised less than 3 of the total one represented by thin grey triangle in 1992 funded commercially oriented project developing tropical crops the other thin grey triangle in 1996 funded figure 3 adb assistance to china types of activity 5 the agriculture share would be slightly higher if two ibrd loans in 1996 80 million for seed sector commercialization and 150 million to strengthen the animal feed industry were counted as agriculture rather than industry the world bank lists them among its agriculture loans the published descriptions of the projects suggest however that they are more industrial in their focus and they have been included in that category here the parallel 20 million ida seed sector loan has been treated here similarly 6 the proportion lent by the ibrd for social sector projects in 1996 would be higher if the 250 million sewerage project in shanghai and the 125 million wastewater and solid waste disposal project in hubei were counted in the urban development category per the world bank categorization however the published project descriptions show that environmental measures comprise the bulk of the activities funded by the projects thus they are treated as environmental projects here as is the parallel 25 million ida project in hubei control of industrial pollution was major focus of the 170 million ibrd industry sector loan in 1996 but this loan is assigned here to the industrial category because improvements in the efficiency of production facilities in the steel industry was also central concern crs7 marine aquaculture project7 environmental projects comprised another 11 percent8 the one social project accounting for less than 3 of the total the striped triangle in 1994 funded an urban water delivery system the adb lends to china through its ordinary capital marketbased loan window in 1996 commitments to china comprised 284 of all such loans approved by the adb this includes some equity investments financed by that windows private sector assistance facility by agreement among the adb member countries neither china nor india receive concessional assistance from the asian bank though their levels of per capita income might qualify them for such aid the adb has not lent directly to fund economic reform in china the promotion of reform for example better management or accounting practices and more marketoriented policies or procedures for state firms has been built into many adb and world bank loans and is not reflected in the sectoral statistics the chinese government has been willing to adopt economic reforms when it sees that these will strengthen its economic situation china is particularly sensitive to any appearance that it was compelled to adopt reforms as result of conditions in mdb loans or other leverage applied by the multilateral agencies the imf and china this report does not discuss the international monetary fund and china the imf is an international monetary not development assistance agency it does not make project loans china last borrowed from the imf during 19867 when it drew the equivalent of 777 million from its reserve tranche the loan was fully repaid by april 1992 countrys reserve tranche is in effect its own money though it must repay the money and pay interest on the outstanding balance when it borrows these funds imf conditionality for loans of this sort is not rigorous chinas current reserve position in the imf is worth approximately the equivalent of 13 billion 7 two other agriculture sector loans 1990 and 1995 helped the state agricultural bank modernize agroindustry as with similar world bank loans these are counted here as industrial loans 8 the adb made two loans in 1996 for energy conservation and pollution control in industry it categorizes them as energy or industrial projects environmental protection was major purpose of these loans in recognition of their dual focus one of them was counted here as an environmental project likewise the 28 million adb loan for environmental improvement in municipal wastewater treatment was treated here as an environmental project rather than as per the adb classification as social infrastructure crs8 tiananmen square and mdb lending to china the tiananmen square bloodshed in june 1989 caused sharp albeit temporary break in mdb treatment of china lending fell substantially the united states and other major member countries urged the mdbs to stop lending in light of the human rights situation in china although the world bank and adb have provisions in their articles of agreement specifically taking human rights conditions into account world bank and adb management justified their suspension of new lending for china on grounds they were waiting to see if the crackdown on political expression would be followed by slowdown or reversal of chinas support for economic liberalization and reform the chinese crackdown on dissidents came in the last month of the world banks julythroughjune fiscal year time when many new projects would normally be sent to its board of executive directors for final approval top bank management withdrew its plans to recommend several new china loans that month and the volume of ibrd ida and ifc lending to china fell considerably the adb whose fiscal year runs from january to december had lent only small amount to china in 1989 when further action on new loans was suspended as management waited to see what was happening in china in early 1990 representatives of the group of seven leading developed countries g7 who together with other countries in the european union own well over majority of the world bank and adbs voting stock agreed that their representatives at the mdbs could support limited flow of lending to china so long as the loans were targeted to fund activities meeting basic human needs bhn the ibrd made loans to china during its fiscal 1990 while ida made six loans for earthquake reconstruction agricultural development in poor provinces vocational education and afforestation between february and june 1990 the adb made only one loan to support an agricultural development bank in late november at the houston summit meeting in mid1990 leaders of the g7 countries decided to maintain their policy of limited support for mdb aid to china however they added two new criteria that would garner their support loans to facilitate economic reform and loans for projects benefitting the environment following the houston summit the volume of mdb lending to china increased substantially by 1992 it was almost onequarter larger in dollar terms than the amount lent in 1988 according to the treasury department the united states continues to support the policy approved at the houston summit to do otherwise would contradict the requirements of us law as well as administration and congressional preferences other countries however have broadened their attitude towards mdb lending for china in subsequent years two factors seem to be at work first the determination of the g7 countries to only support mdb loans that would promote basic human needs environmental protection or economic policy reform has proven hard to sustain many mdb loans to china have some link to economic policy reform or an environmental component thus in the absence of crs9 clearer definition of the terms those criteria could be used to justify g7 support for wide variety of loans second as the events 1989 recede most g7 countries are giving other foreign policy and trade factors higher precedence in their mdb policy calculations many seem to have abandoned the houston criteria entirely as these seem to apply only tangentially to many of the mdb loans approved in recent years us law and us votes on mdb china loans existing legislation section 701a of the international financial institutions ifi act pl 95118 adopted in 1977 requires the united states to oppose mdb loans to countries evidencing pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights the us representatives at the mdbs may vote for loans to such countries only if they are deemed to meet basic human needs bhn other countries do not seem to have similar requirements governing their votes in the mdbs sections 701c and 1701b9 of the ifi act require the administration to submit quarterly and annual reports to congress indicating what mdb loans it supported or opposed and whether those loans meet basic needs these reports show that between 1985 and 1995 the united states supported 111 of 182 loans approved by the world bank group including the ifc and 15 of 92 loans approved by the adb see table 3 before the tiananmen table 3 us votes on mdb square events in 1989 the united loans to china 19851995 states supported 70 of 74 approved by total loans supported by us the two banks later it voted for only wb adb wb adb 56 of 200 mdb

though the administrations quarterly 1995 21 25 7 4 report to congress said it had bhn orientation9 9 the us administration is required by law to report annually to congress and the public how it votes on mdb loans the last report submitted covers 1991 lack of staff reportedly has prevented the treasury department from both filing the required reports and monitoring us participation in the mdbs for us votes between 1985 and 1991 see us treasury department international finance annual report of the chairman of the national advisory council on international monetary and financial policies nac to the president and to the congress the unpublished quarterly reports to congress show that the united continued crs10 the concept basic human needs has clear meaning in us law the human rights guidelines for us votes in the mdbs were adopted in 1977 the concept basic human needs was borrowed from laws governing the us bilateral foreign aid program section 102b4 of the foreign assistance act faa of 1961 which governs us bilateral aid says that activities aimed at improving health conditions particularly infant mortality education particularly literacy control of population growth increased income equality reduced unemployment or underemployment and agricultural development aid for the rural poor could be defined as meeting basic human needs other provisions of the faa of 1961 say that alternative criteria equitable growth better conditions for women improved development administration protection of the environment and natural resources promotion of private investment economic policy reform designed to achieve economic growth with equity etc may also be key elements of us development aid policy it is not clear however whether these other criteria exemplify the concept basic human needs some might argue that the context is sufficiently general that any criteria promoting growth with equity or poverty alleviation might be included in the term in recent years the clinton administration has made sustainable development key component of us development aid policy environmental considerations are major element of this concept since the g7 conference in houston in 1992 the mdbs have increased considerably the number of their projects in china and in other countries that are labeled environmental the treasury department indicates though that some environment creep in loan titles is evident projects categorized under this label today might have been listed otherwise in prior years in addition mdb environment projects now often contain funding for many related activities somewater and sewerage or toxic waste disposal for exampleare clearly bhn activities others are not some aspects reclamation or alteration of watercourses in the context of flood control or industrial upgrades at steel plants for example may not even be environmental continued states voted subsequently in the world bank to support the following loans 1992 educational

bank commercial finance and management ta fujian soil conservation and rural development and fujian soil and water conservation ta crs11 it would seem that the inclusion of bhn activities in multipurpose environmental loan may be deemed sufficient to justify us support providing the other components in the loan are not blatantly unacceptable in large part the prospect for us support depends on the way the mdbs package their loans thirteen of the mdb loans for china that the us supported citing the bhn provisions in section 701a were environmental projects however the published descriptions of at least ten of them make mention of activities focusing primarily on public health or assistance to the poor these include four general environment projects an afforestation project watershed rehabilitation project and two urban environmental improvement projects the adb soil conservation project was linked to rural development several small adb loans which the united states supported were intended to provide technical assistance to the chinese agencies responsible for soil or water conservation and grassland management and provided direct assistance to the public if this trend continues the bhn waiver in section 701a could be used if the administration wished to justify us support for broad range of mdb assistance for china proposed legislation two bills pending before congress in 1997 would affect the future us response to any mdb or imf loans for china10 one titled the communist china subsidy reduction act of 1997 hr 2605 was introduced october 2 1997 by representative gerald solomon the other titled the china policy act of 1997 s 1164 was introduced september 17 by senator spencer abraham hr 2605 this bill would require the us representatives at the mdbs and the international monetary fund imf to use the voice and vote of the united states to oppose all concessional assistance to china china is currently eligible for concessional assistance from the ida and the imfs enhanced structural adjustment facility esaf the bill is more stringent than existing law as it allows exemptions to its requirement as noted earlier sec 701 of the international financial institutions act allows the secretary of the treasury to waive for loans that meet basic human needs the requirement that the us representatives at the mdbs oppose all assistance to countries that violate internationally recognized human rights similarly sec 43 of the bretton woods agreements act allows the treasury secretary to waive the requirement that the united states oppose all imf assistance to communist dictatorships if the secretary certifies to congress that the imf loan is in the best interest of majority of the people in the borrower country and the loan will help stabilize the countrys balance of payments situation and relieve severe constraints in its labor and capital markets by itself us opposition to imf or mdb assistance to china would not be sufficient to kill loan majority vote of the imf or mdb executive board is required for passage the united states has 132 of the vote in the adb 1703 of the ibrd 1529 of the ida and 1825 of the imf 10 for fuller list of legislation related to china see china pending legislation in 1997 crs report 97933 updated continuously crs12 the house banking committee has waived jurisdiction for hr 2605 the rules committee is likely to report it for consideration by the house in november 1997 earlier bill hr 2196 with broader sanctions against mdb lending to china was introduced by representative solomon and referred to the house banking committee s 1164 this bill requires the us representatives at the multilateral banks and the imf to vote against virtually all loans to china opposition in the form of abstentions would not be sufficient the united states can vote for loans to china if they meet basic human needs however the definition of that term is drawn so tightly only disaster reconstruction and famine relief that it excludes virtually all aid china is likely to receive from the imf and multilateral paradoxically though the language of the bill would seem to allow the united states to support any mdb loans for china that were targeted for disaster relief even if they include only funding for the reconstruction of infrastructure and economic facilities the senate foreign relations committee held hearings on the abraham bill on september 11 1997 the future prospects for the bill are unknown the requirements in previous version of the bill s 810 cutting the us payments to the multilateral banks dollarfordollar or proportionally whenever they lent to china were not included in the current bill perspectives on the future the us government has opposed long mdb concessional aid to china on grounds that it can afford to borrow more of its foreign credit on commercial terms and its potential for absorbing the lions share of existing mdb resources even before the tiananmen square crackdown when us relations with china were less complicated the us administration opposed the extension of adb concessional aid to china when lending began in 1987 other countries however were willing to see china borrow concessional funds from the adb however they eventually acquiesced to the us argument that asian development bank concessional funds were too scarce and that little would be left over for the smaller asian countries if india and china were eligible to borrow those funds in the world bank the us administration has argued for reduction in ida lending to china in part the us view has been justified on grounds that ida resources are limited and the poor countries in africa and the other lowincome countries in asia have fewer alternatives than do china and india more pointedly though the us view has been buttressed with arguments that chinas favorable balance of payments situation its substantial foreign reserves 75 billion in december 1995 and its growing capacity to attract foreign investment and commercial credit obviate chinas need for ida aid in the agreement among the donor countries undergirding the ida ninth replenishment signed in 1990 the world banks major member countries agreed that the combined lending to idas two largest borrowers china and india should not exceed 30 of ida resources during the threeyear replenishment period in late 1992 in the ida tenth replenishment agreement the ida donors declined to reduce crs13 these countries combined share of ida further they did agree however that lending to the blend countries china being arguably the most prominent member of that group should see their combined access to ida resources reduced from the 40 percent level approved in 1990 to lower combined total of 30 to 35 given the strong pressure for continued ida lending to some of the other countries in the blend group egypt pakistan and india for example the ida 10 agreement seemed to put clear limits on idas ability to provide aid to china in the ida eleventh replenishment agreement initialed march 19 1996 in tokyo the other donor countries finally agreed that ida lending to china should stop china will be eligible to borrow from ida 11 but the lending framework the world bank presented to justify the new replenishment indicated it would receive only about 4 of ida lending during the ida 11 period china would graduate from ida in 1999 japan was reportedly one of the countries that most stoutly resisted the effort to reduce and ultimately terminate ida assistance to china the japanese reportedly believe that efforts on their part to facilitate strong economic growth in china and to strengthen their economic relationship with china should be an important aspect of their foreign policy in recent years china has been the largest single recipient of japans foreign aid for example in 199495 china received almost 20 of the net 10 billion japan disbursed annually for bilateral development aid11 china also receives many export credits and other nearmarket rate official loans from japan the chinese government has agreed this would be its last replenishment the question whether chinas borrowing from ida would taper down to zero or whether it would continue at constant level throughout the replenishment period was not resolved the united states is the principal sponsor of the plan to end chinas eligibility for ida aid if us influence in the world bank remains strong one may expect to see the volume of ida lending to china decline in the next few years if us influence wanes and that of japan grows the plan to reduce or terminate ida aid to china may be reconsidered member countries such as the united states can delay by few weeks the consideration of any loan including china loans by the mdb executive boards however country has veto over world bank or adb lending12 11 development assistance committee dac development cooperation 1996 report paris organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 1997 pp a30 and a76 the united states by comparison gave china almost none of the average 645 billion in net bilateral development aid it disbursed during those two years ibid pp a36 and 82 the peace corps at about 900000 annually is the only foreign aid the united states currently provides to china compensation to volunteers comprises most of those funds 12 the united states is the largest single member of the world bank with 17 voting share in the ibrd 153 in ida and 227 in the ifc in the adb it is the second largest member with 8 voting share japan has 156 share in the adb the us share would be equal to japans if the united states purchased all the stock available to it crs14 congress is considering legislation in 1997 to formally authorize us participation in ida 1113 the other ida donor countries approved their comparable legislation in 1996 congressional efforts to bar ida from using uscontributed funds for china have low chance of success the world bank made it clear in the past as for example the struggle in the late 1970s about ida aid to vietnam14 that it will not accept earmarked contributions that direct or restrict the way it can use those funds congress could make the reduction or termination of ida lending to china condition for us participation in ida 11 the other donors might acquiesce if as stipulated in the new ida agreement this merely sought guarantee that chinas eligibility would end with ida 11 the other ida donors will likely resist however if the united states seeks to end chinese borrowing from ida any earlier than now planned the effects of termination of ida lending to china can only be surmised on the one hand if the chinese government decides to rely more on foreign investment and commercial credit to fund chinas development it may well adopt more market oriented economic policy and institutional reforms in order to make itself more attractive to lenders on the other hand the chinese government may feel it needs to intervene more in the economy in order to deal with the consequences of increased economic reform private capital would probably flow mainly to the fastgrowing urban and coastal regions rather than to the poorer inland provinces this could magnify existing social and economic strains and interregional tensions one concern is whether the central government will have the authority and capacity to control or mitigate these tensions another is whether the exercise of such authority would be compatible with efforts to allow individuals and localities more autonomy and larger role in the economic and public policy process it is unlikely that private capital will fund the kinds of projects ida has financed in recent years15 the question is whether china will be willing to borrow regular ibrd and adb money to fund these activities as noted before ida has emphasized povertyalleviation agricultural development and other social sector programs the ibrd and adb have lent relatively little for these purposes many other countries indonesia for example use mdb marketrate money for these purposes the chinese government showed little indication in 1996 that it is prepared to do this also ibrd lending for social sector poverty alleviation and agriculture projects may increase as the volume of ida lending declines the descriptions of projects under consideration for china however provide only slight support for this conclusion16 13 see title iii of the senatepassed version of hr 2159 the foreign operations appropriations act for fiscal year 1998 14 see jonathan sanford restrictions on united states contributions to the multilateral development banks in the george washington journal of international law and economics 153 1981 pp 561573 15 for additional information see multilateral development banks and capital flows to developing countries crs report 97881 september 17 1997 16 the world banks monthly operational summary dated december 6 1996 shows 42 projects for china at various stages of preparation most will come to the banks executive continued crs15 it is doubtful in any case whether china will be able to replace the funds it previously borrowed from ida with increased borrowing from the ibrd the world banks rules stipulate that country may account for more than 10 of the ibrds outstanding loans over period of time the bank has made exceptions as in the case of indonesia and mexico which accounted for 996 and 1107 respectively of the ibrds outstanding loans at the close of the banks fiscal 1997 it makes such exceptions reluctantly however at the end of 1997 loans to china comprised 75 of the ibrds outstanding loans however if the world bank keeps lending to china at its current rate that countrys share of ibrd lending will soon exceed 10 of the total at the end of the banks fiscal 1997 chinas share of all ibrd loan commitments including loans that had been approved but not yet disbursed totaled 1065 the comparable figures for indonesia and mexico were 975 and 97 in other words the current pace of ibrd lending to china is pushing up its share of the banks total loan balance whereas the ibrds slower rates of current lending to indonesia and mexico are gradually reducing their share of the ibrds loan portfolio if the ibrd continues lending to china at its current rate the share of its disbursed loans allocated to china will exceed 10 within two years the ibrd member countries could raise the loan ceiling for china however this step would be controversial and number of major countries might oppose it17 china may not wish to risk its prestige on such an application in any case given its current level of exposure in china the world bank may have problems justifying further continued board for approval in the next two years of these 18 accounting for most of the money are for power or transport infrastructure with funding from the ibrd eight others are for environmental mainly pollution control projects 7 with ibrd funding and one afforestation with an antipoverty element with minority ida funding another 5 will promote enterprise reform mainly for state firms or finance institutions two of these with discernable poverty orientation will be partly funded by ida all this seems to replicate the previous pattern possible change may be found in the funding for planned projects in the agriculture and social sectors of the 4 planned agriculture projects three have commercial or market orientation and are scheduled for ibrd funding the last 150 million poverty and environment project in the tarim basin however will be funded by the ibrd 60 and ida 40 the prior tarim basin project 1992 was financed solely by ida likewise the ibrd seems slated to play larger role in funding the 6 planned projects in the social sector two health projects will be financed solely by ida however one of the two water and sewerage projects and one of the two education undertakings for higher education reform will receive partial ibrd funding as will the qinba mountains poverty reduction project even so total ibrd funding for these social sector projects is not expected to exceed 150 million in effect the share of ibrd lending for social and povertyoriented projects would grow slightly to perhaps 240 million over two years if all the projects in the mos are implemented total world bank lending for these kinds of project would fall however as the volume of ida lending diminishes 17 the economist concluded that the prospects for an increase in chinas loan ceiling are doubtful saying not all richcountry members of the g7 are yet convinced that chinas economic reforms are irreversible they would probably object to still greater share of the banks lending going to china see china problem with the bank july 13 1996 pp 3233 crs16 increase in its annual volume of ibrd lending to compensate for the coming reduction in ida aid to date as the previous analysis shows ida has financed major share of the world banks social sector and poverty alleviation projects in china the issue is whether china will be willing to finance these kinds of projects with ibrd money as its access to ida resources declines china may be willing to do this if its access to ibrd credit is not restricted its foreign trade situation remains positive and its net income from exports to the united states and other developed countries remains strong to repay its growing debt to multilateral and commercial lenders china will need to increase its net income from foreign trade chinas debtservice ratio the ratio of its total debt payments principal and interest to its total export earnings was 99 in 1996 this is relatively low considering the fact that the average lowincome country had debtservice ratio of 150 and the average middleincome country had debtservice ratio of 168 that year on the other hand chinas foreign debt burden has been growing quite rapidly between 1990 and 1995 the lowincome countries increased their aggregate foreign debt by 318 while middleincome countries expanded the size of their foreign debt by 429 during this same period china raised its total foreign debt from 553 billion to 1181 billion an increase of 113518 chinas foreign exchange reserves total reserves minus gold standard imf benchmark totaled 12782 billion in july 1997 this was the largest body of reserves held by any developing country some have suggested on the basis of the size of its reserves that china can afford to borrow more from commercial lenders and less from multilateral banks contrary argument could be made when the size of chinas foreign exchange reserves are compared to the size of its foreign trade in relation to its annual import bill chinas foreign exchange reserves in mid1997 were comparable to those of india bolivia and egypt all of them current ida borrowers19 if chinas export situation declines because of turndown in the world economy or because of foreign policyinduced restrictions on its trade opportunities the chinese governments willingness to borrow marketrate world bank funds for agriculture and social sector projects may decline in that case it seems likely that 18 world bank global development finance 1997 vol 2 pp 42 46 and 152 19 chinas import bill cif for 1996 totaled 13894 billion in other words its total reserves were sufficient to finance 920 of its annual imports by comparison indias total foreign exchange reserves in july 1997 were sufficient to have funded 715 of its 1996 imports the comparable figures for egypt and bolivia were 1410 and 709 india egypt and bolivia continue to be eligible for assistance from ida to be sure most poor countries have much lower reservetoimport ratios those for senegal pakistan and honduras for example were 219 115 and 294 respectively see international monetary fund international financial statistics october 1997 relevant pages for each country cited crs17
