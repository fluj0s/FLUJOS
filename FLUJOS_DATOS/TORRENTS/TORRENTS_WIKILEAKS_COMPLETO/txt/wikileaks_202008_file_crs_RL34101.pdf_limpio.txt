evidence in other markets for the health sector d andrew austin and jane g gravelle government and finance division april 29 2008 abstract the ﬁrst section of this paper brieﬂy reviews the empirical studies of the eﬀect of changes in price transparency on prices and quality of goods in variety of industries most of this evidence relates to markets where buyers are the ﬁnal end users of the good and the bulk of evidence suggests that more transparent prices lead to lower prices and transactions costs this section includes examples of direct eﬀects of price transparency acting through normal market mechanisms as in the case of lifting advertising restrictions or reducing search costs as well as instances in which publicity about pricing strategies altered ﬁrms behavior an appendix contains more detailed discussion the second section addresses the extent to which this evidence might be applicable to the health care market it addresses certain special characteristics of the health care market which may reduce the importance of prices as signals for example the complicated nature of health care the intermediation of physicians in making health care choices including choosing hospitals and the presence of third party payment eg insurance companies the third section then turns to closer examination of how prices are actually set by hospitals and the evidence that exists on price dispersion both across hospitals and across patient categories the fourth section discusses some initiatives undertaken by governments insurers and interest groups to improve information about prices and to regulate price discrimination the ﬁnal section draws the pieces together suggesting that while it is diﬃcult to determine the consequences of greater consumer price transparency it is reasonable to believe that greater transparency would improve outcomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101 order code rl34101 does price transparen cy improve market efficiency

the health sector summary consumer advocates proponents of wider us of market incentives in the health care sector and some policy ma kers have called for greater price transparency these measures might include posting prices in an accessible form or regulations constraining price discrimina tion different prices charge d to different customers price transparency implies that consumers can obtain price information easily so they can usefully compare costs of different choices price transparency may also mean consumers understand how prices are t and are aware of price discrimination in health care markets consum ers often have difficulty findi ng useful price data in particular few consumers have clear idea of what hospital stay s or hospitalbased procedures will cost or understand how hospital charges are determined many empirical studies have investigated how changes in price transparency have affected various markets most of this evidence largely relating to advertising restrictions and lower search costs on the internet suggests that price transparency leads to lower and more uniform prices view consistent with predictions of standard economic theory if this evidence could be applied to the health market it would suggest that reforms that increase tr ansparency would reduce prices in cases involving nasdaq and amazoncom public r eaction created pressure to change pricing strategies few studies involving intermediate goods in one case and less clearly identified advertising effects in others found that transparency raised prices however the special characteristics of the health market make it difficult to directly apply empirical evidence gathered from other markets these characteristics include limits on competition among hospitals complicated products that vary in quality intermediate agents physicians who make choices and thirdparty payment of costs through insurance the dispersion of prices for similar health care procedures is high which suggests that these markets are not working well with respect to price outcomes as would be expected in ordinary competitive markets in addition prices paid by different types of payers vary dramatically on average patients without insurance or who pay their own bills pay much more relative to what private insurers medicare and medicaid pay despite these complications greater price transparency such as accessibly posted prices might lead to more efficient outcomes and lower prices some markets where lifting advertising restrictions led to lower prices also involved complicated products such as eye care suggesting that the complex nature of health care may not be barrier to benefits from price transp arency internet comparison shopping sites also appear to have lowered prices for many products better price information might allow patients either directly or through their physicians to obtain better value for health care services several states and health insurers now provide online data on hospital costs these price transparency initiatives at least so far have had little visible effect on pricing public pressure which in so cases has caused hospitals to curtail aggressive bill collection tactics might change hospitals and health care providers pricing behavior this re port will be updated as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101contents

empirical evidence in other markets for the health sector introduction price transparency helps consumers obtain price information easily which allows them to make useful comparisons of costs of alternative choices price transparency may also mean that consum ers understand how prices are set and are aware of any price discrimination different prices charged to different customers in health care markets consumers often have difficulty finding useful price information in particular few consumers have clear id ea of what hospital stays or hospitalbased procedures will cost or understand how hospital charges are determined prices charged by hospitals vary significan tly across hospitals and vary within hospitals across cat egories of patients transparent prices play key role in the efficient allocation of goods and services under certain conditions the decentralized and selfinterested decisions of firms and households in pri ce system yield resource llocations that avoid waste and that match what suppliers make and what consumers want which is how economists define efficiency financia l economics researchers typically define markets as efficient when prices reflect all available information and when prices adjust swiftly as new information arrive s if buyers and sellers do not know what prices are then some mutually agreeable trades will fail to occur thus creating inefficiencies if buyers can see and co mpare prices for the same good offered by different sellers the buyers then save money by choosing the cheapest vendor if goods are similar but not identical buyers then can compare prices and qualities offered by different sellers and pick whic hever offer suits them best the buyers ability to choose an offer that suits them best puts tremendous pr essure on all sellers to lower prices improve quality or both without such competitive pressure firms that are less efficient or that are earning excess profits can remain in the market and prices will be higher than they would otherwise be lack of transparent prices may also contribute to price discrimination which can cause different customers to pay higher prices an outcome that may be acceptable in some markets but may lead to undesirable consequences in others for example if the customers with the least bargaining power also tend to be those with the least ability to pay such discriminati on may be deemed par ticularly undesirable barriers to price transparency include both explicit restrictions on information such as government restrictions on pri ce advertising or concealment by firms of prices or pricesetting approaches includi ng negotiated prices and costs of searchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs2 by consumers the simplest theories ggest that more information about prices should decrease prices and also bring pri ces closer together but certain theories predict that more price information could raise average prices and advertising might raise prices by increasing mand or brand identification the first section of this paper briefly reviews the empirical studies of the effect of changes in price transparency on pri ces and quality of goods in variety of industries most of this evidence relates to markets where buyers are the final end users of the good and the bulk of evidence ggests that more transparent prices lead to lower prices and transactions costs this

health care the intermediation of physicians in making health care choices including choos ing hospitals and the presence of third party payment eg insurance companies the third section then turns to closer examination of how prices are actually set by hospitals and the evidence that ex ists on price dispersion both across hospitals and across patient categories the fourth section discusses some initiatives undertaken by governments insurers and interest groups to improve information about prices and to regulate price discrimination the final section draws the pieces together suggesting that while it is difficult to determine the consequences of greater consumer price transparency it is reasonable to believe that greater transparency would improve outcomes empirical evidence on the effects of price transparency isolating the effects of price transparency from other determinants of price is empirically difficult and the literature contains variety of approaches used to identify these effects more detailed discussion of this extensive literature is presented in the appendix some examples of the effects of price transparency relate to the effect of publicity about pricing practices that may be viewed as inappropriate and that may lead to fears of regulatory involvement or consumer backlash one such example relates to nasdaq in 1994 william chri stie and paul sc hultz two vanderbilt university financial economists noticed that nasdaq dealers almost never quoted prices using odd eighths ie 18 38 58 and 78 for many highvolume stocks ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs3 1 william h christie and paul h sc hultz did nasdaq mark et makers implic itly collude journal of economic perspectives vol 9 summer 1995 pp 199208 2 robert m

møllgaard and per b overgaard government assisted oligopoly coordination concrete case journal of law and economics vol 45 december 1997 pp 429443 companies such as microsoft intel and apple this practice effectively created quarter dollar minimum spread between sellers asks and buyers bids which increased the trading profits of dealers the day after these economists issued press release about their findings the practice was abandoned and spreads for several major stocks fell by about half1 some other examples of transparency in financial markets suggested transparency lowered prices when isla nd an electronic communications network ceased displaying limit order data in 2002 tr ading costs rose when island resumed year later trading costs fell anothe r study found prices mo re volatile after hours than during regular market hours wh trades are immediately reported second example of the effect of pub licity involves the case of amazoncom the internet seller amazon according to reports used characteristics gathered about individual customers from the internet itsel f such as whether customer was new to the site what browser the customer was using and what the customer purchased in the past etc to charge different prices to different individuals once this strategy was publicized the protests led amazon to cease the pricing variations and apologize2 another case study focused on the inte rmediate market in 1993 the danish competition authority required that all readymixed concrete contracts be made public which it hoped would s timulate greater competition instead average prices rose by 1520 and other factors such as changing demand conditions played discernable effect3 there are two possible explanations for this unexpected increase in prices with publicity first public prices may make collusion among sellers easier rivals can observe sellers who undercut their competitors and may be able to mete out punishments in various ways second pr ice transparency may alter the strategic incentives of sellers inducing them to become tougher bargainers larger body of studies estimates the eff ects of restrictions on advertising and posting of prices most of these studies involved comparing jurisdictions that banned certain types of advertising primarily for vision exams and eyeglasses some studies focused on the effects of restrictions on the advertising of prescription drugs and alcoholic beverages and restri ctions on posting gasoline prices it is important with advertising which can increase demand for branded products to examine cases where some outside authority in this case the government restricts advertising two studies examined the effects of local adve rtising of food prices one examining the effects of the 1978 newspaper strike in new york city and another where researchers provided advertising via dir ect mail although studies of quality are more difficulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs4 to undertake two studies examined these ffects one study examined the effect of mandatory fat content labeling and another the effect of re quiring restaurants to post hygiene quality grade cards almost all of these studies found that more information on prices and quality lowered prices improved quality or both the final part of the appendix discusse s the relatively new and growing body of studies on the effect of better price info rmation and lower search costs through computers and the internet studies have examined wide range of items automobiles books and cds airline ticke ts and life insurance the evidence was mixed for cars and for books and cds but showed reductions in prices for airline tickets and insurance these studies suggested that consumers using comparison sites did pay lower prices and later studies as the internet became more common more frequently pointed to lower prices pa rt of the difficulty of studying the effect of the internet is that internet sellers may offer benefits to customers compared to conventional sellers so that the evidence on price comparison sites which appeared to reduce prices and price variation may be more relevant than comparing prices of internet and conve ntional sellers considering all of the evidence of price transparency the majority of the empirical studies tend to find that greater price transparency including advertising and reduction in costs of finding informati on through the internet leads to lower and more uniform prices what are the implications for health care markets can the evidence from other markets be used to analyze the effects of greater price transparency in health care markets or provide guidance about what measures might best be considered while the special features of the health care market that distinguish it from other markets ar well known among health economists researchers and policy makers have sought ways to capture the potential gains from increasing efficiency in the health care sector by the introduction of marketlike reforms whereas published prices in othe r markets provide important signals of the true economic value of goods and servi ces in other parts of the economy the impenetrability of many health care billing practices creates barrier to rational decision making and analysis prices in the health care markets reflect physician charges hospital pricing prescription drugs costs for medical devices and diagnostics as well as other types of health care goods and services certai n market characteristics of industries that provide many of these products are importa nt in analyzing the effects of price transparency they are subject to quality differences and are thus not entirely homogeneous products the product may be one whose na ture and benefits are not easily understood by the customer sellers charge different prices to different customers and customers pay different and often small shares of the costs because of insurance and within specific geogra phic areas there may be few providers at least in the case of hospitals these asp ects of the health care market not only mean that prices will vary but they also in many cases complicate the consumers understanding of expected pri ces or their response to pri ce differences they also mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs5 4 in economic theory charging different groups di fferent prices is called thirddegree price discrimination first degree price discriminati on occurs when sellers have information on the price sensitivity of individuals and s econd degree price discrimination occurs when sellers use quantity discountsmean that it is difficult for prices to br ing about economic effi ciency for example because of lack of competitive markets all of these aspects of the health care market therefore may mute the effects of transparency on prices prices clearly vary in the health industry and why they vary is relevant to the implications of price transparency the discussion below reviews basic aspects of pricing that lead to different prices in ma rket and are relevant to discussing barriers to the effect of transparency on prices in the health market the first section discusses two reasons that different pr ices persist for th same pr oduct pr oduct differentiation and price disc rimination as we shall s ee both characteristics exist in the health care market secondly the cost structure of an industry may lead to market power that allows different prices to be charged following that discussion some specifics of the health care market and how they relate to pricing characteristics are discussed many of these characteristics are directly related to the role of price in consumers decisions finally the empirical evidence on price transparency presented in the first part of this report is examined in light of these issues why do different prices persist differentiated products and price discrimination the law of oneprice which states the same good will sell for the same price is simple consequence of buyers ability to pick the most advantageous offer in many situations however prices will vary this may happen because two goods are not identical for exampl store in more conveni ent location can charge more than store in an outoftheway locati on spending time in resort during peak season is different than spending time in the same resort during low season conversely as the real estate maxim states if the price of an apartment with view is the same as an otherwise similar apartment without view then there really isnt view moreover products that otherwis seem quite similar ma be differentiated if more than in consumers minds by brand and certainly great deal of advertising appears directed at diffe rentiating similar pr oducts which permits suppliers to increase prices and profits because health care depends on location quality and patient character istics it is not homogene ous product and so some price differential is expected some sellers may gain larger profits by charging different prices to different groups of consumers for this to happe n firms must have some market power meaning that they can rais their average selling price by cutting back on the amount they sell if the seller can identify differe nt groups that differ in their sensitivity to price changes and if buyers cannot resell or use arbitrage then firms will earn higher profits by charging groups with wer price sensitivity higher price4 for instance airlines know that business travelers are us ually less sensitive to prices than leisure travelers by imposing saturday night stayover requirements for cheaper fareshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs6 5 for one list of marketing techniques designed to charge different prices to different customers see f m scherer and david ross industrial market structure and economic performance boston houghton mifflin 1990 pp 491494 6 r kessel price discrimination in medicine journal of law and economics vol 1 1958 pp 2053 kessel examines physicians fees and argues the setting of higher fees for those with more means to be standard case of price discrimination to maximize profits 7 this point is analyzed in more detail in the section entitled price variation by payerairlines are able to charge higher prices to business travelers who want to sleep in their own beds on weekends firms can price discriminate in number of ways5 consumer electronics manufacturers offer mailin rebates in order to charge higher prices to customers who either value their time highly or who ar poorly organized and who therefore fail to obtain those rebates car dealers charge different prices for identical cars an outcome of the bargaining process price discrimination often benefits some classes of consumers those who would probably pay higher prices under uniform pr icing if airlines could not charge business passengers higher fare s leisure travelers would cer tainly have to pay higher fares some price discrimination schemes such as college financial aid are often justified on the grounds of fair ness although they can also be explained by the desire to maximize profits hospitals before the medicare act often sought to justify charging different rates to different cu stomers on the grounds of fairness although some economists who examined the issue at the time were skeptical6 hospitals in the current health finance environment dominated by large insurers and managed care firms on the private side and medi care and medicaid on the public side typically attempt to charge more to uninsured patients who have less ability to negotiate even though uninsured patients ar more likely to have lower incomes than insured patients7 cost structures and pricing the structure of costs within an industr has important eff ects on the nature of pricing firms with market power which often arises from cost structures will have some ability to set prices differently from cost and may be more resistant to competitive pressures that result from price transparency firms will have limited market shares nd will face strong competitive pressures to keep profit margins low when firms have fixed costs that are small relative to operating costs that can be added or cut in the short run variable costs and unit costs that increase as output increases on the other hand if fixed costs are large relative to variable costs or if firms use an increasing returns technology th uniform pricing may be difficult tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs7 8 technically fixed costs and increasing returns create nonconvexities in firms production function this will cause gaps in the firms supply curve so that supply and demand curves might not intersect in this case there is market equilibrium experimental evidence suggests that pricing can be extremely erratic in such cases 9 lester g telser competition and the core journal of political economy vol 104 1 1996 pp 85107 10 even if electricity is physically homogen eous costs of generation and demand for power vary by time of day nonetheless electric power even if differentiated by time of day is much more homogeneous than outputs provided by the health sectormaintain especially if the firm cannot store its output8 economic theory suggests that industries that have high fixed costs and which sell perishab goods or services face strong pressures to charge different customers different prices and compete in markets subject to unstable prices9 increasing returns can often be found in industries with network characteristics for example phone connection is more valuable within large network than w ithin small one because more connections are possible learningbydoing effects are another example of increasing returns in addition many hospitals provide indi gent care for which they are not wholly compensated such hospitals must find othe r ways to finance this care which often involve crosssubsidies in these conditi ons simple flatrate price system may not be viable strategy for hospitals theref ore imposing greater transparency of health care prices may require closer attenti on to crosssubsidies and uncompensated training and care the hospital industry has some na tural monopoly or natural oligopoly characteristics natural monopoly exists where incremental costs fall as output rises through the relevant range of output for market natural monopoly would suffer losses if it set prices equal to incremental cost which is standard condition for socially efficient pricing theref ore natural monopoly must be supported by some subsidy or must charge prices bove incremental cost which from an economic perspective causes inefficien cies and market distortions industries with natural monopoly characteristics are ofte n regulated and prices are often set administratively through rateofreturn type regulations the outputs of indus tries regulated under rateofreturn procedures however are much simpler than the set of outputs which hospitals provide for example electric power distribution which generally has been subject to rateofreturn regulation deals with single commodity which is uniform in its physical characteristics10 entry of new firms in an industry with natural monopoly characteristics is inefficient because at least some firms will be forced to operate at inefficiently low levels for example entry of new hospital might cause the average number of empty beds in market area to increase which increases average prices because of the hospital industrys natural monopoly char acteristics state nd federal regulators have often imposed restrictions such as certificates of need on entry of new hospitals theoretical models have been developed to better understand the tradeoffshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs8 11 rabah amir market struct ure scale economies and industry performance working paper university of southern denmar k at odense

concentration would lead to lower prices and rejected the department of justices claim that the merger would raise prices providing an illustration of case where the s cale economy argument prevailed12 special characteristics of the health care markets health care markets differ from markets for standardized commodities described in economics textbooks in seve ral important ways the special features of health care have had strong effect on the evolu tion of health care markets five key features of health care markets are discussed below in general they point to price being less important signal than it typically is in other markets prices could however become more important with shift to insurance types such as health saving accounts where consumers confr ont higher prices at the margin health care is complicated by its nature health care cannot be easily standardized making price di spersion difficult to monitor different diseases affect different people in different ways and trea tments that work for one patient may fail to help another patients may not know what disease or condition is affecting them and may have difficulty in articulating what is wrong with them and what they would like treatment to accomplish hospitals are sometimes described as job shops to emphasize their dissimilarity to assembly lines thousa nds of different types of procedures may be performed in an aver age general hospital and even specialized hospitals must be equipped to face wide range of conditions and complications because hospitals produce ma ny different outputs with many of the same inputs allocating costs to particular outputs or to specific patients can be somewhat arbitrary there is unambiguous way to allocate the costs of employing nurses pathologists accountants and billing clerks to specific pro cedures or patients hospital management strategies that seek to assign such costs to specific profit centers appear to rely more on rules of thumb than on precise economic calculations physicians as agents because patients cannot always know what they want physicians must serve as their agents in most cases physicians will make preliminary diagnosis recommend which specialists will be seen and determine whether patient is admitted to hospital or not it is true that ethical and professional guidelines stress that physician s must act in the best interests of the patient still physicians may be swayed directly or indirectly by insurers pharmaceutical companies hospitals and peers in ways that might not benefithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs9

patients often do not choose which hospital they enter rather patient s choose physician and the physicians admitting privileges determine where the patient goes hospital credentials committees decide which physicians get admissions privileges based on physicians training residency program malpractice record and ot her relevant information although some physicians have ad mitting privileges at more

provides referra l to more than one surge on while this provides the patient with some choice th patient rarely s detailed information about cost and quality and is rarely in position to make an informed choice if patient wishes to go to certain hospital then the patient must select physician with privileges there insurance companies offer physician directories which list hospital ffiliations and hospitals ofte n sponsor physicianfinder services that feature their mds therefore patients may have sufficient information to figure out which physicians they would need to choose in order to go to particular hospital in the event of some medical condition emergency admissions are generally sent to the neares t hospital with an emergency room or to hospital which specializes in trauma cases in some cases they may have information on quality through studies that rank hospitals the fact remains however that patients are usually in poor position to choose hospital which best suits their needs because th ey lack the right informa tion and because they are shielded from information about co st differences among hospitals other peoples money pays for most hospital care hospitals get slightly less than third of their revenue from medicare another third from private insurers and slightly more than sixth of their revenue from medicaid15 while public or private insurance protects

nature of their care through their choice of insurance pla n and as noted above through their choice of physician many plans using preferred provider organization ppo pproaches restrict policy holders choice of hospital or impose financial penalties for using hospitals outside the ppo network one plan may be cheaper than another because it is able to drive harder bargain with hospitals or because it can restrict the co st or amount of care which policy holders receive while consumers can obtain information about features of different insurance plans that information arguably is often incomplete and confusing patients have poor information bout hospital quality and costs patients may also be in poor position to choose their own hospital because they have little access to informati on about hospital prices nd quality or are not familiar with the information that is available such as hospital ratings as with any other good or service good decision about hos pital selection must be suppor ted with adequate information on costs and quality hospitals in most states are not required to make public individual prices for ite ms and other resources for comparative pricing information are limited aetna for example has provided price information for physician services in selected areas but this information is available only to its subscribers16 the impenetrability of hospital bills is legendary hospital bills for privately insured patients routinely run for pages and contain hundreds of individual items hospital billing and coding have become arcane arts practiced by highly specialized clerks and consultants insurers and gove rnment analysts have access to files that can be used to generate meaningful average co sts but this information is not available to patients compounding the problems patients face they generally ve access to little useful information about health care quality in part this is due to the inherent complexity of medical care and the difficulty of defining and measuring quality consumers can quickly judge the quality of most goods they buy on daily or weekly basis and make changes in shopping routines accordingly in some cases such as obstetrics wordofmouth and reputation may lead patients to reasonably well informed choices among hospitals in gene ral however hospital stays are for most an infrequent event and not many patients have enough ex perience or connections to compare experiences in ra nge of different hospitals large corporations insurance compan ies and government agencies have developed extensive

market satisfies conditions of the model of perfect competition which imply that consumers are fully informed nd can choose the lowest price prices will converge to the cost of producing the last unit of output and goods will be distributedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs12 22 efficiency here means waste in production and that all gains from trade are exhaustedefficiently22 more generally the lawofoneprice asserts that consumers ability to choose the most advantageous offer will ensure that the same good will sell for the same price to the extent that transpar ent pricing helps mark ets rapidly converge by bringing prices in line with incremental costs it promotes economic efficiency many markets do not satisfy conditions of the model of perfect competition if consumers are poorly informed or hindere d from taking their most advantageous option prices might not converge to efficien t levels if they converge at all while such problems can arise in markets for simple goods the problems are exacerbated for more complex goods and services such as health care several aspects of health markets including natural differentials in the product due to differences in quality and patient characteristics nd the widespread practice of price discrimination limit the effects of price transparency in ddition other important characteristics interfere with price signals and competitive pricin g outcomes the product is complicated physicians rather than consumers tend to determine the produc t purchased patients generally do not directly pick hospitals many costs are c overed by third parties and patients have poor in formation about costs in sum health care patients often have only limited and indirect ability to choose which hospital they will be treated in the event of some medical episode choosing different hospital may require ch ange of physician or of insurance plan even if patients could switch among hospitals more easily their incentives to search for cheaper hospital care are dulled by th irdparty payment and patients typically lack price and quality data that would be n ecessary for them to make fully informed choice much of the difficulty in instituting marketlike reforms in the health care sector stems from the nature of health care itself and from the ways health care institutions have evolved to deal with special features of health care improvements while possible would probabl be neither quick nor easy these characteristics however all point to some important conclusions prices as signals are diluted and muted in the health care market as compared to many other markets that muting of price signals nds to suggest that improvements in price transparency may be less effective in the health care market than in other markets and that this problem is particularly serious with hospital pricing at the same time the lack of understandable price information in the health care market may suggest significant room for improvement to unders tand this last issue it is important to be clear about just how complex and di spersed hospital pricing is an issue considered in the following section hospital pricing as the previous section suggests the barriers to direct consumer choice are high for hospitals and it is for hospitals that many initiatives discussed below have been made to improve information and transparency

to be related to costs most hospitals in the lewin sample char ged higher markups on lessexpensive items prices listed on the chargemaster bear little resemblance to what is actually paid on average

medicares calculations of drg weights use claim experiences of medicare beneficiaries who are older than the average private health plan policy holder and so may not reflect relative costs for younger patient populations private insurers vary in their ability to extract discounts from hospitals and arrangements between insurers and hospitals are tightly guarded trade secrets according to many analysts familiar with health care finance medicare and medicaid payments on average fall short of the fully allocated costs associated with patients in those programs31 thus hospitals must shift costs to private insurers increase efficiency or reduce services to balance their books as result payments for particular patients case will reflect not just the complexity of the case and the

report charges and are therefore excluded from the analysis although some hospitals and hospital ssociations have argued that some federal regulations prohibit hospitals from offering di scounts and fee waivers on casebycase basis34 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms contends that federal law prevents hospitals from reducing or waiving charges for an indigent uninsured patient so long as such reductions or wa ivers conform to the hospitals indigency policy moreover the cms inspector general has stated that it is highly unlikely that hospitals that waived charges to indigent uninsured patients would run afoul of the federal antikickback statute35 more detailed analysis of hospital charge and cost data shows that uninsured and selfpay patients are charged when confronted with the full list price on average about 2½ times more than what insurers pay hospitals and about three times medicareallowable costs36 the gap between what uninsured and selfpay patients pay and what insurers pay hospitals appears to have widened since the mid 1980s how does hospital pri ce dispersi on compare to other markets chargemaster prices charged by differe nt hospitals for the same procedure can vary wildly as noted in figure 1 and figure 2 actual charges for specific procedures which are generally lower than chargemaster prices also vary widely although information on them is unavailable chargemaster prices are nevertheless important because they are prices bille d to uninsured patients who do not have discounts and are the starting point for discounted prices figure 3

supports the view that better in formation on pricing reduces prices imply that greater price transparency would affect health markets in the same way despite the specific structures and characteristics of the health care market of course how the examples are applied depends on how pricing information is provided for example allowing the public to examin charge books and data on actual average charges at hospitals finance office provides more limited access than posting that information on the internet additional in formation could be conveyed by providing information on the pricing of complete but typical procedures as well selective reporting could provide opportun ities for hospitals to game the system by lowering costs on the reported procedures and raising costs on others even more information could be conveyed by also reporting prices for the different categories of patients medicare medicaid uninsured or in sured by specific health plans one caution is that prices of goods co mmonly sold on the internet also show substantial price variation although the gree of price dispersion may be less than for average daily hospital charges for example figure 5

relationship between changes in average charges and changes in hospital volume for normal births over the 2003 2006 period59 several explanations are possible for th lack of discer nable relationship between changes in average charges and ch anges in hospital volume differences in perceived quality or care or amenity levels may matter more than price for many patients especially if insurance coverage insulates them from prices patients relationships with their physicians and thos physicians relationships with hospitals might reduce patients sensitivity to hospital prices alternatively patients may care about prices but might be unable unwilling or disinclined to examine online price data finally changes in prices might co rrelate to ffsetting change s in quality or amenity levels distinguishing among these explanations would require more sophisticated data however the availabl evidence while preliminary suggests that the california price transparency initiativ so far has had little observable effect where it might have been expected to have the greatest effect how would greater price transparency affect the health care sector the experience of the danish compe tition authority noted above in the section titled empirical evidence on the effects of price transparency suggests that imposing price transparency in negotiations between sellers and buyers of intermediate goods does not necessarily lead to sharpened competition or lower prices at the same time some evidence ggests that information about the process of setting prices including practices of price discrimination may produce change in pricing as in the nasdaq and amazon cases much of the remaining evidence also suggests that transparency lowers prices and makes them more uniform the evidence

deregulation reregulating the airline industry would likely reverse consumer benefits and not save airline pensions gao06 630 june 2006will the health sector ch ange like other industries one of the most important differen ces between hospital care and other commodities is that typically patients pick physicians and physicians pick hospitals although this characteristic means that dir ect consumer pressure to hold down prices or at least have sensible pricing system is more difficult it does not mean that physicians would not become more sensitive to differences in costs among various hospitals on behalf of their pa tients particularly if thei r patients raise questions about these costs not everyone in market is required to be attentive to price for pressure to be exerted at the margin moreover publicity about price di fferentials may result in voluntary compliance by hospitals nevertheless this aspect of the delivery of hospital services makes it more difficult to apply evidence from other markets to the expected outcome of introducing more pri ce transparency in health care markets changes in the airline industry might provide some insight into how increased price transparency and competition could aff ect the hospital industry while the air travel and hospital industrie s have important structural differences airlines like hospitals have high fixed costs and offer nonstorable product before the airline deregulation act of 1978 pl 95504 airlines competed largely on the basis of amenity levels rather than on price the airline deregulation act restricted the civil aviation boards price administration powers and led to the abolition of the board in 1984 after deregulation veral new airlines entered the market while several major airlines went bankrupt and exited the market increasing competitive pressure led airline companies to cut back amenities to passengers and led to contentious negotiations with labor unions that resulted in sharply reduced wages in many cases67 employees with highly specialized skills such as pilots and mechanics appeared tofare better in resisting wage and salary reductions compar ed to other employees air service to some small c ities supported by implicit cr oss subsidies ceased while service to some other small cities expanded in part becau some airlines found ways to serve such markets at lower cost lowe r fares in real terms led to an enormous expansion in air travel and increases in air travel employment some relatively new airlines such as southwest airlines pr ospered and expanded while other airlines struggled including several major ca rriers that declared bankruptcy were price transparency to improve and if consumer choice in health care were to become more sensitive to price diffe rentials then economic analysis would suggest that these effects would increase pressure on hospitals to become more productively efficient that is to use fe wer inputs to produce the same or greater output costcutting measures would put pressure on health sector salaries and wages which some occupati onal groups would resist more successfully than others services such as indigent care now in part supported by imp licit cross subsidies could face cutbacks unless direct subsidies to support such services were increased innovative providers however may find ways to expand access to health care by the indigent using more effici ent and cheaper methods some prices might fall along with amenity levels lower prices in turn could expand access to health care andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs34

markets are set up financial exch anges are structured as auction markets or dealer markets68 in an auction market such as the new york stock exchange nyse investors send orders to specialist who coordinates trading for particular stock investors can send market orders which are to be executed immediately for the best possible price or limit orders which instruct broker to buy stock at set price or to sell stock at set price the specialist executes market orders by matching them with orders from the other side of the market or by buying or selling on his own account limit orders that ar not executed are entered into the specialists order book in dealer market such as nasdaq orders for particular stock flow to market makers who then pos t bids ie prices at which buyers are willing to trade with asks ie prices at which sellers are willing to trade via an electronic market in nasdaq each stock mu st have at least two market makers and for major stocks there may be 30 or more market makers price transparency can mean several things in financial markets the most basic form of price transparency is the timely reporting of executed trades second form of transparency is information about outst anding limit orders liste d in specialists order book order book information can sign impending price movements and trader with special knowledge about outst anding orders can make profits for example an order book with many buy orde rs just above the market price and very few sell orders may signal that the market price is about to rise and specialist who buys before that rise occurs will reap profits third form of transparency concerns information about how dealers or specialists handle orders dealer often has some discretion in how and when orders are executed and may sometimes exploit that discretion to earn profits at the expense of the investor who placed the order past nasdaq pricing practices illustrate the importance of the third form of price transparency in 1994 w illiam christie and paul schultz two vanderbilt university financial economists noticed that nasdaq dealers almost never quoted prices using odd eighths ie 18 38 58 and 78 for many highvolume stocks of companies such as microsoft intel and apple this practice effectively created quarter dollar minimum spread between llers asks and buyers bids which increased the trading profits of dealers the day

difficult or impossible with large numbers of traders more careful argument is that collusion depends on the ability to make explicit or implicit agreements and maintaining agreements may be more difficult for larger groups should large group of sellers collude each seller has strong incentive to increase his or her market share by making small reductions in price if seller can reduce its price and increase sales without other sellers noticing then it will reap extra profits for exam ple many members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec have been suspected of making hidden side deals which allow them to sell more oil than their opec quotas specify which may have led to softened oil prices in the case of nasdaq it appears that very simple rule trading on odd eighths created artificially high tradin g spreads which allowed dealers to reap higher profits young traders reportedly we re cautioned not to narrow inside spreads by using oddeighths and traders who vi olated the nooddeighths convention may have been subject to intimidation or isola tion in addition securities dealers rely on trades with other dealers to rebalance their inventories of stocks in order to minimize financial risks associated w ith sudden price movements if other dealers refused to trade with dealer who violated the pric ing convention then that dealer would be exposed to higher levels of financia l risk furthermore the practice of preferencing among nasdaq dealers which involves guaranteeing flows of orders to preferred dealers or dealer subs idiaries meant that order flows were less sensitive to spreads dealer who violated the pricing conventi on in order to attract order flow would therefore gain little add itional market share because of existing preferencing arrangements which in turn reduced incentives for dealers to compete by narrowing spreads while evidence was found that this pr icing convention was the result of an explicit collusive agreement that conven tion enhanced traders profits for many years70 while investors and regulators we re not aware this pricing convention existed transparency of dealers prices which were visible on trading monitors made enforcement of the pricing conven tion possible all other dealers could immediately observe if any dealer vi olated the nooddeighths convention while prices of stocks and other

transparency in order to keep strategic advantage over w ouldbe entrants for instance following mexicos 1994 financial crisis the world bank sought to create credit registry which would list all assets pledged as collateral by borrowers77 credit registry allows any lender to see what loan appli cant has already pledged in collateral thus giving potential lenders be tter opportunity to price risk incumbent banks strongly opposed creation of the registry because th ey could already obtain information about lenders while less establishe d lenders could not although credit registry would have expanded and strengthened mexicos financial system it was thwarted by banks who feared more competitive environment dynamic pricing at amazoncom the internet seller amazoncoms dynamic pricing experiment illustrates how marketing strategies can affect prices and create consumer backlash dynamic pricing is term that has come to be used to refer to particular type of price discrimination price discrimination usually takes the form of sorting customers into groups with different price sensitivity based on their purchasing behavior78 for instance for airline fares saturday ght stayover requireme nt separates price insensitive business travelers from pricesensitive tourists price discrimination typically raises prices for some groups and lowers them for others in 2000 two episodes of differential pr icing by amazon were publicized the second episode involved the sale of dvds amazon accord ing to reports used characteristics gathered about individual customers from the internet itself such as whether customer was new to the site what br owser the customer was using and past purchases etc to charge different prices to different individuals amazon stated that it was simply conduc ting tests but neve rtheless apologized and promised not to do it again79 the same availability of information that permits individualized pricing also makes it much easier to expose such price

countervailing power and price transparency cie discussion papers 200001 university of copenhagen department of ec onomics 2000led amazon to cease the pricing variations and apologize this example illustrates that consumer backlash against differen tial pricing affected pricing behavior and provides evidence that people generally disapprove of price discrimination based on individual characteristics80 readymixed concrete intermediate markets may run differently antitrust authorities and consumer gr oups have often advocated price transparency on the grounds that consumers could more easily make comparisons among sellers which would sharpen competition among sellers competition generally leads to greater efficiency and lower prices price transparency however can change the workings of markets in unexpected ways which can lead to higher prices for example in 1993 the danish competition authority required that all readymixed concrete contracts be made public which it hoped would stimulate greater competition instead average prices rose by 1520 and other factors such as changing demand conditions played discernable effect81 there are two possible explanations for this unexpected increase in prices first public prices make collusion among sellers easier rivals can observe sellers who undercut their competitors who may be able to mete out punishments in various ways second price transparency may alter the strategic incentives of sellers inducing them to become tougher bargai ners hviid and møllgaard motivated by the danish concrete case veloped model in which di fferent buyers negotiate with seller of an intermediate good82 some buyers are better informed than others which makes them tougher bargainers if lessinformed buyers can observe prices negotiated by moreinformed buyers then the seller will become less willing to offer lower prices to the informed buyers this happens because the seller understands that by offering an informed buyer bette r price creates an obligation to offer less informed buyers better price thus in this model greater price transparency in the sense that lessinformed buyers are allowed to see prices negotiated by informed buyers can actually increase average prices the underlying logic resembles that of price discrimination where different pri ces are charged to different groups of consumers with lower prices for those who are more sensitive to price in this model buyers differ in their bargaining power whereas in standard price discrimination models consumers differ in price sensitivity bargaining power and high price sensitivity are related because both depend on the availab ility of good alternatives more generally some competition experts argue that some exchanges of information about production costs or pr ices among sellers often have anti competitive effects in particular flows of information among firms can makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34101crs40 83 per baltzer overgaard market

easier as the cases of the danish readymix concrete and the nasdaq oddeighths pricing convention suggest on the other hand flows of information to buyers make price compar isons among sellers easier and thus make consumers more sensitive to prices therefore in general giving firms better price or cost information about other firms ma harm competition but giving consumers better price or cost information may enhance competition83 the hviid and møllgaard model in some ways resembles the negotiations between hospitals and insurers hospitals engage in negotiations with private insurers which make about one third of hospital payments some insurers are in stronger bargaining position than others due to better data analysis larger size or managerial talent the hviid and møllg aard model and the danish experience with price transparency in the concrete market suggest that it is not inevitable that greater price transparency in hospital markets would lead to lower average prices most of the evidence discussed below however suggests that for variety of markets more information on prices lead s to lower overall prices restrictions on advertising in determining the effects of greater price transparency restrictions on advertising which vary across jurisdictions or across time can provide evidence on the effects as advertising can make price comparisons easier advertising has sometimes been banned for some goods and services for example many states prohibited lawyers and other pr ofessionals from advertising prices in general most studies that examined prices across jurisdictions that restricted or permitted advertising found lower prices in those jurisdictions that permitted advertising some studies also examined changes over time involving control group which allows simple method of controlling for ot her variables the findings of this body of evidence may provide important insights about how improving price information for consumers in the health sector wher priceoriented advertising is uncommon and basic information about prices is of ten unavailable or difficult to obtain might affect the level and dispersion of prices an important consideration is distingu ishing between voluntary advertising and restrictions by third party also for some types of commodities it is possible that low prices signal inferior quality the clearest test of the effect of advertising occurs when third party usually the government prevents advertising note that many of the studies discussed below are older because most advertising bans longer exist although their

commission found that adver tising restrictions on optometrists had effect on the quality of contact lens outcomes prescription drugs restrictions on adver tising prescription drugs according to some research also lead to higher prices in 1976 cady91 found that prescription drug prices were 43 higher on average in states restricting advertising of prices than in states allowing such advertising the restrictions examined included limitations on outdoor signs with informa tion identifying the products and prices offered by the pharmacy prohibitions on implying the pharmacy has discount drugs prohibitions on price advertis ing and prohibitions of pr omotional schemes such as senior citizens discount he also found that the quantity of prescription drugs bought was unaffected cady found evid

current advertising to consum ers that promotes potential be nefits of drugs but does not advertise prices kopp analyzed how the initiation of directtoconsumer advertising affected retail drug pr ices

of items not advertised also stores with the initial lower prices were more likely to advertise and adver tising stores drew more consumers availability of consumer price information some studies were also done on changes in information two st udies related to food prices glazer98 used the 1978 newspaper strike in new york c ity to examine the pattern of price movements compared to neighboring juri

decrease in foodborne illnesses in the areas posting hygiene scores compared to other areas search costs and the internet in some markets consumers obtain price information with difficulty or at high cost for example car buyers traditionally have had to negotiate with car dealers in person obtaining price quote from deal er can therefore require several hours of effort from identifying local dealers traveling to the dealers lot and negotiating with salesmen and finance specialists when obtaining price information is costly consumer may settle for given firms pr ice even though further search might have identified firm with lower prices the economic theory of search describes consumers optimal strategy when obtaining price quotes is costly consumer gets price quote then either decides to search further or to settle for one of the price quotes he has in hand an optimal search rule balances the cost of obtaining an additional price quote against the ex pected gains of further search102 if consumer has previous experience in the market and knows something about the distribution of prices then computing an optimal stopping rule for search is straightforward if the

different costs of search different firms will ffer different prices firms with higher prices earn higher ma rkups on smaller num ber of sales while firms with lower prices have smaller markups but higher number of sales if search costs for consumers fall then both av erage prices and price dispersion fall prices and the internet many economists expected that the internet which enabled the emergence of cheap and effici ent price searching mechanisms would lead to lower prices some studies conducte d when the internet use had just started to spread to the general public found high er prices online although later studies tended to show some price reductions pricing and marke ting techniques have changed as the internet has evolved often in different ways for di fferent markets in addition studies of internet pricing have become more sophisticated over time in general later studies and studies of compar ison sites tend to find lower prices as result of the internet cars lee103 studied an electronic automobile auction network in japan and found that prices can be higher than in more traditional markets even after controlling for quality this effect might be attributable to the reduction in transaction costs and the better matching of desired car type in two papers settlemeyer morton and silvarisso104 examined the effect of the internet on car prices and found that

statistically insignificant over the time period of this study the share of restricted tickets decreased substantia lly this trend on which the authors did not focus could be interpreted as an increase in quality as it allows more travelers flexibility in their trav plans in additi on airline fares had long been subject to comparison through travel agents which means the increase in

on the internet because of the reduction in transactions cost or other advantages the characteristics of the internet as it evolves have complex effects on marketing and pricing strategies the internet is well suited to increasingly sophisticated price comparison tools which tend to reduce prices and price dispersion for those who use them the ev idence on the use of comparison sites as opposed to direct sales on the internet wh ich may be most rele vant to the question at hand seems to suggest that having access to direct price comparisons reduces prices when consumers use price comparis on sites baye and morgan contend that prices reached via price comparison sites are lower than prices obtained directly from vendors website115 on the other hand some internet char acteristics make entry of new firms difficult internet traffic patterns show strong winnertakeall features small number of websites account for large pr oportion of tota l traffic designing building and maintaining major retail website are expensive tasks some internet sellers have been able to establish str ong brand identification that permits higher prices because of these characteristics in some product markets few dominant firms may be able to maintain substantial market power in the internet age highly visible firms however can be vulnerable to public pressure as the case of amazons dynamic pricing experiment illustrates empirical research on price transparen cy conclusions most research suggests that when better price information is available prices for goods sold to consumers fall the larges t and most straightforward body of evidence relates to the effect of advertising where nearly all research indicates advertising prices is associated with lower prices this reduction in prices suggests that advertisings increased information on prices and increases in competition outweigh any tendency to increase prices through increasing demand and brand identification evidence on price comparison sites on the inte rnet also seems to support this view again this conclusion may not apply to cu rrent manufacturers dr ug advertising that does not include price information

involved the effects of pri ce transparency depend on the particulars of market structure price transparency gives buyers and sellers important information about the true ec onomic value of goods servi ces or assets but may also enable traders to observe deviations from collusive practices allowing weaker bargainers to see prices negotiated by stronger bargainers will change incentives facing buyers and sellers and can lead to price increases in financial markets dealers need to trade with other dealers on freque nt basis to rebalan ce portfolios and take actions to maintain liquidity which leads to complex relationship among price transparency trading costs and market efficiency studies in experimental financial economics suggest that price transparency can either increase or decrease prices116 in short how price transparency affects in termediate goods markets is an active area of research and settle d conclusions have not yet been reached in traditional economic theory consumers react to price differences because lower prices mean that consumers can buy more goods and services the unwillingness of consumers to pay higher prices imposes market discipline upon firms other mechanisms however may act to discipline firms as well firms that charge unusually high prices may face po litical or legal pressure for example sellers of gasoline may face complaints of price gouging with sharp price increases as happened in some states following katrina117 also consumers are willing to punish firms by not doing business with them even if this action reduces the welfare of consumers for example many consum ers reported that they had resolved not to buy from amazoncom after experiencing dyn amic pricing even if this meant that they would pass up advantageous offers in the future118 nasdaq spreads narrowed not because of consumer pressure but because nasdaq administrators feared adverse media coverage and wsuits filed by investors nd regulators thus price transparency may impose discipline upon firm s even if this occurs through non market mechanisms
