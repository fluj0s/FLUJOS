ally since 1954 thailand was long praised as an economic and democratic success story the usthai relationship solidified during the cold war strengthened on the basis of shared economic and strategic interests although some thais were disappointed that the united states did not do more to assist thailand after the devastating 19971998 financial crisis trade and defense relations continued to develop access to military facilities and sustained militarytomilitary cooperation made thailand an important element of us strategic presence in the asiapacific after several decades of mostly military dictatorships by the early 1990s thailand established democratic rule further bolstering its status as primary us partner in maintaining stability in southeast asia by the turn of the century usthai relations appeared to further accelerate designated as major nonnato ally in 2003 thailand contributed troops and support for us military operations in both afghanistan and iraq prime minister thaksin shinawatra had consolidated control of politics and was seen as likely to assume major leadership role in asean thaksin embraced the usled war on terrorism in the region role highlighted by the highprofile 2003 arrest of radical islamic leader in joint thaius operation the start of negotiations in june 2004 for usthailand free trade agreement fta marked thailands possible entry into the expanding american web of trade pacts with political allies bilateral ties began to fray however as concerns about thaksins governance emerged and then with the 2006 coup critics charged that his administration stifled thailands democratic institutions prioritized the wealth of his family and affiliates and proved incompetent in dealing with nascent insurgency in the muslimmajority southern provinces of thailand deep divisions within thai society and power struggles between the old guard and thaksins team surfaced and then exploded with the military coup that deposed thaksin in september 2006 in the political turmoil that followed the united states strived to maintain the relationship while simultaneously imposing penalties for the interruption of democratic rule military aid suspended after the coup was reinstated after elections in december 2007 but as successive administrations have struggled to hold on to power new uncertainty about the durability of the alliance has emerged one of the primary motivations for maintaining strong relations with bangkok is the ongoing competition with beijing for influence in southeast asia thailand long known for its ability to keep good relations with all parties enjoys strong economic political and cultural ties with both china and the united states mindful of geopolitics the united states is attempting to balance its strategic needs with its imperative to remain champion of democracy in the region g22g145g138g146g149g138g151g141g514g156g561g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g8g155g138g150g142g160g152g155g148g561 managing the us relationship with thailand has become increasingly challenging as divisions in thai society have become more pronounced the recent turmoil in thailand see below underscores growing divide between the rural mostly poor population and the urban middle class largely based in bangkok by stoking thai nationalism and providing inexpensive health care and other support to rural communities thaksin galvanized populist movement in thailand with the support leading to emphatic electoral victories for his thai rak thai party and more recently the successor peoples power party ppp this success threatened the traditional model of governance which combines powerful military backed by the royal family an elite corps of bureaucrats and relatively weak executive government

continues to play in thai politicshave brought these two camps into competition and exposed deep divisions within thai society the power of the palace and particularly the intense popularity of the king himself provides an important pillar of stability king bhumiphol who has served since 1946 commands tremendous respect and loyalty from the thai public and continues to exercise influence over politics the king is 81 years old and reportedly in poor healt h giving rise to anxiety about succession due to stringent lèsemajesté laws the issue of royal continuity is never discussed in the press

turmoil since early 2006 particularly so after military coup ousted thaksin shinawatra as prime minister in september 2006 after the coup an interim military government took power generally proving to be ineffective at governance but orchestrating relatively clean elections in december 2007 the peoples power party ppp successor party to thaksins thai rak thai trt party won strong victory in parliamentary elections but its two subsequent prime ministerssamak sundaravej and somchai wongsawat were both forced to resign because of decisions by thailands court system meanwhile thaksin after spending 17 months in exile returned to thailand in february but fled again after being denied visa to remain in great britain he is reportedly spending time in various countries including china indonesia and the united arab emirates he faces slew of criminal charges in thailand and his exwife has already been convicted on tax evasion charges

after thaksins departure in 2008 many observers expected degree of political stability to return but demonstrations by antithaksin forces ongoing for several months swelled in number and aggression through the fall culminating in weeklong takeover of bangkoks two major airports in late november and early december 2008 the protests were mostly organized under the peoples alliance for democracy pad group of activists that spearheaded massive demonstrations that weakened thaksins power before the coup the protesters insisting that the government represented thaksin puppet regime demanded the resignation of both ppp prime ministers in response progovernment demonstrations also materialized and confrontations developed at times the demonstrations turned violent with several deaths on each side after the constitutional court ruled that the ppp must disband and somchai stepped down the protestors dispersed the protests and particularly the airports takeover hurt thailands economy especially the crucial tourism sector analysts speculated that the activists may have been attempting to provoke heavyhanded response from the military by creating chaotic situation thereby potentially mounting another coup to drive samak or somchai from power the army was apparently reluctant to intervene fearing that bloody crackdown would exacerbate the already volatile situation the militarys reticence may have also reflected implicit support for the pad efforts from some elements in the military httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32593g22g145g138g146g149g138g151 g141g497g561g4g138g140g148

was elected by the parliament as prime minister by collecting enough defector votes from former ppp lawmakers byelections in january 2009 to fill the seats of those legislators expelled after the ppp was disbanded may tip the balance once again to the prothaksin camp the ppp has regrouped under the phuea thai or for thais party and promise challenge past popular elections suggest that if put to nationwide vote the thaksinaffiliated party will win handily meanwhile in the days before the parliamentary election over 40000 supporters gathered in bangkok to hear video address by thaksin taped in indonesia some observers anticipate that street violence this time initiated by thaksin supporters may return political analysts have little optimism that the new government will endure many members of the hastilyformed coalition are traditional rivals and politically and philosophically there appears to be little to bind the group together abhisit himself holds sterling resume young oxfordeducated ec onomist but his image does not suggest he will find ways to reach out to the rural poor population that has flocked to thaksin in recent years abhisits government seems unlikely to call for new parliamentary elections in order to seek mandate and elections do not need to be held until 2011

majoritymuslim southern provinces which includes the provinces of yala narathiwat pattani andto lesser extent songhkla while dealing with political instability in its capital since january 2004 sectarian violence between insurgents and security forces in thailands majoritymuslim provinces has left over 3300 people dead according to press reports the groups that have led this surge in violence are generally poorly understood and their motives are difficult to characterize many believe they are mostly focused on local autonomy but even the thai government has poor understanding of the diverse groups active in the south the successive administrations have taken somewhat different approaches to curbing the violence in the south but none appear to have found way to resolve the ongoing insurgency g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g5g152g151g143g149g146g140g157g561 the southern region has history of separatist violence though the major movements were thought to have died out in the early 1990s thai muslims have long expressed grievances for being marginalized and discriminated against and the area has lagged behind the rest of thailand in economic development the recent death toll of over 3300 includes suspected insurgents killed by security forces as well as victims of the insurgents this includes both buddhist thais particularly monks and teachers and local muslims after series of apparently coordinated attacks by the insurgents in early 2004 the central government declared martial law in the region moreover pattern of insurgent attackstargeted shootings or small bombs that claim few victims at time and counterattacks by the security forceshas developed the pattern crystallized into two major outbreaks of violence in 2004 on april 28 thai soldiers killed 108 insurgents including 34 lightly armed gunmen in historic mosque after they attempted to storm several military and police

handling of the violence was widely criticized as ineffective and inflammatory critics charged that the thaksin administration never put forth sustained strategy to define and address the problem that it repeatedly and arbitrarily shuffled leadership positions of those charged with overseeing the region and that it failed to implement adequate coordination between the many security and intelligence services on the ground under the military government interim prime minister surayud chulanont took more conciliatory approach by publicly apologizing to muslim leaders for past government policies in the south and resurrecting civilian agency responsible for improving relations between the security forces the government and southern muslims that thaksin had abolished general sonthi boonyaratglin leader of the coup and the first muslim commander of the army advocated negotiations with the separatist groups as opposed to the more confrontational strategy pursed by thaksin however the violence increased in the months following the coup 1 some analysts said that younger generation of more radicalized insurgents resisted the more conciliatory approach of the new leadership in bangkok criticism emerged that surayuds policies were insufficiently implemented law enforcement was unable to effectively prosecute cases and that intelligence coordination remained abysmal the samak and somchai govern ments under fire from their inception were unable to devote sustained attention to the south critics maintain that the administration did not focus adequate resources on the area as it struggled to maintain its hold on power in bangkok the region remains under martial law which allows security forces to arrest suspects without warrants and detain them for up to 30 days since june 2007 more concentrated counterinsurgency campaign know as operation southern protection d to far more arrests but many analysts see the mass arrests as fueling local resentment daily violence ebbed somewhat as result of the military crackdown but observers note an increase in more lethal and bold attacks human rights groups have continued to criticize the military for its mistreatment of muslim
