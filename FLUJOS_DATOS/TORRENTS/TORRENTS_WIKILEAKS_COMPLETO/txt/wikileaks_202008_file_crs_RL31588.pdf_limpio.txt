thirtythree states considered similar legislation to implement handsfr ee mobile telephone requirements none of these bills were enacted into law in 2003 although two such bills have been enacted and

from using mobile telephones while operating sc hool bus in 2003 legislatures in six states proposed bills which would implement such restrictions arkansas and tennessee enacted such laws in 2003

telephone use and motor vehicle crash other states have enacted legislation which requi res the conduct of studies of the effects of mobile telephone use on traffic safety another legislative theme is for the states to assert authority over the jurisdiction of mobile telephone use and to restrict local mobile tele phone use laws several states kentucky louisiana and nevada among them have laws that prohibit local restriction or regulation of mobile telephone use by dr ivers of motor vehicles certain proposals would place special requirements on the use of mobile telephone use by the drivers of

february 9 2004 legal considerations related to the enactment of federal legislation over the years congress has repeatedly conditioned the use of federal highway funds to encourage states to enact desi red transportationrela ted legislation for example congress has used this legisla tive device in dealing with various issues related to the issue of driving while intoxicated the highway safety amendments of 1984 effectively establishe d the national minimum drinking age by providing that congress would withhold 5 percent increas ing to 10 percent of federal highway funds for states failure to enact minimum drinking age of twentyone32 similarly other federal legislation has b een enacted that cond itions the receipt of federal highway funds on state adoption of federal standards gove rning the revocation or suspension of drivers licenses of i ndividuals convicted of drug offenses33 the operation of motor vehicles by intoxicated minors34 and the establishment of minimum penalties for repeat offenders for driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence35 the pending federal legislati on making federal highway funding contingent on state restriction on the use of mobile telephones by drivers of motor vehicles would appear to fo llow these legislative models as the supreme court has stated congress has frequently employed the spending power to further broad policy objec tives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient w ith federal statutor and administrative directives the court has repeatedly uphe ld against constitutional challenge the use of this legislative device to induce gove rnments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily with federal policy36 various criteria concer ning congress discretion have been provided by the court the conditions placed upon the receipt of funds like the spending itself must advance the general welfare but the decision of thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31588crs31 37 south

bennett v kentucky dept of education 470 us 656 1985 42 king v smith 392 us 309 1968rests largely if not wholly with congress37 since the states may choose to receive or not to receive the proffered federal funds congress must set out the conditions unambiguously so that the states may rationally decide38 the court has suggested that the conditions must be related to th federal interest for which the funds are expended39 furthermore the power to conditi on funds may not be used to induce the states to engage in activities that would be unconstitutional40 if the state accepts the federal funds on conditions and then does not follow the prescribed federal requirements the typical remedy is federal administrative action to terminate the funding and to recoup f unds that the state has already received41 it has also been determined that under certa in circumstances the recipients and the potential recipients in particular program may sue to compel states to observe the standards42 conclusion along with the substantial growth in mobile telephone use has been concern about the use of mobile telephones by the dr ivers of motor vehicles at the present time variety of state laws and local ordinances provide some regulation of mobile telephone use in addition number of stat are considering gislation to regulate mobile telephone use by dr ivers of motor vehicles federal legislation has been introduced in the 108th congress which would effectively require individual states to enact legislation to restrict mobile telephone use by drivers of motor vehicles noncompl ying states would be subject to the loss of federal highway funds the legislation appears simila r to existing legislative precedent directing states to enact certain legislation or be subject to the loss of federal highway funds
