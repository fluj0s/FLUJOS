christopher bolkcom specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division navy fa18ef super hornet and ea18g growler aircraft background and issues for congress summary the fa18ef super hornet is the navys highest priority aviation modernization program it is replacing the navy fa18cd hornet combat aircraft the decision to undertake the fa18ef super hornet program was made during period of great turbulence in navy aviation modernization during this time frame the navy struggled to identify and implement the best way to modernize its aging fleet of f14 fighters and a6e attack aircraft the a12 program stealthy replacement to the a6e was terminated in january 1991 the afx program another proposed replacement for the a6e began in 1991 but was also terminated the principal alternative to the fa18ef was modest upgrade of the f14 large twoseat fighter designed in the 1960s with potential airtosurface attack capabilities some observers describe the fa18ef as an upgraded and larger version of the fa18cd with increased range and payload capacity and more space and weight for future improvements others assert that the differences between the baseline hornet aircraft and the ef model are so great that they would describe the super hornet as an entirely new aircraft the department of defense is currently facing shortage of radar and communications jamming capability the navy and marine corps ea6b prowlers escort and protect navy marine corps and air force aircraft operating in hostile airspace the prowlers however are few and rapidly aging1 all the services are evaluating preferred approaches to ameliorating this shortfall the navys approach is to produce new electronic attack aircraft based on the fa18f called the ea 18g the navys fy2009 budget for the fa18ef and ea18g requested total of 43 billion to procure 45 aircraft modernize existing aircraft and conduct research and development the defense departments selected acquisition report sar of december 25 2007 estimated the total acquisition cost of 493 fa18efsaircraft program at 463 billion ty the cost of procuring 85 ea18g electronic attack variants is estimated at 86 billion ty the

for congress introduction the fa18ef super hornet is the navys highest priority aviation modernization program replacing rapidly aging fa18cd hornet combat aircraft2 it has been employed in conflicts in afghanistan and iraq and is currently in full rate production principal issues surrounding the program relate to the total number of super hornets to be procured and how this might affect other aviation programs background the decision to undertake the fa18ef super hornet program was made during period of great turbulence in navy aviation modernization when the navy was struggling to identify and implement the best way to modernize its aging fleet of f14 fighters and a6e attack aircraft the a12 program stealthy replacement to the a6e was terminated in january 1991 the afx program another proposed replacement for the a6e began in 1991 but was also terminated efforts to develop carrierbased naval version of the air forces f22 advanced tactical fighter were abandoned in 1991 and proposals for carriercapable version of the air forces f117 were never endorsed by navy leadership in the midst of these program starts and stops the principal alternative to the fa18ef major upgrade of the fa18 smaller one or twoseat strikefighter designed in the 1970s as lowercost supplement to the f14 was modest upgrade of the f14 large twoseat fighter designed in the 1960s with potential airtosurface attack capabilities proponents of the fa18ef argued that upgrading the fa18 to take over the f14s airtoair combat mission would cost less in procurement and operating expenses than upgrading the f14 to take over the fa18s airtosurface attack mission some also argued that the f14s longrange air defense mission known as the outer air battle will be less important in the postcold war era when naval aircraft are expected to be used at shorter ranges in littoral offshore operations in 2 the navy f35 joint strike fighter jsf program currently projected by defense department officials to produce up to 680 new fighterattack planes for the navy and marine corps could yield operational aircraft in 2012 that will complement and eventually replace the fa18ef crs2 thirdworld scenarios competing upgrade options were proposed for both the f14 and the fa18 in 1992 the house and senate armed services committees recommended development of both the fa18ef and an attackcapable version of the f14 pl 102484 section 125 the fa18ef program began officially in may 1992 when the defense acquisition board dab approved the commencement of engineeringmanufacturing development emd on july 21 1992 the navy awarded two contracts to get emd under way mcdonnell douglas received 97 million from 3964million contract to develop the airframe and general electric received 94 million from 754million contract to develop the f414ge400 engine on september 18 1995 the navy received the first of seven emd aircraft to be flighttested in 199598 by september 1997 these test planes had logged some 1500 flight hours with carrierbased flights beginning in january 1997 aboard the uss john c stennis although derived from an existing aircraft the fa18ef suffered noteworthy developmental challenges in 1996 flight testing was suspended when problems with the super hornets engines caused the aircraft to be grounded the super hornet fleet was grounded second time in 1998 when engine problems resurfaced in december 1997 the fa18efs persistent performance problems in high speed maneuvers led the navy to delay fy1998 funding for the program pending their resolution after successful flight testing modification to the wings leading edge former secretary of defense cohen approved fy1998 funding for procurement of another 20 aircraft on april 3 1998 the defense departments quadrennial defense review qdr of may 19 1997 recommended reducing procurement of fa18efs from 1000 aircraft to 548 with the possibility of buying up to 785 if the joint strike fighter jsf program were delayed or if the aircraft were too expensive compared to the fa18ef secretary cohen stated that he hoped this change in the program would set up creative tension between the contractors producing the jsf and the fa18ef the qdr also recommended reducing the maximum annual production rate to 48 aircraft these recommendations were reflected in the fy1999 budgets procurement projections the fa18ef program system description some observers describe the fa18ef as an upgraded and larger version of the fa18cd with increased range and payload capacity and more space and weight for future improvements other observers assert that the differences between the baseline hornet aircraft and the ef model are so great that they would describe the super hornet as an entirely new aircraft the singleseat fa18e and twinseat fa18f will replace the singleseat c and twinseat d versions of the fa18 which have been in production since 1986 compared to the fa18cd the fa18ef has crs3 longer fuselage 43 ft and 25 larger wing providing 33 more internal fuel capacity 14500 vs 10381 lb two additional weapon stations 11 vs 9 and survivability improvements eg new electronic warfare equipment and reduced vulnerable areas the fa18ef is powered by two upgraded f414ge400 engines developed originally for the a12 producing 36 more thrust than the cds f404 engines using 480gal tanks increases the efs external fuel capacity to 9800 lb vs the cds 6700 lb with 330gal tanks the use of lowobservable materials and shaping makes the ef less detectable by radar than the cd figure 1 comparison of fa18 dimensions in 1992 the fa18s operational requirements specified combat radius of 410 nautical miles nm 115 statute miles for fighter missions and 430 nm for attack missions such ranges were not achieved by the fa18cd whose rangepayload capabilities have been reduced by weight growth due to equipment added in successive upgrades since 1982 when its combat radius was 366 nm in fighter missions and 415 nm in attack missions in 1992 the navy projected the fa18efs fighter combat radius to be about 420 nm with an attack radius of about 490 nm exceeding requirements of 410 nm and 430 nm for these missions3 in carrier landings the fa18ef is estimated to be able to bring back 9000 lb of fuelordnance payload vs the cds recovery payload of less than 6000 lbs these improvements in range payload and bringback capability are viewed by the navy as the primary advantages of the ef over the cd in 1996 the general accounting office seriously questioned the fa18efs performance advantages over the cd variant arguing that fa18cds could provide similar capabilities at 3 the december 31 2005 sar estimated the fa18ef mission radii for fighter escort and interdiction missions to be 439nm and 468nm respectively crs4 lower costs4 the navy did not agree with these gao conclusions which were cited during senate debate on the fa18ef program in july 1996 table 1 comparison of fa18 cd and ef

2006 the fa18efs radar will also differentiate it from earlier models under current plans the majority of the navys super hornets will be equipped with active electronically steered array aesa radar conventional radars are limited in part by the speed with which their antennas can be mechanically moved recent improvements in electronics technology enable aesa radars to update radars computer several times second5 aesa radars are expected to offer up to 30 times the net radar capability of mechanically steered radars6 the hope is that they are more reliable than mechanically steered radars and are able to perform several different functions almost simultaneously many believe that in addition to seeking out and locking on to enemy targets aesa radars will also offer powerful electronic warfare capabilities specifically the ability to jam enemy radars that attempt to target the fa18ef7 it is currently 4 us general accounting office navy aviation fa18ef will provide marginal

approved for export in june 200110 in march 2008 press reports described debate within the australian government over whether the ea18g should be purchased as well11 malaysia which currently operates the twoseat fa18d appears to be potential importer on september 4 2002 the department of defense dod notified congress of the potential sale of 18 fa18fs to malaysia as part of larger 148 billion arms deal but as of 2008 sale has taken place12 the fa18ef is one aircraft competing for the indian governments plan to procure 126 new combat aircraft13 other potential fa18ef importers include bulgaria finland japan kuwait and spain generally speaking arguments for foreign military sales tend to focus on advancing us industry supporting allied countries and promoting interoperability with those countries arguments against arms sales tend to focus on the negative aspects of military technology proliferation and the potential for causing regional instability the government approves arms sales on caseby case basis14 according to press reports the boeing co with assistance from the navy is aggressively marketing the super hornet for export15 despite these efforts international orders for the

jamming capability the navy and marine corps ea6b prowlers escort and protect navy marine corps and air force aircraft operating in hostile airspace the prowlers however are few and rapidly aging21 all the services are evaluating approaches to ameliorating this shortfall the navys approach is to produce new electronic attack aircraft based on the fa18f called the ea18g basing the ea6bs replacement on the fa18ef airframe is attractive to the navy because it is expected to engender less new training operations and maintenance than new type of aircraft operating an electronic attack aircraft that can fly at the same speed and to the same ranges as the strike aircraft it is supporting should also generate operational benefits the marine corps does not operate and currently does not plan to procure the fa18ef so fielding the ea18g is presumably less attractive to that service in january 2005 it was reported that the 17 tony capaccio boeing super hornet new us fighter begins

carry up to five alq99 jamming pods these are the same jamming pods currently employed by the ea6b the navys currently envisioned program includes total buy of 90 ea18gs at cost of 9 billion to augment and replace the aging ea6b force the navy has awarded 1 billion contract to boeing for system design and development sdd23 procurement of 56 ea18gs by fy2009 is included in boeings second myp contract 154 fa18efs fill out the 210aircraft contract if 56 ea18gs are not approved additional fa19efs will be produced to maintain the contracts 42 aircraft per year minimum quantity in july 2007 it was reported that the ea18g program had been approved for lowrate initial production24 key issue for congress the principal issues surrounding the program at this juncture relate to the total number of super hornets to be procured number of super hornets to be procured like other dod tactical aviation programs eg f22a rah66 jsf the planned number of fa18ef super hornets to be procured has fluctuated over time the current plan is to procure 494 ef models about half of the originally planned quantity several factors could influence whether the planned procurement number continues to decrease or holds steady the department of the navy has recently implemented tactical aviation integration plan which has reduced the planned number of super hornets and f35s to be procured and fielded if this integration of navy and marine corps aviation appears successful some may argue for further reductions in these aircraft further in the future the successful fielding of naval unmanned aerial vehicles uavs for both surveillance and strike missions could compete with manned navy aircraft for deck space the most discussed factor however influencing the potential purchase of super hornets is the f35 program 22 robert wall us marines realize time is short to draft ea6b followon plan aviation week space technology january 3 2005 23 navy awards boeing 96 billion in super hornet and ea18g contracts press release the boeing company st louis december 29 2003 24 growler passes milestone c goes lowrate initial production aerospace daily defense report july 19 2007 crs9 the navy and marine corps are both planning on procuring variants of the f35 jsf this aircraft is expected to be operational between 2012 and 2013 some argue that the jsf will be clearly more capable aircraft it will be stealthy employ advanced integrated avionics the most modern agile electronically scanned array aesa radars and is hoped to be cheaper to procure and operate than the super hornet jsf proponents also argue that the f35 will field and that the fa18ef lacks advanced computing and communications capabilities that enable tomorrows combat aircraft to fully participate in high speed collaborative targeting sharing and receiving targeting information from other sources appears central jsf proponents argue to effectively engaging challenging targets improved enemy air defenses suggest that the navy field these kinds of strike fighter attributes quickly if it is to remain survivable and relevant on tomorrows battlefield in addition to these operational attributes the jsf is hoped to be less expensive to procure and to operate than the super hornet jsf advocates argue that the fa18ef program should be truncated and that more resources should be invested in the jsf program it makes little sense they say to continue purchasing two types of aircraft that perform essentially the same role especially when one is clearly superior the super hornet is compromise program jsf proponents say designed to fill the void left by the cancelled a12 it isnt as good fighter aircraft as the f14 tomcat nor it as good an attack aircraft as was the a6e intruder the fa18 versus jsf debate received more fuel when in the late winter and early spring of the fy2009 legislative cycle both air force and department of the navy don officials testified that they were facing projected fighter gap because of high combat aircraft utilization rates in afghanistan and iraq legacy air forces a10s f15s f16s fa18s were wearing out faster than previously predicted while new aircraft procurement eg f22a f35 fa18ef remained steady or had declined at its worst don officials projected deficit of more than 90 aircraft in fy2017fy2020 one way to address the projected potential fighter shortfall would be to purchase more f15s f16s fa18efs and f22s all of which are still in production the navy reportedly is considering procuring 69 more super hornets to close the fighter gap this option might be cheaper than purchasing more f35s although these aircraft are less capable than the f35 additional purchases of these aircraft however especially if at the f35s expense could raise f35 unit cost and potentially alienate foreign partners who are already concerned about cost growth in the jsf program the ease with which the us air forces have dominated its recent military opponents eg kosovo afghanistan iraq suggest that the current inventory of f 14s and fa18cds will continue to be effective until the jsf is fielded much can be saved by truncating the super hornet and buying the jsf in even greater numbers acting dod acquisition chief michael wynne reportedly suggested that truncating crs10 the fa18ef purchase in favor of the jsf could be considered if dod had to reduce its tactical aviation procurement budget25 while the navy looks forward to the jsfs eventual deployment fa18ef proponents point out that it is still in development and there is guarantee that it will be fielded on time many aviation programs such as the c17 globemaster rah66 comanche and the v22 osprey took much longer to develop and procure than planned the fa18ef is bird in the hand its supporters say and its rapid and continued procurement is essential to executing the navys current and evolving military strategy in 2006 navy leaders and the senate armed services committee supported the purchase of additional super hornets in its markup of the fy2007 defense authorization bill the committee noted the navy will confront sizeable gap in aircraft inventory as older fa18ad hornets retire before the aircraft carrier variant of the joint strike fighter jsf is availablethe magnitude of the problem and the procurement cost to avoid shortfall in the carrier air wing force structure is entirely dependent on when the navy determines that its fa18acs are at the end of their service lifethe committee recommends that the navy consider buying additional fa18efs to mitigate the known shortfall while allowing the navy to transition to the jsf as soon as feasible26 super hornet advocates argue that while the jsf will be valuable contribution to the navy inventory its capabilities complement the fa18ef rather than supercede it it is not clear that stealth technology is required immediately and stealthy aircraft have not proven invulnerable in recent conflicts also to maintain its stealthy signature the jsf must carry its weapons internally which limits its payload proponents of the fa18ef acknowledge that the plane lacks some of the f14ds mission capabilities speed and allweather attack capability and the a6es rangepayload but they argue that advances in weapons and targeting capabilities make up for these shortcomings further they argue the super hornet offers considerable upgrade potential modernizing the fa18ef with software programmable radios computers and other networking equipment is relatively straightforward proponents argue congressional action the
