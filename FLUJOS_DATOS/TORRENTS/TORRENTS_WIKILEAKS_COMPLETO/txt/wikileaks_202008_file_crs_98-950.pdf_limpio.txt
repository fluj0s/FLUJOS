continuing the expansion that began in 1993 british investors lead all others europeans as whole are the largest foreign direct investors1 both in terms of annual investments and in terms of their cumulative holdings of investments in the united states japanese investors have reduced their annual investment expenditures in us businesses although they still rank as the second largest foreign investors in the us economy some americans believe foreign investments could eventually have negative impact on the us economy but most economic assessments indicate that foreign direct investment yields net national benefits to both the recipient and the investing countries by most measures foreign investors have become fully integrated into the us economy and are indistinguishable in many ways from firms that are whollyowned by americans this report will be updated as events warrant additional information on this and other traderelated issues is available from the crs electronic

1999 when adjusted for changes in the value of existing investments and currency values as figure 1 shows spending by foreigners on businesses and real estate in the united states during the past two years has grown to levels that far surpass anything experienced previously as share of the total amount of investment spending in the us economy investment spending by foreign firms reached 17 in 1999 exceeding the share such spending accounted for in the us economy in the late 1980s foreign firms spending is being sustained by growth in their reinvested earnings and in intercompany debt but is arising primarily from equity capital outlays that reflect sharp increase in corporate merger and acquisition activity in the united states4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98950crs3 5 us library of congress congressional research service japans economy from bubble to bust crs report 94226 by james k jacksonwith over 150 billion invested in businesses in the united states great britain is the largest foreign direct investor japan with foreign direct investment of 133 billion stands as the second largest investor sluggish economic growth and other economic problems in japan have caused japanese firms at times to slow down their investment spending in the united states to shore up their balance sheets back in japan5 losses on real estate and on parts of their us operations also deterred japanese investors investment spending by other foreign firms however has been especially strong since the mid1990s reflecting the continued fastpaced economic growth in the united states and increases in us productivity besides british and japanese investors dutch canadian french german and swiss investors have been investing heavily in us businesses and real estate on historical cost or book value basis value at the time of the initial investment foreign direct investment in the united states reached 812 billion in 1998 the latest year for complete data this represents an 17 increase over 1997 in the overall direct investment position of foreign investors table 1 page 4 shows that investments by developed economies account for nearly 92 of all foreign direct investment in the united states these investments are predominately in the manufacturing sector which accounts for about 41 of foreign direct investment in the united states another 14 is in the retail and wholesale trade sectors reflecting purchases of department stores and other investments to assist foreign firms in marketing and distributing their products other sectors account for modest shares insurance 100 the petroleum sector 70 services 62 finance 60 and real estate 55 in some cases investments by one or two countries dominate certain industrial sectors suggesting that there is rough form of international specialization present in the investment patterns of foreign multinational firms by year end 1998 the netherlands and the united kingdom accounted for the bulk of foreign investments in the us petroleum sector reflecting investments by two giant companies royal dutch shell and british petroleum japan is the single largest foreign investor in us real estate nearly equalling the value of all european holdings in addition the swiss the dutch and the british are the largest foreign investors in the insurance sector japans 26 billion investment in the us banking and finance sectors is more than twice as large as comparable investments by any european country and means that the japanese are the single largest foreign investor in those sectors foreign direct investment in the manufacturing sector is also represented by relatively small number of countries investments by the united kingdom the netherlands japan germany and france account for 71 of the total amount of foreign direct investment in this sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98950crs4 6 fahimnader mahnaze foreign direct investment in the united states new investments in 1998 survey of current business june

lowe jeffrey h foreign direct investment in the united states detail for historicalcost position and related capital and income flows 1998 survey of current business september 1999 p 37 acquisitions and establishments another way of looking at foreign direct investment is by distinguishing between transactions in which foreigners acquire existing us firms and those in which foreigners establish new firms termed greenfield investm ents new investments are often preferred at the local level because they are thought to add to local employment whereas foreign acquisition adds little if any new employment in 1998 outlays for new investments which include investments made directly by foreign investors and those made by existing us affiliates rose by 250 from the amount invested in 1997 to 200 billion in nominal terms acquisitions of existing us firms accounted for 62 of the new investments by number and 90 by value while investments by us affiliates accounted for 78 of the transact ions by investor6 part of the increase in foreign investment to acquire or establish new establishments can be traced to substantial increase in very large investments the number of investments over 2 billion rose from 3 in 1997 to 12 in 1998 while there was slight decrease overall in the total number of investmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98950crs5 7 foreign direct investment in the united states operations of us affiliates of foreign companies preliminary 1997 estimates bureau of economic analysis 1999 table a1included among these investments are the purchase of amoco corporation by british petroleum plc for 55 billion and daimlerbenz ags acquisition of the chrysler corporation for 40 billion economic performance by yearend1997 the latest year for which detailed data are available foreign firms employed 5 million americans about 5 of us employment and owned over 9 thousand business establishments7 in 1997 45 of the foreign firms employment was in the manufacturing sector more than twice the share of manufacturing employment in the us economy as whole the affiliates of foreign firms spent 100 billion in the united states in 1997 on new plant and equipment and 20 billion on research and development since 1980 the total amount of foreign direct investment in the economy has increased eightfold and nearly doubled as share of us gross domestic product gdp from 34 to 60 it is important to note however that these data do not imply anything in particular about the role foreign direct investme nt has played in the rate of growth of us gdp foreignowned establishments on average are far outperforming their usowned counterparts although foreignowned firms account for only 34 of all us manufacturing establishments they have 14 more value added on average and 15 higher value of shipments than other manufacturers the average plant size for foreign owned firms is much larger five times than for us firms on average in similar industries this difference in plant size apparently rises from the fact that there are small plants among those that are foreignowned as result of the larger plant scale and newer plant age foreignowned firms paid wages on average that were 14 higher than all us manufacturing firms had 40 higher productivity per worker and 50 greater output per worker than the average of comparable usowned manufacturing plants foreignowned firms also display higher capital intensity in larger number of industries than all us establishments the differences between foreignowned firms and all us firms should be viewed with some caution first the two groups of firms are not strictly comparable the group of foreignowned firms comprises subset of all foreign firms which includes primarily very large firms the group of us firms includes all firms spanning broader range of sizes secondly the differences reflect range of additional factors including the prospect that foreign firms which invest in the united states likely are large firms with proven technologies or techniques they have successfully transferred to the united states small foreign ventures experimenting with unproven technologies are unlikely to want the added risk of investing overseas foreign investors also tend to opt for larger scale and higher capitalintensity plants than the average us firm to offset the risks inherent in investing abroad and to generate higher profits to make it economical to manage an operation far removed from the parent firmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98950crs6 conclusions foreign direct investment in the united states far surpasses the recordbreaking amounts set in the 19890s when both congress and the american public expressed concerns over the potential economic impact of such investments presently public concerns seem to be focused not so much on foreign direct investment per but on the overall phenomenon referred to asglobalization within this context these concerns seem not to stem from potential losses of international competitiveness that characterized similar concerns in the 1980s instead concerns over foreign direct investment seem to arise from potential job losses that could result from mergers and acquisitions although such losses could occur wether the acquiring company was foreign or usowned looking ahead the pace of economic growth in us and foreign economies and the resultant pull between domestic sources of and demands for capital determine the role and amount of foreign capital in the economy within this broader context the federal governments budget deficits or surpluses relative to the credit conditions in the rest of the economy also influence capital conditions in the economy and the importance of foreign capital in addition to credit conditions foreign direct investment seems to be tied closely to the overall performance of the economy and will rise and fall with economic conditions strong economic growth such as the united states has experienced over the last six years increases direct investment by attracting new investments and by encouraging firms to reinvest profits in their us operations as long as the us economy continues growing at favorable rates and the rate of price inflation stays in check foreign direct investment in the united states likely will grow in nominal terms as it has since 1992 it seems unlikely however that the pace set over the last two years can be sustained additional increases in interest rates by the federal reserve could restrain corporate profits reducing somewhat the attractiveness of additional largescale investments moreover slow pickup in economic growth in europe could make investments there more attractive and compete for funds that european investors have been placing in investments in the us economy additionally longexpected slow down in the annual growth rate of the us economy likely would reduce activity in the mergers and acquisitions market as well and thereby reduce the pace of foreign direct investment
