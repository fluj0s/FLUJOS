legislative process government and finance division distinctions among amendments the amending process is central to the consideration of legislation by the senate and the rules practices and precedents that underlie this process frequently depend on distinguishing among amendments based on their type and form the way in which an amendment is crafted and the circumstances in which it is offered can have an impact on its consideration when an amendment to measure is offered in the senate and while the amendment is pending it is normally in order for other amendments to be offered dealing with the same portion of the measure the relative precedence of an amendment determines whether it can be offered while another amendment is pending and if it can that it be voted on first amending opportunities available in the senate depend on what amendments have already been offered and several different amendment trees can develop depending on circumstances precedence depends on the relationship between the degree form and scope of the pending amendments and the ones to be offered distinguishing among the types and forms of amendments therefore has implications for what alternatives the senate may choose among and how many amendments may be pending at one time for more detail on these implications see crs report 98853 the amending process in the senate for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml degrees of amendments fundamental aspect of the amending process in the senate is that it is limited to two degrees generally amendments may be offered to the measure under consideration firstdegree and to amendments to the measure seconddegree seconddegree amendments have precedence over firstdegree amendments that means not only that seconddegree amendments are offered while firstdegree amendment is pending but also that they must be disposed of before the senate can vote on the firstdegree amendment as it may have been amended senate rules do not allow thirddegree amendments forms of amendments amendments may also be distinguished by whether they are posed in the form of 1 motion to strike out some existing text from measure or from firstdegree crs2 amendment 2 motion solely to insert some new text into measure or into first degree amendment or 3 motion both to strike out some existing text and insert something new in either measure or first degree amendment this distinction is integral in structuring the choices that the senate may choose among because the senate allows different amendment trees to develop depending on the form of the first amendment offered the senate assigns higher precedence to amendments to insert and amendments to strike and insert than to amendments to strike out although an amendment to strike is not itself amendable senate procedure allows senators to go behind an amendment to strike and first consider amendments to the portion of the measure proposed to be stricken in this way when one of the effects of an amendment is to eliminate some text from measure the senate may first consider alternatives to that text scope of amendments third way to distinguish among amendments is by their scope the procedural scope of an amendment is defined in relation to the text the amendment would effect and is not indicative of any substantive policy changes that would result from the proposed amendment generally the senate considers an amendment to be substitute if it would replace all of pending text perfecting amendment is one that inserts text or replaces less than complete text an amendment drafted as motion to strike out and insert may be treated as substitute or as perfecting amendment depending on what is being stricken and the procedural situation in which it is offered in certain circumstances both substitute and perfecting amendment may be pending simultaneously for example when firstdegree amendment to insert new text in measure is pending seconddegree amendment that would be substitute for the firstdegree amendment could be offered moreover perfecting amendment has precedence over substitute directed to the same text therefore while the seconddegree substitute to firstdegree amendment is pending seconddegree perfecting amendment may also be offered and would be voted on first the principle behind this is to allow alternatives to be perfected before the senate must choose between them when firstdegree amendment to strike and insert is offered and other amendment is pending it is considered substitute for portion of the measure however special case arises when it is offered in the form of motion to strike out everything in measure after the enacting clause or the resolving clause in the case of resolution and insert different text because committees frequently report their recommendations to the senate in this form senators typically focus their consideration on the substitute although amendments to the text of the measure itself would be in order an amendment in the nature of substitute is not treated as firstdegree amendment instead it is subject to two degrees of amendment similar but not identical to the situation that would arise if it were the text of the measure amendments in the nature of substitute are rarely offered except at the recommendation of committee and would be in order only when other amendment of any kind is pending for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98614
