crime has become major problem throughout the world transnational criminal organizations have benefitted from the global economy as well as the breakup of the soviet empire and birth of fragile new democracies vulnerable to criminal exploitation russian criminal groups have become increasingly active in europe and north america sometimes working with foreign crime groups they have engaged in money laundering and trafficking in arms illegal goods and people growing share of organized crime in the united states has foreign roots including russian ones besides its direct costs to the united states russian crime threatens larger us interests first among these is the successful democratic and market transformation of russia and eastern europe crime and corruption have undermined public support for democracy and the market economy and played role in the current russian political and economic crisis russian criminals may be fueling regional tensions and strengthening rogue regimes with arms and other sanction breaking trade there is concern that they could seriously endanger international nonproliferation efforts if they get access to weapons of mass destruction for sale abroad governments and international bodies are struggling to keep pace with what is now recognized as global security threat the state department and fbi have been given the lead us role abroad in the fight against international crime the united states now has permanent crime fighting presence in some 34 countries including russia for purposes of investigation training and other cooperation the united states has worked closely with russia and international organizations to curb russian international criminal activities in may 1998 the president announced new international crime control strategy experts agree that further steps may be needed to fight transnational crime including better intelligence and law enforcement cooperation some experts advocate more crime fighting assistance and training to russia multinational task forces to fight crime across borders and more offensive and even preemptive approach to fighting transnational crime effective cooperation is hampered by the fact that most countries and jurisdictions are still reluctant to cede authority to outside or multinational organizations the us congress has demonstrated concern over trends in russian and other international crime and supported assistance to russia the former soviet union and eastern europe in the law enforcement area the administrations proposed international crime control act of 1998 s 2303 package of measures to enhance the us ability to fight international crime was introduced in the senate on june 14 1998 by senator patrick leahy but not acted upon by the 105th congress contents

us interests scope of the problem transnational crime has grown in recent years as threat to international security russian criminal organizations have emerged as significant and dangerous actors in the equation several developments have contributed to the rising international crime trends and threats the world is witnessing the emergence of truly global economy built on unprecedented movement of people and goods across national boundaries and revolution in information and communications technology transnational criminal organizations have been major beneficiaries of globalization criminal groups have learned to take advantage of the new porousness of borders and to cooperate with each other on an opportunistic basis in the process the lines have blurred among traditional crime organizations drug cartels and terrorist groups with the end of the cold war and fall of communism in russia and eastern europe the former rigid authoritarian government and police controls have been removed but they have not yet been replaced by an effective rule of law system in many of the new democracies given the weakness and uncertainty of governments the transition to market economies has been chaotic and vulnerable to criminal exploitation russian crime is just one piece of worldwide problem russian crime organizations are neither the biggest nor necessarily the most costly to international society to date the italian mafia latin american drug cartels and asian crime organizations have had substantially greater impact internationally and inside the united states furthermore russian organized crime is just part of larger cis and east european crime problem this report is focused specifically on crime emanating from within the current borders of russia whether by ethnic russians or other groups recognizing that the picture is similar in other former soviet republics many observers would argue that russian organized crime deserves special attention russian crime groups are rapidly expanding their international activities more than criminal elements of other countries russian criminal organizations could become serious threat to international stability and us interests due to russias geopolitical weight and substantial military assets coupled with the unsettled conditions that exist within the country crs2 fbi director louis freeh has said the united states is leading importer of international crime by virtue of its wealth stable financial system and openness it appears to be magnet for criminal money and activity substantial and growing share of organized crime in the united states now has foreign roots and connections1 as part of this trend russian criminal organizations have made their harmful presence felt in the united states russian organized crime is of particular concern to the united states because of its possible impact in four areas russian crime and corruption are undermining and eroding public support for the democratic and market transformation of russia particularly because of its links to official corruption and the still potent invisible networks of former communist bureaucrats secret police and disgruntled military officers russias current financial and political turmoil may be seen in part as result of the crime and corruption as result the russian populace could opt for law and order even if it meant return to more authoritarian rule and tighter central control of the economy2 crime and corruption from russia are being exported to neighboring countries and complicating the transition in other emerging democracies securing stable democracy throughout this region remains high priority for us policy russian criminal organizations with their possible access to large quantities of arms may be in position to fuel regional tensions and conflicts in hot spots such as the balkans and middle east by breaking embargoes smuggling weapons to combatants rogue states as well as to terrorist and foreign criminal organizations weapons from russias large increasingly vulnerable nuclear chemical and biological stockpiles which some fear are inadequately protected could be sold by corrupt officials and disgruntled soldiers in concert with criminal organizations russian crime organizations could threaten our efforts to combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by obtaining and selling such weapons number of other crs reports and issue briefs address related issues see also crs report for congress 97705 crime in russia recent developments and

brief 92089 russia and crs issue brief 95077 the former soviet union and us foreign assistance who and what is russian organized crime organized crime in russia has long history with varying degrees of linkage tolerance or lack thereof to the state in the presoviet period russia was plagued with small scale crime like most european countries russian criminal gangs were not linked to the state and government during the soviet period the police and authorities dealt harshly with traditional criminals and did not tolerate independent criminal organizations although crime was probably bigger problem than official statistics admitted however from the earliest days of the revolution the communist party leaders did enlist and use criminal groups and their tactics when it suited their purposes but those carrying out largescale illicit activities had to operate within the tolerated boundaries of the soviet system and with tacit approval of those in power3 after the collapse of the soviet union and communism new opportunities for organized criminal activity were provided by the weakening of the state and its police institutions as well as the freewheeling and unregulated nature of the economic transition the new reformoriented russian leaders recognized the vulnerability of the economy to criminalization and sought to combat the rise in crime both domestically and in cooperation with other countries this effort has had mixed results to date russia does not have centralized criminal umbrella organization such as the italian mafia instead organized criminal activity follows more decentralized and fragmented model where powerful gangs of varying sizes operate and have loose links with one another russian organized crime today includes 1 soviet era criminal gangs in many cases tolerated and used by the previous kgb and police in other cases toughened by the previous dangers of operating in an authoritarian state these include ethnic and regionallybased gangs 2 new groups made up of disenfranchised and disgruntled former kgb police military and party officials who lost their power and livelihood with the transition members of these groups have particular commitment to the success of russias transition they still have contacts and leverage in russia and abroad through their previous networks the existence of these networks and clandestine patterns of doing business make russian crime particularly difficult to combat german intelligence agency bnd study has reportedly concluded that in russia today groups within the state security bureau the 3 virginie coulloudon the criminalization of russias political elite east european constitutional review vol 6 no4 fall 1997 p 7375 crs4 fsb and officials of other russian agencies are closely tied to crime groups4 such charges have been vehemently denied by russian security agencies in addition elements of the military including high ranking officers have been implicated in criminal activity5 russian criminal groups have unprecedented access to specialists and expertise in number of fields with the collapse of the soviet system scientists engineers computer specialists accountants etc displaced from their careers and unable to find an adequate niche in the new russian economy are susceptible to criminal temptations greatly increasing the technological and professional capabilities of russian criminal groups most experts agree that there has been rapid growth in the number and impact of russian criminal organizations although precise figures are unavailable the russian ministry of the interior mvd estimates that there are some eight thousand criminal groups with some 100000 active members in the former soviet union6 the fbi which has narrower definition of what is organized crime says there are over 300 major criminal organizations in russia and the former soviet union the rising numbers of criminal organizations may reflect fragmentation and better intelligence in uncovering them as well as actual growth in criminality many groups are little more than local street gangs others control crime in large regions and sectors criminal organizations have gained control of significant share of the russian economy the mvd has reportedly determined that organized crime controls 35 percent of commercial banks 40 percent of the public sector of industry 35 percent of private enterprise and substantial share of joint ventures with western companies as vehicle for laundering money7 in 1995 the russian government estimated that criminal activities accounted for some 25 percent of gnp8 more recently some russian officials have conceded that as much as 50 percent of the 4 germanys der spiegel magazine quoted in reuters october 16 1997 for further discussion of

internet for intelligence janes intelligence review november 1997 p526 crs5 economy is shady in some way connected to crime and corruption9 as result crime bosses make up significant proportion of the new wealthy class in russia their economic activities are intertwined with those of legitimate businessmen at time when there was private capital in russia they gained wealth from hasty and sometimes rigged privatization allowing stripping of assets and resources at the onset of privatization sales and purchases were paper transactions apparently only the communist party the kgb government institutions and criminal gangs had assets they competed among themselves in scramble for export industries and resources corrupt officials and criminals were able to pour their assets into newly transformed enterprises and big banks which they or their partners already controlled corrupt officials have been accused of funneling government tax revenues into special banks under criminal control these officials may also have given these banks favored treatment with export licenses when necessary criminal groups have been able to bribe many officials from top leaders down to local officials and police on the beat with what to them amounted to huge payoffs given their meager salaries the russian government response russian leaders understand the severity of the crime problem and want to bring it under control but they are also overwhelmed by it as they try to cope with range of critical problems with russias economy in severe crisis it may be even harder than before to muster the official attention and resources needed to fight crime effectively president yeltsin has called crime and corruption the greatest threat to the future of russian democracy at the same time he and other russian officials are sensitive to overly alarmist foreign assessments of the problem believing it undermines public confidence hurts investment and is exaggerated the russian president and his government hold ultimate responsibility for controlling crime the 1993 russian constitution gives disproportionately large share of power to the president leaving weak judicial and legislative branches thus far russian anticrime efforts have had mixed results for the first nine months of 1997 russian statistics indicated nine percent drop in overall crime yeltsin praised the mvd for the success however this downward trend is not expected to continue in the immediate future former interior minister kulikov cautioned that crime was likely to go up again in 1998 due to lack of resources10 the 1997 decline may also not represent much of dent in the activities of the major criminal organizations 9 gareth jones russian intelligence body denies mafia link charges reuters october 16 1997 10 christina ling russia sees decrease in crime rate in 1998 reuters november 5 1997 crs6 the government has taken number of recent actions to combat crime in 1997 the interior ministry targeted 100 criminal groups and investigated over 1000 people in november 1997 the russian government announced program to improve coordination among law enforcement agencies in russia which had been purposely fragmented to break up the former police power of the kgb in december 1997 the russian government approved draft federal program to intensify the fight against crime for the years 19982000 the program was to put law enforcement activity on new legal footing and improve the organization of law enforcement agencies11 it still did not provide for centralized coordinating mechanism key component of the program is to substantially increase funding for law enforcement it is not clear that russia can come up with the money in its worsening financial situation critics of the governments response to crime have charged that rather than producing more effective judicial system and enhancing law and order many of yeltsins actions have made scape goats of and replaced individual officials they argue that many of the governments anticorruption moves look suspiciously like political steps to redirect blame and remove potential rivals from power alexander lebed while in the central government was viewed by many in russia as the cleanest politician with the will to root out crime and corruption he pushed measures that many thought gave teeth to the governments anticrime and corruption efforts he was dismissed by president yeltsin many believe due to political rivalry rather than the alleged shortcomings of his performance some western reports have accused the russian government of turning blind eye to links between government agencies and criminal organizations as individual security and other agencies face desperate shortages of funding they have been encouraged by russian leaders to seek alternate funds this has been interpreted at least by some security officials as green light to work with the the mafias for profit12 the transnational role of russian organized crime russian criminal organizations have steadily expanded their activities abroad beginning with other countries of the former soviet union and eastern europe alone or in cooperation with local gangs russian crime groups have gained foothold in other countries of the former soviet union they were able to use old links and their familiarity with the terrain when soviet troops were withdrawn from eastern europe some russian soldiers deserted remained behind and became involved in crime this is not to blame crime in neighboring countries mainly on russians or to suggest that indigenous crime is not major problem there crime is serious homegrown problem in most of these countries exacerbated by conditions similar to those in russia however the impact of imported russian crime is significant and in some countries russian criminal groups have large impact 11 moscow interfax december 4 1997 12 kevin obrien and jason ralph using the internet for intelligence janes intelligence review november 1997 p527 crs7 the russian criminal presence has also expanded well beyond the former soviet bloc russian groups have become increasingly active in germany and western europe they are present in latin america the caribbean and canada as well as the united states13 russian organized crime has used number of tools to extend its international reach it has infiltrated and bought up russian enterprises banks and industries with strong international focus and connections russian criminal groups have sought to gain control over goods and resources that have strong illicit markets abroad including arms precursor materials needed for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction and strategic minerals like italian chinese and other criminal organizations russian groups use their own national emigre communities abroad to hide and base operations thus they are active in former soviet countries with large russian minorities and other countries with significant russian emigre communities including the united states israel canada australia and germany ethnic communities are also the principal victims of russian crime and extortion in those countries according to russian mvd estimates russian criminal incidents abroad have grown 5 fold since 1991 within the commonwealth of independent states cis crime doubled in five years the mvd estimates that 400 russian groups operate abroad worldwide14 in 1998 the fbi said that russian based crime groups operate abroad in 54 countries mainly in europe and north america fbi field offices in 34 foreign capitals were dealing with cases involving russian crime groups however in trying to measure their impact russian criminal groups are difficult to separate out from other groups for example some 70 percent of russian groups operating in the us also have links to ukrainian criminals fbi director freeh told congress in april 1998 that of russian crime cases abroad investigated by the fbi 55 percent involve fraud 22 percent money laundering the rest murder extortion smuggling of humans arms and drugs15 as russian organized crime spreads abroad it is both cooperating and competing increasingly with other crime groups the fbi states that russian criminal groups have known links with 50 foreign crime organizations in 29 13 center for strategic and international studies

the italian mafia as well as colombian and other latin american drug cartels russians criminals have cooperated with nigerian turkish japanese chinese and korean criminal groups in drug trafficking money laundering and counterfeiting16 the extent of these links is uncertain they are probably sporadic opportunistic and unreliable given the absence of honor among thieves how russian crime threatens us interests russian crime threatens usinterests in number of ways both directly and indirectly while the russian criminal presence in the united states is significant and growing most law enforcement officials believe the problem is manageable and should not be exaggerated however russian criminal activities in other parts of the world may have strong impact on us security and foreign policy interests direct threats presence in the united states17 by some measures the united states would not appear to be very attractive target for international crime compared to many countries in which international crime groups are active the united states has strong legislation relatively little official corruption and the will to fight crime on the other hand several factors make the united states attractive to international criminals 1 the relative openness of us borders 2 the legal protections of privacy free movement and civil liberties offered by the american system 3 the exploitable division of justice and law enforcement among local state and federal government jurisdictions18 4 americas wealth financial stability and security and the fact that the dollar is the dominant international currency and 5 the presence of well established emigre communities into which criminals can melt as result russian and other international criminal organizations target the united states very actively the exact nature and extent of russian criminal activity in the united states is difficult to assess some 25 major russian groups operate in the united states according to the fbi they concentrate their activities in major cities such as new york san francisco angeles miami chicago boston denver seattle cleveland detroit and philadelphia19 the russian emigre community of brighton

excise taxes they collaborate with the italian mafia colombian drug cartels and other foreign groups role in international drug trafficking russian criminal groups have become active in the illicit drug trade this is not surprising since it is still the most lucrative business for criminals with worldwide profits thought to make up as much as two percent of global gnp russian criminal gangs are connected to central asian drug traffickers russia has become the main conduit for drugs from central asia and other parts of the world to europe east and west russian crime groups are reported to be developing synthetic designer drugs as well in 1997 drug related crime tripled in russia at time when there was an overall decline in russian crime of 9 percent in recent years large amounts of colombian cocaine have been seized in russia in the process drugs have become growing domestic problem for russia there are now an estimated 2 million russian drug addicts21 new transnational patterns are becoming apparent in international drug trafficking number of recent big drug busts have involved criminal groups from more than one country including russia the fbi has found clear links between russian criminal groups and colombian drug cartels operating in miami financial crimes russian crime gangs have been very skillful in using technology to steal defraud and evade the law russians and east europeans known for their computer and programming skills have been very resourceful in perpetrating computer crimes criminals are able to draw on highly trained underemployed computer specialists money laundering is particular concentration of russian criminal activity especially in the united states it is estimated that russian gangs launder billions of dollars each year russian groups reportedly use shell companies investments and bank accounts in cyprus switzerland austria liechtenstein persian gulf emirates and offshore banking centers it is estimated that in cyprus alone russian criminal groups have laundered some 12 billion per year some analysts believe that more than 60 percent of joint ventures between russian and foreign firms are thought to be fictitious established solely for purposes of money laundering22 20 reuters july 9 1998 officials crack alleged russian mob ring in new york 21 interior minister anatolii kulikov quoted by itartass radio free

village cincinnati anderson pub 1997 p 64 crs10 since 1991 billions of dollars in russian assets have been sent abroad legally and illegally23 not all of this money is criminal or laundered some 80 percent of all enterprise hard currency assets is reportedly sent abroad even international foreign aid money is said to have wound up in secret accounts in western countries24 major portion of this money represents criminal profits for the most part untaxed as consequence of russian capital flight which is not likely to subside in view of the countrys financial crisis there is very little domestic investment in russia because so much of the new wealth is built on extraction of resources for export the interests of the groups who control the resources may not be tied to general russian welfare economic conditions or consumer spending capacity the new russian tycoons unlike the american robber barons of old to whom they are sometimes compared do not for the most part reinvest their profits in russia they prefer to send their wealth abroad25 capital exported to the west by criminals often remains under their control may eventually be used for further criminal activity trafficking in humans one of fastest growing areas of criminal activity and one that is of particular concern to the us congress is the smuggling of illegal aliens across borders and trafficking in women and children for prostitution while the smuggling of illegal aliens is more the focus of chinese asian mexican and central american groups russia and the former soviet union are now believed to be the principal source of trafficking for prostitution and the sex industry according to ngo estimates between 1 and 2 million women are trafficked each year world wide the main source countries are russia ukraine belarus poland and the baltic states in addition several central and east european countries are reported to be both receiving and transit countries increasingly this trafficking for the sex trade is controlled by big russian crime groups often in cooperation with foreign criminals in turkey yugoslavia italy and japan russian criminals use marriage agency databases to find and lure victims they place advertisements in the newspapers for good jobs abroad as urban women become more suspicious of scams and dangers these gangs move their recruiting efforts to villages and rural areas26 23 it is impossible to get precise data on the amount of money that has left the country estimates range between 60 and 300 billion dollars 24 former national security advisor zbigniew

victims also end up in the united states some twothirds of women trafficked to western europe for sexual exploitation are from the former soviet union women trafficked to the united state most often wind up in new york florida california and hawaii27 small minority of women come knowingly as prostitutes most are lured with false promises of work and are then forced into labor to pay back substantial fees for smuggling them to their destination in addition to trafficking russian criminal groups are gaining control of prostitution in many parts of europe and the united states28 it is booming business in which instead of onetime profits from smuggling their victims they can continue to make money off the same victims it is business in which the criminal gangs face relatively low risks of capture and punishment until recently there has not been much official help or even sympathy for the victims often the victims were the ones punished when caught however the issue is gaining greater attention european countries have signed convention to fight the problem the united states and the eu agreed on joint initiative to combat trafficking in november 199729 the us congress is also focusing new attention on the issue threats to broader us security and foreign policy interests threat to democratic transitions since the end of the cold war the united states has viewed the successful transition of russia and eastern europe to democracy the rule of law and market economy as the best assurance of future european and international security russian and east european crime and corruption have the potential to distort and even derail the transition to democracy in russia and cause national disillusionment in the process already substantial minority of russians believe that russia is ruled by organized crime many more see criminals as reaping most of the benefits of capitalism while the rest of the population pays the price increasing numbers of russians believe that crime is one of the leading threats to russia forty percent of russians polled at the end of 1997 felt personally threatened by crime and some thirtyfour percent by corrupt officials30 this sentiment has probably increased significantly with the collapse of the ruble and economic turmoil that hit russia in the summer of 1998 the costs to russia of organized crime are in the billions of dollars just in lost tax revenues sharply limiting what the government can do to help its citizens through the rough transition period on the other hand criminal organizations are finding void to fill precisely because of the weakness and even impotence of many 27 ibid p 4 28 global survival network an expose of the traffic in women for prostitution from the newly independent states washington dc

pay criminals to ensure their security and to enforce contracts which the weak and corrupt courts cannot do some western observers have expressed the fear that russia could become criminal state study by center for strategic and international studies task force on russian organized crime found that in the absence of significant reform russia is likely to become criminal syndicalist state one which is governed by corrupt officials working with criminals and unscrupulous businessmen the study concludes that in many respects russia has already reached this state31 while the russian government is not ruled by corruption in the view of most experts the impact of russian crime is definitely magnified by its strong links to official corruption not only do corrupt officials countenance crime but criminal organizations encourage and feed public corruption in many cases high level officials charged with fighting crime are working with the criminals the lines are not always clearly drawn between legitimate and unethical activity by officials number of observers have pointed out that russians do not yet have strong understanding of the concept of conflict of interest even officials who view themselves as honest and serving the public good countenance or participate openly in what would be considered conflict of interest activities unacceptable in established democracies all the time viewing this as normal behavior under capitalism until parliament passed law barring private company positions for those holding public office in 1996 many senior government officials also held senior positions on boards of enterprises since 1996 one can see revolving door with people going back and forth between officialdom and enterprises there are still few checks and balances to correct misdeeds in the young russian democracy the legislature and judiciary are very weak under the 1993 russian constitution32 crime is becoming central issue in the eyes of the general russian public sizeable proportion of russians saw law and order as the main issue in russia prior to the economic and political crisis that erupted in mid1998 they are likely to blame the president for the crime situation since he holds most of the power in russia today coming elections may well favor those who are perceived as incorruptible and tough on crime several experts have pointed to alexander lebed as potential beneficiary of such sentiment33 the broader implications of this sentiment are unclear the main concern from the perspective of us interests is the 31 center for strategic and international studies russian organized crime washington 1997 p 26 32 virginie coulloudon the criminalization of russias political elite p 7578 christian lucky public theft in early america and

peace in chechniya he was for time the head of yeltsins national security committee and is now regional governor he is leading candidate for the presidency he has gained reputation as an incorruptible champion of law and order though some have seen him as somewhat authoritarian crs13 possibility that russian voters could accept return to more authoritarian rule in the interest of cleaning up crime and corruption this sentiment might be strengthened by the countrys worsening financial crisis fueling regional tensions tensions and conflicts in europe the middle east and other parts of the world may provide opportunities for international criminal exploitation criminal organizations have history of involvement in breaking embargoes smuggling arms petroleum and other needed goods to warring parties and governments facing international sanctions russian criminals may have comparative advantage in the arms trade area with the help of corrupt officials and members of the military they are likely to have relatively easy access to large quantities of arms fuel and other supplies they could use local criminal organizations as intermediaries to find buyers and make deliveries the concern about potential criminal involvement in smuggling goods to warring parties in defiance of embargoes is especially strong in volatile places such as the former yugoslavia or along the russian periphery in the caucasus and central asia some analysts are concerned that russian criminals might become involved in selling weapons or components to rogue regimes such as iran libya iraq syria and north korea and even to terrorist groups russian officials downplay this problem and maintain that some of the transactions attributed to criminals in fact have been what they consider legitimate sales by the russian government and enterprises they accuse the united states as major exporter of arms and technology of hypocrisy holding other countries to different standard than our own potential access to weapons of mass destruction one of the greatest concerns is that russian criminal organizations could get their hands on and attempt to sell weapons of mass destruction threatening to undermine global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear chemical and biological weapons in response to questions posed by the senate intelligence committee in december 1997 and released by the committee cia director george tenet reaffirmed us concerns over the possible loss or theft of nuclear weapons and materials the fears are heightened by periodic reports of lax controls and corruption at nuclear biological and chemical facilities that have accompanied the deterioration of the russian armed forces number of nuclear thefts from russian submarine bases have been reported the fbi has raised concerns about the vulnerability of russian and east european radioactive materials to theft and diversion pointing to the seizure of significant amounts of cesium in lithuania and uranium in the czech republic34 many suspect that the russian authorities may not have very tight inventory of their nuclear chemical and biological weapons stockpiles see also crs report 97102 nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress and crs issue brief 98038 nuclear weapons in russia safety security and control issues 34 testimony of fbi director louis freeh before the foreign operations subcommittee of the senate appropriation committee march 12 1996 crs14 the threat of nuclear weapons smuggling by criminal organizations is still more theoretical than real criminal organizations have shown little interest so far probably because of the physical dangers involved in the handling storage and transport of such materials and the difficulty of finding genuine buyers as opposed to undercover police stings given the difficulties and dangers involved in arranging and carrying out nuclear weapons sale criminal groups may be inclined to find more lucrative and less risky activities in other areas to date there have been few incidents of trafficking in nuclear material and those have been rather amateurish not showing the fingerprints of more sophisticated criminal organizations nuclear materials apprehended have been either far below weaponsgrade or very small in quantity most have been smuggled via europe though nuclear materials have also been apprehended in the caucasus with ultimate intended destination unknown these have posed at most low grade environmental hazard but even low grade nuclear materials could pose serious public danger for instance in the hands of terrorists british intelligence reportedly has been investigating the possibility that the provisional ira may have tried to buy fissile materials from russia35 more immediate threat has been the involvement of criminal groups in the sale of dualuse goods nonfissile materials used both in building nuclear weapons and in civilian manufacturing markets are larger and easier to find still the potential danger exists that russian criminals could turn their attention to the smuggling of nuclear biological and chemical weapons as trafficking networks expand and potential payoffs grow russian criminal groups are more likely to be able to get access to nuclear materials especially with the collusion of military and government officials than criminal organizations of other countries both governments and terrorist groups aspiring to nuclear biological and chemical weapons status may be prepared to pay large sums for key components us and international response to the threat until recently the united states and other countries viewed international crime solely as law enforcement problem to be handled by national and local police agencies now there is growing awareness that it is security and foreign policy threat requiring broad interagency and international response us actions the state department has been given an enlarged role in the fight against international crime it has negotiated extradition treaties mutual legal assistance agreements including one with russia in 1997 and information exchange agreements the state department has also played role in foreign law enforcement training 35 kevin obrien and jason ralph using the internet for intelligence janes intelligence review november 1997 p527 crs15 in 1993 the responsibilities of the

in may 1998 president clinton announced new international crime control strategy to combat global crime37 it includes 10 administration initiatives to better combat drug and firearms trafficking illegal alien smuggling trafficking in women and children terrorism money laundering computer theft public corruption and other crimes the eight goals and thirty objectives spelled out in the report are meant to set priorities in the us fight against international crime the report released by the white house was called blueprint for the fight against the growing threat of international crime38 the first initiative under the strategy is proposed new legislation the international crime control act of 1998 discussed in the section on the role of congress cooperation with russia the russian

pleased with the level of cooperation through information sharing and coordinated action regular series of meetings between vice president gore and russian prime ministers has led to the signing of agreements on law enforcement cooperation in 1995 and the establishment of bilateral group to combat commercial crime in 1996 on july 24 1998 vice president gore met with russian prime minister kirienko specific agreements on fighting crime came out of the meetings but russia agreed to take action against firms that have violated russian export controls by shipping sensitive technology to

countries have worked effectively against financial and computer crime drug trafficking and kidnapping cases the cooperation is not without friction russian officials reacted strongly to fbi director freehs statements before 1997 that russian crime poses significant threat to us national security former russian federal security service director nikolai kovalev protested that such statements are likely to limit foreign investment in russia he cited foreign security service sources to make the argument that only 02 percent of crime abroad is committed by former citizens of russia and the former soviet union43 since then us officials have significantly toned down their own characterizations of the problem in november 1997 fbi director freeh said in moscow that crimes by russians or russian groups do not threaten the domestic or national security of the united states he indicated that their impact was serious but less than other groups operating in the united states in april 1998 fbi director freeh testified before the foreign operations subcommittee of the senate appropriations committee again emphasizing the serious and growing threat posed by russian crime44 international initiatives european union the european union has its own programs to stem russian and east european crime it has established the socalled octopus program crime experts from eu countries are sent to the region to gather information they issue reports on the situation in each country and offer guidelines for responding after the schengen convention of 1990 among eu countries was put into force borders were opened between participating eu member countries to people business and in the process to criminals europol was established by the european union in 1995 to enhance european cooperation in the fight against crime to date europol is little more than an information clearinghouse with small budget and few staff it does not open the way for national law enforcement agencies to act against criminals across borders thus russian and other criminal organizations that have penetrated western europe can more easily expand their activities throughout the eu but law enforcement officials must respond in fragmented manner45 in 1995 us and eu presidents signed new transatlantic agenda to establish broader cooperation in many areas special emphasis was placed on 42 moscow

duplication and rationalize efforts in russia and eastern europe48 in 1994 world ministerial conference on transnational organized crime was held in naples italy the general assembly approved the

again stated that money laundering posed serious threat to democracy and to the soundness of the international financial system and pledged members to full implementation of package of 40 recommendations to combat money laundering agreed on in previous meetings the fatf defined fiveyear plan 19992004 to spread the fight against money laundering to all regions of the world emphasis was placed on more effective cooperation among law enforcement judicial financial and regulatory disciplines49 russia is not currently member of fatf even though it is major source of money laundering it has not been seen in the past as meeting all the criteria for membership the organization has set as high priority bringing in strategically important countries which meet certain criteria including commitment to end money laundering the organization could be strengthened by bringing in russia in november 1997 the oecd adopted convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions it was aimed specifically at fighting official corruption linked to organized crime which was deemed significant threat to stable democratic institutions the rule of law and human rights50 role of congress the us congress has expressed growing concern and sought legislative vehicles to reverse recent upward trends in russian and other transnational crime series

defense department authorizations bills before the house hr 3616 and senate s 2057 would again authorize funds for this purpose as part of its announced new international crime control strategy the administration transmitted to congress the proposed international crime control act of 1998 the bill s 2303 was introduced in the senate on june 14 1998 it was transmitted to the house on june 9 and referred to several committees51 the bill aimed to close the gaps in current federal law criminalize additional types of harmful activities and strengthen domestic and foreign criminal justice systems in his letter of transmittal the president stated that the proposed legislation would substantially improve the ability of us law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute international criminals seize their money and assets intercept them at our borders and prevent them from striking at our people and institutions it would strengthen the ability to punish those who commit crimes against americans abroad strengthen controls at us borders deny safe havens to international fugitives and allow for seizure and forfeiture of assets it would also permit us law enforcement agencies to share the seized assets of international criminals with foreign law enforcement agencies provide for extradition of fugitives even in some cases where there is governing treaty and streamline the investigation and prosecution of international crime in us courts52 the bill was not acted on by the 105th congress see also crs issue brief 98038 nuclear weapons in russia safety security and control issues 51 house document 105272 52 white house press release june 9 1998 crs21 options for more effective response as the dimensions of the international organized crime problem grow an understanding is emerging that the threat needs to be looked at and attacked in new ways despite recent us administration g7 and other initiatives number of critics argue that the international response has not kept pace with the spread of transnational crime suggested options for more effectively fighting transnational crime include better information sharing not only among intelligence and law enforcement organizations but also with the private sector and nongovernment organizations especially human rights organizations expanded bilateral and multilateral cooperation and coordination expanded programs of law enforcement assistance for russia and eastern europe and designing more proactive and even preemptive approaches to fighting international organized crime specific options include 1 information sharing in order to gain better intelligence and predictive capacity governments and international organizations could significantly increase their information sharing some have also said that the us and other governments need to work more closely with the private sector exchanging information and sharing intelligence in the fight against crime this involves helping businesses to better know what they are getting into and how to avoid becoming organized crime targets some have suggested that this may require creating unclassified public data bases on criminal organizations so that companies can verify with whom they are doing business the other side of the coin is that governments could more systematically seek information from the private sector on its exposure to and experiences with organized crime some have suggested that activities of criminal organizations should also be treated as human rights problem and given publicity as such at present only governments are monitored in official and nongovernment organization ngo human rights reports it is argued that criminal organizations should be publicly monitored and reported on too 2 law enforcement cooperation law enforcement cooperation could be expanded within the us with russia and multilaterally to match the globalization of crime groups just as borders are coming down for criminals some experts believe they must come down for crime fighting53 where appropriate efforts could be made to bring 53 key problem identified by experts is that countries still act individually continued crs22 russia into international groups and organizations set up to fight transnational crime beginning with the financial action task force bilateral or multilateral task forces with flexibility and jurisdiction across borders to go after international criminals have been recommended54 3 harmonizing legislation it has been suggested that anticrime legislation should be harmonized to the extent feasible so that criminals cannot exploit discrepancies in the laws of different countries to elude justice55 some have suggested treaty or code of conduct among developed or g7 countries investing in russia and other former communist states to deny export credits to firms doing business with organized crime56 4 bilateral assistance many experts argue that law enforcement assistance and training for russia and eastern europe has been very beneficial in the fight against international crime and should be expanded in addition some experts assert that further assistance could also be provided to agencies of the russian government and other institutions responsible for regulating the private sector and its professional standards and business practices to strengthen the ability of legitimate russian business to stay clear of russian crime57 5 taking the offensive against international crime number of experts have suggested that governments move from reactive to more offensive and even preemptive approach to fighting transnational 53 continued rarely bilaterally and even more seldom multilaterally most of the cooperation that does occur is still limited to information exchanges on casebycase basis confirmation of the problem was provided by the then head of the russian security service nikolai kovalev at meeting of cis security services heads on october 8 1997 he stressed that criminal groups of the cis states were integrating much more rapidly and effectively than the agencies tasked to combat them another good example of the problem is provided by the schengen convention of 1990 among eu countries this agreement opened the borders between eu member countries to people business and in the process to criminals but it did not open borders for national law enforcement agencies to act against criminals across borders 54 the united states and italy have had significant success with these in fighting the mafia phil williams transnational criminal organizations strategic alliances p70 55 louise shelley eradicating crime groups foreign service journal september 1997 p 23 56 center for strategic and international studies russian organized crime p 12 57 center for strategic and international studies russian organized crime p 12 crs23 crime along the lines of recent initiatives in the fights against terrorism and drugs to an extent far greater than against terrorists governments can take better advantage of the inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities of criminal organizations and attack them it is argued their networks are fragile vulnerable and penetrable coordinated international responses could include freezing of criminal assets cross border arrests and denial of safe havens for criminals and their money the ability to sow discord and distrust is great if governments work together experts believe that criminal organizations can be penetrated fragmented and isolated pursuit of new options is hampered by two sets of problems first all countries are reluctant to compromise sovereignty or cede jurisdiction this is true not only between countries but even among competing law enforcement agencies within countries58 second any suggestion of combining the efforts of law enforcement defense and intelligence agencies to help to stem crime raises fears and warning flags such moves have troublesome implications for democracy and civil liberties even in established democracies but especially in the transition states 58 it is illustrative that when russian interior minister kulikov unveiled the governments new crime fighting program in the fall of 1997 he devoted as much time to reassuring his different agencies that they would not lose power as to explaining the elements of the program see moscow interfax october 28 1997 for
