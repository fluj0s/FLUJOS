from tom wigley wigleyucaredu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject 1940s date sun 27 sep 2009 232538 0600 cc ben santer santer1llnlgov xflowed phil here are some speculations on correcting ssts to partly explain the 1940s warming blip if you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip as im sure you know so if we could reduce the ocean blip by say 015 degc then this would be significant for the global mean but wed still have to explain the land blip ive chosen 015 here deliberately this still leaves an ocean blip and i think one needs to have some form of ocean blip to explain the land blip via either some common forcing or ocean forcing land or vice versa or all of these when you look at other blips the land blips are 15 to 2 times roughly the ocean blips higher sensitivity plus thermal inertia effects my 015 adjustment leaves things consistent with this so you can see where i am coming from removing enso does not affect this it would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip but we are still left with why the blip let go further if you look at nh vs sh and the aerosol effect qualitatively or with magicc then with reduced ocean blip we get continuous warming in the sh and cooling in the nh just as one would expect with mainly nh aerosols the other interesting thing is as foukal et note from magicc that the 191040 warming cannot be solar the sun can get at most 10 of this with wang et solar less with foukal solar so this may well be nadw as sarah and i noted in 1987 and also schlesinger later reduced sst blip in the 1940s makes the 191040 warming larger than the sh which it currently is not but not really enough so why was the sh so cold around 1910 another sst problem shnh data also attached this stuff is in report i am writing for epri so id appreciate any comments you and ben might have tom xflowed attachment converted ceudoraattachtthemisxls attachment converted ceudoraattachttlvsoxls
