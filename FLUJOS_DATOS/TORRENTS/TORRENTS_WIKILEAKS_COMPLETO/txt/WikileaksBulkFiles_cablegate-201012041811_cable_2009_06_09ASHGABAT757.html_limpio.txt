demand recount ashgabat 00000757 0012 of 002 classfied by charge richard miles reasons 14 b and d 1 c in conversation today with iran watcher source removed in ashgabat labeled the announcement of mahmoud ahmadinejads victory in fridays presidential election coup detat and called irans incumbent president another pinochet name removed said that based on calculations from mousavis campaign observers who were present at polling stations around the country and who witnessed the vote counts mousavi received approximately 26 million or 61 of the 42 million votes cast in fridays election followed by mehdi karroubi 1012 million according to his sources ahmadinejad received maximum of 45 million votes with the remainder going to mohsen rezai he said that more than anything else the huge turnout of voters on friday was reflection of the iranian electorates overwhelming antiahmadinejad sentiments precinct results obscured 2 c name removed said that in clear departure from established electoral rules and practice in iran including the procedures followed in the 2005 presidential election and last years legislative elections the authorities embargoed the results from individual precincts and announced instead that they must be conveyed directly to the central election authorities who would announce the overall results after all the votes were counted the iranian authorities knew he said that attempts to falsify individual precinct counts could be countered by observers from the mousavi and the other campaigns so in order to engineer lopsided ahmadinejad victory they had choice but to conceal the precinct results in his words people know who they voted for and the observers know who won in each precinct arab reaction huge disappointment 3 c name removed said that iranians are puzzled by the muted reaction thus far of the us and eu governments as well as very disappointed by the number of arab rulers who have sent messages to ahmadinejad congratulating him on his victory he said that the international community should acknowledge the illegitimacy of the election and demand that the iranian authorities release and account for the results from each precinct he said the irgc iranian revolutionary guard corps was behind the coup even supreme leader khamenei he said to whom the irgc owes allegiance is not totally in control of the irgc citing the irgcs warnings against velvet revolution in the days leading up to the election it would appear that the irgc has taken on life of its own iranian diplomats get 4th of july invitation instructions 4 c during visit to the iranian embassy in ashgabat last friday to vote name removed said that without exception everyone he spoke to who was there to cast their ballot said they were voting for mousavi detail removed civil disobedience our only option 5 c name removed said that the iranian authorities particularly the irgc are merciless and unlike the government in 1979 will use any level of force necessary to put down iranians who attempt ashgabat 00000757 0022 of 002 to demonstrate or force an annulment of the election instead he said the most effective means to counter the results will be in the form of peaceful civil disobedience the people need to act in concert and shut down the country if one goes to work and the government cannot function he said this will cause them to think again 6 c comment during our conversation our interlocutor recalled the words of his father detail removed during the leadup to the 1979 revolution he said that his father warned him against joining the revolution and to watch out for the islamists once they get power he had said theyll never relinquish it people are going to be sorry end comment miles
