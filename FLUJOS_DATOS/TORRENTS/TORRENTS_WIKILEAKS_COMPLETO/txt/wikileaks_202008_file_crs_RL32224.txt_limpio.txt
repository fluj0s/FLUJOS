rights in united states v patane missouri v seibert and fellers v united states updated july 26 2004 estela i velez pollack legislative attorney american law division congressional research service the library of congress miranda reconsidered supreme court review of miranda rights in united states v patane missouri v seibert and fellers v united states summary the united states supreme court created the now wellknown miranda warnings to preserve the right against selfincrimination provided by the fifth amendment of the constitution and the right to counsel provided by the sixth amendment these warnings provide that prior to questioning individuals suspected of crime must be informed of their right to remain silent that anything they say may be used against them in court that they have the right to an attorney and if they cannot afford one that lawyer will be appointed to represent them miranda v arizona 384 us 425 1966 aside from serving to inform people of their rights the miranda decision is meant to guide the police and deter improper conduct this term the united states supreme court decided two cases that challenged miranda united states v patane and missouri v seibert in patane the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that firearm should be suppressed on grounds that it was inadmissible as the fruit of statement obtained without miranda warnings united states v patane 304 f 3d 1013 1014 10th cir 2002 on june 28 2004 the supreme court issued its opinion reversing the circuit courts decision and remanding the case the court held that failure to give miranda warnings does not require the exclusion of physical evidence derived from suspects unwarned but voluntary statements the court reasoned that since miranda warnings were designed to protect criminal defendants rights under the fifth amendment and the fifth amendment forbids compelling defendant to testify against himself at trial the introduction of physical evidence obtained as result of voluntary statements given without miranda warnings does not violate the fifth amendment united states v patane 542 us __ 72 uslw 4643 june 28 2004 021183 in seibert the missouri supreme court held that mirandized confessions following prior intentional violation of miranda are inadmissible in court on june 28 2004 the supreme court issued an opinion affirming the lower courts decision in so doing the court held that when police officers deliberately withhold miranda warnings consequent statements are inadmissible even if miranda warnings are later administered because the statements cannot be considered voluntary missouri v seibert 542 us __ 72 uslw 4634 june 28 2004no 021371 however the court left the door open for the possible admission of these statements when the withholding of the miranda warnings is unintentional third case united states v fellers originally raised miranda issue but it was disposed by the court on sixth amendment right to counsel grounds contents background 1 united states v patane 1 background 1 holding 3 missouri v seibert 5 background 5 holding 6 fellers v united states 8 background 8 holding 9 miranda reconsidered supreme court review of miranda rights in united states v patane missouri v seibert and fellers v united states background custodial interrogations are inherently intimidating and their tactics are geared towards undermining the right against selfincrimination1 the supreme court recognizing this set some concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies to follow when conducting custodial interrogations in miranda v arizona 384 us 436 445 1966 these guidelines are commonly known as miranda rights miranda rights grow out of the fifth amendment right to remain silent2 and the sixth amendment right to an attorney3 miranda requires the police to advise suspects that they have right to remain silent that anything the suspects say can be used against them in court of law that they have right to the presence of an attorney and that if they cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for them prior to any questioning if they so desire the purpose of this rule is to make sure that if accused persons answer questions in an interrogation this waiver of their right to remain silent or to have an attorney present is one that is made freely with 1 miranda 384 us 436 445 1966 2 the fifth amendment affords individuals the right against selfincrimination it states that person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself 3 the sixth amendment guarantees the right to legal counsel during all stages of the criminal process the sixth amendment also affords criminal defendant the right to be informed of the nature of the charges against him or her and the facts underlying those charges the right to compel witnesses to appear and testify the right to confront witnesses and the right to speedy and public trial by an unbiased jury us const amend vi crs2 knowledge of the existence of the right4 this report discusses the supreme court decisions addressing the latest miranda challenges united states v patane and missouri v seibert the report also addresses united states v fellers which originally raised miranda issue but was decided on other grounds united states v patane background patane was arrested for violating domestic violence restraining order the arresting officer who had been informed that patane was convicted felon and possessed pistol began reading him his miranda rights but stopped when he was told by patane that he knew what his rights were5 the arresting officer then proceeded to question patane about his possession of firearm patane told the officer the location of the gun and was charged with being felon in possession of firearm6 patane filed successful motion to suppress the firearm in district court7 on appeal the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that the firearm should be suppressed on grounds that it was inadmissible as the fruit of statement obtained without proper miranda warnings8 the tenth circuit relied on dickerson v united states9 supreme court case declaring that miranda articulated constitutional rule that congress may not supersede legislatively moreover since the supreme court had already decided in wong sun v united states10 that fruits of unconstitutional conduct require suppression the gun in patane the tenth circuit reasoned must be suppressed in holding that the gun had to be suppressed the tenth circuit distinguished the instant case from michigan v tucker11 and elstad12 where the supreme court had declined to apply the wong sun fruits of the poisonous tree doctrine13 to suppress evidence obtained from miranda violations but had not referred to miranda 4 id at 445 5 united states v patane124 sct 2620 2625 2004 6 id 7 id 8 id 9 530 us 428 2000 10 371 us 471 1963 in wong sun the court found that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule barred evidence obtained as direct or indirect result of an unlawful search from being admitted at trial the court noted that the exclusionary rule applies to physical as well as verbal evidence 11 417 us 433 1974 12 470 us 298 1985 13 fruit of the poisonous tree is the doctrine that evidence discovered due to information found through illegal search or other unconstitutional means such as forced confession may not be introduced by prosecutor the theory is that the tree or the initial illegal evidence is poisoned and thus taints what grows from it crs3 as constitutional right14 the court reasoned that tucker and elstad were based on the view that miranda announced prophylactic rule position that is incompatible with dickersons announcement of constitutional rule15 the court found that the failure to give miranda warnings equated to violation of the constitution and the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applied16 the government petitioned the united states supreme court and the court granted certiorari17 on june 28 2004 the court reversed the circuit courts decision and remanded the case18 holding the issue in patane was whether the weapon that the police were able to locate as result of patanes nonmirandized statements was admissible in court justice thomas announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion for the court in which chief justice rehnquist and justice scalia joined justice kennedy joined by justice oconnor filed an opinion concurring in judgement justice souter joined by justices stevens and ginsberg and justice breyer dissented in the plurality opinion justice thomas noted that the purpose of the fifth amendment selfincrimination clause is to protect an individual from being compelled to testify against himself and that the miranda warnings are designed to protect this right therefore failure to give miranda warnings should only require the exclusion of resulting statements and not any physical evidence that may have been obtained as result of the statements19 justice thomas reasoned that the miranda rule is prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the selfincrimination clause however the self incrimination clause is not violated by the admission into evidence of physical evidence obtained as result of voluntary statement20 furthermore the miranda rule along with number of other prophylactic rules designed to protect the core privilege against selfincrimination21 sweeps beyond the actual protections of the 14 united states v patane 304 f3d 1013 10201022 10th cir 2002 15 patane 124 sct at 262526 16 id the court also distinguished elstad in that it involved statements made prior to miranda warnings that were repeated after the reading of the warnings the court reasoned that elstad did not exclude the postmiranda statement in patane because it was willingly offered by the defendant who already knew his rights and made the statements out of his own volition the supreme court did not find that distinction relevant id at n2 17 patane 123 sct 1788 18 united states v patane 542 us __ 124 sct 2620 2004 19 patane 124 sct at 2626 20 id 21 id at 2627 citing united states v balsys 524 us 666 671672 1998 minnesota v murphy 465 us 420 426 1984 holding that the government may compel grand jury testimony from witnesses invoking the fifth amendment if the witness is given immunity united states v hubbell 530 us 27 37 2000 holding that potential suspects may assert the privilege against selfincrimination in proceedings outside of the trial where their continued crs4 clause22 therefore only real necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled selfincrimination can justify any further extension of the miranda rights23 consequently the plurality decided against expanding the miranda rule to include physical evidence furthermore the plurality disagreed with the circuit courts reasoning that the gun had to be suppressed since the miranda rule is constitutional right and the fruits of unconstitutional conduct are inadmissible24 instead the plurality stated that the determination that the selfincrimination clause does not extend to physical evidence is consistent with the courts prior characterization of miranda as constitutional rule25 the lead opinion clarified that mere failure to give miranda warnings does not violate an individuals constitutional rights or the miranda rule itself since the right against selfincrimination is fundamental trial right26 this the plurality stated is consistent with both the predickerson and postdickerson line of cases therefore the plurality reasoned the miranda rule is not code for police conduct and the police do not violate the constitution by failure negligent or deliberate to warn27 potential violations of the rule could only occur when unwarned statements are actually introduced in court28 any miranda violation can be sufficiently remedied by the exclusion of the unwarned statements29 thus unlike the fourth amendment or an actual violation of the selfincrimination clause there is nothing to deter ie police conduct with respect to failures to warn30 consequently there is reason to apply the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine31 justice kennedy joined by justice oconnor concurred with justice thomas only as to the judgment kennedy agreed with the pluralitys reasoning that admitting physical evidence does not run the risk of violating the selfincrimination clause kennedy departs from the pluralitys reasoning on two grounds 1 that it was unnecessary to decide whether the detectives failure to give the full miranda warning constituted violation of the miranda rule and 2 that it was unnecessary to decide whether there is something to deter ie police conduct with respect to failure to give miranda warnings 21 continued answers may be used to incriminate them in subsequent criminal case 22 id 23 id at 2628 24 id see patane supra 304 f 3d 1013 25 id

crs5 considering that patane does not have majority opinion it may still be difficult to ascertain how the court will apply the miranda rule in other fifth amendment contexts however in looking for common nucleus between the plurality opinion and justice kennedys opinion one holding may be controlling in future cases admission of nontestimonial physical evidence does not run the risk of violating the selfincrimination clause neither opinion embraced or repudiated the holding in dickerson that miranda is constitutional right they did clarify though that failure to give miranda warnings does not by itself violate an individuals constitutional rights missouri v seibert background the facts in seibert are similar to those in patane one morning seibert found one of her sons who was severely handicapped dead in her trailer he had died while sleeping seibert did not report the death to the authorities because she was afraid of being accused of neglect32 as cover up another of her sons and friend decided to set the trailer on fire it was decided that another friend who lived with them should be in the trailer so it would not seem like the had been left alone33 the arson did not go as planned and the friend left in the trailer died34 the police who suspected seibert was involved in the death of the friend decided to put pressure on seibert and approached her while she was at her sons bedside in the hospital the officers intentionally did not give her miranda warnings35 seibert after initially denying any involvement in the fire admitted knowledge of the fire and that the friend was intended to die in the fire the police took short break and then gave miranda warnings seibert again stated that she had knowledge of the fire and that she intended the friend to die in the fire36 at trial the lower court suppressed the premiranda statements but admitted the postmiranda statements37 the missouri court of appeals affirmed the lower courts determination that the second confession was admissible it based its decision on elstad supra38 on appeal the missouri supreme court reversed the appellate courts finding that the second confession was admissible it found that there was an intentional miranda violation39 according to the missouri supreme court once there is an intentional miranda violation the court must examine the 32 missouri v seibert 542 us __ 124 sct

involuntary the court reversed the conviction41 the missouri supreme court distinguished elstad in that the confession in that case was not part of premeditated tactic42 the missouri supreme court was divided 43 and the dissenters argued that the case was not distinguishable from elstad in that there was evidence that the police officer used any deliberately coercive tactics in eliciting seiberts confession and therefore evidence to support the majoritys presumption that the officer was trying to weaken seiberts ability to exercise her constitutional rights knowingly and voluntarily missouri petitioned the united states supreme court and the court granted certiorari43 on june 28 2004 the court issued an opinion affirming the lower courts decision44 holding the issue in seibert was whether the miranda rule that requires the giving of warnings at the beginning of an interrogation should be abrogated in favor of making the warning optional justice souter joined by justices stevens ginsberg and breyer delivered an opinion and announced the judgment for the court justice kennedy filed an opinion concurring in judgment justice breyer filed concurring opinion justice oconnor joined by justices rehnquist scalia and thomas filed dissenting opinion the plurality criticized what appears to be law enforcement tactic of questioning suspects where the officers conduct twostage interrogation this tactic consists of interrogating suspects without giving them miranda warnings and at any point afterwards usually after confession give the miranda warnings and ask the suspect to repeat what they just said this would allow officers to repeat any subsequent incriminating statements in court45 the plurality found that the objective of this tactic is to render miranda warning ineffective46 and that it would be absurd to think that mere recitation of the litany of the miranda warnings suffices to satisfy miranda in every conceivable circumstance47 however the plurality left the door open for some statements resulting from question first and warn later scenario admissible at court the plurality distinguished this case from their prior holding in elstad supra where the plurality held admissible 40 id 41 id 42 id 43 seibert 123 sct 209 2004 44 missouri v seibert 542 us __ 2004 45 seibert 124 sct at 260809 citing police law institute illinois police manual 83 jan 2001dec 2003 available at httpwwwillinoispolicelawtraininglessons ilplmirpdf 46 id at 2610 47 id crs7 statements obtained after an initial unmirandized admission48 in elstad the defendant after engaging in conversation with the arresting police made an incriminating statement prior to the administration of miranda warnings the police then administered the miranda warnings and he made additional incriminating statements the issue in that case was whether the defendants statement post miranda warnings must be suppressed as the fruit of the prior miranda violation49 the court held that suppression of the statements was not necessary because they had been made voluntarily after the administration of the miranda warnings50 in distinguishing elstad the plurality in seibert noted that the failure to give the initial miranda warnings in that case was goodfaith mistake and not intentional therefore the plurality concluded that when interrogators question first and warn later the test is whether it would be reasonable to find that under the circumstances the warnings effectively advised the suspect that he or she had real choice about giving statement at that time51 the plurality effectively left the door open for some statements resulting from question first and warn later scenario to be used in evidence to be admissible the prosecution would need to show that the police were not trying to circumvent miranda when they were questioning the suspect52 to facilitate said determination the plurality set out series of relevant facts to consider 1 the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation 2 the overlapping content of the two statements 3 the timing and setting of the first and second statements 4 the continuity of police personnel and 5 the degree to which the interrogators questions treated the second round as continuous53 justice breyer wrote that simple rule should apply to the twostage interrogation technique fruits of initial unwarned questioning should be excluded unless the failure to warn was in good faith54 breyer clarified that the pluralitys approach will function in practice as test to determine if the miranda warnings given were effective justice kennedy concurring in the judgment agreed with the plurality opinion that statements obtained through questionfirstwarnlater technique are inadmissible since this interrogation technique is designed to circumvent miranda55 however kennedy viewed the pluralitys test as too broad56 he disagreed that the test should be applied in every instance of questionfirstwarnlater scenario 48 elstad 470 us at 311313 49 id 50 id 51 seibert 124 sct at 2610 52 id at 261213 53 id 54 id at 2613 55 id at 2614 56 id at 2616 crs8 kennedy would apply the test more narrowly only when the twostep interrogation was intentional57 considering that there was true majority in seibert we must look for the common point between the lead opinion and the two concurring opinions to try to ascertain how the court is most likely to approach future similar cases the common ground between all three opinions is that in cases where there is an intentional use of questionfirstwarnlater interrogation technique test will be used to determine the effectiveness of the miranda warnings and therefore the admissibility of the statement this test will look for certain specific circumstances occurring between the unwarned and the warned questioning lapse in time change in location or interrogation officer and shift in the focus of the questioning brightline rule making inadmissible all statements resulting from questionfirst warnlater scenario was issued by the court instead the determination of admissibility will most likely be made on casebycase basis based on the facts of each case fellers v united states third case58 considered by the court this term initially thought to impact miranda is fellers v united states59 however the court disposed of it on sixth amendment right to counsel grounds rather than the fifth amendment brief summary of that case is included below background following his indictment two police officers arrived at fellers house with warrant for his arrest they told him they wanted to discuss his involvement with drugs and his association with certain people they did not read him his miranda rights fellers in turn admitted that he associated with the people in question and that he had used methamphetamine60 the officers took fellers to jail where they informed him of his miranda rights fellers signed written waiver and then repeated the statements made at his home61 the magistrate judge suppressed both statements but the district court later ruled that only the first statement should be suppressed the court of appeals for the eight circuit agreed with the district court finding that the statement made at the jail was voluntary statement knowingly made after waiving his miranda rights62 the court based its decision on the supreme courts holding in oregon v elstad 57 id 58 fourth case yarborough v alvarado 124 sct 2140 2004 also included miranda issue however that case came to the court as writ of habeas corpus which looks at the propriety of the state courts application of the law rather than answering or clarifying question of law 59 124 sct 1019 2004 60 united states v fellers 285 f 3d 721 723 8th cir 2002 61 id 62 id crs9 470 us 298 198563 that even if the first statement was result of miranda violation subsequent mirandized statement is admissible64 fellers petitioned the supreme court and the court granted certiorari65 two issues were presented 1 whether the initial statement was inadmissible under the sixth amendment because the statement was made without miranda warnings66 and 2 whether under the fifth amendment the statements made after administration of the miranda warnings should be suppressed as fruits of the initial unmirandized statement on january 26 2004 the court issued its opinion reversing the court of appeals judgment and remanding the case for further proceeding consistent with the courts decision67 holding in reversing the lower courts decision the court noted that the sixth amendment right to counsel is triggered at or right after the time judicial proceedings are initiated against an accused68 the court had also previously held that an accused is denied his sixth amendment protections when there is used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words which federal agents deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of counsel69 this is known as the deliberateelicitation standard under this standard statements deliberately elicited from an accused who is already being represented by counsel without first obtaining valid waiver of that counsels presence during the interrogation are inadmissible during the prosecutions caseinchief70 excluding these statements serves to protect the integrity and fairness of the criminal trial71 for postindictment statements to be admissible the government must show that the accused voluntarily knowingly and intelligently relinquished his sixth amendment right to counsel72 in this case the court held that the officers had deliberately elicited information from fellers the court focused on several facts including that the officers had come to fellers house and informed him that their purpose of coming was to discuss his involvement with the distribution of drugs and the discussion had taken place outside the presence of counsel after fellers had been indicted applying the 63 discussion of the facts in elstad is included under the section discussing united states v patane 64 id at 724 65 fellers 123 sct 1480 66 as stated previously miranda rights grow out of both the fifth amendment right against selfincrimination and sixth amendment right to counsel in this instance the supreme court in granting certiorari chose to focus on the sixth amendment aspect of miranda 67 fellers 124 sct 1019 68 id citing brewer v williams 430 us 682 689 1972 69 idquoting massiah v united states 377 us 201 206 1964 70 massiah v united states 377 us

deliberateelicitation standard the court held that fellers sixth amendment rights had been violated by admitting the first statement the court distinguished this case from the fifth amendment custodial interrogation line of cases where the right only attaches upon actual interrogation73 the court had previously held that the sixth amendment right to counsel exists even when there is interrogation and the fifth amendment does not apply74 in this case the court held that the lower court improperly conducted fruits of the poisonous tree75 analysis under the fifth amendment instead of the sixth amendment because it had erroneously held that fellers sixth amendment rights had not been violated the court however did not decide the issue of whether the incriminating statements are admissible after knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel notwithstanding an earlier questioning in violation of the sixth amendment right to counsel therefore the court remanded the case back to the lower court to address the admissibility of fellers second statement after holding that those statements were the fruit of previous questioning conducted in violation of the sixthamendment deliberateelicitation standard76 73 the court did not address the fifth amendment aspect of the case as it decided it based on the sixth amendment 74 michigan v jackson 475 us 625 632 n5 1986 75 the
