relationship of training to ot lecture given on 7 november 1963 whats the date audience seven november seven nov ad 13 saint hill special briefing course you are very fortunate people you are very very lucky people come down all the way down the track lived all of those years did all these stupid things and you wind up here with chance out the chance is as good as you can audit and its not bit better the number of raw meat thats going to go out through the roof will be numbered on nonexistent chinese abacus from the ming dynasty which has long been lost they wont make it you can patch them up you make them feel better but thats about it unless you train them unless they become actually fully trained auditor they really dont have prayer this at this stage of the game is not it is good thing if anybody is to be fully cleared or go ot for them to be trained organization policy moves out of that zone and area into an entirely different zone and area if dey gonna make it dey gonna have to have been trained well so i can see you now with your sleeves rolled up sweating dubiously with three or four people that youre auditing something like this over hubbard mind trainerputty on the end of your nose little pointer in your handsaying this is gpm and the fellows saying huh and you about that time saying i wish to god herbie was here yes matter what i thought of fred last year if he were only here now you know this type of state of mind and then youll sock ahead with this seesock ahead and you decide well why dont you gowhy dont you go to angeles or cape town or something and take an hca course and you keep askingthey keep asking you these silly questions you see about well you say something aboutwhat is this thing called tone scale i didnt know i had to study music in order to you say well why dont you go todown to cape town or angeles or someplace and take an hca course and when you come back ill give you the hot dope here dont you see because in the first place theyre not really worried about becoming ot they want to cure their lumbosis and of courselumbosis slumbosiswho cares about that see its nothing importance and theyre all worried about their present time problems they come into session you see and they want to tell you about the fight they had with their wife you see and they want this all cleared up as present time problem but actually its their theyre really worried about and then therestheres aunt agnes and so forth she has committed terrible overt act against they got motivator she didnt die and leave them her money and so forth and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and i can just hear you now straightening all this up saying fine and the guy says well whats all this wonderful power i was supposed to have and that sort of thing well i tell you ahem its like this you have to be very learned indeed in order to put your little feet upon this road to glory and you have to have attained certain philosophic poise something like this and theyll come around well all right ive read some textbooks now have i attained philosophic poise am i now capable of right conduct and so forth and i can see you now by the way why dont you go down to angeles or to anywhere take the hca course when you come back why and so on and so forth and there it will go youyou wait youll do just that why because your rawmeat case is very easy to auditvery very easy to audit theyre marvelous i mean of course youre sitting there with so much knowledge of cases and that sort of thing you could hardly fail to get some kind of result matter what the fellow did but the facts of the case areis you can audit the fat off the top ris these cases are fat theyre fat with charge the charge is leaking out of their ears they remind you of boiler which was designed to contain two hundred pounds and has been pumped up to fifteen hundred pounds per square inch in other words youve got charge here man theres voltage coming out of their ears you just touch them with glance at the emeter and they bleed charge dont you see because the top of the bank is fat present lifetimegot lots of reality on their difficulties the case is fat see good and fat and all you have to do is take little bat at either one of these two top ris the terminal or oppterm and it bleeds charge so you can just sit there and bleed charge and get good tone arm action and straighten out how aunt agatha didnt die and leave them their money and you can charge chargeyou can justservice facsimiles and aahh and so forth and the tone arm fl very easy auditing because youre auditing fat and the reason why scientologist appears to be tougher case which he isnt is because the fat has been taken off of him more fat left on those two top ris how are you going to bleed any charge off of them the only way you can bleed charge off them is find the two top ris and go on down the bank that make sense to you so how youre findingin the lower units here at saint hillhow you were finding any charge or tone arm action on the pc at all i dont know because its probably the totality of it was removed several years ago ive made some kind of side remark on this in an earlier lecture but i think you must be flock of geniuses to get charge at all see that doesntthat doesnt restrain from insisting that you get tone arm action but realize that in all honesty im totally aware of the fact that youre attempting the near impossible you get case parked into its first or second bank you get that goal in full bloom youve got this case all ready to find that goal and the longer you dont find that goal the harder and tougher that ta is going to get stuck ive seen case well straightened outnothing really wrong with the case at all just lined up beautifullyin the second gpm ready to list for the third gpm and that tone arm at 55 man and going higher and there were errors to be straightened out in the casethere were some errors there in the first and second gpm that could have been straightened out beautifully but even straightening out these errors made slightest difference to the tone arm that case was ready to roll on the third gpm and that case had alreadyhuh as one found laterhad thought of the next goal and that was it tone arm i mean the case could have gotten wound up in legal actions and every other kind of human difficulty you could name and been charged up with it and you could have put in the prepcheck buttons on their ptps and you could have just done everything you could have thought of becausei know because i did it and there it sat55 56 next session57 next session575 and so forth and finally got around in the department of case analysis to find out whats wrong with this case well the case had thought of the next goal and the full charge of the next gpm was sitting there just pong all ready to go it was the next charge up nobody was touching it nobody was doing anything with it at all and until that goals list was completed that tone arm stayed at 55 not even case analysis would put it down why because the case was rolling the case was running do you understand that i was solving just this one mystery is how did this case come back into session with tone arm at 55 when theyd left the session at 30 after two sessions or something of that order i found out theyd thought of and actually had written down four goalsand one of them was it it brought the whole gpm right back up there and it wasnt any between sessions charge it was the next goal all one really had to have done at that spot of course was just to continue the r4 and you had tone arm action and immediately r4 was resumed and tone arm action went back to fortyfive divisions per session well whatswhats the matter here well the auditor wasnt running the next thing to be run on the case do you see that well the auditor wasnt running the next thing to be run on the case this next thing was so germane to the resolution of this case that there wasnt anything that would have alleviated it except doing it so scientologists are sitting there ready to roll you want to know the truth of it you can do case analysis and patch up the bank and get some tone arm action and get goals that have been found analyze these things these things youve got to do anyway and you get some tone arm action and square it up but think about somebody that has his present time gpm has it it is it unfortunately the only real tone arm action youre going to get on that case is finding the top terminal and opposing the next ri so your lowerlevel case runs on fat theyre fat with charge when this is blown out and straightened up their life looks much simpler to them looks much better and so forth well whats wrong with them now is the whole stretchedout bank and that is sitting there ready to be run youre not going to get anyplace if you dont run it and you cant run it on somebody who doesnt know his mindthe mindand so forth backwards and upside down and also right way to so what kind of situation does this put us into this is series of data which are forced upon us by technical factsnot by my hopes not by what we would like to believe not by optimism and theyre very very cold harsh facts the tone arm action which youre going to get at case levels i ii and iii are the fat that exist on the two top ris and incidental fat that may be on the rest of the bank disarranged and thats the tone arm action youre going to get and those ris are going to be cut down theyre going to feel easier life is going to be easier those things are going to have less punch when you find them howeverwhen you finally find themtheyre going to have bang theyre going to have punch in them still you cant take i ii and iiilevel auditing and do anything really to an ri when its put back in position ready to be found and so forth it still fires and blows down and opposes everything and so on these things are practically indestructible so dont get too worried about the case was messed up and so some of its ris are missing thats never going to happen you can even find them in the wrong banks and when you put them in the right bank they fire and blow down as usual they only disintegrate when exactly and properly located and when they are opposed or up against the item which they oppose when the companion items around them are released and so forth then they disintegrate and you havent got any more ri thats the end of that now trying to find it again now can actually cause fantastic arc break on the part of the pc you found it properly with r4 it is gone you now tell the pc we are now going to find it you want an arc break take pc whos had the first second third bank run out and say we are now going to run out the second bank he cant see youve told him to take stock out of the shop that isnt there you say now see that empty warehouse good move everything out of it that in actual fact is the only way you can get rid of goals gpms and risis run them properly by r4 all right somebody thats had his bank chopped up fifth gpm from the top found sometime in the past by r3 bunch of items run out of the thing and that sort of thing that fellowthat bank if it was at all well run is going to cause you trouble when you finally connect with it because the next goal isnt now going to fire youre trying to empty the warehouse that is empty and the way to get around that if you ever run into that situation is to make sure that you have every goal thats ever been run on the pc and do it by dating you can confirm by dating because you can date an ri even though it has been discharged its the only thing you can do that is left to do with an ri you can date it even though its gone and the bank is gone you can still get reactions on where it has been on the track because of course it was pulled slightly out of position to be run so the reorientation of it still has the bang left in it necessary to locate it on the track interesting isnt it its just the idea is left and youre really dating the idea it has mass with it or anything like that anymore so if you ran up against that proposition why you can solve the thing by dating lets say the bank to know nothing has been run out of the pc and youve gotfor some reason or other youve come across the goal to know and youve just run it out and youre doing an oppose and it doesnt conclude with anything you dont wind up with anything well you finally have to assume that if the pc had been run on r3 earlier and some gpms run out look them over youll find in that list gpm that will oppose it youll probably find see to know nothing and you get some kind of situation here you can confirm it by dating you can date the bottom of the gpmthe ri end of the gpm that you just leftand you can date the top of the one that has been run out the two dates should coincide should be within short distance of each other trick well but its necessary trick to know now lets look over this general situation im sure that somebody sooner or later is going to get around this going to take one of these big tables and bunch of clay and hes going to train somebody up whos unusually smart and get them to know all the parts and definitions of the mind and that sort of thing and get them groomed up to point where they can call them all off and know what hes talking about and so forth and find the present time gpm and go on down the line somebody is going to do that sooner or later and that will be the exception however to the rule you have not realized how much aplomb you have acquired with regard to the mind you have concept of how much aplomb you have pavlov his approach to the mindnervous oldmaid aunt you know just uhhhh nervy man if youd talked about the mind to him while he was on an emeter why it would have banged across both pins why of course nearly everything theoretical was lie on the thing but he was still nervous he had aplomb about this subject at all when you start training somebody in an hca course and so forth youve had that activity thats been part of your activitiesyou remember how nervous these people were amongst them how nervy they get you tell them to sit down and say something to the person across from them well they will do this very happily maybe in coaudit because they havent even looked at what theyre doing yet its all unreal to them so its perfectly all right to do this you see and youll see this in pes all the time well that theyre not saddled with any responsibility theyre just doing something there because the instructor told them to do and theyre not taking any responsibility for anybodys mind all right you get them into the lower levels of hca course and the d of t or instructor starts chewing them out for the subject of having gotten somebody into an arc break because they didnt complete the auditing question or something like this and all of sudden theyre saying what somebody is actually requiring to be responsible for the conduct of session ohhhhh actually theres little gradients many instructors have dreamed up trying to get people to actually sit there and take some responsibility for session they give them self analysis or something like that and have them read questions out of self analysis to the pc or something like this just to get the idea of it the approach there is quite interesting well actually these people are all preselected out of the races of earth today theyre preselected they arrived and enrolled thats interesting isnt it they arrived and enrolled well theyre preselected people to begin with that theyre there tells you that so its not any cross section of the population at all this is very great minority of the population certainly composed of the upper tenth of the intellects of the world today so this is preselection and if those people coming into an hca course are showing any degree of nervousness theyre already people who have potential of aplomb on this particular subject and they get nervous now you start running them up along the line little bit further and you start getting them into the zones and areas of running the pcs goals and itsaing the pcs goals youll see them little bit nervous because theyre theyve now got further zone or area getting the read on the meter is source of nervousness not getting ta action they get nervy any of us dome you all of us and we sit there over session and we see that ta isnt moving man and hooah whawhatswhats going on whawha whatswhats the matter here whats the matter here whwhywhy didnt that run lie awake half the night why didnt i do that i wonder if ss mmm has got something to do with it wawawa and did i sowabbaba and this sort of thing well youre smart enough and bright enough and got enough aplomb to get up to that level to get nervous i think pavlov himself he probably would have gone into complete nervous breakdown he probably would have been howling if not slavering but theres your level youre dealing with preselected people and these people have tremendous amount of training even peoplenoncertified people who hang around an organization have tremendous lot of training and aplomb on this particular subject its quite amazing so youre dealing with specialized group specially selected and then these people are moved on up with further selection by advanced levels of training and theyre moved on uptheir confront their persistence look at the things that are required of one of these people you seethe things that have been required of you in actual fact and sticking with it and the disappointments and the upsets and the reasons why you shouldnt have and all this and the lack of success youve had with this one and that one and the trouble youve had someplace else and so forth boy if you dont think that isnt process of preselection you should take look at it someday just going on being in scientology see it has its rewards but it also has its liabilities and the liabilities particularly the last few years have been very great rolling along on research line mostly living on hope and the next and latest techniquethis sort of thing has taken its toll dont think otherwise and those that have survived this particular process and so forth are not to be congratulated that has nothing to do with it they have simply demonstrated the fact that they will obviously someday make ot its as simple as that dont you see all right now we walk along this line little bit further and were suddenly confronted with brandnew demands of auditing new style of basic auditing not too different but requires some neat adjustment of sitting in there as an auditor not taking the pcs itsa away from him and yet not abandoning the pc to his own itsa man you make that adjudication thats rough one to make you have to make it yourself at what pointat what point do you take over too much of the pcs itsa and at what point do you take over too little where is the exact middle ground of these two points discover it for yourself you will sooner or later the reason you have to discover it for yourself is it varies from pc to pc theres variation here its notdoesnt vary from auditor to auditor it varies from pc to pc some pcs are quite bright their perception of their bank is quite good and so on and you mess up their itsa youve really done something dont you see they know what theyre talking about they say there is cat sitting over there see and the auditor that doesnt pay any attention to this at all and doesnt weigh the fact with that particular pc is going to be in trouble similarly youll have pc he says there is eat over there and you can be absolutely sure that if thehe said so that proves it isnt the case see pcs are different hes maybe trying to make good show for the auditor hes not trying to look at the bank or itsa hes trying to put on an act oror theres lot of other wild factors enter in here well how much responsibility do you have to take for him and the reason you should learn to adjust this is as your pc moves on up the line to higher and higher case levels his perception gets better and better his ability to itsa gets better and betterdependent on whether or not you yourself have engaged in promotion of his ability to perceive have you increased his reality on his own bank and if you have and the case is rolling along the line nicely why he will wind up with higher and higher levels of responsibility for his own bank and finally running on to ot and going actually on down the track and knocking out gpms youll get to point where it would be very perilous to challenge the pcs perception of the matter i mean it would be just foolhardy not that the pc would do anything to you but its just foolhardy youre just making trouble pc says the next goal is to scat it rocket reads blows downthats the next goal thats your goals list see now if at this point you said well lets take list here and were going to list this thing out and so forth and hed sayhell keep saying why what do you want to list it for its sitting right there thats it thats to scat and he says the top terminalthe top terminal is those who scut and somebody who cant stand scutting nonscatter and your meters going wildwhat are you going to do at this point say weve got to go back and weve got to trace all this back and really well go back and well first do the goals list you see and we want fifty past the last rr and so forth and so on three sessions later your pcs going into decline you say whats the top oppterm he says oh to hell with you the horrible part of it is the same condition can exist apparently on somebody who doesnt have any gpms run out he says my next goal is to scat and there it is right there and the top oppterm is to play on piccolo and the terminal is to eat meat you buy this the pcs wrapped around not one telegraph pole it was something like sticking him out through train window as you were going by the telegraph poles you see so there is your there is this adjustment how much responsibility do you take how much of the pcs itsa you take and so forth well it changes not only from pc to pc but it changes in the same pc furthermore you can go reversewise the pc has had some bad loses his itsa can deteriorate for little while had some real bad loses you know some kind like this you ran out the present time gpm only it wasnt it and it shut off the rr you got him stuck you dont know where in what incomplete list this that the other thingsomething is wrong here case analysis is coming to the fore and the pc is all snogged up well maybe short time before you did that he could have itsaed it well but now that this has happened he cannot itsa for little while very well he cant spot these things he really doesnt know and he gets frantic and he gets wild and he starts giving you various ideas and hints and so forth of what you ought to do he starts giving you auditing directions which are based on unreality and you wrap him around half dozen telegraph poles toohaving wrapped him around telegraph pole dont you see wrap pc around telegraph pole and his ability to itsa will deteriorate that doesnt mean it wont improve immediately that you straighten it all out again but you have to make these allowances so not only different from pc to pc but plus and minus in the same pc and can not only improve but also deteriorate in the same pc so these are things that when you say this is exactly how much responsibility you take for the pc at any given instantwell how manyhowthis is the much the degree of responsibility you take for itsaing for the pc you see finding out and showing him what it is is not constant its highly inconstant varies session to session pc comes in with big present time problem hes been reliablehes been reliable as grandfather clockticktock hell call his shots all the time and he comes in this session hes got present time problem hes bit overwhelmed hes bit bothered by various things and in gesture of impatience or something like that why he gives you wrong datum youre very accustomed towell you havent estimated your pc for that session this is not something that takes great deal of study but it takes some experience its something you want to watch pcs run good and they run bad pcs run well in the morning session bad in the evening session see some pcs run well in the evening session and badly in the morning session see thatsit varies one day your pc who always runs badly in the evening session comes in and runs wonderfully in the evening session runs horribly the next morning so the final solution to it is you do what you have to do to get the case done right at any given instant of auditing and every moment of auditing is different moment of auditing than any other moment of auditing particularly in this business where you can produce change in pc you of course are changing the values by which you audit you ever look at that now some auditors back in the old days solved this by simply not changing the pc and theyd express it this way theyd say such and such process ran well on the pc so we will now run it and this is the only process we are ever going to run on this pc and of course the thinglong since flat you see i remember one time somebody long time ago ran on mary sueone of her auditorsran her for forty hours or more on i think failed to endure at the end of that period of time she sure was failing to endure very successful series thats because she happened to be running well on it at the beginning you see and then they didnt know how to shift their gears its happened to all of us at one time or another and also the reverse has happened is before process could bite the auditor had changed it see all these various casualties occur well these casualties occur by failure to estimate the state of the case at the moment the case is being audited the case is always different one moment to the next they are never the same case they are always different for one reason theyre in different period of time dont you see time has changed all right well lets get back to this problem of you audit the fat off the top ris and youve got r4 type case now it requires real genius to get any ta action off the case at all you see hes taken something that has fat left on it and is trying to find some fat and of course he has to be more and more adroit about the kind of fat he finds and he can get quite remarkably adroit at this it makes good basic auditor because at this particular time he of course is running into case that has fat to be run to amount to anything and he is yet running some so therefore the case is more liable to arc break and becoming critical of auditing so it works two ways and it makes fantastic auditor not only is there nonothing there to get ta action on but theres greater liability to the whole zone of auditing because hes more likely to get arc breaks and upsets in the session pc is more likely to develop present time upsets by reason of auditing so by the time you get through that preselection why youre practically screaming genius man now lets move into the field oflets move into the field of what happens after somebody has gotten up the track what happens theyre in position of doing r4 well at this stage of the game theyre probably trained theyre probably trained somewhat theyd certainly have to be trained further in spite of the preselections and other things that brought them up along the line theyd have to be pretty well grooved its almost grimly factual that saint hill will undoubtedly make more ots in the final run for various reasons data first on the firing pin and its being sorted out all the time theres terrific evaluation of this data reassessment resorting the data continuously occurring and so forth cases being very carefully adjusted and right here of course we have more people that know more scientology than any other place in the world naturally andon the staff and you get into preselected situation already by reason of technical knowledge and this is expressed right now that theres only abouti think there are four or five cases at this moment in the whole world that are headed directly immediately and straightly to ot without another quiver on the line i mean they couldnt be stopped just give them auditing and they will arrive see there are only that many cases in the world right now that are in that particular state and they are all at saint hill thats interesting isnt it so we can suppose that this area of dominance and forward progress will continue the best way and the most surefire way to get to be ot then is to be toprank auditor and that for various reasons you see including the aplomb it takes to confront the bank you have idea how mu we had somebody here i wouldi wont mention any names but we had one case that was running very badly i call case on the way to ot by the way who has had the first bank run out this proves it this proves the top gpm this squares it up first bank run out second bank coming up and that case is surely in the channel and on the road it isnt just that weve found somebodys goal and were fishing for the pt goal and that sort of thing i dont consider that case route yet it will take that case anything up to two years to get into this other situation anything up to that might only be month might only be two months just because somebody has found goal on this person is guarantee of anything but i might add this snide cynical and horrible comment there is one thing it is guarantee of that the case who has had goal found on him between that point and the first actual gpm run out finished and the next goal found between those two points is more hell upset and uproar than any being ever thought he would have to endure that is absolutely ghastly im talking now about actual empirical experience ive seen these cases now these arelack of technology is some of the explanation for the length of time in this one of these cases at saint hill had the top gpm foundimagine it it was the top gpmand its top ris listed for over the better part of two years i think more than that horrible the reason it could never make any progress is there werent any top itemsit was truncated bank and it never occurred to anybody to go down into the bank and run it as truncated bank technical of course has caught up with this type of thing but nobody ever suspected this was the pt gpm gpms have been listed for above it and below it and around it and discarded and ive seen goal after goal presented as something closer to present time on this case in the last few months and misery and bow and upset and so on andoh misery agony even when youve found the pt gpm that agony isnt over and so forth because one might miss couple of items in it and one might shoot that sideways now now the real trouble begins this is the toughest period of the case top gpm found will it run is it the top gpm and i myself have been knocked around for thirty days on just answering that question session after session misery after misery and so forth other things being found for it being found above it being found below it and so forth and then we found out that it had been run out how can you make mistakes like this well its very easy to make mistakes like this because the present time gpm is the one in which all persons present time problems sit and he has practically perception on it you go backyou go back ten gpms you can probably run one of those out pc wont run it with any reality and it wont do him any good and for gods sakes dont do it that would probably run with nice perception and everything going along swimmingly and you move up into the present time gpm all of his present time problems are sitting on this present time gpm now do you see what i mean about preselection because at any time during that period of finding goal and finding and running out the perst ptthe first gpm on the case life can become so horrible so unbearable so unlivable so many creaks occurring of various kinds whatsoever the fellows just liable to pack it up man raw meat wont stand there and they wont understand anything about it they wont have any hope they wont have enough confront to go through it little creak turns on well ive been audited and i dont feel so good so i dont think ill be audited anymore well let them go creak till the end of time who cares preselection didnt operate dere was many called and few was put into first bank now these are the facts these are the facts im giving you these arent any gilded thoughts of any kind these are just the grim horrible facts now once youve got the person into that first gpmyou know its the first gpm theres doubt about it whatsoeveryou can maybe for the next two gpms worry about whether or not it was the first gpm and be prepared to find two more above it at any given moment because the bank is liable to straighten out suddenly and so forth and you find yours but this is much moreless likely to occur than has been believed in the past and lot of case time and auditing time has been lost in taking the first gpm and then knowing it is the gpm checking it out and then for some reason or other not running it or not really handling it and even after running it not knowing whether or not it was it and therefore do something else to prove something else was it because this horrible datum has just emerged as very important datum and that is an actual goal invalidated will then behave like wrong goal its terrible i mean datum like thatthats terrible man think it over for moment an actual goal invalidated will then behave like wrong goal well you probably havent measured in everything there is to be measured into that simple statement because it means this that that invalidated actual gpm will now turn on the creaks and arc break the pc just as though it were wrong goal and just the way wrong goal would arc break the pc and when you say to the pc on the meter thats wrong goal because it reads that way weve found wrong goal thats wrong goal to spit thats wrong goal the pc will say oh well what relief proves it doesnt it he will feel relieved because youve just added more notis this is notis coming in see but he wont feel very happy hell go on being arc breaky around the perimeter here someplace but not on that one that ones all taken care of isnt it we knew that was wrong goal didnt we because every time we say its wrong goal it turns off the creaks and the pcs happy and cheerful and doesnt arc break now and every time it comes up and gets restimulated why the pc arc breaks so thats wrong goal so we just say its wrong goal and the pc doesnt arc break now and it straightens up beautifully so we obviously know what it is isnt that terrible thats why now youve got it contained in your lines where i gave you that program after you got through checking everythingafter you got through checking everything you know all the case analysis on the thing then you prepcheck everything you found thats why thats there thatsprobably youve been wondering well it was there just as an elementary caution to begin with but it was just my instinct that it ought to be there now ive found out why it ought to be there because you could have carefully with great relief to the pc laid aside an actual gpm as wrong goal in the case analysis simply because it was so heavily invalidated that it behaved like wrong goal now i dont know that the reverse is true but i would bei would expect now just by extrapolationi dont know that this is true or will hold true but this horrible specter might rise too that wrong goal is sufficiently validated to behave like right goal on the meter on case analysis pc has asserted asserted asserted and everybodys asserted and everybody knows thats the right goal and so forth and somehow or another its got now the value of being right goal while being wrong goal i dont know that that particularly will obtain but i would expect that sooner or later we might run into instances of this because if one side of it is trueif you can say that right goal is wrong goal and it will then thereafter behave like wrong goal you should be able to say that wrong goal is right goal and it will then behave thereafter theres only one thing wrong however with that second statement is any actually wrong goalits gpmor an actual goal run as an implant goal will turn off the rr just like that two items three itemsno rr falls nothing on the meter gone see this is the guy who wont get any tone arm action he wont get any meter action he wont go lah lah lah you try toso youre saved you see from making this second guessed at mistake because it shows up almost at once you wont ever run then you wont ever run wrong goal that i can absolutely guarantee you wont have any rr to run it with that simple youd have to sit there and just lie to the pc say oh well we found an item yeah we found another itemthe meter is absolutely frozen see it wont run so you never really will even though goal is an incorrect goal it could only be incorrect for its position it could never be incorrect for its wording you can sometimesyou can get items for an implant gpm you can get wrong line plot for an implant gpm without turning off the rr but you can take an actual gpm and try to run it on an implant pattern and it turns off the rr right now off goes the rr off goes the falls off goes the tone arm action that thing will just sticknot necessarily high tone arm or low tone armit just wontnothing happens now and the longer you try to run it and find items and so forth so the surest sign in the worldthis is sure you know like it is daylight when the sun comes up if you run wrong goal the rr or falls or any other meter action will turn off completely aside from the arc breaks of the pc so that one isnt dangerous what is dangerous however is that the pcs actuan actual gpm of the pc is so thoroughly invalidated you know by various thingsits so thoroughly invalidated that it now reads as wrong goal and so will be consistently discarded by the auditor he and the pc both know and agree by actual test that to spit is wrong goal and theyre going on looking for the next gpm in the line or the pt gpm or something like this and they can just go on looking forever because you see you cant find something in place where something you know isnt there is its these errors which take up time in r4 they are not in the broad analysis destructive theyre merely hell to live through hell for the auditor hell for the pc the pcs got nothing but screaming arc breaky sessions hes not getting any improvement his tone arm action is minimal he doesnt know where hes going he doesnt know what hes doing hes starting to itsa all in the wrong directions and dish up wrong data at every hand invalidate everything thats been found on him and knock everything out left and right and rearrange his data and hes getting into worse and worse condition the auditors sitting there tearing his hair out by the roots tone arm isnt moving ishe isnt getting falls his goals lists arent listing properly he cant find anything anything he does find today checks out perfectly and tomorrow is invalidated and wont check out and its all different and thuhthuhbuauah my godthat it should happen you see and theres absolutely nothing will ever be done to make it any other way thats horrible because that is the condition of auditing with the very best auditors and the very best trained pcs there are thats something to think about isnt it now you get square look at this many are called and few ever hit the top of the bank see that see given all the training given all the data given everything else it has great and wide liability it can be worked out somebody whos started in this line if hes had that much preselection all up along the line and enough training and so forth himself and so forth is not going to bail out until it is done but remember two years have elapsed of course the technology was not up to it in many instances and so forth but two years have actually elapsed between the actual finding of pt gpm and running that same gpm and the interim covered with trying to find the pcs goal trying to run the pcs goal trying to audit the pc and so forth that has actually happened and even with all the technology youre sitting there right this minute with it has been many months of very skilled auditor and very well educated pcmany months to finally sort the thing out finally and get it running we got better technology we can shorten the time but dont go around in the happy dream that it cant happen all the best training in the world makes it possible for it to occur at all see the best training makes it possible for it to occur this is exactly the state that its in see and even with the best training it occurs sometimes very smoothly and very luckily and very slippily just that morning you got up and you were wearing the right halo and you sailed in and for some cockeyed reason were actually able to bust through the line and really run it and it started running just figure it for what it is its high degree of skill compounded with phenomenal bit of luck thats what it is itsyou just got up that morning and youyour shoes were in the exact correct position alongside of your bed and that was it youre just lucky now this is sober look at all these things and i perhaps might sound to you as though im depressing your morale im not trying to depress your morale im trying to keep your morale from departing from reality and the reality of the situation is that if youre very good and if youre very well trained and if you know your business very well as an auditor and when as pc you are audited by very skilled very capable and very able auditor and you have great deal of luck you wont suffer many catastrophes get the level of action there you wont suffer many catastrophes up to the point of having the first bank found and run out and thats exactly your level of expectancy now the actual running out of the bank can furnish difficulty you can get into the fourth bank or something like that and all of sudden the pc invalidates the goal its out of session see the goal is for instance to be snob see and the pc says hey i dont like that goal ive neverno ive never been snobbish and so on theyre caught up somewhere up around the top terminal dont you see and they start dramatizing the top terminal which is an humble person see they say well us humble persons you know they dont know what it is yet us humble per we hate snobs you know theyre good and uhand so on and so on and so on or unfortunatelyunfortunately they see great big limousine going down the street with guy in top hat or something in it you see something keys them in suddenly that goal couldnt be my goal thatit couldnt be my goal and they come back inyouve got some items in this thing see already put them on the meter so forth check it out the pc nattering arc broke see nyah nyah nyah nyah you figure somethings wrong heresomethings wrong somethings wrong you check this thing out to be snob all right is that an actual gpm and is it in proper sequence andno read see is it an incorrectly worded gpm tick you see is it wrong goal you see clang you know it goes practicallyrocket reads you know all right is it out of sequence and so forththeres read its just wrong goal thats all there is to that see so you say all right now lets try to do and extend our little goals list that we were doing from the upper gpm at this moment you have sealed your doom for maybe the next two weeks of auditing itll look so reasonable to you and the combinations are so varied youll fall for it its inevitable you try to clean this thing up well did you think anythingknowing this we might shorten it down dont you seedid you think any invalidative thoughts about the goal lets get in the mid ruds on the subject of the goal on this goal has anything been suppressed blahblah blahblahblahblah and all straightened out and pc spends the whole time youre getting the mid ruds on it saying yeah but ive never been snob i never had goal like this i never had aso on and so on im ainot i couldnt possibly have had goal and so on and so on so even the mid ruds are converted into total invalidation of the goal see so this thingthis thing still reads wrong gpmmust be the pcs arc broke and you say well lets get the pc out of the arc break all right you say that is wrong goal and the pc will say whew boy thats relief see you add to the notis that theyre trying to pull off of course it complements it and so on now begins the silly rat race of trying to find the right goal which occurs in that place one after another we get three goals to read actually fire actually check out as an actual gpm see everythings awry now and we get one after the other and we startand we find their top oppterm and we find their top terminal and we lose the rr thats the end of that rr well it must have been wrong goal huhum so we throw that one away and we get another one we take the same goals list and we work and sweat over this goals list and the reason of course goals list will read if you work it over hard enough unbelievably hard under circumstance like this where youve already invalidated the correct goal on it youll find other items will start reading on the same list whether you extend it or not so you find another goal and you put it in the same place pc has eventually sold you to be humble see something like that motivated by the ri theyre sitting in only you dont know that and neither do they see top oppterm top terminal everythings going alongwell were really rolling now got beautiful blowdowns you see we get the third item up erk people who hate humble people i dont know what it says read lets conti extend the list little bit more that needle is just freezing its getting tighter and tighter theres less and less read theres less and less fall theres less and less tone arm motion well thats wrong goal all right we throw that one out see all right now lets find another goal that goes in this immediate area and so forth youre groggy the pcs bank is all messed up he couldnt he actually couldnt itsa bright red paint in front of his face by this time see youve got his bank looking like gpm pretzel and then sometime down along the linewe hope it will be in the next few months somebodys looking over this folderyoure looking over this folder or somebodys looking over it or you notice it and so forth the goal you were running ran seven items without turning off the rr must be right goal from someplace well we better orient the thing so we put in the ruds on it and we get it sorted out and we eventually straighten it out and all of sudden bang it was the right goal in the first place and the rr is beautiful and its on and everything is going along gorgeously and here we go now and we go on down and finish off and we find we were only two items from the bottom or something stupid see it isnt that that was that short gpm but let us say wed found eighteen items in it and maybe stopped on the last rissomething like this this sort of thing happens see the one thing youd never imagine because it all checked out everything checked everything checked but it read as wrong goal because it had been invalidated all right lets take the exact same situation remember were walking in the dark here these sixfoot rearview mirrors when weve got it all done we say of course but at the time were walking into it man that peephole in front is about onethousandth of millimeter in diameter and we are going up the line one way or the other here and we say who or what would to dance oppose and we get and it reads and everything is fineto not dance obvious the exact goal everything is fine so we take this goal and we run it and it doesnt turn off the rr pc is beginning to look mighty pale and the tone arms pretty high were not getting much in the way of blowdowns and the falls arent very pronounced but its running so we say well we wont make trouble for the pc we will go on and run this little bit further its all checked out everything is gorgeous you see and so forth and it gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse and were not quite sure what this is and the items start to look rather odd to us so we challenge the pc we say you arent listing the auditing question now you must list it yes he is he swears he is and hes getting the goal you see to not dance and taint running right though nothings running right its going to pieces tone arm actions degenerated tone arm high or low and pcs morale kind of bad theyre dragging around and they shouldnt be operating like this hard to find items hard to get them to blow down and have to prepcheck every item to get it to blow down and all kinds of stuff like this is occurring you see finally you get bright and you sayyou start looking at those items and gee you know those look like an implant line plot and hurrah hurrah it is it is and you check it over on an arc break and you get thisyou get tick your first clue maybe by just inspection which it probably should be but if you didnt get that youd get something like an incomplete goals list is the reason for the arc break well youve completed every goals list you can think of so why should it possibly be an incomplete goals list you see and so on we find out that there is gpm an implant gpm to not dance and the reason the rr didnt turn off is we were running an implant gpm and of course an implant gpm doesnt turn off the rr if youre running it so why should it if an imif youre running an implant gpm with the wording of an actual gpm your rr will go off you know you think youre running an implant gpm youre running it by pattern and youre trying to run the actual gpm by an implant pattern you wont have any more rr than rabbit but the other isntthe otherwise isnt true you found an implant gpm the only thing thats wrong with it is is youre just finding some misworded items in it and the rr isnt going off nothings going off thing is apparently running everythings going along all rightexcept it isnt running well at all the pcs pretty upset and so forth you got an incomplete goals list you go ahead and you did youryou finish up your goals list and so forth and youll find out that it was to be sad or something see and that was the right goal and youre back up at the top and youre on your way again how many auditing sessions did it take you to find this that is the question how many auditing sessions its actually as many auditing sessions as it took you that is the exact precise statement of time because it could take you anything up to thirty auditing sessions to get blunder what takes time in r4 is the mistakes youll find this time and time again the time consumer is the mistake you make the mistake youre in for it well that doesnt mean you should go on trying to be perfect all the time just be as good as you can and youll make as few mistakes as possible and lose the minimal amount of auditing time if you repair them as quickly as possible but this statement will still hold true that the time that is consumed in r4 is as result of mistake mistakes consume the time you make one blunder you buy the wrong goal there you go youve had it now actually if youd found the right goal you would have had the whole thing run out in the next session or two see would have been all gone and youd have been on your next list instead of that here youll be idling around fooling aroundnot for just this session but the next session and maybe the next session and maybe the next session with your pc getting less and less capable of straightening it out and you getting more and more confused and everything youre trying on as the error here you see is not working out dont you see and then youre invalidating things that are true you see and validating things that arent so that your analysis of the situation is getting poorer and poorer dont you see well of course you could say quite handily and possibly some day in future ages some instructor will say it well of course the thing to do obviously is not to make mistakes in the first place thats not possible thats merely snide not an obtainable perfection where absolutes are unobtainable that one is peculiarly so because it depends exclusively upon the pcs ability to itsa and the auditor auditing with the best possible talent technique attention to duty and so forth is sooner or later going to run into zone or area where the subitsa as represented by the pcs ability to itsa is very peculiarly shallow and hes going to hit that point and hes going to say well its this way and this way and this way and what makes this and hes going to be wrong but what makes this peculiarly true that younobody should go around saying well you shouldnt make mistakes in itwhat makes it peculiarly true about the matter is that the mistakes that you make are consistently trying not to make mistakes pcs running like welloiled dreamive done it myselfso you decide just to be sure we havent made mistake we will go back up and patch up and then find that the next four items i found in the patchup of the goal above it actually belong in the goal below it and we got pc wrapped around the telegraph pole and the tone arms sitting over here at five point fif id just kept my mouth shut and just gone on the way we were going all would have been well so you see you can strain so hard to not make mistakes that you wrap pc around telegraph pole ill give you an idea how you do this this is one of the reasons mistakes are impossible to avoid they are impossible to avoid in r4 because you have to do this but you mustnt do this see it runs like this you see all right is that an actual gpm all right that reads ill check it out the rest of the way is that an implant gpm is that gpm well those dont read its an actual gpm all right good pc is sitting there smiling happy everythings all ready to go you see you got it made now see youre all set all you got to do is say the last ri down to the next oppterm and get that list and youre away like the hounds you see after the red fox you see but you dont do that youve just got through wasting two weeks on this pc through having wrapped couple of telegraph poles around the pc and then the pc around the telegraph poles for good measure youre all set now so youre not going toyoure not going to get caught this time we know this now all right you mind if i check that again thisis this an actual gpm is this an implant gpm thatthat reads did you protest that well is this an implant gp gee thathat reads you know all right do youyouyou mind if i get theget the mid rudsmid ruds in on this goal and we come back and we check it again is this an actual gpm is this an implant gpm is this gpm is this only goal that reads all right lets get in the session mid ruds here just to make sure that everything is straightened up all right because weve got to be sure just uuuhwasted two weeks on this other gpm all right good enough now is this is aisis this aonlyonly goal all right thatthats fine now lets get inlets get in theseonly goal yeah well lets get inlets get in couple of buttons on the session mid ruds anyway and get these in in this session has anything been protested so forth so on so on so on so on so on all right thank you in this session has anything been decided all right all right all right good good all right now lets continue this goals list all right lets continue this goals list is that okay pc sitting there huh find it very hard to list and so on well justjust go ahead on this list has anything been suppressed well you sort of suppressed the idea that we already found the goal i thought the list was complete well all right fine got that thank you now all right who or what would to dance oppose all right pc obligingly gives you whole bunch of new goals meantime the actual gpm is all being beautifully suppressed then two weeks after that you suddenly remember that there was point where the pc was running well and you went back to it to see what was happening at that point and find out that you had the goal in the first place and the reason the thing changed from the read of actual gpm over to the read of an implant gpmthe reason that changedis because the pc was saying to himself and didnt bother to tell you why the hell arent we running it why arent we running this and he thought that at the time you asked the question is that an implant gpm this factually youll never recover you understand you dont get that datum back but thats actually what happened you were going to be very careful and you were going to doublecheck so the second time you checked it the pcs objections give you an incorrect analysis thats many complications in another case the reason why youre going to make mistakes and thats for sure is the pc is not ready to have an analysis done the tone arm is still moving the needle is still blowing down the pc is still cogniting on this goal see to be snob there it still goes pshewww every once in while youll see it go out from under you think it has now quieted down now actually the impingement of your voice on the bank of your voice on the pcs bank is enough to causeduring particularly blowdown period when waves of heat and that sort of thing are coming off the pcyour voice against the pcs bank is sufficient to produce rocket read well looklook the charge is blowing off see and every time it blows off you get long surge and youre watching that tone arm come down by long surgessporadic occasional surges well look it got down here to 325 and its all ready to blow down to 30 and all it does is need the slightest zephyr breathing upon it you see to trigger it you get the idea i mean its all set to be triggered if youd sat there just little bit longer and let it blow down all the way but you thought you estimated it properly its still got way to blow down dont you see pcs little bit introverted thinking about this thing of heshow hes zuh zuh zuhthisthis accounts for the fact that he can only have daimlers you see or something like this but he can never afford them and that sort of thing and really doesnt like them and so on hell say thats zuh zuh daimlers and so on and so on and so on and thats why i always went round with tall blond girls you see and so on so on and on and on and you know like this still very introverted you think the blowdown has stopped so you say all right were going to check this now is that all right with you and he wakes up oh yes perfectly fine life is wonderful you see in sort of foggy dopeeaters daze you see life is wonderful oh yes its all right and so on youoh you know best you know good old little auditor thats fine we got thiswe got this nice goal here to be snob all right now now good enough good enough now okay now is this an actual gpm hm theres read there you see all right is this an implant gpm what my goal an implant gpm see see rocket read on the protest and the triggered charge that goal will now continue to read as wrong goal and with all of the cares of observation and everything else that you can do you still cant avoid once in while making one of those wild everythingwasjustexactlywrongatthatmomentforyoutohave saidwhatyousaidinordertogetthatread see so anything that can make meter go out or any condition which will give you an erroneous read on meter is then susceptible to throwing out case analysis and your own efforts to straighten out case analysis are susceptible to throwing out case analysis and case analysis can be wrong in the first place all right those are the nerves with which you live at least know you live with them something like the gentleman who was going to teach his young boy his first lesson in business and sent him up to the top of stepladder and told him to jump that papa would catch him and so the little boy jumped and papa stepped aside and there was tremendous upset at this particular point and why didnt you catch he said that was your first lesson in business dont trust anybodynot even your papa all right now thats the way it isthats the way it is with your meter see thats the way it is with your emeter and yet if you dont trust it youll never get anyplace either these in actual fact are really the exact conditions under which r4 is performed so you see very clearly that if there are three zones of auditing basic auditing the technique or process as your second zone and case analysis is your third zoneyou see that with all these conditions occurring you havent got any time to be worrying about how you perform the technique or your basic auditing you havent got any time to be worrying about those things because all of that is going to be subtractive of the real and terrible liabilities of case analysis and the liabilities ive just been giving you are simply the liabilities of case analysis matter how carefully your basic auditing was performed matter how well you knew the technique matter for all of these things your case analysis is still liable to error and will always be liable to error because youre getting your case analysis from blind man who is lost in the dark and doesnt even know who he is where he is or what hes looking at even though hes perfectly well trained and beautifully educated in the subject to know the best blind man caught in the dark isnt going to be able to tell you the only thing thats going to be able to tell you is meter and that meter while when it reads is perfectly accurate what is it reading on were not quite sure of that and so from that point on we have time at all to be worrying about our basic auditing thats something you should be able to do you got headache you got backache you havent had anything to eat you feel dizzy you feel confused you are very faint you have just had terrible session yourself you are halfway through wrong goal and life is looking awfully grimyou should be able in the basic auditing division to turn in flawless session thats part of the preselection to be able to turn in flawless session theres excuse for not doing so why its very easy to do providing you can do it so there you are technique man this bank and this pc that youre facingto keep seven indian clubs in the air is simple action compared to getting them to sit there all assembled and not arc breaking and running down the wrong corridors and getting everything upset even though theyre trained and they know what theyre looking at and theyre well grooved in and their case is not in bad condition and theyve still got the ability to confront their bank to some degree and theyre not scared to be pc and horrified at what might happen to them thats still like keeping seven indian clubs in the air simultaneously see so your technique youve got to be able to sit there and dish off list goals listplaffploof who cares goals list fiftyodd down the line well write it upside down it doesnt matter see basic auditing going off perfectly goals list blahblahblah it doesnt matter and so on down the line all flawless perfectly every read recorded over here and everythings fine perfect but you havent got any time to worry about being able to do that youve got time at all to worry about any lets see how do i head goals list lets see how do i head goals list i was supposed to write the question up here i think yes lets see and how do i write this first goal down lets see im having an awful time keeping this where do you keep meter here write goals list youyou keep meter from out here so on and so on thatscant really see the meter itsits this cant really see the front of the meter while i write the goals list and so forthim notexcuse im having an awfully hard time trying to get this meter oriented its perfectly all right to have problems like that but lets have them all smoothed out before we get into the raw meat of running case see theres all kinds of interesting solutions that auditors make with regard to it the paper slides up this way and that way and they work these things out and they start subtracting things from the things they can record and keep track of for instance how much tone arm can you keep track of while doing goals list well i frankly cant keep track of much more than doing fall and blowdown while doing hot goals list on pc im doing very well to keep track of the falls and blowdowns and the amount of the blowdown and thats why you need counter and counter which wont subtract you the first counter that was developed by the way i rejected categorically because it distracted the auditor too much so you see at this point you have reason for the technique to be posing you any difficulties at all because youve got room for it thats all you cant be having trouble with technique how do you do goals list see how do you do an items list these things should not be an enormous puzzle to you otherwise they just take that much out of the session they cause you to make lot of mistakes in other words you got to have those things licked and this leaves this tremendous zone of case analysis and you should be able to think bank that certainly sounds funny doesnt it because bank is for thinking bank thinks bank pushes thoughts off on people so forth well theres another point of preselection you should be able to think perfectly and accurately about pcs bank which youre not looking at except through an emeter and by signs and data and youre thinking perfectly about bank and the bank is something that thinks and your bank also kicks around little bit while youre thinking about the pcs bank inevitably little bit and so the final analysis is thats enough trouble because that is big point of randomity and in auditing r4 that should be the only point of randomity is exactly what is happening with thiswith this bank i am handling exactly how is it going together what are the contributive data i have to make up my mind about the situations in this bank and that is plenty for you to handle i know it got plenty for to handle i dont i dont want to handle anything else but that see because thats plenty because thats the one that gets you mistakes and with perfectly free mind and with perfect education on the subject youre still going to make errors but if errors are the things that cause you to stretch the case out endlessly then we want to minimize these errors well the way to minimize these errors is with perfect training in the zones oddly enough of basic auditing and technique and then the elements of case analysis and with that threeway triangle there of training you can make ots and you can be ot because you only really get auditing of the level which you yourself give in the final analysis if you dont give good auditing why you actually dont tend to receive good auditing it isnt for the reason of the overtmotivator sequence its just the people who will coaudit with you i mean theres one point you see you can always get worse auditing than you give to some slight degree so if your auditing is pretty poor and the auditing youre going to get is worse than your auditing think what happens and that gets to be grim scene doesnt it in fact i can almost guarantee it youll always get slightly poorer auditing ordinarilyyou can view it safely from this viewpointthan you yourself give therefore if youre real whizbang your auditing you get wont be so bad now the training levels and so forth then and training is definitely definitely definitely part of the route to ot definitely degrees levels training this is something that its not nice to be part of this is something that is vital part of becoming ot and i would say that we have gone andweve gone up to new plateau here because youve noticed here in the last few lectures i have given you particularly ive been talking to you pretty straight from the shoulder about this sort of thing ive been giving you exactly what the score was and so on now the best reason for that is is there are several people rolling up thing right here at this moment on the goals channel going right straight to ot and there isnt any quiver on that line theres just the incidental mistakes of straightening out the goal and that sort of thing in other words we are on our way definitely and its from this factual data that one can view this other with aplomb our interest in the state of clear is so microscopic as to be yawn see its of importance at all the state makes somebody more comfortableso what you can make sick man more comfortable by putting pillow under his head see raw meatvery nice you can make them well good fine well worth doing theres nothing wrong with that at all you can make marriage run better and kid be happier and you can make life tenable and so forth but actually you have to know to audit well in that direction just to make life tenable enough for you to be able to go on through to ot thats necessary zone too actually nonscientologist is so surrounded by confusion that their present time is insufficiently calm for them to have any progress in the direction of ot these are other preselections and so forth many are called few are chosen there are many reasons why this track and path is limited track and path now it isnt going to say that eventually everybody wont make ot but certainly certainly and definitely and positively itll be very very long route for others and youll still be getting around to some hundreds of years thousands of years from now therell be somebody picking it up saying well lets see whats this thing called tone arm action now when you look up the line on that and get real view of the situation you realize where you are and where you sit youre right up in the front seat of the first breakthrough thats ever been made in this universe on the subject of the road out the way throughthat sort of thing youre right there youre fortunate to have moved up into the situation that youre in and the only thing i can ask you and point out to you is that youre in position where you shouldnt waste any of the potential which you have immediately at your fingertips you shouldnt waste any part of that the only thing i ask you to do is to make the most of what youve got ive tried to give you an outline of training its use and application and its relationship to state of case and future of case and i hope it has been of some assistance thank you
