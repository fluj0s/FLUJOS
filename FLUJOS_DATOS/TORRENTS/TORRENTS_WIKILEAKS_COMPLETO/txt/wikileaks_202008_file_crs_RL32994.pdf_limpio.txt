congress w ill consider in reviewing the districts appropriations for fy2006 the controversy surrounding funding needle exchange program touches on issues of home rule public health policy and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illega l drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the in cidence of shared needles opponents of these efforts contend that such progra ms amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drugaddicted persons with the tools to use them in addition they contend that public health c oncerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contaminated n eedles should be addr essed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the citys ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32994crs15 the

use of private funds for needle exchange program but it prohibits the use of both di strict and federal f unds for such activities at present one entity prevention works private nonprofit aids awareness and education program operates privately funded needle exchange program the fy2002 district of columbia appropriations act required such entities to track and account for the use of public and private funds during consideration of the fy2004 di strict of columbia appropriations act district officials unsuccessfully sought to lift the prohibition on the use of district funds for needle exchange programs senate provision wh ich was not adopted proposed prohibiting only the use of fede ral funds for needle exchange program and allowing the use of district funds the house and final conference versions of the fy2004 bill allowed the use of private f unds for needle exchange programs and required private and public entities that recei ve federal or distri ct funds in support of other activities or programs to account for the need exchange funds separately the presidents budget proposal for fy2006 included provision that would have continued to prohibit the use of distri ct

the programs eligibility criteria applied for scholarships the enactment of the program was conten tious and following the first year of implementation the program re mains controversial some of the controversy may be fueled by effects of the limited time for implementation following enactment the program has been criticized on several fronts including the participation of st udents and schools has not been as great as was anticipated sizeable percentage of firstyear scholarship recipients hadpreviously been enrolled in private schools mismatch between scholarship applicants and available slots inschools across the various grade vels with an oversupply at the elementary level and shortage at the secondary level and the 7500 scholarship amount does not meet the full cost of attendance for most secondary schools in reaction to some of these concerns pr oposals may be made to amend some of the terms and conditions of the opportunity schol arship program however given the early stages of the program and the evaluation component value may found in continuing the demonstration program in its current form before significant changes are made the house version of hr 3058 w ould
