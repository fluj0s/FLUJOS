6310c15 shspec312 essentials of auditing the relay of information from one mind to another is communication education therefore the arc triangle operates if you can take effort out of the comm line you can normally get fast accurate comm line but when comm line loses enough mass it becomes unstable that is what happens with verbal data line sometimes there is data on tapes but not in bulletins this is unfortunate since sometimes there is data in the tapes that could make all the difference but you cant hold duplicatable standard because it isnt down anywhere in writing with nomass data eg verbal data it gets altered in the relay there is always some data that escapes the solid comm lines so you cant get all the data for this reason you have to reduce things to their fundamentals keeping what is important you can always have communication of fundamentals both for educational purposes and because to reduce something to fundamentals makes one understand it better the relay of data from mind to mind b is susceptible to many alterises there are almost as many sets of alterises as there are minds for the data to be transferred through this also occurs on the timestream we probably have very little grip on what was thought in 1800 there was tremendous change in manners in the us because of the telephone movies radio tv and the automobile you can overload comm line by putting too great volume of data on it so that it doesnt communicate the door to learning can be shut that way too students sometimes feel overwhelmed by data and long for some fundamentals an overloaded comm line is overloaded because of insufficient time to peruse the material being communicated you can also have too little or too varied communication scientologys data is basically research data at present it is not yet sifted and clarified into fundamentals and less fundamental data we started with the definition of an auditor as one who listens and computes thirteen years later it turns out that listens is the fundamental not the and computes which was part of the original definition in the meantime lot of other data got added which in fact was only added because there was insufficient understanding of the original definition there is datum in the sciences subject has arbitrary data in it in direct proportion to its distance from the actual comprehension of its basics so you get into pure opinion and arbitraries as in art there is nothing actually known about subject when the subject is nothing but opinion opinion present is proportional to knowledge absent for instance when psychological testing requires the opinion of the tester you know that nothing is known developmental line is an ambitious selfcritical line which is trying to achieve parsimony of information the data keep condensing and becoming more fundamental with importances well evaluated this evaluation factor is missing in other philosophies eg that of krishnamurti krishnamurti on time is great but it is not evaluated for importance by him it isnt true that you are studying lrhs case the struggle has been to rise above ones case and the colorations given by the condition of this planet etc this has been quite successful whenever things get more fundamental bucketful of items drop out which can make one wonder what is stable from the past the stable data are the axioms the logics and prelogics the fundamental material of the philadelphia lectures and the behavior of thetan the only thing changed was the idea of exteriorization what will person do when brought to point where he doesnt have to be in body we used to think that he would move out of his body this is not what he will do he will move his body off of him because we have changed him upscale to where he could hold position the factors and arc triangle and scales of all sorts these are stable what has altered is applied technology not the theory better more efficient ways of applying the theory have been discovered it is reevaluation of data as applied tech that you are seeing and because you are studying to become an auditor not theoretician you need to know application what gives you headache if anything is trying to apply the theory to case so as to get result all your bulletins are addressed to this subject the data that you are using to square away an aberrated student or pc has to be absolutely fundamentally true the project 80 hcob actually hcopl 21aug63 change of organizational targets project 80 preview p 1 where scientology is defined as the common peoples science of life and betterment drew some criticism because of one phrase the common peoples science of the mind oddly enough this is the one inaccurate phrase in the bulletin the critics didnt spot that fact they just objected to the phrase the mind tends to fixate on those things that contain an alteris of truth and an alteris of truth is the thing that most resists the truth of the situation it is an aberrated stable datum where you have slightly altered truth that you try to give to someone who has already got an altered truth on the same subject the two will come into conflict which promotes all sorts of bad applied technology it is like trying to drive truck through truck when you have two alterised truths in conflict to try to understand an aberrated datum through another aberrated datum results in complications so if you are studying body of data that has any alteration from the fundamental that should be there and you have an alteration that is contrary to the altered datum that you are trying to assimilate you get dogs breakfast you never look at what is wrong with the datum that you are trying to assimilate the conflict wont resolve because you have vested interest in trying to make it fit with an aberrated datum you get conflict of aberrated data against each other overlaid with opinions you have pc who is gold mine of aberrated stable data if any datum which you are using to solve that case is the least bit curved the case wont resolve but will develop new complications therefore the mass of technology that grows up in scientology is centered around applied technology you get masses of data that subside when fundamental is clarified so the greatest possible truth has to be used in application hence research is directed at finding the clearest fundamental possible we have gone long way and have made great gains but we still have to cope with the randomity in the person who is assimilating and trying to apply the data if you in assimilation of data are assimilating to the slightest degree data up against miscomprehension or an allness which you are putting in place of the auditor you dont get an assimilation you have difficulty assimilating the data but you can assimilate the data your trouble comes when you turn around and take the data youve assimilated and altered in some fashion and then try to apply it to the case that is sitting in front of you the alterises in that data will then bring about nonresolution of that case you are confronted with the only solvent is truth even though absolutes are unobtainable truth in very refined form the purest possible is the only thing that will resolve cases all the way because it is the one thing that the aberrated case cannot argue with therefore you as an auditor desiring results have business twisting the technology there is fortunately considerable zone of tolerance that permits the tech to work even when it is imperfectly applied as long as you stay within this zone of tolerance but the tech has to be as nearly perfect as possible the tech heretofore was too imperfect ever to work it has been lrhs task to bring about recognition of fundamentals that is sufficiently great and tech that is sufficiently great to overcome lot of this alteris this task is thousand times greater than the task of simply presenting what is necessary to resolve the case we have to present if so accurately that the pc can still alter it and the auditor alter it and still have resolution of cases this is an heroic problem the amount of difficulty that you have with cases is directly proportional to the amount of aberration or alteris that you are adding to the data that you are trying to apply it is also inversely proportional to the purity and assimilatability of the material that you are asked to study that is tough one but it is pretty well handled the way you solve solutions is solutions wherever lrh has made little mistake or wrong emphasis there has been trouble because the additional alteris added by the auditor takes it far enough from truth to make it flukey to apply lrh in describing some horrendous auditing error says its good thing kids that im almost indestructible these things usually get done to first level iv makes an ot but it cant be varied 118th of an inch from its procedure and still work there was hole in it that appeared when it was imperfectly applied there are three types of goals that will rocket read 1 an actual goal with gpm connected with it 2 an implanted goal 3 an actual gpm any gpm can have in it up to hundred actual goals plus the goal of the gpm but there is another source of rocket read 4 phrase in an engram this wont necessarily rocket read but it might even pcs life or session goals can be free actual goals every now and then one will rocket read it is probably lock on an ri if you run it as an actual gpm goal you can even find items from the nearest implants or other gpms or locks but there was gpm there in the first place so when you find goal rocketreading you should check on the meter 1 is this an actual gpm 2 is this an implant gpm 3 is this gpm auditors have been asking is this an actual goal etc instead this can wrap you around telegraph poles because you will be trying to oppose it when it is lock on something and you can do this pulling things all out of place for awhile until the pc crashes in flames the three comm lines in session include the itsamaker line the pcs line into the bank the whatsit line and the itsa line it is an error to cut the pcs comm line to the bank in order to put in the itsa line this stems from misunderstanding of the auditors role as listener the error could also have come from failure to communicate the importance of the pc to bank itsamaker line since it was obvious to lrh that that was what auditing is all about he didnt mention its importance it is where the itsa line comes from without it the itsa line has nothing to carry the auditor is actually there to get the pc to confront his bank the charge blows off to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow the reason why that communication wasnt accepted or didnt go through is the reason why the auditor is having trouble auditing education is acceptable to technical end only when it is conceived pretty purely and relayed well technical data must 1 be conceived purely 2 be relayed well 3 be received accurately its test in scientology is results auditors can also have trouble because they have glommed onto some older datum and made it an all but there is this overriding fact that datum i give you is substitute for you thats the burning thing to remember as an auditor datum wont audit pc the only thing that can handle auditing is live thetan because that is all that can handle the complications that come up youve got to have technology but the live thetan in the chair is necessary to audit the pc
