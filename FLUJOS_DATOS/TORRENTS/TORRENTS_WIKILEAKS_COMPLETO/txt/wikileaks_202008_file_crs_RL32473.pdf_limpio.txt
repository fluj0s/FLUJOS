fy2001 in addition to the customary concern of sacrificing the opportunity for debate and amendment for greater legislative efficiency that arises whenever complex legislation is considered under time constraints the us of omnibus appropriations acts has generated controversy for other reasons these include whether adequate consideration was given to regular appropriations acts prior to their

109th congress reduced the numbe r of regular appropriations acts considered each year to 114 the number of regula r appropriations acts was increased to 12 at the beginning of the 110th congress due to further subcommittee realignment if action is not completed on all of the regular appropriations acts toward the end of congressiona l session congress some times w ill combine the unfinished

measurements of spending budget au thority and outlays the discretionary spending limits were enforced by the sequestration proce ss which involved automatic largely acrosstheboard reductions in

for fy1996 hr 3019 originated as an omnibus measure and retained this status throughout its consideration selected issues in the use of omnibus appropriations acts several issues pertaining to the use of omnibus appropriations have been the focus of debate in recent years including the extent to which the regular appropriations acts have received consider ation prior to being incorporated into omnibus legislation the use of acrossthe board spending cuts and the inclusion of legislative provisions prior consideration of re gular appropriations acts one of the chief concerns regarding the use of omnibus ppropriations acts is that it reduces the opportunities members have to debate and amend the regu lar appropriations acts that are incorporated therein this concern ma be lessened if the regular appropriations acts eventually incorporated into omnibus legislation are first considered individually during the fy1986fy2008 period the senate was more likely than the house not to have given prior cons ideration to regular appropria tions acts the house did not initially consider or considered but did not pass 18 of the 109 regular appropriations acts subsequen tly included in omnibus legislation these most often included regular appropriations acts fo r foreign operations and laborhhs education four times each and agricu lture and defense two times each during the same period the senate did not initially consider or considered but did not pass 52 of the 109 regular appr opriations acts subsequently included in omnibus legislation eight of the 52 meas ures were considered on the floor whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32473crs6 12 this topic is discussed in more detail in crs report rl32153 acrosstheboard spending cuts in omnibus appropriations acts by robert

discretionary spending limits and ad hoc budget agreements between congressional leader s and the president or to meet other purposes congress and the president from time to time incorporate acrosstheboard cuts in discretionary budget author ity into annual ppropriations acts12 during the six fiscal years covering fy2000fy2005 fi ve governmentwide acrosstheboard spending cuts were included in omnibus ppropriations acts in addition an across theboard cut was included in the defens appropriations act for fy2006 year in which all of the regular appropriati ons acts were enacted separately13 the governmentwide acrosstheboard spending cuts included in omnibus appropriations acts ranged in size from 022 to 080 of cove red appropriations and an estimated 11 billion to 35 billion in savings the 038 cut for fy2000 in pl 106113 saved an estimated 24 billion in budget authority the 022 cut for fy2001 in pl 106554 saved an estimated 11billion in budget authority the 065 cut for

rth in separate divisions of the omnibus legislation pl 108199 for example included tw other requirements for much smaller uniform spending cuts in nondefense programs 1 0465 cut in funding in the commercejusticestate appropriations division estimated to yield 1887 million in savings and 2 cut of 50 million in administrative expenses for the departments of labor health and human services and education further pl 108447 included three other provisions requiring acrosstheboard spending cuts focused on particular divi sions of the act 1 054 cut in the commercejusticestate appropriati ons division estimated to save 229 million 2 0594 cut in the interior appropriati ons division estimated to save 120 million and 3 cut of 18 million in the labo rhhseducation appropriations division applicable to administrative and related expenses for departmental management except for the food and drug administra tion and the indian health service the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 also employed acrossthe board spending cuts but they were not gove rnment wide instead they applied to six of the divisions of the act ranging in size from 025 legislative branch to 1747 laborhhseducation the office of management nd budget estimated total savings from the cuts excluding cuts affecting the legislative branch at 3357 billion in discretionary budget authority the significance of the spending cu ts differed with regard to budget enforcement the fy2000 cut was an integral component of the plan that successfully avoided sequester at the end of the ssion the fy2001 cut contributed to overall discretionary spending being below the statutory limits but the acrosstheboard cut proved to be unnecessary in avoiding sequester with regard to the fy2003 cut the house and senate did not reach agreement on budget resolution and the statutory discretionary limits had expired the fiscal year before nonetheless the acrosstheboard cut was n ecessary in adhering to an informal limit reached between congressional leaders and pres ident bush and avoiding veto of the omnibus appropriations act similarl the fy2004 fy2005 and fy2008 cuts were necessary to keep the costs of the measures under overall limits acceptable to the president although the acrosstheboard spending cu ts were viewed as essential elements in meeting budget enforcement goals so members criticized them as involving formulaic approach that undermined the process of making deliberate informed choices regarding appropr iate funding levels inclusion of legislative provisions although house and senate rules and practices over the decades have promoted the separate consideration of legislation and appr opriations the separation has not been ironclad in many instances during the routine operation of the annual appropriati ons process minor provisions are included in appropriations act s that technically may be regarded under the rules as legislative in nature but do not significantly undermine the dichotomy between legislation and appropriations at other times however the legislative provisions included in annual appropr iations acts especially omnibushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32473crs8 14 recent practices in this regard are addressed in crs report rl30619 examples of legislative provisions in omnibus appropriations acts by robert keithappropriations acts have been much mo re substantial and have represented deliberate suspension of the usual procedural boundaries14 in addition to the regular appropri ations for fy2003 for example the consolidated appropriations resoluti on for fy2003 pl 1087 included the agricultural assistance act of 2003 amendmen ts to the priceanderson act and the homeland security act and provisions d ealing with the uschina economic and security review commission among other legislative matters the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 pl 110 161 included such items as the emergency steel loan guarantee act of 1999 amendments the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and cont rol act of 1998 amendments the ed 10 act and the kids in disasters well being safety and health act of 2007 while the inclusion of significant legislative matters may represent an efficient way to conclude legi slative business as congressi onal session comes to an end it also may raise concerns about the adequa opportunity for memb ers to debate and amend themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32473 crs9 table 2 detail on omnibus appropriations acts fy1986fy2008 fiscal yearcongress
