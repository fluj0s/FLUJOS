work of large number of individuals within the government the united nations system and other organisations in dynamic process begun six months ago these individuals worked together to carry out the essential first phase of data collection and analysis for the future united nations development assistance framework 20062008 undaf this we believe has been an important learning tool for the entire united nations system staff it is with pleasure that we the united nations country team present this first cca for afghanistan in the hope that it will prove useful source of information for better

common country assessment cca reviews and analyses afghanistans development situation to begin to answer the question where can the united nations system have the greatest impact between 2006 and 2009 toward the overall goal of poverty reduction in identifying development challenges requiring priority attention during its harmonised programme cycles the united nations system and its partners clustered themes for analysis into four closely interrelated groups l governance and institutional development l peace security and justice l economic development and growth l social wellbeing all themes are key to helping afghanistan achieve the millennium development goals mdgs for 2015 which afghanistan has endorsed for each thematic area this document presents strategic analysis identifies root and underlying causes of key issues and assesses the factors for success providing recommendations for future areas of cooperation and underscoring the urgency of acting now crosscutting issue of note lies in conflict prevention postconflict reconciliation and peace building which underpins all four thematic areas and must be mainstreamed in each in the area of governance and institutional development key issues included l democratic accountability and the rights of the citizen l participation in political processes and social inclusion l corruption l public administration reform l decentralisation and devolution l ensuring positive role for the media under peace security and justice issues that were assessed included l explosive remnants of war l continued power and influence of nonstatutory armed forces along with the persistence of incidents of armed violence l contested allocation of resources l cultivation of poppy l dysfunctional formal justice system and preference for traditional justice mechanisms l social violence and lack of social protection economic development and growth analysed issues of l employment the right to decent work l distributive justice the right to human dignity and gender equality l using natural resources sustainably managing disaster risks effectively lastly social wellbeing looked at availability of and access to l the right to education l the right to health l the right to food overall root causes of these key issues were traced to the following l underdeveloped human rights culture along with lack of traditions of democracy statebuilding and civil society participationl young governance structures still in the process of establishment andor early stages of development and unable to curb political insecurity l shortage of human resources that can propel democratic economic and social reforms l wide variations in socioeconomic indicators by gender region and ruralurban divide l weakened social infrastructure l sociocultural traditions that result in widespread marginalisation based on gender social status or ethnicity l culture of unsustainable resource use that must be reversed l obsolete industrial and agricultural techniques and practices that harm the environment complete summary of the findings of the cca is available in annex based on the analysis three broad areas have emerged in which support for the transition of afghanistan can be concentrated these are l human rights and peace building l good governance and participatory development l basic social services and environmental sustainability the main criteria for proposing these areas of cooperation are priority needs potential for longterm impact on national goals and priorities lessons learnt and good practices and opportunities to strengthen both national capacities and international cooperation the three areas will be coherently reflected by individual agencies in their mandated activities within the undaf the focus of human rights and peace building will not be on emergencies as such but rather on longerterm peacebuilding 1 this can include support to creating the knowledge skills and values for human rights culture significantly improving gender equality expanding counternarcotics measures enhancing the rule of law and ensuring more equitable allocation of resources particularly through enhancing conflict resolution mechanisms and access for the poor and vulnerable building national ownership and national capacities both within government and civil society will be emphasised meanwhile different concepts of good governance can be accommodated within durable structure of pluralist democracy grounded in civic rights the latter also constitute vehicle for ensuring minority rights through good governance and participatory development the united nations system can assist in this process both by helping to solidify the governance agenda as well as by supporting number of initiatives to consolidate democracy in the course of the afghan transition this can include support for the fight against corruption strengthening of civil society institution building and civil service reform enhanced pro poor policy frameworks and accountability and monitoring of the public sector finally under basic social services and environmental sustainability the united nations system will support measures essential to allow people to lead long healthy and creative lives to enjoy decent living standards and freedoms and to possess dignity selfrespect and respect for others these can include education health family planning and nutrition the environment mitigation of natural disasters and social protection consequently as the united nations system moves forward with development of the undaf the focus on the poor and vulnerable as well as on duty bearers including the state will be more deliberate this approach also will be highlighted in united nations involvement in the world bankled poverty reduction strategy prsp process what this implies is more concerted explicit engagement of domestic and international partners nongovernment organisations ngos and civil society families local governments and communities the business community the media and academia in so doing the united nations system can help afghanistan stand firmly among democracies of the 21st century1 peacebuilding is used in this context as aimed at preventing the outbreak the recurrence or continuation of armed conflict and therefore encompassing wide range of political developmental humanitarian and human rights programmes and mechanisms united nations security council presidential statement 20 february 2001 51 2country backgr ound afghanistans geopolitical role as the centre of global interchange was well established more than century ago and it is strategic role that continues to exercise considerable influence today this starkly beautiful countrys recent history marked by civil war soviet occupation mujahidin resistance fragmentation of power the rise of islamic extremism and continued military coalition presence still makes it pivot for international relations thus the entire world has strong interest in afghanistans reconstruction longerterm development and avoidance of further conflict following the last quartercentury of turbulence afghanistan is working to rebuild secure state that can reduce poverty for its people it is powerful yet urgent challenge in the new national human development report afghanistan ranks as the worlds seventhpoorest nation devastating figure 2 moreover its poverty is deeply entrenched even before the 1979 soviet invasion the countrys development indicators were very low now human security based on the full realisation of the human rights of the afghan people must be significantly expanded so stability may thrive low incomes sociocultural traditions that severely restrict womens opportunities poor quality of education continued threats from the burgeoning drug economy and criminality are mutually reinforcing in response eliminating vulnerability improving social services delivery strengthening democratic institutions establishing participatory development all will lead to more stable afghanistan this will help not only to formulate propoor poverty reduction strategies but also to fulfil human security despite myriad of challenges before stability is assured afghanistan has hope education is again priority for girls as well as boys with 4 million children thronging back to school with an improved political situation an estimated 36 million refugees have returned nearly onefifth of the population and 700000 internally displaced persons idps have come back to their homes largescale infrastructure projects have been undertaken to stimulate economic growth perhaps most importantly path toward democratic self government has been laid out starting at the bonn conference in 2001 new constitution was signed in january 2004 and the nations first presidential elections were held in 2 national human development report undp 2004 p 2 afghanistans human development index value is 0346 at the bottom of the low human development countries with gender development index gdi of only 0300 reflecting the level of equality or inequality between women and men afghanistan ranks just above one country introduction 4for each thematic area this document presents strategic analysis identifies root and underlying causes of key issues and assesses the factors for success it provides recommendations for future areas of cooperation and underscores the urgency of acting now crosscutting issue of note lies in conflict prevention postconflict reconciliation and peace building which underpins all four thematic areas and must be mainstreamed in each meanwhile the government committed to the mdgs in march 2004 and has progressed in key areas of the millennium declaration such as gender equity expanding the base of political and social freedoms and revival of the media moreover its key policy document securing afghanistans future takes an explicitly mdg based approach afghanistan has the potential to meet 10 of 11 mdg targets 5 although the state of the supportive policy environment is weak to fair in relevant areas 6 this must be further qualified however by the prerequisites of attaining human security and continuing strong international assistance for at least the next 10 years full compliance with commitments to the major international conventions signed and ratified by the government also will promote greater respect for the rights of all the cca process and partners the ccaundaf process was launched at meeting of the united nations country team unct in afghanistan in may 2004 steering committee chaired by the resident coordinator and comprised of the heads of undp unfpa unicef wfp unhabitat who and the world bank set up thematic groups on the four priority areas outlined above nearly all resident united nations agencies appointed focal points andor participants the government was invited to join the process in june 2004 as were other stakeholders total of 19 ministries and government departments participated as well as the national security council the afghan independent human rights commission the afghan investment support agency the microfinance investment and support facility for afghanistan the supreme court the law faculty of kabul university the chamber of commerce and 14 nongovernment organisations ngos and civil society organizations twenty nonresident agencies also were invited to participate and asked to share an overview of their current engagement in afghanistan 7 the four thematic groups held frequent meetings where members identified additional issues for review and corresponding indicators and carried out their analytical work drafting of inputs to the cca document began in augustseptember 2004 8 followup the united nations country team and the government of afghanistan will refer to the cca to consolidate the process of human rights and mdg monitoring at the country level and to follow up on implementation of united nations conventions and agreements it also will be used to ensure that data gaps and research needs will be systematically addressed through programme and projectspecific components by all organisations through the poverty reduction strategy prsp process it will assist the united nations system and the donor community in aligning coordinating and monitoring assistance strategies and budgets for poverty reduction at the national level ultimately the analysis of the cca rests on the concept that it will complement the governments vision behind national policies that is the achievement of climate conducive to poverty reduction human rights and human security 3 securing afghanistans future accomplishments and the strategic path forward transitional islamic state of

international human rights instruments but given decades of conflict it has not been able to fulfil its reporting obligations under the ratified human rights treaties the government has however

for development and thematic indicators to provide further insights into issues of major concern for development including specific country settings national priorities and needs and crosscutting issues in pursuit of human development 189 united nations member states including afghanistan have adopted the millennium declaration setting out key development challenges facing humanity and outlining measures for gauging performance eight timebound goals have been identified for combating poverty hunger disease illiteracy discrimination against women and environmental degradation the millennium declaration also pays special heed to all nations responsibility to protect the vulnerable particularly children and civilian populations october 2004 all these developments properly managed contribute to the overarching goal of poverty reduction at the same time afghan women and girls continue to struggle to exercise fundamental rights to health education work freedom of expression and freedom of movement considerable disparities among different social groups and across different regions of the country bring the continuing need for vigilance in development to the forefront huge amounts of external assistance are required to help afghanistans reconstruction estimated at us276 billion over the next seven years 3 if meaningful poverty reduction is to occur in the long run the experience of afghanistan may show whether the international community can sustainably assist fragile country as it rises from the aftermath of conflict equally important the capacities and potential of the poor themselves must be fully tapped to unlock the potential of afghanistan as whole only then will afghan voices be heard as they should objective and scope of the common country assessment the common country assessment cca reviews and analyses afghanistans development situation to begin to answer the question where can the united nations system have the greatest impact between 2006 and 2008 toward the overall goal of poverty reduction the multidimensional character of poverty indicates that its incidence in afghanistan remains high although specific data remain scarce and variations among regions are wide see also who are the poor in afghanistan while the cca identifies the key challenges to tackle poverty reduction the united nations development assistance framework undaf which follows it will put forward common response to select number of those challenges both processes are intended to strengthen the contribution of the united nations system toward achieving the global millennium development goals mdgs and maximising the potential of afghanistans women men and children because poverty most often results from the denial of human rights 4 through discrimination marginalisation or unequal access to education health or resources the guiding principle behind this cca is rightsbased human development those living in poverty are often vulnerable to further human rights violations therefore focus on human rights will help ensure that key concerns of the poor become and remain key concerns of poverty reduction strategies the legal obligations for duty bearers particularly the state that this involves in turn enable the people to demand accountability strengthening good governance and the rule of law in particular the cca examines impediments to fulfilment of rights to survival livelihood protection and participation for the poor and vulnerable it then lays out opportunities required to guarantee basic rights for all afghans and identifies the united nations systems niche in identifying areas requiring priority attention during its harmonised programme cycles the united nations system and its partners have built on national development priorities the global mdgs and the united nations experience and proven competitive advantage the most crucial themes for analysis have been clustered into four closely interrelated groups l governance and institutional development l peace security and justice l economic development and growth l social wellbeing5 6who are the poor in afghanistan poverty in afghanistan is complex involving low assets physical financial and human years of insecurity and drought cultural traditions and poor infrastructure and public services most of afghanistans estimated 245 million people particularly women and girls remain severely challenged in terms of human development more than 1 in 5 afghans cannot afford food consumption level of 2070 calories per day which in many circumstances defines the poverty line the highest maternal mortality rate in the world is found in the northeast of the country and despite significant recent advances in girls enrolment 2 out of 3 girls are still not in school only 4 in 10 afghans have access to safe drinking water around 1 million people have disabilities 25 percent as result of war finally large parts of the country are still under the control of commanders and warlords and out of reach of assistance despite urgent needs the following table shows the magnitude of the gaps between todays social indicators and the global mdg targets for 2015

political institutions especially those that prevent the efficiency of legislative activity appropriate administration of justice and participation of the poor in defining policies may be related to factors that have caused poverty to persist the millennium declaration recognises this and represents the strongest most explicit and unanimous statement of united nations member states in support of democratic and participatory governance it articulates that the interlinked goals of poverty reduction the mdgs and the protection of rights to survival livelihood protection and participation must be achieved through good governance encompassing power that is effective honest equitable transparent and accountable this will ensure not only the full enjoyment of political rights but also meaningful economic development and improvements in standards of living in both rural and urban areas in afghanistan issues of governance and conflict also are intricately related support to governance factors such as participatory decisionmaking strengthening of civil society and public administration reform thus will have implications for reducing the outbreak of violent conflict strengthening efforts at poverty reduction progress has been made toward establishing central government through the 2001 bonn conference and two loya jirgas grand councils traditional governance institution these set out the formation of the transitional government after the fall of the taliban agreed upon schedule for permanent elections and adopted the new constitution which recognises women as equal citizens now accountability of the public sector and political authorisation by the people is emerging through the budding democratic elections process reflected in the high voter turnout including the wide participation of women in the october 2004 presidential election 9 even so civil society as vehicle for participation is severely underdeveloped more than 50 percent of rural afghans in selected provinces have knowledge of the new constitution 10 overall ngos are relatively recent in the afghan context large number deliver shortterm emergency and reconstruction assistance and thus act more as private contractors than as genuine civil society fora fostering popular participation and social 1 9 the joint electoral management body jemb finalised list of 18 candidates for the presidential election and registered more than 105 million afghans as prospective voters 582 percent men 418 percent women at the time of writing this figure is still preliminary and subject to change given that the electronic counting of registrations by the data center had not been completed 10 human security and livelihoods of rural afghans 20022003 feinstein international famine centre tufts university june 2004 p 810 national policies and priorities in governance are laid out in the national development framework ndf which articulates clear vision of the role of government as limited to providing only essential services under the ndf the government has developed number of relevant programmes national solidarity programme nsp l participatory governance policies can well be illustrated by the nsp which was developed to reduce poverty by building the ability of communities to identify plan manage and monitor their own development projects l the nsp promotes new development paradigm whereby communities are empowered to make decisions and control resources during all stages of the project cycle in accordance with government policy the programme is expected to make local governance more representative eg for women ethnic minorities returneesidps and to provide assistance for community reconstruction and development l the nsp aims to establish framework for highly inclusive villagelevel consultative decision making through community meetings and development councils this process will serve as basis for interaction within and between communities as well as among communities the central government and aid agencies afghanistan stabilisation programme asp l the asp offers an integrated strategy for addressing security governance and reconstruction challenges at provincial and district levels and is designed to make urgent changes to the way provinces and districts are governed it intends to reestablish basic security and good governance at district and provincial level through sequenced coordinated projects l through one of the asp subprogrammes the provincial stabilisation fund decisionmaking is decentralised and governors are provided with capacity to address priorities in their provinces and to plan and implement projects initially it intends to cover 158 districts by the end of the current afghan fiscal year 21 march 2005 the second phase in the course of 2005 aims at addressing the rest of the countrys districts public administration reform par l the par strategy provides framework for programmes and projects that will build sound legal administrative and physical environment for efficient effective public service in which civil servants can be held accountable for their performance l the par covers these major components civil service legal framework personnel management institutional and functional streamlining and development financial management and machinery of government administrative efficiency and improvement of government physical infrastructure l the document securing afghanistans future presented to donors in march 2004 describes decade long plan to build civil service that is better equipped skilled and managed while more representative of afghan society ambitious targets include meritbased and transparent system of civil service appointments that will cover 90 percent of the system by march 2015 another goal is to increase the percentage of civil service staff based outside kabul currently 63 percent in order to decentralise and provide services to the provinces and districts for its strategic vision of economic management public administration and technical assistance the government is requesting us201 million this year and us11 billion over sevenyear period l within the par strategy the government in 2003 launched the priority reform and restructuring programme prr which rationalises the responsibilities of employees and labour market pay scales more than 41 departments in ministries had their priority restructuring and reforming plans approved by september 2004 national urban programme nup l through good urban governance and management this programme aims to establish network of dynamic safe liveable urban centres that are hubs of growth and arenas of cultural and social inclusionnational policies and prioritiesorganisation in particular serious limitations remain on participation of women in political and civil affairs representing direct obstacle to their rights and human security as well as to nationbuilding and poverty reduction 11 regional military factions conservative religious leaders and insurgent forces are limiting womens participation in society through death threats harassment and physical attacks 12 meanwhile afghanistans civil administration has little reach beyond kabul given that local commanders retain control of vast regions administrative arrangements remain highly centralised politically fiscally and administratively the central government suffers from overlapping functions serious lack of skilled professionals severe gender imbalance low pay and lack of meritbased recruitment 13 14 many policies are not yet welldefined or propoor and capacity for oversight and enforcement by government institutions is lacking at all levels often the central government makes policy decisions for provincial and districtlevel administrations15 at the same time good governance also is critical for ensuring that cities function well and are engines of growth with decentralisation leading to devolution of power serving as key component for poverty reduction number of reform initiatives are under way largely within the framework of the public administration reform par programme in its landmark investment programme securing afghanistans future the government describes decadelong plan to build civil service that is better equipped skilled and managed while more representative of afghan society concerted efforts must be supported to provide an enabling environment for all of afghanistans ethnic minorities with regard to participatory governance given that ethnic politics has long held sway in the country another important area in which the government must take full ownership is the reintegration of the millions of refugees and idps who have returned to their places of origin since 2002 afghans represent the secondlargest number of refugees and idps in the world longterm mainstreaming policy for returneesidps is critical despite considerable developmental and economic absorption challenges this should include integration into democratic participation given that return and reintegration are not solely humanitarian issues 2 analysis of key issues and underlying and root causes the cca analysis is synchronised with national priorities see national policies and priorities box and the united nations system is supportive of government efforts toward governance and institutional development particularly the national solidarity programme the afghanistan stabilisation programme the public administration reform programme and the national urban programme analysis has identified the following key issues all of which relate to good governance l democratic accountability and the rights of the citizen l participation in political process and social inclusion including gender equality and civil society partnerships l corruption11 loccit 12 between hope and fear intimidation and attacks against women in public life in afghanistan human rights watch october 2004 p 1 13 securing afghanistans future opcit public administration reform and economic management technical annex p1 14 within the 12 pay grades for civil servants average total compensation at the highest grade is only 12 times higher than in the lowest grade pension levels are negligible many mid and lowerlevel government employees have left their jobs 15 the road ahead issues for consideration at the berlin donor conference for afghanistan centre for strategic and international studies march 2004 p 9 12l public administration reform l decentralisation and devolution l the role of the media duty bearers that hold an obligation to fulfil these entitlements are primarily state actors and institutions at various levels of the governance structure as well as nonstate actors including civil society itself that can influence the rights of others the root causes for the above challenges in afghanistan which are interlinked arise from l an underdeveloped human rights culture along with lack of traditions of democracy statebuilding and civil society participation l young governance structures still in the process of establishment andor early stages of development and unable to curb political insecurity l shortage of human resources that can propel democratic reforms l wide variations in socioeconomic indicators by gender region and ruralurban divide l weakened social infrastructure l sociocultural traditions that result in widespread marginalisation based on gender social status or ethnicity 2a democratic accountability and the rights of the citizen in constitutional system democratic accountability is relationship in which power wielders are accountable to broader public weak democratic institutions thus perpetuate weak system of accountability 16 in turn leading to lack of realisation of human rights and the inhibition of poverty reduction accountability also involves enforcing individual compliance to fiduciary standards and ensuring transparency and public access to information while democratic accountability addresses the effective exclusion of women minorities and the disadvantaged corruption commanderism drug trafficking and smuggling add to the difficulty in ensuring such values in afghanistan specifically there remains accountability for the violations of womens human rights17 that are longstanding aspect of afghan society an important player however has emerged in the form of the afghan independent human rights commission aihrc which has established itself as the leading monitor of rights and investigator of abuses and violations18 the commission is the first independent organ in afghan history to ensure that national legal codes are in harmony with international conventions it is result of the 2002 afghanistan national human rights plan which incorporates national plan for human rights education based on analysis three key challenges have been identified as underlying causes inhibiting democratic accountability and infringing on the rights of the citizen these include l challenges to credibility of political processes l challenges to separation of powers l lack of capacity within civil society to monitor government and hold it accountable for its acts 1 challenges to credibility of political processes analysis of the three most recent major political processes the two loya jirgas and the runup to the presidential elections reveals that democratic accountability remains constrained controversy erupted over the delegate selection process at the emergency loya jirga some delegates complained of threats by commanders and extremists and about 70 walked out to protest what they termed lack of free vote19 according to some observers the course of this loya jirga demonstrated that powerful forces inside and outside the country are still categorically opposed to democratic accountability20 in addition vetting processes with regard to prosecution for human rights violations need to be in place for election candidates presidential and parliamentary members of the cabinet and civil servants which will further increase public accountability 2 challenges to separation of powers currently elected legislative body exists so the executive branch both proposes and implements laws reports exist of repeated violations of the independence of the judiciary by members of the executive branch21 3 lack of capacity within civil society to monitor government in the absence of an elected legislative body strong civil society would function as the peoples primary monitor of government constraints on the capacity of civil society are fully reviewed below 2b participation in political processes and social inclusion civil society in afghanistan is weak traditionally afghan society centred on family tribe and community and political and social authority were embedded in the institution of jirga or shura which included only adult men now need exists to stimulate participation in governance through civil society activities and organisations in order to generate legitimate demands articulate social needs and enhance state accountability in realising basic rights22 among the most promising platforms for promoting good local governance in afghanistan is the institution of community development councils cdcs established in 34 provinces under the national solidarity programme nsp as community selfmanagement structures with regard to prioritising developmental needs thus far cdcs appear more representative and proactive than traditional jirgasshuras and they have greatly increased the opportunities available for womens participation in village life womens participation in nsp community development councils cdcs source gtz september 200416 the government has begun to put in place elements of legal framework to ensure that civil servants are accountable for the execution of their duties and draft ministerial code of conduct is soon to be adopted the proposed public finance and expenditure management law also provides specific penalties for any civil servant who uses his or her position for material gain or otherwise abuses it proposed procurement law is expected to have similar provisions 17 womens rights in afghanistan report of rights and democracys mission to afghanistan september 2002 p 5 18 nojumi

groups religious networks and voluntary associations interest groups encompass nongovernment organisations ngos professional womens and youth groups student associations and political parties 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 36 proportion of established cdcs with female members27 nsp villages with parallel female cdcs13 14although much has been achieved since the fall of the taliban major challenge remains in the enactment of new constitutional provisions the nsp and the scheduled elections are two new mechanisms that constitute channels for participation in democratic governance particularly for rural women with regard to voter registration the percentage of female registration has been higher than expected although in some traditionally conservative southern provinces such as kandahar women comprised less than 10 percent of registered voters23 upcoming parliamentary elections may represent significant test of afghan womens ability to exercise their political rights many women say they expect to face threats from commanders and their supporters if they run for parliament24 based on analysis three key challenges have been identified as underlying causes that prevent the full enjoyment of rights of participation in political processes these include l consequences of the lack of human rights culture l lack of policy framework as well as lack of capacity l consequences of gender inequality 1 consequences of the lack of human rights culture democratic habits must be institutionalised to make representative government work this includes majority rule working toward compromise solutions respect for the civil and political rights of other individuals and respect for minority rights the political rights verification process 25 found nationwide pattern of selfcensorship among political formations which often are not willing to take advantage of freedoms under the constitution for fear that they will suffer reprisals26 this tendency is reinforced by the dominant role of commanders or misguided approaches to political activities which has resulted in an inability to build on political momentum 2 lack of policy framework and capacity to date policies and legislation have not been formally adopted to enact the constitution with respect to empowering civil society27 in general ngos suffer from lack of regulatory framework and coordination mechanisms marked fragmentation and lack of capacity contribute to ngos lack of influence when it comes to decisionmaking 3 consequences of gender inequality those who have the ability to participate in democratic governance are few and mostly limited to urban areas rural women especially lack awareness of governance issues many still do not have full understanding of their rights knowledge of how to participate in complex economic and political processes or how to hold their leaders accountable28 in numerous cases freedom of expression in terms of speaking freely about womens rights issues or dressing according to ones preference remains elusive given the extent of intimidation by armed factions and political or religious leaders29 lastly traditional stereotypes prevent the public including women themselves from recognising womens leadership capabilities women therefore are rarely appointed or elected to high positions 2c corruption corruption undermines social confidence in the willingness and capacity of public institutions to fulfil their obligations to the people likewise it reinforces existing power relationships that are themselves typically part of development problems corruption also promotes poverty because it deprives disadvantaged sectors of muchneeded programmes and environmental stewardship due to financial losses of the state afghanistan has

years on international assistance to rebuild such aid may not be forthcoming if donors fear it will be lost to corruption nor will the nation benefit as it should if aid is wasted in this manner30 the presence and perception of corruption permeate many areas of governance in afghanistan of notable concern are the suspected close links between corruption and the drug economy as well as other criminal activities31 while there is systematic data on corruption recent typology 32 estimates corruption within both formal and illegal private sector activities as high this includes payoffs to officials to avoid taxes and licensingplanning regulations as well as bribes by those involved in narcoticsrelated activities and arms and human trafficking the typology estimates corruption associated with the public sector is also high in connection with procurement ghost employment and patronage positions corruption is believed to be high as well in captured areas of the public sector under warlords or commanders who maintain parallel governance structures in march 2004 the government established an anticorruption department based on analysis two key challenges have been identified as underlying causes of corruption which denies the rights of the poor by discriminating against them in access to services among other negative aspects these include l absence of legal and regulatory systems and efficient enforcement as well as absence of institutional structures that encourage accountability transparency and information sharing l low level of salaries in the public sector and delays in payment 1 absence of legal and regulatory framework and efficient enforcement as well as absence of institutional structures that encourage accountability transparency and information sharing in general regulatory systems and enforcement are very limited in both the private and public sectors this as well as the extent to which the public administration police and judiciary appear affected makes enforcement practically impossible moreover the overarching structures that allow for efficient regulation are lacking few exceptions are noteworthy such as in late 2002 when president hamid karzai sent delegations to investigate corruption in different parts of the country and sacked small group of officials in line with the delegations findings 2 low level of salaries in the public sector and delays in payment recent reports show that civil servants as well as law enforcement and judicial personnel experience delays of several months or more in receiving their salaries lack of timely payment does not necessarily lead to corruption but low intermittent pay is an important contributory factor the tendency toward corruption is reinforced by large amounts of money that can be made through smuggling extortion and trafficking 30 rubin summary of papers on anticorruption measures in the constitution of afghanistan centre on international cooperation new york university

system office of the high commissioner for human rights july 2004 p 8 32 ibid pp 4344 15 162d public administration reform overlapping of functions between ministries and between central and local government hinders successful implementation of policies diminishes government efficiency and increases the cost of doing business eventually this negatively affects the accessibility of basic services and thus increases the social and economic dimensions of poverty in addition the magnitude of the task to which afghanistan must respond with its weak institutional capacity is enormous compared to what administrations in other countries deal with33 the afghan civil service remains large and cumbersome including the problem of ghost employees listed on the payrolls of ministries without actually working serious lack of experienced professionals with modern management skills exists particularly women perhaps most importantly the payment of civil servants in the provinces and districts occurs only after complex chain of events and is often delayed see also corruption subsection above some basic reforms are under way legislation has been established to allow individual ministries to restructure another key challenge lies in ensuring that revenues are transferred to the central government from the periphery34 to ensure that the state has sufficient domestic resource base based on analysis one key challenge has been identified as the underlying cause for the lack of institutional capacity this is l politicisation of the public administration institutions and absence of meritbased system 1 politicisation of public administration institutions and absence of meritbased system in afghanistans public administration employment patterns privilege alignment to certain political factions and loyalty to local power brokers nepotism and favouritism can outweigh merit and provide for service delivery by people without the necessary background and skills public service thus may be used as form of improvised political and social safety net which also negatively affects the quality of service delivery 2e decentralisation and devolution throughout its history afghanistan has been nominally centralised state although it has had limited control and ability to deliver services to the periphery due to the geographical layout and climatic conditions especially since 1978 local power brokers have been in control over different parts of the country and armed conflict over territory has been almost continuous35 the fragmentation that has resulted reinvigorated through the war on terrorism36 differs significantly from the global trends that see decentralisation as conducive to democracy and grassroots development by and large the afghan population is demanding centralised state because of the current politicalmilitary ground realities of fragmented power consequently the constitution provides for centralisation but many features counter it taxation revenue raising dispersal of armed forces dissident activity and extensive regional control by power brokers37 decentralised system however does not necessarily ensure higher participation although improved responsiveness of the central government to public demands can reduce poverty while improving efficiency and quality of public services in afghanistan at the district level is where the real challenge of decentralisation lies and where an effective solution is an urgent priority in its policies such as the nsp the government is attempting to strike balance between rigid centralism and moderate decentralisation and to attempt to encourage provincial and districtlevel administrations to improve their management systems as they are given more autonomy in financial matters 38 and policy decisionmaking however resource allocation by local administrations is not conducted transparently and local officials possess little financial accountability in reality this may be compounded by bold refusal to transfer resources to the centre challenge for the international community is to support strengthening of the central government while working simultaneously only with regional forces that collaborate with the central government legal framework has yet been established to regulate centre periphery relations and address the challenges outlined above which could provide for such balanced approach through the eventual devolution of powers which broadens decentralisation from focus on administrative and financial issues to embrace principles such as participation empowerment democracy and equity service delivery benchmarks can help to assess the performance of local governments and their impact on the poor if afghanistan eventually can achieve devolution subsequent major effects are likely on poverty reduction corruption planning and accountability based on this analysis one underlying cause has been identified as central to realising good governance through decentralisation and devolution l absence of an integrated local governance framework 1 absence of an integrated local governance framework it is imperative to support the integration of elected assemblies at subnational level into the national planning and budgeting framework such integration has yet to be undertaken 2f the role of the media as with democracy and civil society participation tradition of strong independent media exists in afghanistan39 indeed the media remain far from being able to fulfil their role as independent guarantors of human rights monitors of public policy and channels for the expressions of citizens views this is however changing slowly radio is the main source of news information for most afghans because of the low literacy rate the high costs linked to television and the poor electricity infrastructure of the country it has been shown to be highly effective in educating rural populations available data indicate that only 25 percent of households in urban areas and 365 percent in rural areas on average do not have radio40 based on analysis three key challenges have been identified as limitations on the freedom of expression that the media must enjoy to fulfil their role these include l financial dependence of the media l climate of fear among journalists l consequences of gender inequality 1 financial dependence of the media the costs linked to media management are high and the majority of media are financially dependent on government agencies international organisations or political parties potential exists for content to be controlled4133 for example aid coordination is daunting with very high level of aid flows delivered through various channels and relying on widely varied allocation mechanisms the world bank opcit p 41 more than 150 percent of gdp was pledged for the next three years at the berlin donor conference of marchapril 2004 34 this is particularly challenging in the case of provinces that are captured by regional power brokers key element in the effort to raise revenues is the 2003 customs reform and new tax policy reforms enacted in 2004 35 ghai unitary or federal

hamed afghan journalist and winner of the 2003 committee to protect journalists award17 182 climate of fear among journalists the lack of tradition of investigative journalism still affects todays afghan journalists and their standards in relating to authorities limited understanding of freedom of expression is exacerbated by climate of intimidation resulting from the dominance of strong political and armed factions as well as the absence of the rule of law this leads journalists especially women to selfcensor on sensitive issues and to present their work as moderate and mainstream42 in particular conservative forces have tried to exercise media control by threatening and physically attacking journalists 3 consequences of gender inequality women journalists are encountering particular problems mainly intimidation and discrimination since they resumed work after the fall of the taliban this is result of the traditional sociocultural environment many women journalists and womens rights activists who have been outspoken on issues such as human trafficking or violence against women have reported death threats visits to their homes by gunmen and dismissals from their jobs43 3 what does success depend on given the strategic analysis of issues related to governance and institutional development it appears there is long way to go for afghanistan to create an environment conducive to achieving good governance and the commitments in the millennium declaration leading to the realisation of basic rights even so in barely three years the government has accomplished much in terms of formulating policies and prioritising needs see national policies and priorities box the momentum must be maintained and appropriate policy sustainability ensured through full support including l support for strengthening government implementing capacity including the ability to formulate propoor policies l support for strengthening civil society encompassing establishment of regulatory framework for ngos assistance in ngo coordinationknowledge sharing and support to government actors to understand that strong civil society is beneficial for strong government l support for transparent and credible political processes including through vetting of serious human rights violators l support for rights education especially for women vulnerable groups and children outreach must particularly be increased to women outside of urban centres l support for monitoring of human rights womens rights and political affairs with special emphasis on strengthening independent monitoring bodies to observe the 2005 parliamentary and local elections l support to freedom of expression and to the right to information including full use of the media and information and communications technologies icts to disseminate rights information and contribute to civic education in democratic society l support to data collection on human rights violations and cases ngos civil society organisations violations of the freedom of expression and census data see also significant data gaps box l support to an integrated local governance framework that fully involves elected assemblies at subnational level in national planning and budgeting ultimately success in all these areas will also depend upon vastly improved security and genuine respect for the rule of law42 between hope and fear intimidation and attacks against women in public life in afghanistan opcit p 22 43 ibid p 2 one journalist and womens rights activist in mazar isharif was forced

the millennium declaration and the copenhagen declaration on social development incorporate basic issues of governance freedom of the media citizens rights empowerment and improved equality afghanistan also has just recently signed the united nations convention against corruption the constitution stipulates that the afghan state shall observe international treaties which afghanistan has joined and the universal declaration of human rights article 7 the state and its institutions are therefore bound by constitutional law to uphold the rights identified as relevant to governance the constitution likewise provides explicitly for enjoyment of such rights and freedoms as the freedom of expression and the right to political participation and it enshrines strong safeguards against corruption of state officials significant data gaps l data must be collected and rendered easily accessible on human rights violations reported and unreported cases resolved cases and sentences delivered this also should include comprehensive human rights needs assessment to ensure that reconstruction programmes are based on priorities expressed by afghans themselves such an assessment can serve as tool for enabling community participation and providing check against corruption and waste the lack of accessible data in this area hinders awareness raising of individual citizen rights and fosters continued unpunished violations l overview exist s on how many ngos or civil society organisations shuras religious networks and voluntary associations and interests are in the country or of

along with systematic recording and analysis of cases l the absence of accurate census data severely affects the reliability of all statements on popular participation and involvement in governance issues the upcoming census will provide detailed information on the composition and location of the afghan population l reliable data on the number of public and private sector employees is neededinternational context and commitments 191 the situation in afghanistan perhaps in way do the poor suffer more than during conflict situation where their vulnerability to human rights violations lack of opportunities and formal powerlessness come to the forefront what this means ultimately is that every step taken toward reducing poverty and achieving broadbased economic growth can be step toward conflict prevention and realising human rights however peace security and justice for all in afghanistan are still far from being achieved while large parts of the country have been pacified the security situation in some areas has deteriorated despite the presence of international troops and ongoing security sector reform the importance of achieving peaceful secure society is given prominence in the millennium declaration and is intrinsic to the realisation of rights to survival livelihood protection and participation nonetheless countries such as afghanistan have fewer economic and political resources with which to contain or resolve conflicts especially in the aftermath of the first presidential elections in afghanistan understanding dimensions of reconciliation will be critical development efforts must be used strategically not just to prevent and settle conflict but also to consolidate peace when settlement has been reached44 in so doing strategies addressing such issues as those at the base of all peacebuilding poverty governance justice environment also must be developed through lens of peacebuilding recognising that dialogue can triumph over discord and that diversity is universal virtue45 the dominant perception of security and insecurity in afghanistan is based largely on the ability of international and national relief and development staff to safely implement programmes in certain areas46 views of afghans however are often different afghans living in many areas considered low risk by and for the united nations report high levels of insecurity and conflict primarily in the north west and centre47 womens and childrens rights are particularly affected with their right to protection compromised however afghans own definition of security goes beyond the mere absence of fighting or armed attacks and includes access to education health care and economic opportunities48 significantly more research and data collection are required on all aspects of peace security and justice 44 the secretarygenerals report on transitional justice 2004 states that our experience in the past decade has demonstrated clearly that the consolidation of peace in the immediate postconflict period and the maintenance of peace in the long term cannot be achieved unless the population is confident that redress for grievances can be obtained through legitimate structures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the fair administration of justice secretarygeneral report on rule of law and transitional justice in conflict and postconflict societies 3 august 2004 at 3 s2004 616 45 the frameworks for action on this priority within the united nations system include the following statement by the secretarygeneral to the united nations security council june 2001 on the prevention of armed conflict the role of the united nations is principally to assist national governments and their local counterparts in finding solutions to their problems by offering support for the development of national and regional capacities for early warning conflict prevention and longterm peacebuilding likewise the statement of the president of the security council on the adoption of resolution 1325 of the security council 31 october 2001 is relevant to the critical role of women in peace and security issues the security council reaffirms its commitment to the implementation of its resolution 1325 2000 of 31 october 2000 and welcomes the efforts by the united nations system member states civil society organisations and other relevant actors in promoting the equal participation and full involvement of women in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security and in implementing the provisions of resolution 1325 2000 46 the vast

with regard to disarmament demobilisation and reintegration of armed factions as well as development of capacity in the securitylaw enforcement and judicial sectors49 the continued existence and perceived legitimacy of commanders throughout afghanistan compounds all three issues50 as does the continuing proliferation of small arms incidents of armed violence that affect civilians occur in the contexts of coalition military activities terrorist activities factional fighting and violence and commander violence forced recruitment forced labour extortion of money physical assaults increased narcotics production by maintaining allegiance systems and the economic dependence of considerable portions of the population on regional power brokers particularly contributes to the worsening security situation and must be tackled through reduction of supply demand and harm 2 analysis of key issues and underlying and root causes the cca analysis is synchronised with national priorities see national policies and priorities box and the united nations system is supportive of government efforts toward peace security and justice particularly security sector reform the national justice and rule of law programme and the afghanistan stabilisation programme key issues identified as relevant to peace security and justice all of which point to an ongoing lack of realisation of human rights in afghanistan include l explosive remnants of war l continued power and influence of nonstatutory armed forces under commanders and warlords along with the persistence of incidents of armed violence49 it is estimated that it will take several more years to train the targeted numbers of afghan national army afghan national police judges prosecutors and defence lawyers 50 the road ahead

percent per month in july 2004 l slow progress has been made on the commitment to ddr of at least 40 percent of the stated strength of factional forces 100000 afghan militia forces amf as well as the cantonment of all heavy weapons by june 2004 participation of various army corps in the exercise has been very uneven amf units in the southeast have been practically demobilised while in the south ddr was discontinued still of concern is the fact that very few commanders are among those demobilised in addition by august 2004 about 3300 minors associated with fighting forces out of an estimated 8000 underage soldiers were demobilised in the northeast east central highlands and part of the central region recently the ddr process has gained new momentum and the government has made presidential candidacy and political party registration conditional upon signature of an agreement to cooperate with the ddr programme l by august 2004 about 20000 afghan national police anp had received training

legal training legal awareness capacity building and procurement of equipment and vehicles together these sub programmes are designed to achieve an immediate impact on justice reform while ensuring

victims from 2001 to march 2004 source unmaca 2b continued influence of nonstatutory armed forces and persistence of incidents of armed violence general climate of impunity and limited power of sanction by the central state are at the core of the issue of peace security and justice in afghanistan the most significant threat to security for afghans is the recurrent challenge to the monopoly of coercive force by the state in other words the widespread nature of violence or the threat thereof by non statutory armed forces under the leadership of local commanders armed political groups or militias generally this is achieved through land occupation illegal taxation and extortion along with forcible recruitment and forced labour54 it is also important to note that many ordinary incidents of armed violence against civilians especially women and children are left unreported55 the continued presence of these forces undermines efforts to extend the legitimate authority of the central government inhibits the establishment of effective democratic and accountable local government and threatens national unity more specifically non statutory armed forces present direct and indirect threats to the staging of elections and challenge efforts to establish the rule of law economically they distort and impede efforts to establish system of central government revenue collection in the context of organised crime they become key obstacle to combating narcotrafficking nonstatutory armed forces often have manipulated ethnic sensitivities to mobilise support and loyalty from local communities56 based on analysis four key challenges have been identified as underlying causes for these continued issues they affect the rights to life freedom of association expression assembly and movement freedom from torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment liberty and security of the personfreedom from arbitrary arrest and detention freedom from discrimination and propertyfreedom from arbitrary interference with privacy family home and correspondence these include l slow progress on implementation of disarmament demobilisation and reintegration ddr l traditional widely dispersed authority l insufficient and inadequate law enforcement capacity l weakened conflict resolution mechanisms 100 80 60 40 20 0 2 unknown9 female89 malel contested allocation of resources particularly land and water l cultivation of poppy l dysfunctional formal justice system and preference for traditional justice mechanisms l social violence and lack of social protection duty bearers that hold an obligation to fulfil these entitlements are primarily state actors and institutions at various levels of the governance structure as well as nonstate actors including armed factions local commanders and civil society itself that can influence the rights of others the root causes of the above challenges which are interlinked arise from l an underdeveloped human rights culture along with lack of traditions of democracy statebuilding and civil society participation l young governance structures still in the process of establishment andor early stages of development and unable to curb political insecurity l shortage of human resources that can propel democratic reforms l wide variations in socioeconomic indicators by gender region and ruralurban divide l weakened social infrastructure l sociocultural traditions that result in widespread marginalisation based on gender social status or ethnicity 2a explosive remnants of war landmines unexploded ordnance landmines and unexploded ordnance uxo constitute structural impediment to the development of afghanistan the result of more than two decades of mine use by many armies and factions51 besides the old mineuxo caseload an unknown number of landmines remain in the possession of commanders and militias in various regions as well as with the government according to its obligations under the mine ban treaty afghanistan must destroy all stockpiled antipersonnel mines by march 2007 and must clear all mines by march 2012 based on analysis two key challenges have been identified as inhibiting reconstruction and economic development that lead to the realisation of rights to free movement to access land and resources to safe return and most importantly to life these include l lack of awareness of risk related to landmines and uxo l lack of legal and regulatory framework 1 lack of awareness of risk related to landmines and uxo mine risk education often does not reach the populations most vulnerable to minerelated injuries or death because of geographic or climatic obstacles often too the dire economic situation drives afghans to enter contaminated areas even if they are aware of danger to collect minesuxo in order to earn small amount of money by selling metal scrap52 2 lack of legal and regulatory framework national legislation has yet to be passed in order to penalise the use stockpiling transfer and production of antipersonnel mines53 this provides legal loopholes for offenders in afghanistan 51 afghanistan has more than 872 square kilometres of suspected mined land and an additional 450 square kilometres thought to be contaminated by uxo making it one of the most uxo and mine affected nations in the world up to five people day are killed or injured by mines and uxo out of the total recorded new casualties of landmines in 2002 children younger than 18 accounted for more than half and require strengthened protection elderly people also are disproportionately affected especially those not fully familiar with the situation in their homeland such as returning refugees and idps it is estimated that 12000 new victims will suffer from mineuxo incidents over the next decade if clearance activities occur and mine risk education is conducted 52 fully onethird of respondents in mined areas in afghanistan said that someone in their household had gone into areas they knew were mined asked why they took the risks involved most gave reasons related to livelihood including to collect firewood 37 percent to take shortcut 18 percent to tend

development actors particularly the united nations has sharply declined in some provinces mainly in the south southeast east and west this is result of the persistence of incidents of violence especially by armed groups as well as because of open military operations25 262c contested allocation of resources illegal or contested allocation of resources particularly land and water plays central role in increasing insecurity and conflict at both individual and community levels across afghanistan see also economic development and growth numbers of disputes recorded over property ownership have increased significantly since 2002 consistent pattern of forced evictions and land grabs has been found arable land comprises only 12 percent of the countrys total area and resources are made even scarcer by afghanistans frequent natural disasters data supported by qualitative analysis also points to the high incidence of involvement of commanders government officials and other powerful persons in these disputes operating in climate of impunity for responsibility the facto control by commanders and warlords over areas of forest and mineral resources also has been documented as serious issue facto inequality for women in land ownership and tenure contributes significantly to inequities in allocation of land and property the special rapporteur on adequate housing as component of the right to an adequate standard of living 60 has recommended development of national legislation on housing and land rights it was recommended that customary civil religious and state laws be incorporated and codified into one comprehensive source prioritising the right to inheritance of housing and land by women idps nomadic peoples ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups the special rapporteur drew attention to the fact that the constitution while recognising the need for compliance with international human rights instruments in this respect does not explicitly guarantee the respect of the right to adequate housing and related rights five key challenges have been identified as underlying causes that inhibit the rights to life property noninterference with privacy family and home security of the person freedom from discrimination and peaceful enjoyment of possessions these include l lack of central government control over natural resources including weak rule of law l high and increasing indebtedness leading to increased vulnerability l shifts in traditional decisionmaking mechanisms l lack of coherent resource policies l consequences of sociocultural traditions 1 lack of central government control over natural resources including weak rule of law for the past 25 years the security situation has limited the ability of the government in kabul to establish national sovereignty over natural resources including land water and minerals traditional or statutory controls relating to boundaries between arable and pastoral lands have broken down resulting in rampant encroachment contestation and environmental degradation as noted above local or community control in many cases has been supplanted by the influence of local commanders militias or wealthy landowners many of whom exert influence in the formal and informal justice systems formal land records are considered unreliable with transactions since 1990 most often disputed weak to nonexistent rule of law render application or enforcement of law unlikely at this point 2 high and increasing indebtedness leading to increased vulnerability food and economic insecurity of seminomadic and farming populations has been increased as result of war and drought this has led to very high indebtedness with significant reduction of livestock due to drought exacerbating the problem57 international crisis group elections and security in afghanistan 30 march 2004 58 the most prominent example took place in september 2004 when the central government decided to remove the governor of herat from his position 59 human security and livelihoods of rural afghans opcit p 541 slow progress on implementation of ddr although 20000 excombatants have been demobilised lack of overall progress with ddr creates condition in which non statutory armed forces can continue to operate leading to an increasing risk of factional fighting ddr is not being seriously implemented by many commanders 57 at the same time few military actors have been removed from power despite welldocumented evidence of illegal activities and human rights violations58 lack of sufficient incentives or coercion to lead warlords to subordinate to state authorities and disarm also has played an important role in limiting the success of ddr the unregulated provision of arms through regional and international networks and dissemination and availability of heavy weapons in spite of ongoing disarmament efforts has likewise been an aggravating factor 2 traditional widely dispersed authority strong central government is not traditional concept in afghanistan despite jure centralisation in practice people generally gave their allegiance to tribes factions and local military strongmen along ethnic lines 3 insufficient and inadequate law enforcement capacity fledgling institutions such as the afghan national police and afghan national army still do not have the strength and support to enforce law and order or counter attacks by antigovernment armed forces they are affected by severe lack of resources and infrastructure limited remuneration and lack of professional recognition in spite of recent improvements in the salary rates and distribution systems supported by the international community cases of police receiving their small salaries late or not at all are still regularly reported the police force is chronically underfunded compromising the capacity of the police to guarantee the safety and security of those living within the states boundaries this gives rise to the widespread privatisation of security and undermines public confidence in the police in addition to reports of corruption and extortion by police forces the police also are allegedly involved in arbitrary arrest rape sexual assault home invasions kidnappings torture and ransoms for the release of prisoners in afghanistan the distinction between military and civilian police forces typical of democratic societies is blurred while the police are often recruited from local commanders capacity and authority of the police at local level is heavily dependent on their alignment with armed political forces controlling an area59 lack of ethnic diversity and representation of women also is source of concern 4 weakened conflict resolution mechanisms besides the struggle for political power economic interests are an important cause for ongoing violence especially in relation to conflicts over resource control land water and poppy harvests see also economic development and growth social wellbeing while in other environments such conflicts may be solved peacefully there is often recourse to arms in afghanistan because of the absence of culture of peace during the past 25 years new challenges to peace and sustainable development require creative thinking and response as well as the adaptation of traditional approaches to better meet the needs of the new era 60 ecn4200448add2 cited in country profile of afghanistan and the international human rights system opcit p 5 27 28three key challenges have been identified as underlying causes stimulating opium production in afghanistan and further constraining the rights of the afghan people these include l lack of institutional capacity for drug control l limited law enforcement capacity l need for credit l lack of adequate engagement of poppy farmers in eradication plans 1 lack of institutional capacity for drug control the government has set up counternarcotics directorate and developed sound policies which foresee total eradication of poppy by 2013 and achievement of 70 percent reduction in five years this will combine the provision of alternative livelihoods for poppygrowing farmers extension of drug law enforcement implementation of drug control legislation establishment of effective institutions and introduction of prevention and treatment programmes for addicts however the facto focus of policy implementation thus far has been almost exclusively on eradicationlaw enforcement 2 limited law enforcement capacity of government the effectiveness of law enforcement is hampered by alleged widespread involvement of government officials in the narcotics trade and related activities and by patronclient relationships of military actors with rural police and judicial authorities 3 need for credit the opium industry provides an important source of credit for rural afghans and engaging in opium cultivation can enhance household liquidity and increase food security however the greater availability of credit and the oftenunfavourable borrowing terms for opium production also can lead to increased indebtedness62 4 lack of adequate engagement of poppy farmers in eradication plans until now emphasis has been directed mostly to narcotics enforcement and high or mediumlevel commanders involved in the narcotics trade with little effort toward farmers themselves direct awareness raising and alternative development initiatives must be strengthened 2e dysfunctional formal justice system and preference for traditional justice mechanisms functioning system of governance cannot exist without judicial system able to enforce existing law and resolve disputes equitably and consistently due to the history of the afghan legal tradition formal legal mechanisms are much less consolidated than usually presumed and not easily understandable by the people63 womens and childrens rights are particularly affected by the lack of functioning formal justice mechanisms at every stage including knowledge of rights access to justice and trial and detention other vulnerable groups particularly nomadic tribes and the poorest sector of society face similar disadvantages overall the plurality of legal systems across the country creates serious issues of access to justice the afghan legal system draws from different influences sharia islamic law traditionalcustomary law by which justice is administered through jirgasshuras secular law in the form of the constitution and all other legislation enacted and international obligations stemming from human rights and other treaties without eventual integration 61 human security and livelihoods of rural afghans 20022003 op citp 1633 shifts in traditional decisionmaking mechanisms years of war have led to shifts in traditional decisionmaking mechanisms including in some areas the erosion or corruption of the system of local water management at the village level 4 lack of coherent resource policies coherent policies or strategies for management of natural resources are in many cases nonexistent with regard to water management for example responsibility for water is fragmented between six ministries jurisdiction among the ministries overlaps and central coordination mechanism exists 5 consequences of sociocultural traditions in general because women enjoy lesser inheritance rights land access is special problem for widows and womenheaded households see also economic development and growth 2d cultivation of poppy overall rural populations are increasingly turning to opium production as livelihood strategy see also economic development and growth poppy cultivation has influenced power dynamics and brought shifts to local politics by providing substantial revenue to large number of midlevel commanders in parts of afghanistan61 farmers do not always grow poppy voluntarily evidence exists that returnees and economically vulnerable families are most likely to be forced by commanders into cultivation afghanistan opium poppy cultivation by province 2002 2003 source cndunodc afghanistan opium survey 2003 62 ibid p 166 farmers with limited resources typically receive an advance payment against the value of their entire crop prior to harvest with the agreed price equal to half the current market value of opium this system allows traders to collect opium at significantly less than the market rate at the time of harvest but locks the poor into patronclient relationship with local traders 63 securing afghanistans future opcit considerations on criteria for strengthening the justice system technical annex p 1028 30 2002 2003cultivation ha2 low level of capacityresources of the formal justice system lack of national coverage of the national justice institutions combined with lack of infrastructure are but the first of series of issues that make the formal justice system inefficient and inadequate to deal with the administration of justice nationwide effectively impeding the fulfilment of access to justice and basic human rights this is exacerbated by lack of security for staff involved in the administration of justice inadequate salaries and lack of an adequate law enforcement mechanism in addition serious concerns exist about the education level of personnel for the administration of justice 3 the shortcomings of the traditional justice system in safeguarding human rights in situation of monopoly of traditional justice mechanisms for many years the lack of control of the central government over the majority of the country during the years of internal conflict meant that traditional justice fora were the only conflict resolution mechanisms unlike state courts traditional mechanisms settle disputes without long delays and without financial costs because they do not involve written communications access for illiterate people is easier however traditional justice mechanisms have controversial human rights record both in terms of procedures used and mechanisms of enforcement especially with regard to the rights of women 4 lack of clarity of the transitional legal framework the legal framework operating in afghanistan is in transitional phase while the constitution provides an overall framework the work of indexing and digesting existing laws to underpin future law reform has yet to be carried out given that the constitution provides that currently enacted legislation contrary to constitutional provisions is automatically invalid the review will have to ensure consistency and lack of gaps in the legal framework 5 insufficient capacity of the correctional system the correctional sector including the courts and the penal system is severely under resourced and because of shift of responsibility between ministries many staff are unfamiliar with new standards the penal system has been an area where it is extremely difficult to get donor support of these subsystems into consolidated system administration of the justice sector will remain difficult legal strategy still remains to be developed to address this task in this diverse framework limited data available on the use of traditional justice mechanisms indicates that as many as 80 percent of people use shura and jirga mechanisms as the main avenue of redress for range of disputes they thus provide established access to conflict resolution mechanism64 at the same time these shuras jirgas are maledominated and therefore very limited venue for women to address their issues their rulings based on customary law can directly contradict sharia law state legislation and international human rights standards 65 the formal justice system in afghanistan faces numerous additional obstacles including severe lack of human capacity infrastructure and material resources ineffective coordination and communication as well as ideological disagreement among the ministry of justice the office of the attorney general and the supreme court an apparent high susceptibility to military and political influences with some appointments made and cases tried on the basis of personal tribal or ideological ties low number of women lawyers and judges and the nonexistence of defence attorneys 66 67 significant gap exists between urban and rural areas with urban courts mostly operational and overwhelmed by high caseload and rural courts where present extremely underresourced and subject to the will of local military actors at the same time the prison system in afghanistan is devastated after 25 years of being used as political tool for the repression of opponents with the exception of few provincial capitals in the majority of provinces children are detained with adults often without going through due process all this effectively compromises the efficiency and integrity of justice administration and decreases peoples trust in the formal justice system five key challenges have been identified as underlying causes for the lack of fulfilment of rights to an effective remedyequal protection before the law freedom from torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment liberty and security of person freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention and freedom from discrimination these include l lack of awareness of basic rights and the legal system impeding access to justice l low level of capacityresources of the formal justice system l the shortcomings of traditional justice mechanisms in safeguarding human rights in situation of monopoly of traditional justice mechanisms for many years l lack of clarity of the transitional legal framework l insufficient capacity of the correctional system 1 lack of awareness of basic rights and the legal system impeding access to justice the afghan population has very limited knowledge of their rights and entitlements and the mechanisms to protect them of the normative framework of afghanistan and of the international legal framework this is result of low level of education high illiteracy and the restrained access of women to information several studies have indicated that many citizens who are aware of the court system are not confident about its integrity and have little confidence in legal professionals inadequacy of dissemination of information about basic rights and the legal system combined with lack of an institutionalised legal defence impairs overall access to justice 64 see atmar and goodhand afghanistan the challenge of winning the peace in searching for peace in central and south asia 2002 see also wardak building postwar justice system in afghanistan crime law and social change vol 41 2004 4 319341326 328 65 this includes enforcement of method of compensation known as badal which involves resolution of dispute between two families through exchange of young girls for marriage vulnerable groups and those not directly part of the community may be excluded or denied just hearing because of the monopoly of power by elders who comprise the shurajirga in addition the constitution introduced the respect of basic rights at the same time as it conditioned the legal output to noncontradiction with islam hence the concept of compatibility between human rights and islam is indispensable for both advocacy and effective realisation of such rights 66 while the right to defence and legal assistance for the indigent has been recognised in the constitution art 31 the afghan judicial system does not have tradition of professional lawyers assisting clients in court cases nor does it have bar association or systems of provision of legal aid up to now the international community has focused on addressing the lack of government capacity to provide justice leaving it to human rights bodies like the aihrc and few ngos to support the capacity to seek justice through legal awareness and education programmes as well as legal aid schemes slowly more attention seems to be devolved on starting training programmes for defence attorneys and the need for an institutional solution to this issue 67 human security and livelihoods of rural afghans opcit pp 11 and 200 31 323 what does success depend on given this strategic analysis it appears difficult to create the necessary environment to achieve progress toward the mdgs millennium declaration targets and rights of survival livelihood protection and participation specifically with regard to disarming militias expanding access to justice and establishing mechanisms to control corruption see also governance and institutional development this requires ambitious institutional reforms and sustained domestic and international support the existence of considerable disparities in human development across regions and among different social groups must be recognised and development policies must address these inequities full support must be given to appropriate national policies and priorities on peace security and justice including l support to the overall elimination of the culture of impunity and tackling the issue of crimes of the past l support to revitalise and accelerate the ddr process as well as to ensure that security and law enforcement institutions are comprised of individuals who are not suspected of having carried out serious human rights violations an effective screening methodology and reliable database are required 74 l support to human rightsrule of law education for all citizens including children to create an enabling environment for peace and sustainable development this can be particularly achieved through the education system see also social wellbeing l expanded support to an effective reform of the afghan national police as democratic law enforcement actor both from an administrative and commandcontrol perspective including the provision of adequate training and equipment and the recruiting of women l support to strengthening of capacity to implement relevant policies especially at sub national level l support to development of information bases for appropriate early warning systems for conflict prevention l support to the rebuilt judicial system including the juvenile justice system to operate in manner promoting full respect for international human rights standards 75 enactment of nondiscriminatory laws and repeal of all legislation and other measures that discriminate against women or children or impede their full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms the plurality and overlapping of judicial systems must be addressed through support to integration of these different subsystems l support to curbing of poppy cultivation opium processing facilities and drug trafficking assistance must be given to establish benchmarks and achievements indicators see also economic development and growth it is recommended to support the mainstreaming of the counternarcotics strategy within overall strategies in support of national policies need exists however for clearer articulation with regard to the fact that poppy eradication implies substantial reduction in rural incomes which will be acutely felt among the poor 76 l support to development of broadbased social protection legislation policies programmes and services see also social wellbeing 2f social violence and lack of social protection although lack of documented information on many forms of social violence is constraint to analysis indications are strong that social violence 68 is increasing as result of lack of social protection 69 for vulnerable groups see also social wellbeing while the main form of social protection has come from the family longstanding conflict civil unrest and dislocation have severely eroded the capacity of many families to provide such protection to their members even within intact families severe abuses of members occur women and girls are disproportionately affected exacerbated by their absence from decision making fora at all levels70 police militia armed political groups and commanders allegedly continue to use rape and sexual violence as weapon against women and girls their families and communities afghan boys also are targets of sexual abuse71 physical punishment of children at home and at school is common and sharp increase in child trafficking kidnapping and exploitation has been reported in large part because of extreme poverty comprehensive research into child abuse is yet to be undertaken see also social wellbeing 72 based on analysis four key challenges have been identified as inhibiting the realisation of rights to freedom from discrimination for victims of social violence to life and to freedom from torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment rights under the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the convention on the rights of the child also are relevant the challenges are l lack of rights awareness l lack of redress for violations in the absence of formal legal system l consequences of diminished livelihoods l consequences of sociocultural traditions 1 lack of rights awareness the widespread lack of awareness of rights particularly affects women because of their limited access to information low educational status and illiteracy and thus has significant implications for social violence issues it likewise has significant effect on children who are left extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation 2 lack of redress for violations in the absence of formal legal system legal and political factors that allow social violence to continue include disputed legal definitions of rape domestic abuse and marriage age this is exacerbated by the jure or facto lesser legal status of women and some ethnic minorities which has made redress for violations against these groups difficult in many instances 73 3 consequences of diminished livelihoods economic constraints in many instances lead families to send their children to work so as to contribute to the household income and to marry off daughters at an earlier age than normal 4 consequences of sociocultural traditions the perceived status of powerlessness of women and their inability to defend themselves against violations of their wellbeing through forced marriages for example leads an increasing number of girls and women into suicide in many cases through selfimmolation68 social violence encompasses domestic violence trafficking in persons abduction early or forced marriage selfimmolation suicide and child labour 69 social protection is defined according to the asian development bank as set of policies and programmes designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labour markets diminishing peoples exposure to risks and enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption loss of income the policies and procedures included in social protection involve five major kinds of activities labour market policies and programmes social insurance programmes social assistance micro and areabased schemes and child protection 70 the united nations commission on human rights has

economic development and growth 1 the situation in afghanistan economic growth is vital to the rights to survival livelihood protection and participation likewise the first mdg eliminating extreme poverty and hunger is closely tied to the issue of quality of growth in 2002 following the end of major conflict afghanistan had per capita gross domestic product gdp of less than us200 one of the lowest in the world significantly more than half of the population lived in extreme poverty and the total gdp stood at only us4 billion but in the last two years afghanistans formal economy has performed strongly albeit starting from very low base nondrug gdp has increased more than 50 percentage points primarily reflecting revival of economic activity the initiation of reconstruction and the partial recovery of agriculture in some areas from severe drought recent positive growth performance has been supported by the governments sound macroeconomic policies highly successful currency reform prudent nooverdraft policy prohibiting domestic financing of the budget deficit conservative monetary policy that brought inflation down to 10 percent annually and good management of the exchange rate progress also has been made in mobilising domestic revenue and in trade and financial sector reforms at the same time the key to longterm economic development will be strong local private sector based on considerable skills development the informal economy in afghanistan continues to be dominant accounting for 80 to 90 percent of the total economy women work primarily in this sector the legal portion of the sector is centred on agriculture commerce manufacturing handicrafts and transport agriculture not including poppy generates about half of gdp and employs about 70 percent of the labour force estimated at 8 million as such it is considered the main source of livelihoods however illicit activities include the extensive opium production that blights afghan society along with widespread unauthorised timber harvesting and mineral extraction also on the negative side are the severe deprivations suffered by livestock owners both settled and nomadic with regard to animals lost to the drought that continues in many parts of the country their recovery along with that of reduced agricultural production in general is expected to take several years 338as an alarming example of the informal economys considerable growth poppy cultivation for opium production has rebounded to nearrecord levels see also peace security and justice in 2003 opium comprised about onethird of total gdp including drugs narcotics in afghanistan thus remain pervasive and increasingly entrenched with clear nexus among poppy cultivation violence and criminality the scope for expanding poppy production and deepening the skills base represents major economic concern another important element in the informal sector arises from remittances in the form of payments from labour resulting from economic migration such remittances are critical to many households and should be seen as short or mediumterm economic stimuli analysis suggests that countries similar to afghanistan and with sound policies and institutions experience economic growth of around 7 percent annually in postconflict economies growth could be even higher reflecting catchup period 9 percent annual growth rate in the afghan nondrug gdp driven substantially by external financing is estimated as necessary to replace the opium economy over time while enabling the nation to reduce poverty77 2 analysis of key issues and underlying and root causes the cca analysis is synchronised with national priorities see national policies and priorities box and the united nations system is supportive of government efforts toward economic development and growth particularly the national development framework the public investment programme and national environmental action plan analysis has divided key issues of economic growth and development into the following l employment as it relates to the right to decent work l distributive justice as it relates to rights to human dignity and gender equality l environment and natural disaster management as it relates to the right to sustainable development duty bearers that hold an obligation to fulfil these entitlements are primarily state actors and institutions at various levels of the governance structure as well as nonstate actors including civil society itself that can influence the rights of others the root causes for the above challenges in afghanistan which are interlinked can be traced to l an underdeveloped human rights culture along with lack of traditions of democracy statebuilding and civil society participation l young governance structures still in the process of establishment andor early stages of development and unable to curb political insecurity l culture of unsustainable resource use that must be reversed l shortage of human resources that can propel economic reforms l wide variations in socioeconomic indicators by gender region and ruralurban divide l weakened social infrastructure l sociocultural traditions that result in widespread marginalisation based on gender social status or ethnicity l obsolete industrial and agricultural technology and practices that harm the environment 77 securing afghanistans future op cit p 112poverty reduction through broadbased economic growth lies appropriately at the heart of the national development framework ndf the governments vision for investment and social

development public investment programme l at the international conference on afghanistan held in berlin with international partners in marchapril 2004 the government proposed public investment programme pip that aims to enable afghans to generate the type of economic growth and institutional changes that would sustain the politics of hope and inclusion alleviation and elimination of poverty

afghanistans future march 20042a employment the right to decent work the right to decent work encompasses productive work of acceptable quality in which rights are protected and which generates an adequate income with adequate social protection it is not confined to wage employment but extends to selfemployment home work and other incomegenerating activities it also carries with it the responsibility to promote the personal capabilities of people to find productive employment and earn decent livelihood in afghanistan although specific survey on employment has been conducted the overall jobless rate is 32 percent78 unemployment among youth while extremely significant is lower than the average rate although in case of increased education not adapted to concrete market needs and opportunities the potential exists for further worrisome growth in addition evidence exists of exploitative employment conditions particularly in the agriculture sector leading to increased indebtedness for thousands of families79 based on analysis four key challenges have been identified as inhibiting employment and economic growth these include l lack of an enabling environment l lack of support services including key infrastructure and market access l lack of access to capital and financial services l lack of advanced entrepreneurial skills knowledge and technology 1 lack of an enabling environment the weak state of national institutions constitutes major constraint for economic development and poverty reduction compounded by the need to strengthen policy and regulatory and legal frameworks this represents the most important constraint for the small and medium enterprise sme industrial and mining sectors and significant constraint for the agriculturelivestock sector making it key challenge for intervention and reform moreover while only private sector development will be able to take afghanistan to the next level of economic development the overwhelming dominance of the informal economy represents serious issue80 in particular the opium economy concentrated in six districts with high rates of insecurity and risk provides strong incentives that help afghans cope with hardship but that undermine the rule of law and legal economic alternatives81 in the long term it contributes to vulnerability especially for poor farmers in the legal economy an enabling environment for the right to work and private sector development is constrained by the static nature of small and medium enterprises the sme sector contributes less than 10 percent of gdp and is weak particularly because of underdeveloped market linkages that are key to stimulating economic activity beyond subsistence and microbusiness82 finally the slow rehabilitation of the industrial sector must be noted this sector constituted 22 percent of gdp in 2003 with production deriving mostly from agriculturerelated activities83 private investment toward industrial development continues to be insufficient with most focused on postwar reconstruction longterm industrial development strategy is required 2 lack of support services including key infrastructure and market access afghanistans rugged geography and extreme climate seriously constrain access and communication exacerbated by scattered population support services including key infrastructure electricity roads water irrigated land and business linkages warehousing 78 irc labour market information survey 2003 79 see also alden wily rural land conflict and peace in afghanistan areu 2004 payments to tenants sharecroppers and farm workers usually in the form of crops have more or less been fixed for 70 years and are arguably not fair return for labour even in good agricultural year sharecroppers family may receive enough grain for only 4 to 7 months and become indebted for the rest of the year 80 by its nature work in the informal sector is difficult to regulate many workers are without basic protections and are open to rights violations and abuse in unsafe or hazardous environments 81 for poppy production the average family income soars to us4000 year compared with only us500 for legal crops though 10 times more labour intensive than cereal crops poppy can be grown with cheap unskilled labour 82 typical business 55 percent is owned by the family with 69 percent of businesses employing only one or two people in standard market economy the range of activities in the sme sector would be numerous in afghanistan however the core of the sector is in only two areas construction and agricultural processing 83 world bank op cit pp 5 and 13141 42marketing are either severely depleted or have never been developed any private formal or informal economic activity requires all of these to greater or lesser degree moreover many afghans including the majority of women appear to be prevented from accessing markets because of cultural constraints or insecurity arising from militia activity84 as an example of the obstacles faced by afghanistans poor the time currently required for transporting products to market often leads to loss of quality and profit compounding low productivity the neglected development of modern farming techniques and high production costs often market access is limited by illegal taxation or extortion on roads by armed groups military factions and local commanders85 farmers encounter similar constraint in the absence of marketrelated information which makes it difficult for them to even assess the market 3 lack of access to capital and financial services large capital depletion through the loss of land real estate and machinery during the lengthy conflict forms major constraint to renewed economic activity the lack of financial services likewise is serious concern underdeveloped areas include an inadequate banking system as well as lack of financial services particularly credit for the informal economy challenge is to deepen and widen such services through the increase in coverage of credit unions commercial and village banks and microfinance this must be combined with outreach to vulnerable groups especially women and ethnic minorities many of whom have virtually access to credit saving for capital accumulation and capital investment will be equally important currently few livelihood strategies other than poppy cultivation provide ready access to credit and informal credit systems have become limited only to close family members because of war drought and other hardship86 4 lack of advanced entrepreneurial skills knowledge and technology while the entrepreneurial and commercial skills of the afghan people are remarkable many structural gaps in the existing skills sets need to be bridged for the economy to thrive professional managerial and administrative expertise are sharply lacking as are technical and craftsman skills women in particular do not have advanced skills and experience given their extended absence from education and economic activity most technology is highly outdated training research and development to adopt existing technologies also are poor all this results in an inability to expand businesses improving productivity and efficiency the economy has further suffered from brain drain that has resulted in loss difficult to replace although this is partly compensated for in the short term through the inflow of remittances access to public transport source wfp 2003 2b distributive justice the right to human dignity and gender equality like employment equitable access to resources and their benefits represents key factor for economic development and growth discrimination and unequal opportunities represent major constraint on the right to work as well as overall rights and poverty reduction this is particularly relevant for marginalized groups which in the context of afghanistan include the poor the landless ethnic minorities returnees and idps children people with disabilities and overwhelmingly women overall the distribution and contested allocation of resources together with obstacles of access must be taken into account for development strategy to lead to more equitable wealth realisation of social and economic rights particularly the right to human dignity and the right to gender equality and achievement of the mdgs the following points include major concerns with regard to distributive justice l because of sociocultural reasons and lack of opportunities illiteracy little or capital women cannot participate in many types of economic activities and may be exploited in terms of the division of labour l employment is not equally distributed and often reflect biases based on social status gender or ethnic group l ambiguity and high insecurity in land ownership and land tenure rights also marginalize numerous sections of the population again based on social status gender and ethnicity84 human security and livelihoods of rural afghans 20022003 opcit pp 57 and 169 85 ibid p 172 86 ibid p 180the following points summarise available data on employment l unemployment is highest 42 percent in the central region l the age group

sectors are the two largest employers l significant group of farmers are casual labourers without land or homes their dependency on landlords makes them vulnerable to exploitation l total of 62 percent of businesses require additional employees l state owned enterprises previously the backbone of industry have largely collapsed following budget reduction l about 60000 children are employed

constrained economic opportunities despite the commitment of the government to gender equality significant discrimination against women persists in the workplace primarily because of cultural constraints87 afghan women could be wellpositioned to play part in the informal economy which requires flexibility at the same time it requires mobility which many women do not have the majority of rural afghan women who work for income do so within their homes however women who engage in wage labour earn substantially less than men and sometimes less than children88 inequalities for women also are extensive with regard to inheritance laws which provide for lesser share for female inheritor compared to male or in the case of widow to her inlaws or children 2 landlessness the insecurity of land ownership land is distributed unequally and is combined with high level of landlessness both of which constrain the right to property and freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy family home and correspondence see also peace security and justice an estimated 40 percent of arable land is owned by less than 10 percent of the rural population89 landlessness stands at around 247 percent of rural households but may soar to three quarters of some communities90 in addition nearlandlessness land insufficient for meeting subsistence requirements is equally high at nearly 60 percent of those who own land vulnerable groups such as womenheaded households the landless and nomadic peoples are at distinct disadvantage in terms of access to resources ownership and maintaining ownership or tenure studies of historical land relations point to an underlying system of discrimination based on socioeconomic status economic gaps between landlords small farmers and the landless are large and landlessness correlates strongly with local perceptions of poverty powerful cultural barriers also exist between those with and without land landless farmers often perceive acquisition of land as not only financially impossible but as getting above our station at the same time customary religious and state laws offer plural legal basis for land rights with inconsistency and uncertainty as to norms in each body of law customary law used in majority of land disputes tends not to favour women most importantly judicial bodies often are faced with multiple claims to single piece of property while conflict over water rights is integral to many land disputes pastureland is thought to be the most widely contested class of land and represents rapidly emerging focal point for interethnic conflict 3 ethnic minorities longstanding discrimination ethnic discrimination against various groups 91 has effectively prevented access to and equal distribution of resources and their benefits thus constraining the right to work for many afghans discriminatory practices long have provided preferential access to land as reward for certain ethnic groups and power bases and have levied heavy taxes against groups in political or social disfavour such ethnic discrimination has been particularly critical with regard to rights to grazing lands as result violent repercussions have taken place against numerous ethnic groups and are heightened by the return and resettlement of large numbers of refugees and idps4 distributive justice for other vulnerable groups returnees and internally displaced persons economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities are crucial for the sustainability of the return of refugees and idps key concern in this regard includes lack of employment opportunities discouraging return to places of origin or forcing movements to concentrated areas where absorption capacity of the labour market may be insufficient this has exacerbated the increasing trend of ruralurban migration other concerns include the risk of backflow movements abroad the scarcity or lack of productivity of landholdings reducing livelihood opportunities and the presence of extreme vulnerable groups among returnees whose poverty levels may force them into illegal activities to survive in addition some returnees are professionals civil servants and other skilled labour who cannot find employment compatible with their status widows widows have been described as afghanistans most vulnerable group the years of war and civil unrest together with the traditional practice of older men marrying younger women or child brides have resulted in an estimated 500000 widows many widows are deprived of their inheritance leaving them dependent upon their late husbands brothers for support restricted employment opportunities prevent them from establishing independent households and large numbers of widows beg for money to support their children people with disabilities people with disabilities are currently estimated to comprise from nearly 3 to 5 percent of the afghan population although the actual figures are likely to be much higher because more than 8 in 10 people with disabilities are unemployed92 most rely on the beneficence of their families few opportunities exist for training or retraining for employment children with disabilities are subject to severe inequities and have limited access to educational opportunities street and working children estimates vary on the number of street and working children in afghanistan but it appears that most work to support their families who tend to be poor or singleheaded households with little or extended family support many of these children walk great distances to reach their workplaces they face abuses and hazards including dust and pollution lack of clean drinking water and toilets and arbitrary arrest and detention children without parental care parents descent into poverty has resulted in rising numbers of children without parental care and in families placing such children in institutions in the hope of better life for them of the current 8000 children in orphanages about onethird are there because of poverty and more than 80 percent have living parent93 few children leaving an institution are well prepared for work having few social or vocational skills overall afghanistan has the highest child population of orphans in asia at 12 percent as well as the highest of any country in the world without generalised hivaids epidemic87 ibid p 158 88 ibid p 156 in parts of afghanistan women who can find work outside the home also are subject to severe restrictions on their speech dress and behaviour because women and girls have so few economic opportunities threats to their jobs carry even greater weight 89 opcit p 134 90 ibid p 134 91 localregional minorities face inequities from localregional majorities with the two largest ethnic groups pashtun and tajik finding themselves in minority positions outside their main areas of residencein the majority of families the wife or wives and daughters do not inherit any property as long as there is male heir womens lack of formal title to land poses particular problem for returnee widows trying to access former homes and plots it should be noted that under sharia law women have the right to own land and to inherit some property and wealth from male relatives this is rarely upheld in afghanistan 92 irc labour market information survey 2003 93 unicef report on national assessment of the situation of children of children deprived of parental care in institutions in afghanistan 200345 46child soldiers and waraffected children about 8000 child soldiers and many waraffected children have few work or employable skills and are caught in vicious cycle of poverty and exploitation unless provided with appropriate means of livelihood without any opportunities of better life this group is the potential source of recruitment into militias if there are rumours of another war raising serious potential threats to peace and security 2c using natural resources sustainably and managing disaster risks effectively in country where more than 80 percent of the population relies on the natural resource base to meet daily needs widespread environmental degradation poses an immense threat to livelihoods and poverty reduction particularly affected are the poor womenheaded households and households of the landless or nearlandless many of whose rights are thus unfulfilled on the part of communities there is lack of awareness of sound environmental practices which needs to be addressed at the same time with improving their livelihoods and economic conditions communities must become owners of their natural resource base and feel that they actively participate in national economic growth otherwise poverty and environmental damage can be caught in downward spiral ie past resource degradation deepens todays poverty while todays poverty makes it very hard to care for or restore the vitality and the carrying capacity of ecosystems when this selfreinforcing downward spiral reaches it limit poor people are forced to move in increasing numbers to other ecologically fragile lands of the country at the same time afghanistan is prone to natural disasters including drought earthquake sandstorms and extremely harsh winters all of which have devastating effect particularly on the poor between 1970 and 1998 alone afghanistan experienced 57 largescale natural disasters with the total number of persons killed as result estimated at 19630 and the number of persons affected estimated at 336117894 natural disaster management and emergency preparedness must be strengthened to respond to the onset of these crises based on analysis four key challenges have been identified as underlying causes that prevent fulfilment of the right to clean and healthy environment these include l competing land usage agriculture human settlements forestsrangeland wetlands l lack of enabling policy legislative and regulatory frameworks along with ambiguous legal status of ownership and access to natural resources l limited capacity of the government to prepare for and mitigate natural disasters l negative impact from war drought increasing population human settlements over exploitation and landmines 1 competing land usage affecting water resources and land alike is historic failure to acknowledge common property as well as the destruction of such property see also peace security and justice water resources are additionally threatened by contamination from waste dumps chemicals and open sewers many wetlands have dried up and longer support wildlife or agriculture meanwhile unsustainable grazing and livestock practices combined with drought have left the country lacking adequate pastureland or vegetation to sustain large livestock herds95 in urban centres poor waste management practices and lack of proper sanitation are the main environmental factors affecting human health dust from frequent and worsening storms along with vehicle emissions represent the primary causes of air pollution this is compounded in the cold season by usage of stoves and open fires and by toxic fumes from the burning of plastic and tires due to shortages of firewood and electricity 2 lack of enabling policy legislative and regulatory frameworksambiguous legal status the absence of strong environmental regulations and clear natural resource management policy means that clear guidelines exist for how other sector should take account of the environment as they develop this can lead to potential serious impacts in the future afghanistan has unique opportunity to make the principles of sustainability the base for its economic development at the same time while the constitution declares that the state owns all resources in their natural state it is unclear whether private party may legally explore and exploit such nonrenewable resources96 overall particular challenge also exists in the need to develop sound information programmes and monitoring systems that would allow the government to establish link between the quality of health and environmental conditions 3 limited capacity of the government to prepare for and mitigate natural disasters natural disasters such as drought constrain peoples livelihoods including their ability to be foodsufficient and to access safe drinking water which has large effect on their health status while natural disasters affect the population at large they have more devastating effects on the poorest categories mostly those in rural areas women children and the landless tend to be most affected in afghanistan 4 negative impact from war drought increasing population human settlements over exploitation and landmines water is key to the health and wellbeing of the people and essential to maintain agricultural productivity however both surface and groundwater resources have been severely affected by drought as well as uncoordinated unmanaged extraction worsening water quality is among the most pressing issues facing rural afghans in addition many rural dwellers have reported decreased water levels since 2002 despite an end to the drought in some areas restoring vegetation cover to the country is key both to preserve and build up water reservoirs and to fight drought and many of its detrimental effects 3 what does success depend on the challenge for afghanistan is to turn the recent economic recovery into sustained growth poverty reduction and social progress over the medium term the past two years of economic successes thus should not lead to an underestimation of the challenges ahead given this strategic analysis it appears difficult to create the necessary environment to achieve progress toward the mdgs millennium declaration targets and rights of survival livelihood protection and participation the united nations system will fully support appropriate national policies and priorities on economic development and growth including l support to creation of an enabling environment including regulatory frameworks for private investments and policies for rebuilding and privatising stateowned enterprises l support to improved land tenure security and clarified land tenure norms which will 94 citation of undp 2001 disaster profiles of the least developed countries in securing afghanistans future opcit livelihoods and social protection technical annex p 97 95

support to enactment of framework for natural resource management support to implementation of national environmental action plan the ongoing priority reform and restructuring exercise of the government presents an initial opportunity to improve the administrative efficiency of ministries and departments which will have significant implications in allowing the government to improve its capacity to implement economic development programmes similarly economic development can only occur in an environment in which the rule of law is cornerstone strengthening the capacity of institutions such as the judiciary as well as enhancing access to such mechanisms and institutions will invariably encourage economic development ensuring transparency in the use of state revenues also will be important finally strengthening reform initiatives will clarify the relationships between the private and public sector necessary to fulfil the rights and improve the lives of afghans and achieve the mdgs 97 for example national risk and vulnerability assessment data suggest that the poorest quintile of sampled rural households is twice as likely to have experienced sickness andor death in the

passed since the fall of the taliban important progress has been made in all sectors but much remains to be done in order to reach significantly strengthened social infrastructure realise the rights to survival livelihood protection and participation and achieve the mdgs see also introduction who are the poor in afghanistan in addition the earlier devastation has been compounded by the severe drought that is still ongoing in many areas see also economic development and growth overall it should be noted that demandbased approaches are critical to meet social wellbeing and that local institutions such as community development councils are key to success in this regard with an estimated total fertility rate of 626 per woman and an average population growth rate of 25 percent per year the population of afghanistan is increasing very rapidly 57 percent of afghans are younger than 18 average life expectancy however stands only at 445 years 98 as much as 20 years less than the regional average for south asian countries the high fertility rate combined with early marriage 99 and lack of access to modern family planning measures and health facilities has taken devastating toll on the health of both mothers and children4 98 statistical yearbook of afghanistan 2003 99 2004 study by the ministry of womens affairs and womens ngos estimated that 57 percent of girls marry before age 1652education l the governments vision is to ensure that all children complete compulsory education 9 years and have opportunities to continue to higher levels to achieve this the government will through the education public investment programme pip expand access to and raise the quality of primary and secondary education countrywide and will build higher education system that responds to afghanistans reconstruction needs creates new professional and income opportunities and meets international standards the government also intends to expand citizens access to vocational

women returneesidps and other vulnerable groups are crosscutting areas of analysis in this section the cca analysis is synchronised with national priorities see national policies and priorities box and the united nations system is supportive of government efforts toward social wellbeing particularly the basic package of health services the education public investment plan the livelihood and social protection public investment plan the priority reform and restructuring programme and the rural water and sanitation programme 20042008 key issues related to social wellbeing include l availability ofaccess to quality education l availability ofaccess to quality health care l availability ofaccess to food many factors deteriorating quality of education increased risks of disease and infection outdated management styles inadequate dietary intake lack of potable water and sanitation facilities and poor family and community knowledge skills and practices among others contribute to the low level of social wellbeing affecting afghanistan today while those listed in the sections below are more related to specific thematic areas some permeate and affect all aspects of peoples daily lives duty bearers that hold an obligation to fulfil these entitlements are primarily state actors and institutions at various levels of the governance structure as well as nonstate actors including parents teachers community leaders and others in civil society that can influence the rights of others the root causes for the above challenges in afghanistan which are interlinked can be traced to l an underdeveloped human rights culture along with lack of traditions of democracy statebuilding and civil society participation l wide variations in socioeconomic indicators by gender region and ruralurban divide l weakened social infrastructure l sociocultural traditions that result in widespread marginalisation based on gender social status or ethnicity l young governance structures still in the process of establishment andor early stages of development and unable to curb political insecurity l shortage of human resources that can propel social reforms especially for women and girls l culture of unsustainable resource use that must be reversed 2a the right to education with its full endorsement of the millennium declaration in march 2004 afghanistan has committed to meet the second and third mdgs which are to achieve universal primary education 105 and gender equity at all levels by 2015 the world fit for children target of gender parity in education by 2005 also serves as an impetus to realisation of the mdg commitment however regional comparisons of primary school completion rates and progress toward the mdg goal showed afghanistan to be the only country out of 16 ranked as seriously off track106 in large part as consequence of past taliban edicts that seriously reduced school enrolment for boys and eliminated it for girls107 large proportion of people aged between 8 and 33 particularly women and girls thus have been deprived of basic education as consequence of war civil unrest and dislocation even before the soviet invasion many people were not able to undertake basic education in 2003 male literacy stood at 432 percent and female literacy at only 141 percent with barely 8 percent of rural women literate one of the lowest rates in the world 108 adult illiteracy rate source mics 2003 teacher numbers have increased to more than 100000 of whom about 1 in 4 are women although qualifications vary from university degree holders to primary school graduates in addition to wide gender disparity109 sharp disparity in school enrolment between urban and rural areas is observed in large part as consequence of the historical lag in expanding education to rural areas while the net enrolment ratio in kabul province was 76 percent in 2003 the ratio in uruzgan was only 19 percent percentage of children 712 years not enrolled in school in 2003 source mics 2003 105 compulsory basic education in afghanistan now comprises the primary grades 16 and middle school levels grades 7 9 while secondary education covers grades 1012 the ministry of education thus longer differentiates between primary and middle education until now indicators referring to primary education were calculated for grades 16 in the future the ministry is likely to calculate secondary enrolment rates for instance for grades 1012 this means that for internationally comparative sequential and diachronic analysis there is need to recalculate old statistics for grades 1012 only or to incorporate grades 79 in new data likewise primary education indicators will need to be recalculated as well 100 80 60 40 20 0urban rural maletotal female total 80 70 60 50 40

will be on curriculum development teacher training equipment and infrastructure secondary schooling will be an increasing priority in shaping afghanistans educated workforce large amount of funding logistical and technical expertise nevertheless is needed for primary education and literacy which will become more expensive as enrolment increases110 based on analysis four key challenges have been identified as underlying causes for availability issues while three further challenges related to access also constrain the right to education and the achievement of the mdgs these include l poor institutional capacity to plan and manage education programmes l poor quality of education and outdated curriculum l shortage of adequate learning spaces and essential teachinglearning materials l shortage of qualified teachers particularly women and lack of training l consequences of diminished livelihoods l consequences of sociocultural traditions l limited community involvement availability 1 poor institutional capacity to plan and manage education programmes education officials at the national provincial and district levels have limited management capacity particularly to cope with the increasing number of externally funded projects and the consequent need for efficient management of contracts and largescale education development projects review of policy issues related to education along with aid coordination remain major challenges an education database with updated figures also is lacking as result project planning and management to promote girls education in particular is seriously constrained in addition to the planning and management capacity the current education system does not have wellestablished educational administrative structure with clear unambiguous rules and regulations this lack as well the unfamiliarity of educational administrators at central and provincial levels with rules and regulations further weakens management capacity some rules and regulations also are applied without public consultations which may lead to an issue of democratic governance in the formal education system 2 poor quality of education and outdated curriculum in general the quality of education is affected not only by teacher qualifications and experience but also by curriculum textbook quality and availability status of infrastructure the studentteacher ratio and class time all current academic curricula are heavily outdated however revised textbooks for grades 1 and 4 have been developed and are being fieldtested and the full introduction of new curriculum is expected to take place in 2005 provided funding for printing is secured meanwhile the studentteacher ratio in afghanistan has enormous provincial variations with the worst figures being 1851 in kandahar and 1201 in kabul city111 at the same time the curriculum reforms under way have created some tension because of limited transparency and unclear policies on how to address the integration of religious studies support must be given to ensure that the madrasa curriculum is fully aligned with the concepts of conflict resolution and coexistence tertiary education is biased toward law and engineering and does not offer the skills needed for reconstruction and economic development likewise vocational technical and nonformal education must meet reconstruction needs while educating those who have missed out on formal education numerous organisations and institutions are providing vocational and skills training but uniformity or coordination exists in duration cost and substance market feasibility and phaseout strategies are missing and immediate participation incentives often substitute for longerterm incomegenerating objectives of participants vocational training for women in particular lacks creativity and focuses on traditional roles such as tailoring doing little to provide sustainable means of income lastly years of war repeated displacement and drought have constrained the extended family network and community system through which afghan children have pursued early childhood development and socialisation today 238 kindergartens operate accommodating 25400 children according to the ministry of labour and social affairs methods and activities are outdated however focusing in most instances on cognitive development of the child early childhood activities were funded through the national development budget for 1383 20042005 3 shortage of adequate learning spaces and essential teachinglearning materials in 2003 there were 7029 schools 4783 formal schools recognised by the ministry of education of which only 48 percent and 25 percent respectively had water and sanitation facilities112 many students were simply crowded under tents or in the open air since 2002 1753 schools have been rehabilitated or constructed113 yet it is estimated that 5574 schools still need to be built over the next three years114 in many rural areas learning facilities exist at all and because of sociocultural and security reasons girls are not allowed to walk with boys or unaccompanied or to travel long distances to attend schools most parents also are not in position to provide teachinglearning materials for their children many children especially girls drop out of school because of this lack the quality of learning facilities is particularly low in tertiary institutions with illequipped laboratories if any and extremely limited access to libraries total of 17 higher education institutions are functioning but construction or rehabilitation of universities is critical although several private institutions run by ngos offer access for students with disabilities few public educational institutions other than those constructed since 2002 have such access 4 shortage of qualified teachers particularly women and lack of training in most parts of the country girls still cannot be taught by male teachers particularly once they reach adolescence with at most 25 percent of teachers being female this represents serious constraint to girls right to education in addition more than 3 in 4 teachers have formal teacher training115 and some have formal education at all116 an additional 40000 teachers are required to fulfil requirements as of early 2004 as enrolment increases this figure also will increase teachers like other civil servants are inadequately and irregularly paid if paid at all see also governance and institutional development this results in their working for supplementary incomes likely negatively affecting teachers attendance as well as quality of performance and in qualified personnel choosing higher paid careers outside of teaching110 while higher education students numbered only 4000 in 2001 they had increased substantially to 31000 by the end of 2003 securing afghanistans future opcit education technical annex p9 even so less than 2 percent of the population is involved in higher education one of

afford to do so given that the actual and opportunity costs are too high for their meagre incomes girls are required at home to perform domestic work while boys are sent out to earn additional money 2 consequences of sociocultural traditions in large parts of afghanistan preference and high value is attached only to boys education the link between girls education and reduced fertilitychild mortality higher economic productivity and increased wellbeing for the family is not recognised117 insufficient schools for girls still exist as girls progress through adolescence the chances for their continued education are reduced even further because of the prevalence of male teachers in particular security plays an important role in ensuring girls continued access to education dozens of girls schools have been attacked or burned since 2002 allegedly by the taliban or local military factions118 in addition access to schools for children with disabilities remains an unmet need not only with regard to physical access but also in terms of having parents accept the child as capable of being educated 3 limited community involvement education is highly valued in general but its improvement is often seen as the governments responsibility after 23 years of conflict families are first and foremost concerned with rebuilding their own homes and reconstructing their lives the role of the teacher in the community is poorly understood and teachers may not feel responsibility toward children or adolescents not attending their school119 more structured government approaches to community and parental participation are under way as part of reconstruction 2b the right to health current assessments of under5 and maternal mortality the spread of major diseases and the level of access to safe drinking water show that afghanistan may fall seriously short of realising the right to health for all and achieving its mdg targets despite significant government efforts to reduce the health burden in particular support must be given to address the very serious issue of maternal mortality mdg 5 already noted as the highest in the world in some regions of afghanistan in certain provinces such as badakhshan to be woman is literally matter of life and death overall maternal mortality remains among the leading causes of death in the country with up to 25000 afghan women dying annually as result of pregnancy and childbirth moreover when the mother of newborn dies the child has only 1 in 4 chance of surviving until its first birthday120 in all family planning and reproductive health issues also require much stronger attention to meet acute needs including hivaids prevention adolescent reproductive health information and services121 and treatment for sexually transmitted infections122 likewise chronic malnutrition represents serious health challenge which can be addressed in part through food fortification 117 the main reasons for girls nonenrolment

and mortality in general and emphasises maternal and child health as well as safe motherhood through the bphs standardised package of basic services forms the core of service delivery in all primary health care facilities with redistribution of health services promoted by levelling urbanrural disparities although overall health policies and strategies are in place124 and while central management capacities have been progressively strengthened the extent and quality of service delivery remains unsatisfactory even where services are available serious issue remains in that they are often not fully utilised preventive health practices must be improved in view of the lack of information and to inadequate practices in hygiene nutrition waterrelated health behaviour and simple disease prevention such as immunisation and supplemental vitamin provision while routine immunisation reaches more than 50 percent of the targeted age group immunisation coverage for children has increased it is much higher in urban areas than in rural areas more efforts remain to be made in immunisation against childhood tuberculosis and diphtheriapertussistetanus the best coverage has been achieved in measles immunisation following mass campaign in 2003 only 16 percent of children in urban areas and 27 percent in rural areas have not yet been reached with regard to polio eradication the level of the disease has fallen dramatically to only 3 cases by the end of september 2004 large differences in coverage exist between provinces and sometimes even between districts within the same province outside major cities only about 30 percent of households have access to safe drinking water in some provinces such as bamyan baghlan and sari pul the figure stands at less than 10 percent this represents major underlying cause of both morbidity and malnutrition in the country among those with access to safe water only about onequarter had water source within their compound while more work is required to make surface water safe promotion of sanitary latrines and hygiene practices has been the most neglected aspect of water and sanitation work in the country125 200 150 100 50 0 16

critical health services are provided to all especially the poor 124 however separate population policy yet exists 125 afghanistan progress of provinces multiple indicator cluster survey 2003 opcit p 75 61 62based on analysis three key challenges have been identified as underlying causes for availability issues six further challenges related to access also constrain afghans right to health and achievement of the mdgs while lack of awareness has been highlighted in several areas it should be noted that it must be considered in broader context of socio cultural and economic determinants and strongly linked to both healthseeking behaviour and health service provision the key challenges include l shortages of skilled and trained health staff especially female health workers in rural areas along with lack of physical infrastructure equipment and medical supplies l limited accountability and lack of clear relations in government at the provincial level l limited capacity of government to prepare for and mitigate natural disasters l consequences of sociocultural traditions l degraded and limited road infrastructure l lack of awareness of hygiene child care and feeding practices l lack of awareness of patterns of transmission prevention and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases l lack of awareness of both mental health and the ill effects of drugs in society l reports of discrimination against some ethnic groups households with safe drinking water from pumpprotected spring source mics 2003 availability 1 shortages of skilled and trained health staff especially female health workers in rural areas along with lack of physical infrastructure equipment and medical supplies prolonged conflict has led to the retirement or emigration of skilled instructors lack of material and financial resources and restricted access to equipment and updated technical information prohibitions affecting education under the taliban along with low literacy have added to degradation of skills and further reduced the alreadylimited number of female health staff who are absent in 40 percent of all health care facilities this in turn limits the access of women to health care although the government is making particular effort to build capacity for female health workers skilled health staff are more likely to be found in urban areas than in rural areas making the latter even more underserved in some provinces hospital buildings or ambulances exist and private houses are used to provide health services126 2 limited accountability and lack of clear relations in government at the provincial level although clear description of provincial health departments has been indicated under the governments priority reform and restructuring prr programme the bulk of the process of recruitment to meet the necessary scope of services at the provincial level has not yet started in the vast majority of provinces there appears to be limited consistency among national health policy and priority programmes except the bphs in addition the lack of clarity in the relationship between the ministry of health and its provincial departments renders the departments reactive rather than proactive in relation to decisionmaking and preparation management and control of budgets hence there is low level of budget execution typically 25 percent due to nonavailability of cash which heavily affects the availability and delivery of services accountability is low because staff are unaware of expectations and system of regular review discourages high performance huge gaps in salaries and benefits between provincial ministry of health staff and those hired by ngos implementing the bphs further discourages ministry staff access 1 degraded and limited road infrastructure access to transport and ability to travel is the primary reason for unequal access to health care with travel for women and children more restricted than travel for men and with travel for women more restricted than travel for children127 physical access is especially difficult during winter and early spring as well as after heavy rainfalls such that afghans living in remote areas appear to wait until their health problem has become serious before they travel to medical centres these basic centres however are often not equipped to handle the more severe cases and emergencies128 households access to healthcare source world bank 2 consequences of sociocultural traditions maternal mortality is perhaps the most important indicator demonstrating that life is extraordinarily difficult for women in afghanistan nearly 9 in 10 maternal deaths were judged to be preventable according to 2002 ministry of healthcentres for disease controlunicef study129 numerous factors contribute to the high maternal mortality many of them related to traditional sociocultural perceptions high fertility as result of poor education and poor access to contraception poor nutrition with resulting anaemia and maternal stunting inadequate or nonexistent antenatal care and an inability to access urgent obstetric care when needed national coverage for prenatal care has been estimated at only between 8 and 12 percent130 again even where services are available utilisation of such services traditionally is low knowledge and use of contraceptives at only 103 percent131 is believed to be hampered by low availability as well as sociocultural factors leading to one of the highest unmet family planning needs in the world while family planning is generally approved of for economic and health reasons it is often determined by having certain number of sons research 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 402 total312 rural61 urban 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 40 total population9 rural households

showed that 98 percent of women were interested in obtaining contraceptives the ideal family size according to many women was four children two boys and two girls63 64also shows that women are required to seek permission from their husbands to attend family planning clinics and must give persuasive arguments to justify using reproductive health services it appears there is very little communication about reproductive health and sexual behaviour at family level in particular adolescents face severe access constraints given the lack of youthfriendly services and policies as well as lack of social choices such as when and whom to marry and whether and when to have children 3 lack of awareness of hygiene child care and feeding practices in relation to the large constraints on access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities only 322 percent of mothers of under5yearolds in urban areas and 13 percent in rural areas use water or soapash to wash their hands after their own or their childs defecation in addition 29 percent of households in urban areas and 50 percent in rural areas have fixed place for disposal of child faeces exclusive breastfeeding for an appropriate period is not commonly practiced and complementary feeding occurs either too late or too early with foods that are often nutrientpoor breastmilk substitutes are being more aggressively marketed without proper regulation further undermining breastfeeding practices mothers level of awareness increases with their level of education 4 lack of awareness of patterns of transmission prevention and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases minimal or knowledge of hivaids exists and high levels of illiteracy present noticeable barriers to hivaids awareness and prevention an important opportunity thus exists to increase attention and focus on the threat of the disease at an early stage in afghanistan given that numerous risk factors are present such as prostitution men having sex with men drug use and population movements the ministry of health estimates that 200 to 300 persons in the country are living with hivaids it is believed that routes of infection are mainly heterosexual transmission transmission through blood transfusions and the sharing of contaminated needles during drug use132 at the same time afghanistan is heavily afflicted by tuberculosis with young women comprising 70 percent of all adult cases recorded in public clinics again because of lack of awareness one of the main problems lies in the widespread nonadherence to treatment regimes an overall 16 percent of the population is considered at risk for malaria which is prevalent in more than half of the country and endemic below 1500 meters of altitude awareness of preventive practices such as usage of insecticidetreated bed nets must be raised at household level 5 lack of awareness on mental health and on the ill effects of drugs in society recent history has left the population extremely vulnerable to range of mental health problems particularly chronic depression anxiety insomnia and posttraumatic stress disorder the world health organisation estimates that 20 to 30 percent of afghans suffer from mental disorders with another 30 to 40 percent having psychosocial problems reliable data are available although it appears that women children returneesidps and people with disabilities have significantly poorer mental health status133 while mental health is listed as secondtier priority in the bphs clear policy has yet been developed and an extreme shortage of trained mental health professionals exists in such context the availability of cheap opium heroin and other pharmaceuticals is causing rapid rise in drug dependency in afghanistan as well as neighbouring countries lack of awareness openness and information concerning drugs adds to the severe predicament of drug users as they often underestimate the character and the consequences of the drugs they usefinally social wellbeing depends on the ability of enjoying and benefiting from social support networks evidence suggests that the afghan environment has become less conducive to complete social wellbeing limited information is available on an increased trend toward selfimmolation and suicide particularly among young women as well as on child abuse and kidnapping 6 discrimination against ethnic minorities anecdotal reports suggest there may be cases of limited access to health care facilities by ethnic minorities in some areas where health personnel refuse to treat patients because they belong to certain ethnic community134 2c the right to food whether population has adequate food or not largely depends on the availability and diversity of food its nutritional adequacy and its accessibility all heavily affected by availability of adequate roads or transport purchasing power and knowledge while actively involved in the fight to combat hunger afghanistan again remains far from achieving the right to food an d reaching its mdg targets currently those afflicted by or at risk of hunger stand at very high 374 percent of the population while the mdg target is 186 percent135 right to food strategy exists however an information system also is needed that allows disaggregated analysis of foodinsecure groups headcount rate individuals with energy consumption below age sex adjusted basic requirements nrva average 2070 kcalories per day source wfp 2003 132 out of 15 new cases recorded in 2003 13 were among local residents who had not

based primarily on economic and gender factors are evident in skewed consumption patterns the richest 20 percent of people consume nearly half the food leaving the other half to the remaining 80 percent of the population again this is result of the uneven access to natural resources and assets such as land and water see also economic development and growth in addition the frequent natural disasters that afflict the country as well as the conflicts that characterised afghanistan for so long have acted as precursors to widespread and persistent food insecurity results from nutrition and health surveys suggest that women infants aged less than 6 months and infants between 6 and 24 months are at particular risk of malnutrition which as noted above is prevalent in afghanistan136 malnutrition is related not only to food deficiency but also to contaminated water see also the right to health subsection poor infant feeding practices low levels of female education and other issues fortification of food thus represents an important intervention for support by the united nations system on the policy side policies must be supported to help strengthen dietary diversity and healthy eating habits and food preparation based on analysis four key challenges have been identified as underlying causes for availability issues while three further challenges related to access also constrain the right to food and achievement of the mdgs these include l lack of rule of law l lack of fair land ownership norms and single body of land tenure laws l limited capacity to respond to natural disasters l unregulated water rights and decimated irrigation systems l consequences of diminished livelihoods l lack of awareness of nutrition and the importance of dietary diversity and correct child care practices l lack of dietary diversity availability the majority of the rural population of afghanistan depends on access to arable land for food production however as discussed in detail in economic development and growth only 12 percent of the national territory constitutes usable farmland and land tenure in afghanistan is very poorly regulated and nontransparent major causes of land tenure insecurity include 1 lack of rule of law overall lawlessness continues to tolerate commanderism unpredictable declarations depriving ethnic groups of land water and living rights and the assetstripping behavior of elites and militias 2 lack of fair land ownership norms and of single body of land tenure laws instability and ambiguity in land relations have been fostered by lack of fair land ownership norms and multiple cases of unresolved interests over the same plots of land land rights in afghanistan are addressed by the various legal regimes sometimes in contradictory ways 3 limited capacity to respond to natural disasters see also economic development and growth 4 unregulated water rights and decimated irrigation systems unregulated water rights and decimated irrigation systems are vital to the sustenance and productivity of vineyards orchards and cereal farms related issue is the critically uneven access to improved seed fertiliser manure draught power and labour because of competition over scarce resources and longstanding inequities in afghan society access even if available for food to be considered adequate it must satisfy basic nutritional needs anaemia affects up to 65 percent of children under 5 and 70 percent of expectant mothers micronutrient deficiency symptoms result from lack of foods rich in iodine vitamins and c and ironfolic acid137 factors related to access contributing to this scenario include 1 consequences of diminished livelihoods poverty often prevents families from providing healthy meals to their members especially children and women of childbearing age lack of incomegenerating opportunities thus has direct impact on the health of millions of afghans the lack of free market policy in afghanistan while ensuring availability of commodities in large quantities across the country has also contributed to reduce the purchasing power of families already suffering from lack of employment or of any income sources given the absence of government mechanisms to control prices 2 lack of awareness of nutrition and the importance of dietary diversity and correct child care practices women have higher energy protein and micronutrient requirements when they are pregnant and nursing and those who enter pregnancy malnourished or who do not gain sufficient weight during pregnancy are more likely to deliver lowbirthweight babies these children then face heightened risk of dying during the first week of life or of perpetuating the cycle of malnutrition across generations girls who are malnourished during childhood are more likely to be malnourished as adolescents with very high prevalence of iron deficiency138 limited knowledge of correct child care practices leads to inappropriate feeding from shortened timing of breastfeeding to lack of provision of food during episodes of diarrhoea 3 lack of dietary diversity reliance on wheat as staple dietary component and significant reduction in consumption of diversified micronutrientrich horticultural products have contributed to afghans impoverished diet this relates closely to the low purchasing power of millions of afghans it also results from the devastation of horticultural agriculture and irrigation systems139 136 opening doors to opportunity afghanistans millennium development goals opcit p 15137 findings from protracted relief and recovery

in security and dignity but as the cca analysis shows millions of afghans have such rights nor an equal opportunity to fully develop their human potential ensuring human security means protecting vital rights and freedoms freedom from want freedom from fear and freedom to take action on ones own behalf this requires concerted efforts to develop norms processes and institutions that systematically address insecurities it also requires creating systems that give people the building blocks of survival livelihood and decisionmaking because deprivation and insecurity are intimately intertwined tackling both effectively demands an integrated approach through protection and empowerment human security demands building on and going beyond the mdgs by addressing the full range of critical and pervasive threats facing people security of the person social and community security economic and environmental security governance and political security in afghanistan the united nations system is well placed to undertake such efforts within the overarching framework of human security approach the concept of human security resonates deeply here even as afghanistan takes its first steps to rebuild after decades of violent conflict and chronic poverty diminished quality of life and dislocations in public services have emerged as sources of national instability hence the wellbeing of the entire country may be at stake if the multiple and complex causes of these issues are not addressed in particular millions of rural afghan women experience the highest levels of human insecurity in nearly all thematic issues covered in the cca at the root of this insecurity is gender inequality the cultural social economic and political barriers to realisation of basic human rights for afghan women and girls the analysis of the development situation provided in the previous chapters indicates priorities for development cooperation in afghanistan in the years to come while each united nations agency in afghanistan has its distinct mandate some strategic goals and shared values consistent with global and national development agendas complement one another and thus incorporate the roots of collaboration combining these considerations with the diversity of mandates of the united nations system yields three broad areas in which support for the transition of afghanistan can be concentrated these are l human rights and peace building l governance and participatory development l basic social services and environmental sustainability the selected strategic areas for cooperation are not intended to be fully inclusive of all stakeholders interventions but they do represent an explicit common response the main criteria for proposing these three areas of cooperation are priority needs potential for longterm impact on national goals and priorities lessons learnt and good practices and opportunities to strengthen both national capacities and international cooperation for each of these areas joint efforts are necessary network of public private and civil society actors who can help clarify and develop norms embark on integrated activities and monitor progress and performance such efforts can create source of legitimacy that complements traditional structures strengthened efforts at data collection and analysis will be necessary in all areas to identify the numerous data gaps identified in the cca in all unprecedented opportunities exist to address the desire for change that many afghans 574possess including through united nations system participation in the upcoming prsp process during this process united nations strengths in normative standards policy advice capacity building and advocacy will be shared the areas of cooperation will be coherently reflected by individual united nations organisations in their mandated activities within the undaf organisations can build on their strong field presence impartiality and high credibility with government and civil society then act together to help conceptualise implement and monitor countryowned development programmes and projects turning to each area of cooperation it is evident that the commitment of the united nations system to poverty reduction is unwavering in this regard the impact of failed national rebuilding process and inadequate enforcement of the rule of law will be devastating rendering afghanistan yet again vulnerable to violence divisiveness and extreme instability major objective of united nations assistance will be to establish peace in development in afghanistan through building capacities for preventing violent conflict development frameworks supportive to peacebuilding and wider peaceenabling environments the focus of human rights and peace building will not be on emergencies as such but rather on integrating longerterm peacebuilding into the full spectrum of conflictrelated responses this can include support to creating the knowledge skills and values for human rights culture significantly improving gender equality expanding counternarcotics measures enhancing the rule of law and ensuring more equitable allocation of resources particularly through land reform that addresses the rights of returnees and idps the united nations also can provide mechanism for reducing the severity of social conflict by helping to generate framework for social policy that finds place for both poverty and relative equity concerns employing series of internationally tested approaches consisting of mix of poverty reduction the eradication of discrimination protection for the especially vulnerable and improvement in working conditions building national ownership and national capacities both within government and civil society will be emphasised ensuring actionable results in both policies and programmes overall promoting civil society provides channel for dispute resolution as well as governance and participatory development good governance means different things to different people but there is overall agreement that it is critical to have good governance to political observers good governance often means support for judicial and civil service reform the strengthening of national and local parliaments and other governance institutions the adoption of propoor policy frameworks and the establishment of independent watchdog and advisory commissions to the public it means the eradication of corruption from daily life and trust in the fairness of public decisions to the economists it means greater attention to the impact of institutions in market economies to the religious it means polity fashioned along religious principles and edicts all of these concepts of governance can be accommodated within durable structure of pluralist democracy grounded in civic rights the latter also constitute vehicle for ensuring minority rights the united nations system can assist both by helping to solidify the governance agenda as well as by supporting number of initiatives to consolidate democracy in the course of the afghan transition in this context the united nations system will advance bestpractice examples in the area of recovery and postconflict reintegration assistance to ngos in the enhancement of citizens rights and entitlements will help their credibility and increase public participation in their activities in the realm of economic security the proper functioning of markets as well as development of growth that reaches the extreme poor and fairly distributes benefits is essential focus must be given to sudden economic downturns natural disasters and the social impacts of crisesfinally under basic social services and environmental sustainability the united nations system will support measures essential to allow people to lead long healthy and creative lives to enjoy decent living standards and freedoms and to possess dignity selfrespect and respect for others basic education and public information that provide knowledge life skills and respect for diversity are particularly important for human security in afghanistan in their urgency depth and impact also critical are global infectious diseases poverty related health and food security threats and health deprivations arising from insecurity and violence at the same time support for access to land credit and housing especially for poor afghan women is necessary as are strengthened social protection measures and populationrelated activities finally human security recognises the linkages between environment and society the united nations system acknowledges that perceptions of the environment and the way the environment is used are historically socially and politically constructed and must be addressed as the cca analysis reveals afghanistan must accelerate its efforts urgently if the 2015 mdgs and targets are to be realised but the government cannot fulfil its objectives alone in large part its success will depend on the support of international and domestic partners including the united nations system the cca and its preparation bear testimony to the increased consultation and dialogue among the government the united nations system and development partners on sustainable human development and human security in afghanistan programming activities must all be designed with international human rights commitments and the millennium declaration in mind in the end transitions create uncertainty they tend to favour the present over the future the united nations system can do much to protect the future supporting rights based approach that moves the development agenda from the realm of charity to that of obligation as it moves forward with development of the undaf the focus on the poor and vulnerable as well as on duty bearers will be more deliberate this new approach also will be seen during its engagement with the prsp which precedes the undaf what this approach implies is more concerted and explicit engagement of other domestic and international partners local governments and communities ngos and civil society families the business community the media and academia alike in so doing the united nations system can help afghanistan stand firmly among the new democracies of the 21st century 75 76remarks nrva 6 share in food consumption nrva 2003 da
