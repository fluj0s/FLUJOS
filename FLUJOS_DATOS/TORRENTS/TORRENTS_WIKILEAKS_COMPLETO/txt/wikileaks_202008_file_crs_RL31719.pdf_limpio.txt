preparedness summary this report describes the us public health infrastructure the structure organization and legal basis of domestic public health ac tivities in contrast with healthcare public health practice is aimed at decreasing the burden of illness and injury in populations rather than indi viduals public health agencies use epidemiologic investigation laboratory testing informa tion technology public and provider education and other tools to suppor t their mission activities that in turn rely on an adequate and welltrai ned public health workforce federal leadership for public health is based in the department of health and human services hhs and in particular at the centers for disease control and prevention cdc most public health authority such as mandatory disease reporting licensing of healthcare providers and facilities and quarantine authority is actually based with states as an exercise of their police powers local and municipal health agencies vary in size governance and authority but they are th front line in responding to public health threats in 2001 terrorist attacks on the nation brought the weaknesses of our public health system into sharp focus prior to the 2001 terrorist attacks congress passed the public health threats and emerge ncies act pl 106505 to address the decaying public health infrastructure and to prepare for bioterrorism and other public health emergencies after the 2001 att acks congress passed the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107188 expanding grants to state health departments and adding new national hospital preparedness program as well as adding new food safety and security authorities protections for water infrastructure and other provisi ons congress also passed the homeland security act pl 107296 creating the new department of homeland security dhs to serve as coordi nation point for homeland secu rity activities and to house certain public health preparedness programs this report describes the nations public health infrastructure and authorities at the federal state and local levels it pr ovides history of rele vant legislation and appropriations both prior to and after the 2001 terrorist attacks in addition it describes selected public health pr eparedness programs at hhs and dhs this report also discusses number of issues in ensuring public health preparedness specific challenges include ensuring the coordinated planning for and response to emergencies by variety of public health and other governmental actors given that public health authority rests principally with states rather than the federal government setting goals and standards for preparedness at the federal state and local levels ensuring programma tic and fiscal accountability and steady progress toward goals and training and sustaining skilled workforce for public health at all levels of government the overarching challenge for policymakers is in making sound tradeoffs with finite resources ensuring allhazards preparedness for variety of emergencies while balancing resources appropriately between emergency preparedness and the prevention of injuries and chronic diseases that kill millions annually this report w ill be updated periodicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31719contents introduction 1 p u b l i c h l t h i n f r s t r u c t u r 3 v r v i w

terrorist attacks of 2001 in particular the anthrax mailings made clear that terrorism and other public health emergenc ies pose unique challenges to the nations healthcare and public health systems the threat of bombings and similar overt events requires that communities plan for the triage transport and treatment of large numbers of casualties in contrast the health impacts of biological or chemical attack can be covert unfolding gradually over time the speed accuracy and coordination of both the healthcare and pub lic health responses therefore have direct impact on the number of casualties from either type of event terrorism may pose the threat of both events simultaneously the covert event deliberately enveloped within the overt responding to health events of this type is new to the public health and healthcare communities and requires level of planning and coordination not seen before improving public health pr eparedness is expected to offer protection not only from terrorist attacks but also from naturally occurring public health threats this concept is often called dualuse public health officials are increasingly concerned about the spread of infectious diseases because of global travel increased global trade in food and other commodities nd the emergence of antibioticresistant pathogens they argue that if welldesigned the strong infrastructure needed to respond to natural disease threats such as west nile virus nd pandemic influenza will also improve the response to the threat of terrorism some have argued that much of the needed capability improved in formation technology systems or larger workforce for example is so versatile that it could improve the public health response to chronic disease th reats such as heart disease asthma and cancer as well on the other hand some specific scenar ios such as smallpox and pandemic influenza have been considered to pose an especially serious threat and each has been the subject of specific planning activities within the context of broader dualuse planning prior to the 2001 terrorist attacks severa l reports described the increasing threat posed by emerging infectious diseases and terrorism and the continued erosion of the public health system among the problems cited were health partment closures outmoded technology and information syst ems limited workforce with inadequate

preparedness programs bioterro rism training programs and programs to combat antimicrobial resistance among other measures this followed earlier legislation to control the shipment of potentially dangerous pathogens following the terror attacks of 2001 congress expanded its commitment to public health preparedness in the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response ac t of 2002 pl 107188 and through greatly enhanced appropriations for public health thes actions included expanding number of programs at cdc such as grants for state and local public health capacity and

preparedness and expanded food safety authorities for the food and drug administr ation fda congress also created the department of homeland security dhs to serve as coordination point for many emergency preparedness programs and for enhancement of funding for public health preparedness programs throug hout the federal government despite variety of efforts at the fede ral state and local levels since 2001 serious challenges remain in ensuring na tional preparedness for public health threats the biggest challenge for federal policymak ers is to move beyond planning for each worrisome scenario toward strategy based on analysis of threats and vulnerabilities in short to understand which are the top priorities in sea of competing urgent priorities this task is complicated by the decentralized nature of public health in which states and localities rather than the federal government are the seat of most authority and responsibility for public health in addition states claim legitimately that nationwide priority list would fail to address the variety of different vulnerabilities that exist from state to state many feel that versatile or allhazards capabilities make the most efficient use of resources at least until there is more mature strategic approach to prioritize scenariobased planning the public health community faces num ber of specific challenges as well

nally it discusses number of issues and challenges in ensuring public health preparedness public health infrastructure overview the mission of public health is to pr omote physical and mental health and prevent disease injury and disability2 the us public health system comprises wide array of governmental and nongovernmental entities including over 3000 county and city health departments and local boards of health 59 state and territorial health departments tribal health departments more than 160000 public nd private laboratories parts of multiple federal departments and agencies hospitals and other healthcare providers and volunteer organizations such as the red cross definitions vary but in practical terms public health infrastructure is the federal state and local public health or ganizations and the resources they need to operate effectively3 these governmental organizations form the nerve center of the public health systemand interact with wide array of other partners to ensure public health4 in the context of emergency prepare dness some key functions of the public health infrastructure include disease surveillance to detect outbreaks and to monitorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31719crs4 5 much of the material in this section is found in frank p grad the public health law manual 3rd ed american public health association 2004 and crs report rl31333 federal and state isolation and quarantine authority by angie welborn 6 the term police powers derives from the 10th amendment to the constitution which reserves to the states those rights and powers not delegated to the united states historically these have been interpreted to incl ude authority over the welfare safety health and morals of the public trends specialized laboratory testing to id entify bioagents both in individuals and in environments epidemiologic methods to identify persons at risk and to monitor the effectiveness of prevention and tr eatment measures knowledge of disease processes in populations to determine appropria responses such as quarantine decontamination or the dissemination of treatment recommendations and coordination with partners to establish effectiv planning and response to accomplish these tasks the public h ealth infrastructure relies on number of interdependent parts that encompass all levels of government as well as both the public and private sectors one element is the public health workforce typically this includes individuals employed in g overnmental public health though this group interacts with individuals employed in the healthcare sector in academia and in volunteer organizations another element is the healthcare sector which includes hospitals clinics pharmacies emergency medical services host of ancillary services and diverse healthcare workfo rce another element is the national complement of laboratories which function on three levels clinical laboratories which conduct testing on i ndividual patients within the healthcare system public health laboratories which conduc t testing to support popula tionbased programs and may involve testing of individuals as well as environmenta l assessment during terrorist event and research laboratories in which the study of biological agents the effects of treatments or other pursuits are not direc tly linked to detection and response in specific incidents but which provi the scientific basis to guide ongoing and future response efforts another element is the information technology infrastructure that supports disease surveilla nce and the rapid dissemination of information during potential emergencies the extent to which these elements and others are competent wellcoordinate d and otherwise ade quate for national preparedness is matter of considerable discussion these elem ents are discussed in greater detail in subseque nt sections that describe federal public h ealth programs and issues in preparedness legal framework for public health5 public health practice is governed by federal state and local law the federal government can influence public health pr actice through its funding decisions and by exercising its jurisdiction over interstate commerce however most public health authority rests with the states this section will review the legal authorities of federal state and local g overnments in public health most public health authority is based in the states as an exercise of their police powers 6 states use this authority in numbe r of ways to protect public health from enforcing safety and sanitary codes to conducting inspections to mandating thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31719crs5 7 for discussion of the exercise of federal and state authorities in response to the recent shortage of influenza vaccine see

law and the publics health at georgetown and johns hopkins universities at httpwwwpublichealthlawne tresourcesmodellawshtmreporting of certain diseases to state authorities to compelling isolation or quarantine to licensing healthcare work ers and facilities local governments are often responsible for some of these activ ities using powers largely derived from delegation of state authority since states are the basis for most authority in public health the traditional relationship of state and federal agencies has placed states in leading role with cdc providing suppor t through funding training and technical assistance advanced laborat ory support and data analysis and other activities the public health service act grants the secretary of hhs the authority to declare situation public health emergency which triggers an expansion of federal authority such as federal quarantine authority as n eeded the only such declaration made in recent memory was on september 11 2001 on the other hand even though states already have considerable power in respondi ng to public health events most can also declare public health emergencies and expand their powers further7 following the terrorist attacks of 2001 cdc awarded contract for the development of model state emergency health powers act and encouraged states to use the model in revamping state laws to ensure that they are adequate to meet the threats of terrorism and other public health emergencies8 the updated legal au thorities particularly isolation and quarantine aut hority proved helpful to cer tain states in managing severe acute respirator syndrome sars in 2003 though most public health authority is based in state law the federal government nonetheless exerts strong in fluence on public health practice through its ability to tax and spend and its respons ibility for regulating interstate commerce using its commerce authority the federal government can act to protect the environment ensure food and drug safe ty and promote occupational health and safety the power to tax allows the federal government to encourage certain behaviors eg deductibility of employee health insurance costs encourages employers to provide insurance and to discourage others eg raising taxes on cigarettes discourages smoking the fede ral government can also set conditions on the expenditure of federal funds for ex ample states must set 21 as the minimum age for the legal consumption of alcohol in order to qualify for federal highway funds federal public hea lth recommendations while lacking the force of law nonetheless often exert consid erable influence on medical and public health practice and may be incorporated into state laws the federal government also has au thority for disease control functions concerning entries of persons goods nd conveyances from other countries where its activities to compel disease reporting and impose quarantine mirror the activities carried out by states within their borders these activities are carried out by the cdc division of global migration and quarantin which operates number of quarantine stations at major ports recently the division has been involved in

activities are authorized in the public health service act namely the agen cy for healthcare research and quality cdc fda the health resources and services administration the indian health service the

for sars and ordering prohibition on the importation of certain african rodents to prevent monkeypox9 number of federal statut address public health in departments across the federal government most federal public health activity is based in hhs through authorities in the public health service act phsa and the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca in general the phsa authoriz the activities of the public health service agencies10 and creates important vehicles for federal funding of public health activities in states and communities the ffdca authorizes the fda to regulate the safety of f ood and cosmetics and the sa fety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices in addition to hhs most other departme nts have authorities relevant for public health though they may be specific or limited in scope three separate statutes grant authority to the us department of agriculture usda to ensure the safety of meat poultry and processed eggs important environmental health authorities are contained in the national environmental policy act as well as number of related laws that authorize the environmental protection agency epa to regulate the safety of the air water and the ecological system important occupational health authorities are found in the occupational sa fety and health osha nd mine safety acts the departments of defense and veterans affairs exercise authorities to protect the health of the specific populations they serv as does the federal bureau of prisons in the justice department the department s of energy and transportation also act to protect public health through specific authorities such as those governing radiation safety and highway safety respectively independent agencies such as the consumer product safety commission the national transporta tion safety board and the nuclear regulatory commission also exercise federal authorities that at least in part protect public health these examples are illustrative but by means exhaustive they do not encompass all of the many threads of federal activity that ultimately bene fit the publics health other provisions of federa l law address emergency preparedness and response the homeland security act created the department of homeland security dhs and grants the secretary of dhs broad leadership role in planning for and responding to emergencies as well as veral specific author ities for public health discussed in subsequent sections th stafford act establishes provisions for federal assistance to states in the event of disaster the act requires the governor of an affected state to request declarati on of disaster and vests the president withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31719crs7 11 iom reportthe authority to make such declaration and charge federal agencies to provide support to state and local efforts the diversity of federal authorities for public health and the dispersion of responsibilities across almost every federal department mean that many different agencies may be involved in protecting public health in emergencies in creating the department of homeland security congre ss called on its secretary to consolidate existing federal emergency response plans in to single coordina ted national response plan so that multiple federal agencies w ould work effectively with each other and with states and localities in response the new national respons plan is discussed further in subsequent section on issues for the 109th congress some have suggested that the threat of terrorism has made public health national security issue and that the federal government should therefore play stronger role others worry that stronger federal role will reduce flexibility they emphasize that the first response to any ev ent is local that localities have differing needs and that they therefore must have strong role in resource allocation decisions while the primacy of states in matters of health and safety is deeply rooted in the constitution laws and j udicial opinions of the united states government this decentralized approach to public health will continue to pose challenge in achieving nationa l preparedness for emergencies federal public health role and organization the 2002 report from the institute of medicine the future of public health in the 21st century identifies six main areas where the federal government plays role in population health the six areas are policy making financing public health protection collecting and disseminating in formation about health and healthcare delivery systems capacity building for popul

organization states have considerable autonomy in delivering public health services authorities for professional licensing dom estic isolation and quarantine contact tracing and mandatory disease reporting are based largely in state statute and regulation historically cdc has funded state public health agencies through cooperative agreements in which both parties and ideally local jurisdictions and other stakeholders as well are involved in setting goals and defining priorities public health services can be broadly classified into two types traditional populationbased services such as food insp ection and personal health services in the latter case some state health departments provide clinical services directly to certain groups and may be providersoflast resort for indigent individuals states often deliver public health services through number of different st ate agencies thirtyfive states have freestanding state public health agencies while in others public health is part of larger agency that is responsible for wider range of activities including for example medicaid programs21 some important public health activities may be housed outside the states primary public health agency for example in 36 states the environmental health agency is separate from the public health agency emergency medical serv ices may be housed in the public safety department or governed by separate ems authority or board when they are not housed in the public health agency in ma ny states food safety testing is performed by multiple government agencies namely in the departments of public health agriculture and environmental quality states differ in the amount of authority they delegate to local governments some states provide local governments with very little authority while others offer local jurisdictions home rule over public health matters delegation of public health authority can be classified into thr ee categories 1 centralized approach in which states have extensive legal and operational control over local authorities 2 decentralized approach in which local governments are delegated significant control and 3 hybrid approach in which some public hea lth responsibilities are provided directly by the state while others are assumed by the localities states also differ in how long they ve focused on bioterrorism number of states received funding under cdcs biot errorism initiative beginning in 1999 for variety of different capacitybuilding activities while state governments vary in both the breadth and depth of services th ey

size of populati on served and organization of the governmental public health infrastructure at the state and local levels differences in accounting practices and in definitions of public health activities make it difficult to gather comparable national information on public health expe nditures from all sources one specific difficulty involves counting all expenditures related to common set of public health activities for example environmental health regardless of where they are in the governmental structure another particularly difficult problem is separating expenditures and receipts for direct medical care services to individuals from those for populationbased services pilot study of two state and two local health depa rtments conducted in 1996 found that more than twothirds of pub lic health spending overall went toward providing personal health care services ra ther than to populationbased services though there was considerable variability between sites25 this finding was used to generate recently published estimates that showed total federal state and local expenditures for populationbased public health services of 171 billion representing 13 of total nati onal health spending for 200026 while that reported percentage had risen from baseline of 07 in 1960 certainty in the estimates means that this may not represent real growth in any case whatever growth

overview since the 2001 terrorist attacks congress has authorized new programs granted new regulatory authorities legislated reorganizations and substantially increased funding for homeland security activities acr oss the executive branch as result areas ripe for programmatic and fiscal ove rsight are abundant as are the challenges in spending wisely and crafting progra ms that truly make the nation safer one such challenge is determining whether the right balance has been struck between prevention detection and response given that they often fall to different departments or vels of government concerns about newly proposed surveillance systems such as biowatch and the biosurveillance initiative are illustrative these concerns include whether the systems will perform well enough to achieve their goal of speeding detection of largescale events and therefore whether they are good use of resources given competing demands th ere is concern about federal and state roles in conducting surveillance for the biosurveillance initiative in particular whether information from the system may bypass the states which have traditionally been the central collection points for public health data and be collected directly by federal agencies state officials note that they may therefore be unaware of incidents within their state until they are informed by federal authorities hence they are interested in the means by which salient findings will be defined by federal agencies and communicated to state nd local officials and others needing to know both programs are discussed further in appendix despite the efforts that have gone into setting up or expanding host of preparedness programs at all levels of government there are larger strategic questions that remain without answers at this time should the emphasis be on specific scenarios such as smallpox attack or pa ndemic influenza or should it instead be on broader allhazards preparedness activities is bioterrorism preparedness properly balanced with preparedness for chemical or radiological threats is the emphasis on public health emergency prepar edness in balance with effo rts to prevent and control major killers like cardiovascular disease and cancer threat assessments are vital aids in these deliberations but are often not available or do not incorporate the breadth of analysis needed to inform these larger tradeoffs36 in addition setting national priorities for prepar edness in public health is always complicated by its decentralized nature with states rather than the federal government playing the lead role in response congress is likely to continue its consideration of the place of preparedness at the table of competing national priorities some specific policy challenges are di scussed in

out breaks and other public health emergencies few of the benchmarks quantify specific needs such as types of equipment or training of personnel an example of quantitative requirement is the hrsa

indicators to measure the progress of state and local jurisdicti ons and was using contractor to conduct site visits and evaluate states48 cdc has not made the proposed indicators publicly available but the agency did ask the institute of medicines ioms committee on smallpox vaccination program implementati on to evaluate the proposed indicators in december 2003 the committee reported in letter to the cdc director that the dual goals of the indicators to measure grantees compliance with the cooperative agreements and to measure state and local preparedness could lead to an overly large set of indicators that serve neither purpose well the committee cautioned that evaluations based on outcomes require l ongerterm national deliberative process49 the committee also opined that separate i ndicators should be veloped and applied to state versus local jurisdictions and th at federal agencies themselves should also be held accountable through similar evaluati ons in addition based on feedback from variety of stakeholders in response to the indicators the committee noted the need for greater emphasis on communication and collaboration across jurisdictions and levels of government

in the development of meaningful performance measures for public health preparedness and whether the new measures will allow congress to better assess how much progress has been made since funding was enhanced in fy2002 in addition congress may wish to review the use of th enhanced preparedne ss funds to date and may for example request that the secretary of hhs provide information such as the

infectious diseases bioterrorism or emergency preparedness and response53 these categories roughly correspond to priorities in authorizing nguage given this broad definition of relevant programs if states are cutting immunization and other infection control programs as news reports suggest then it appears that the types of tradeoffs congress intended to avoid are occurring in fy2003 hhs required states to adopt comprehensive tracking system to account for federal funds from the cdc nd hrsa preparedness programs while this is likely to improve an understanding of the fate of federal dollars it is not likely to illuminate the matter of s upplanting since it will not track health department revenues from other sources future ig aud its may offer more critical analysis of budgets in each state but there remains the need for consistent terminology and definitions of programs for which maintenance of effort is required and consistent approach to budget documentation in every state until this

the initiative would gather data from existing sources of anonymous or deidentified health information such as hospital laboratory re ports and sales of overthecounter drugs collection and analysis of this type of prediagnostic health data is often called syndromic surveillance environmental monitoring da ta such as food testing results and findings of the biowatch network of ur ban air monitors would be integrated as well the project is intended to gather integrate and analyze these data in realtime the bi is one of number of public health data mining activities proposed since the terror

reports have suggested that eventually data mining for the initiative will be conduc ted by the department of ho meland security but that this activity is in its early stages and is currently performed at cdc in addition to improving detection and response to health emergencies other potential benefits of the bi may include strengthening of the public health infrastructure in general nd better coordination of res ponse partners at the local state and federal levels in particular the initiative is means to improve ongoing collaborations between the public health and healthcare sectors as with other event detection systems the tradeoff for enhan ced detection is the generation of false positive findings to which state and local pub lic health agencies must respond this must be incorporated in program implementation criticisms of the initiative are simila r to those for other newly proposed surveillance systems such as biowatch these include concerns about whether

goal of speeding detection of large scale events and therefore whether it is good use of resources given competing demands there is concern about federal and state role s in conducting surveillance in particular the fact that certain info rmation would bypass the states which have traditionally been the central collection points for public health data and be collected directly by federal agencies state officials note that they may therefore be unaware of incidents within their state until they are informed by federal authorities hence they are interested in the means by which salient findings will be defined by federal agencies and communicated to state and local officials and others needing to know in addition while the proposed system is inte nded to detect health events rather than individuals be they victims or perpet rators there may nonetheless be privacy concerns laboratory response network cdc80 the cdc established the laboratory response network lrn in res ponse to

potentially be used for bioterrorist attacks the initia l select agent regulation 42 cfr 726 administered by the cdc required the re gistration of any laboratory shipping or receiving the agents and documentation of these transfers the cdc developed list of select agents which are those viruses bacteria fungi and toxins that may pose severe threat to pub lic health and safety the public health security and biot errorism preparedne ss and response act of 2002 pl 107188 expands the scope of the select agent provisions by requiring all facilities possessing select agents not just those shipping or receiving them to register with cdc in addition pl 107188 instructs the hhs secretary in consultation with the attorney general to establish lab safety and security requirements for registered facilities commensurate with th level of risk to public health and safety and to institute background screenin g for all persons seeking access to select agents it also mandates the

this emergenc waiver was granted for soybean rust serious plant pathogen that entered the united states in the fall of 200482 in december 2002 hhs and usda issued interim final regulations to

detailed security training and recordkeeping plans in order to be regist ered by either hhs or usda those in possession of only the overlap agents need only register with one or the other not both in addition researchers had to undergo security background checks by the fbi institutions were to be in full complia nce by november 12 2003 an institution that had not been granted certificate of registration by that date would not be permitted to possess use recei ve or transfer select agen ts researchers biosafety experts and lab administrators complained that the deadline was unrealistic and that the substantial work needed for compliance might interrupt delay and possibly discourage research in fact the fbi was unable to complete all the security checks and hhs and usda were unable to finish reviewing all the applications in time to meet the deadline thus on november 3 2003 in order to avoid disruption of ongoing select agent research cdc and usda issued revised regulations allowing labs and researchers to obtain provi sional certification provided they had submitted all the appropriate paperwork the agencies are now reported to have processed their backlogs nd have certified those laborat ories and individuals that met the criteria laid out in the regulation the agencies are now able to work on new applications pl 107188 prohibits federal agenci from releasing information about registered facilities there was initially some confusion as to whether this provision applied to sharing information with state governments which could use the information to identify instate vulnerabilities for emergency planning purposes while states and individual labs are not subject to the prohibition cdc urges them to consider security risks that may result from disclosing information about possession of select agents such disclosures as well as the informal sharing of research samples were part of the routine conduct of scie ntific inquiry prior to the

agent progra m in response to concerns that the anthrax used in the 2001 mail attacks may have been obtained from us research facility alarmed by reports of weak security at labs where researchers study potentially deadly viruses and bacteria wmakers sought to improve lab security without unduly impeding vital biomedical and biodefense research while some academic and industry scientists have pr aised the government for striking an appropriate balance between science and security many in the research community are critical some scientists have discontinued research on select agents because of the security requirements and out of fear that breaking the new law even inadvertently could result in stiff criminal penalties as the anthrax attacks were unfolding in the fall of 2001 officials at the iowa state univ ersity destroyed their research collection of anthrax strains collected over decades fearing they would not have the resources to properly safeguard the collection in the new security climate83 scientists lamented the loss of this rich source of informati on which could potentially have been helpful in biodefense research and in the res ponse to possible future anthrax attacks clinical laboratories whic h may happen upon select agents in the course of their diagnostic work are required to either transfer or destroy the agents within week to be exempt from registration mandate that may also lead to problems for example an agricultural lab recently stroyed cattle tissue samples that tested positive for brucellosis before the results could be confirmed by staterun lab leading to confusion about the states brucellosisfree status84 the bacterium that causes brucellosis brucella abortus is select agent and the lab had elected to destroy the samples as

funds have been made available to health departments to prep are for distribution the sns has been deployed on several occasions in cluding the anthrax attacks of 2001 and falsepositive finding of anthrax contamination in district of columbia mailroom in 2003 the most common concern about the sns is skepticism about the ability of state and local public health agencies to rapidly disseminate stockpile contents in an emergency states are required to prepare and submit plans to the cdc outlining how they would accomplish this task which would require substantial complement of personnel involve numerous logistical tasks in patient screening and dispensing and require the presence of public safety officials states are also encouraged to test this capability through tabletop or wet

new regulatory authorities for the first time all foreign and domestic food facilities are re quired to register with the agency also fda now requires prior notice of all imported food shipments and ma detain suspicious foods for inspection while many feel that these new authorities were essential to further the agencys mission in an age of terror threats others are concerned about implementation of the new regulations and possible adverse effects on commerce some feel that new recordkeeping requirements will pose burde n for industry but will not substantially improve food safety furthe r there was initial concern that fda would not be able to review declarations of imported f ood shipments expediently and that the shipments would be delayed as re sult the fda established phasedin implementation plans for this and some othe r provisions of the law in an effort to minimize commercial disruptions87 programs that build stat and local capacity state and local prepar edness grants cdc in 1999 the cdc launched program to fund state health partments for biote rrorism preparedness recognizing that without dedicated sour ce of funds to prepare for diseases not routinely seen some states might not be able to prioritize these activities the program officially called the cooperative agreement on public health preparedness and response for bioterrorism was announced in the spring of 1999 technically funding through this program is made av ailable not through grants but through cooperative agreements between the cdc and states in which the pa rties cooperate in designating activities to be performed commonly these funds are referred to as grants though as they will be in this repor t this specific program is often referred to in hhs documents and elsewhere as state and local capacity or state and local preparedness grants for public health authority for this program is establishe d in the public health service act under provisions for public health emergencies 42 usc 247d3 when the program began in 1999 grants were to be competi tively awarded to elig ible entities which included states subdivisions of states or consortia of stat funds were to be used to address core public health capacity needs through planning training and laboratory and information technology impro vements the funds were not strictly limited to bioterrorism prepare dness but rather were to be used to prepare for public health emergencies including significant outbreaks of infectious diseases or bioterrorism the program was reauthoriz ed in the public health threats and

almost all stat had completed initial planning for all 14 benchmarks and were on their way to ward achieving the goals set for fy2003 funds as well89 while the fy2002 guidance focused mainly on planning the fy2003 guidance placed greater emphasis on activities that would demonstrate improved preparedness the main differences included availability of funding to increase laboratory capacity for chemical agents more specific guidance on smallpox preparedness activities and explicit recommendations and requirements that planning activities address mental health needs associated with terrorist attacks the fy2003 guidance also required that states implement more rigorous fiscal accounting system and document that significant porti on of local public health officials concur with the proposed use of funds as seen in appendix c benchmarks did not change appreciably between fy2003 and fy200490 partly because states were having some difficulty meeting the requirements and partly because hhs and cd c were working toward an alternative method of programmatic acc ountability an exception was the addition of new crosscutting benchmark ie it applied to both cd c and hrsa grant
