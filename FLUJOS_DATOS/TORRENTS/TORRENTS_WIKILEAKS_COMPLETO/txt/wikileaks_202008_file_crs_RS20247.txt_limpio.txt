new motor vehicles fact sheet david m bearden environmental information analyst resources science and industry division the clean air act amendments of 1990 established tier 1 standards to limit tailpipe emissions from new motor vehicles the law also required the environmental protection agency epa to determine if stricter controls would be necessary by model year my 2004 to assist states in attaining or maintaining the national ambient air quality standards epa also was required to assess the availability and costeffectiveness of technologies necessary to control emissions in report submitted to congress in august 1998 epa concluded that tougher standards are necessary and that essential technologies are available and costeffective1 as result epa finalized stricter tier 2 standards on february 10 20002 the new standards will be phased in beginning in my2004 and will require all new passenger cars and light trucks up to 8500 pounds and all new heavier passenger vehicles up to 10000 pounds including large sportutility vehicles to demonstrate full compliance by my2009 to improve the efficiency of emission control technologies oil refiners also will be required to limit gasoline sulfur levels to an average of 30 parts per million ppm nationwide beginning in 2005 roughly 90 less than the current national average of 340 ppm the new tier 2 standards will require vehicle manufacturers to reduce tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide co formaldehyde hcho nitrogen oxides nox non methane organic gases nmog and particulate matter pm however manufacturers will have the flexibility to average the nox emissions of their vehicle fleets to demonstrate compliance with the standards instead of certifying each vehicle according to the same stringency the standards will require the most reductions in emissions of nmog and nox to help control the formation of groundlevel ozone pollution relative to the tier 1 standards the fleet average standard for nox will require vehicle manufacturers to reduce overall tailpipe emissions by 88 to 95 the standards also will require at least an 80 reduction in pm emissions but will require less stringent reductions in co emissions the standard for hcho is new requirement that is intended to reduce emissions of carcinogenic pollutants the table on page 2 compares the current tier 1 standards which became effective in my1994 to the new tier 2 standards that will be phased in beginning in my2004 1 epa office of air and radiation tier 2 report to congress july 31 1998 55 p 2 epa federal register february 10 2000 p

life benchmark to 120000 miles if manufacturer voluntarily chooses to certify vehicle to higher useful life of 150000 miles compliance with the tier 2 intermediate standards is optional b tier 1 vehicles are subject to the testing procedure for nmhc but tier 2 vehicles will be subject to the testing procedure for nmog both pollutants are closely related hydrocarbon compounds that can combine with nox in the presence of sunlight to form groundlevel ozone pollution epa selected the nmog testing procedure under tier 2 because it more accurately measures hydrocarbon levels c each manufacturer will have the flexibility to select any set or bin of emission standards when certifying different models of vehicles as long as it meets the fleet average requirement for nox emissions d during the
