performance and sizing 6c1 methodologytools the process used for the preliminary performance and sizing of the launch vehicle lv and earth departure stage eds concepts is shown in figure 6c1 of this appendix based upon the mission requirements for the particular concept under study and within the framework of the ground rules and assumptions gras established preliminary concept is sized using the mass estimating relationships mers in the integrated rocket sizing program intros an initial trajectory is flown of this vehicle in the program to optimize simulated trajectories post to determine the ascent flight environments accelerations dynamic pressure payload capability etc and then the initial vehicle weights and trajectory outputs are sent for more detailed structural sizing with launch vehicle analysis lva loads forces material properties and design techniques are all considered within the lva analysis and new structural weights are calculated for the lv or eds concept intros then incorporates these new structural element weights and estimates total injected mass based on the total ideal delta velocity from the previous post output post then determines new total injected mass and ideal delta velocity intros takes these values from post and estimates new value for propellant reserves and continues to iterate with post until the post total injected mass is within 0 lb to 300 lb of the intros estimated value the performance and sizing analysis for this concept is then considered closed and vehicle summary is generated the vehicle configuration description and mass summary for the vehicle and its elements are then sent to the cost team for cost analysis the vehicle configuration description and closed case trajectory summary are also sent to the team for their analysis

at msfc to establish lv designs and sizing it is written in visual basic for applications computer language and uses the excel application for all input and output launch vehicle design and sizing are based on stage geometry and mass properties mass properties are established for selections from large master list of lv systems subsystems propellants and fluids mass calculations are based on mers that are automatically generated from large database of mers that is built into the program program mass calculation accuracy for existing and historical lvs has been verified to be well within 5 percent lva is standalone application written at msfc in visual basic that provides extremely fast lv structural design and analysis it is important to note this program does not use weight estimating or scaling routinesit supplies detailed analysis by using timeproven engineering methods based on material properties load factors aerodynamic loads stress elastic stability deflection etc for the fastest turnaround the program is designed to work with the absolute minimum of input data the output data is purposely limited to the least possible quantity to prevent the analyst from having to dig through large amount of data for the necessary information lva and its predecessors have been serving nasa for more than 20 years maximum dynamic pressure max q and maximum acceleration max g are run as the maximum for the class of vehicle loads are run as single combined worst case structural analysis is run to within 510 percent of closing the results are these values post3d program to optimize simulated trajectories is fortran 77based legacy code developed by nasa langley for detailed trajectory simulations quoting from the introduction in the utilization manual post is generalized point mass discrete parameter targeting and optimization program post provides the capability to target and optimize point mass trajectories for powered or unpowered vehicle near an arbitrary rotating oblate planet post has been used successfully to solve wide variety of atmospheric ascent and reentry problems as well as exoatmospheric orbital transfer problems the generality of the program is evidenced by its nphase simulation capability which features generalized planet and vehicle models this flexible simulation capability is augmented by an efficient discrete parameter optimization

are well understood during the benchmarking activity for nafcom it was discovered that the cost estimating relationships cers for avionics were significantly different from the contractors this difference led to nafcom developers reviewing the database and statistical analysis of the avionics cers one result of this exercise was to drop very old avionics data points as unrepresentative of modern avionics in addition to the cer adjustment the avionics mass estimating relationships mers used in the intros lv sizing program were revised previous mers were derived from sts data centaur stage data shuttle c heavylift launch vehicle hllv and other studies leading to much heavier weight input into nafcom than would be expected with modern electronics in recent years avionics have changed considerably due to such things as electronics miniaturization and function integration stateoftheart avionics masses are considerably less than what was previously used in intros revised mers were provided by msfcs avionics department for gnc actuator control radio frequency rf communications instrumentation data managementhandling and range safety the revised mers were used within nafcom

is well understood and used on existing systems today electrical power is provided by silverzinc batteries with redundancy of two conversion distribution and circuitry are considered new designs with stateoftheart technology hydraulic power is hydrazine fueled used in lvs today reaction control systems rcss when used are the same type as used in the shuttle today range safety will require modifications to the flight termination system fts to add time delay for abort humanrating requirements may require the removal of the autodestruct capability all of these subsystems are similar to those already in existence either on eelvs or shuttle and have been validated in the relevant environment full qualification and testing is estimated for all crew and cargo vehicles 6c51102 ddte 122 nasaspaceflightcomthe lowest cost option uses the existing foursegment rsrb and the modified ssme of the two fivesegment configurations the vehicle that uses only one j2s engine is cheaper than the vehicle that requires four lr85s 6c51103 production lv 131 lv 15 and lv 16 are single srbbased crew vehicles with either four or fivesegment booster modified from the current shuttle srbs as described above the modifications will enable the integration of the booster with an upper stage the recurring production costs of these three concepts are very close and within the accuracy of the model although the foursegment srm is slightly cheaper to refurbish than the fivesegment version the cost of refurbishing and reloading single motor segment is relatively small the cost of the expendable space shuttle main engine essme equipped upper stage more than offsets this savings so that lv 131 has the highest recurring production cost lv 16 with the single j2s upper stage has the lowest production cost while lv 15 with four lr85 engines is slightly higher 6c51104 launch operations all of these concepts require the stacking of either four or fivesegment srb with modified forward skirt and the interface to the interstage the srm segments are refurbished in the same manner as in the current shuttle operation described previously in the production section portion of the interstage is also refurbished item the upper stage upper stage engine and part of the interstage are newly manufactured hardware the launch operations activities include receipt checkout stacking and integration testing transport to the launch pad pad operations and launch the cost of launch operations is lowest for lv 16 and greatest for lv 131 however the difference at six flights per year is slight 6c51105 facilities the facilities costs include modifications to mobile launch platform mlp vehicle assembly building vab and launch pad to accommodate the different profile and footprint of the inline srb

appropriate scaling of the risk an equati on was developed equation 2 based on the estimated catastrophic failure probability of the rd180 and nk33 engines which are very similarly designed engines but with signi ficant vacuum thrust differences the rd 180 is 933000 lbf vac thrust engine wh ile the nk33 is 367600 lbf vac thrust engine equation 2 is assumed to hold for all types of engines in the

shutdown is caused either by offnominal operation which is detected by sensor or by erroneous sens or readings that trigger an engine cutoff benign shutdown usually leads to an loss of mission lom event for vehicles that do not have engineout capability the statistical analysis of benign engine failure probability as function of burn time follows weibull distribution and is theref ore not linear with engi ne burn time rather the failure probability is sk ewed towards engine start 2 as shown in figure 6d2 the weibull equation given in equation 4 is termined by two parameters the scale

explai ns the calculation of the η eta values used in the weibull distribution for the benign engine s hutdown failure probability this explanation is essential since the msfc team did not provi direct failure proba bilities for benign engine shutdown instead the team provided persecond catastrophic failure rates through estimating reliability growth and catastr ophic failure fractions cffs through expert opinion these values are in table 6d1 with the resulting η values the provided cff and persecond catastrophic failure rate is used to find the corresponding benign failure probability si nce benign failure probabilities are not calculated in persecond it generic mission burn time of 515 sec was selected in order to apply the cff to derive consiste nt failure probabilities therefore the catastrophic failure rate per second is convert ed to an overall mission failure probability for an assumed engine burn time of 515 sec equation 5 515 persec icf m icf eng p eng p the resulting benign failure probability for 515 sec is then calculated using the cff ratio as shown in equation 6 equation 6 515515 515 eng pcffeng peng picficf bgn from the mission benign failu re probability

failure the outcomes of engine shutdowns are f unction of the state of the vehicle ie velocity thrusttoweight tw etc and th ability of the vehicl remaining engines to compensate for the lost thrust first handl two types of engine shutdown initiated vehicle outcomes delayed catastrophic failure dcf and be nign vehicle failure bgn for expendable vehicles dcf and bgn failures both lead to lom the difference between the two is that delayed ca tastrophic failure implies an imminent loss of control of the vehicle while benign vehi cle failure implies that vehicle maintains sufficient thrust even though th remaining impulse is not sufficient to make the mission for single engine core or upper stages an engine shutdown would be catastrophic since there would be total loss of thrust and an im plied loss of control of the vehicle in this case the probability of dcf is equivalent to th at of the bgn failure probability and if the stage is airstarted the startup failure probability for multiengine stages the probability of dcf decreases with the number of engines the algorithm in first that is used to estim ate the probability of delayed catastrophic failure utilizes the tw and the throttle up ability of the vehicle to determine the 196 nasaspaceflightcom consequences of engine shutdowns ascent is broken into multiple regions depending on the number of stages as region 1 liftoff to clear tower region 2 clear tower to 1st stage separation region 3 1st stage separation to 2nd stage separation region 4 2nd stage separation to 3rd stage separation region m n1th stage separation to nth stage main engine cutoff meco the vehicle must maintain critical tw ratios after engine shutdowns or it will suffer dcf the basic trend is decrease in the re quired tw ratio in each region as the vehicle gains momentum and loses weight the nominal tw ratio profile is calculated within first as equation 8 twt v tpt dragtgwpt where twt is the tw ratio of the vehicle vtpt is the vehicle thrust profile dragt is the drag prof ile of the vehicle and gwpt is the gross weight profile of the vehicle all variables are timedependent in this eq uation angle of attack effects are assumed negligible the maximum tw is calculated for each engi ne shutdown scenario the scenarios are calculated for combinations of engine shut downs per stage the maximum tw that vehicle can attain after losi ng the thrust of one or more engines on stage is the instantaneous tw of the vehicle times the ra tio of the maximum thru st available to the vehicle relative to the instan taneous thrust of the vehicle this method assumes that the engines ramp up to their maximum power vel as soon as an engine shutdown is detected 6d1117 maximum thrusttoweight vailable after engine shutdown the general

and the times at which the vehicl can sustain engine s hutdowns determined 6d1118 thrusttoweight ratios once the maximum tw profile is calculated the following assumptions are used to calculate the

198 nasaspaceflightcom the majority of risk occurs in the first 10 to 30 seconds of flight and is due to many factors the tw limit is the most stringent at liftoff due mainly to the fact that any translation of the vehicle may cause contact w ith the tower since benign engine failure is skewed towards engine start see figure 6d2 in section 6d1114 benign engine failure the probability of delayed catastrophic failure due to contained engine shutdowns starts at its highest value at liftoff and decrease s during the vehicles ascent 6d1119 engine startup failures groundstart failure probability holddown failures are failures that occur whil the launch vehicle is still on the ground and do not contribute to foms in first holddown failures occur when liquid engines or solid rocket motors srms either fail to ignite or in the case of liquid engines are shutdown due to reaching the redline limits for vehicles with liquid engines it is assumed that if any engine fails to start the remaining engines in the cluster are shut down and the launch is scrubbed on vehicles with multiple shuttletype srbs failure of any of the srbs to ignite causes an immedi ate catastrophic event and in the case of crewed vehicles necessitates an abort in th case of inline shuttlederived vehicles sdvs that use single srb failure of th srb to ignite is considered holddown failure and does not contribute to the foms airstart failure probability for series burn vehicles there is an inhere nt risk of an upper st age engine or engine cluster failing to start airstart failure pr obabilities for the were based on expert opinion and the limited historic data listed in table 6d1 aside from the specific startup failure probabilities the following assumptions were made regarding airstarted stages for an engine cluster two or more engines there is 10 percent chance that any single engine startup failure will cause the entire cluster to fail to start ie the probability of the entire clus ter failing to start is 10 percent of the startup failure probability the startup period from ignition to fu ll stable thrust is instantaneous transients the cluster startup failure is independent of manifold complexity changes for differe nt number of engines in cluster overall engine size and nominal thrust level of the engine the probability of catastrophic uncontain ed failure during engine

and in space stages reliability trades on engine cycle number of engines and engineout scenarios were performed 6d1131 system description and reliability logic model the liquid propulsion system reliability model reflects systems approach to reliability modeling ie the model simulates an engine in propulsion system that includes main propulsion system elements and avionics elements figure 6d6 shows the modeled liquid propulsion system the model reflects t hose physical elements that would have significant contribution to stag reliability for example an engine purge system is indicated because of the potential requirement for restart however while filland drain system would be presen t physically such system w ould be verified and latched prior to launch commit note that since th engine interface requirements are not known the avionics pneumatics and hydraulic subsystems are modeled as combined elements figure 6d6 liquid propulsion system schematic the liquid propulsion system reliability model described here is an event driven monte carlo simulation of the schematic shown in figure 6d6 for each event the cumulative failure distribution is randomly sampled to ob tain timetofailure the timetofailure is compared to mission burn time if the timetof ailure is less than the burn time failure is recorded figure 6d7 shows the top event logic for th reliability model note that parallel events indicate that failure in any one path is system failure figure 6d7a shows the toplevel events where the engine cluster is modeled in parallel with failures in the purge system and external leakage events figure 6d7b shows the further breakdown of the cluster where each engine is modeled along with support systems figure 6d7c shows the further breakdown of the ngine support systems to include the pneumatics hydraulics and avioni cs provided to the engines figure 6d7d shows the 208 nasaspaceflightcom sequence of events modeled at the individua l engine level to include isolation valve failures and engine start and main stage failures figure 6d7 event logic model for engineout cases if first benign failure is recorded then the burn time is scaled by the ratio of the original number of ngines divided by the number of remaining operational engines the timetofailures for the remaining operational engines are compared to this new extended burn time if the timetofailure of any one of the remaining operational engines is less than the new extended burn time then stage failure is recorded 6d1132 data sources and event quantification the data source for quantifying the nonengine events is the current version of the probabilistic risk assessment for the sp ace shuttle orbiter main propulsion system provided by johnson space center the one excepti on is that the avionics failure rates for the space shuttle orbiter were not available the engine controller failure rates for the ssme were used instead table 6d6 shows the failure parameters that were

data in order to make the appropriate adjustments it was necessary to an alyze historical data to determine the reliability growth profile experienced over the life of the ssme program data file was obtained that provided the chronological list of the test and operations data for ssme through the last shuttle flight and tests completed subsequent to that flight the total accumulated time was approxi mately 1000225 sec the initial estimate of the parameters of the ssme reliability growth model included all failures indicated in the file at the time it was known that some of the failures were properly categorized as facility failures however the data did not clearly distinguish between which failures resulted from facility issues and which were attributable to the ssme in order to properly estimate the reliability growth of the ssme it was necessary to identify failures attributable to the ssme nd to further distinguish between failures that would result in loss of mission lom criticali ty 2 failures and those that would result in loss of crew loc criticality 1 failures in searching for the appropriate data it was determined that numerous versions of lists existed identifying the specific ssme failures as subset of the total failures the team settled on list of 76 failures accepted 211 nasaspaceflightcom by the ssme project office at msfc as the ba sis for estimating the parameters of the ssme reliability growth model these failures were entered into the testoperation history time line as either criticality 1 or 2 fa ilures allowing estimation of the parameters of the ssme reliability growth model consider ing criticality 1 failures only criticality 2 failures only and the combined criticality 1 and 2 failures the parameters were estimated by performing linear regression on the data points in the plot of lncumulative tes toperation time versus lnc umulative failures where cumulative failures were either crit icality 1 criticality 2 or both reliability growth model various reliability growth models are available to use in describing the growth experienced by ssme because the army mate rial system analysis activity amsaa reliability growth model was applied to some componentlevel ssme data it was selected as the model for describing the engine growth the amsaa model takes the form θitαβtα1β where θit the instantaneous mean time between failure mtbf at time t β the shape parameter of the amsaa model α the scale parameter of the amsaa model in order to obtain estimates of the parameters of the amsaa model chronological data on cumulative testoperations time and failu res experienced was used the number of failures during any cumulative period of time t is given by the equation nt tαβ this is converted to linear equation by taki ng the natural logarithm of each side to yield lnnt β lnt β lnα the parameters are then estimated by plotting the natural logarithm of cumulative testoperation time on the xaxis versus the natural logarithm of cu mulative failures on the yaxis the slope of the be st fit line through these data po ints provides an estimate of the value of β the value of α is estimated by setting the intercept of the best fit line equal to β lnα the value of α is then calculated using the formula α eyintercept β since the similarity analyses were ba sed on qras 2000 criticality 1 values the criticality 1 reliability grow th model was used the parameters obtained were α 1620089 β 08191 intercept 79393 figure 6d8 below shows the regression analysis performed on the data to obtain these values 212 nasaspaceflightcom figure 6d8 regression analysis reliability growth model applied to other engines in order to use the amsaa model obtained from the ssme to compensate for the immaturity of the engines find parameter c such that өnewengine t c өssmee t this is accomplished by using the similarity analysis values and taking the fraction өnewengine t өssme t c since the instantaneous mt

time of the new engine and where t new t this produces өnewengine tnew cαβtnew α1β and provides an estimate of the compensation for the immaturity of the new engine in actuality the parameter c is also function of ct but in the interest of time and due to the lack of data the c onstant c provides good estimate and as long as the same methodology is applied to each case the results should be consistent uncertainty in reliability growth the estimate of the uncertainty in the reliability growth model comes directly from the uncertainty in the parameters which in turn comes from the

is based on historical data the historical data shows that in the early years of rocketry avionicssoftware contributed approximately 15 percent to unch failures from 1958 to 1997 propulsion systems both liquid and solid steadily came to dominate launch failures with up to 90 percen t of launch failures due to propulsion systems from 1988 1997 for atlas delta and titan vehicles most launch vehicle reliability assessments are based on this data concentrated on estimating propulsion system failures as an indication of launch vehicle failure probability the hist oric data also shows that the trend has sharply transitioned since 1980 with avioni cssoftware and structures contributing approximately 70 percent to launch failures fo r us launch vehicles the reason for this sharp reversal is unclear as is the possibility that this trend will continue in the next generation of expendable launch vehicles howev er all three of the four known avionics failures occurred within 9month period from 19981999 and none have occurred since in us launch vehicles also it was assumed that every launch vehicle would have two fault avionics to meet nasa safety requirements 214 nasaspaceflightcom

parametric cost model based on 122 nasa and air force space flight hardware projects the database includes launch vehicles robotic satellites humanrated spacecraft and the space shuttle resume content includes mission description major changes or unusual events and work breakdown structure wbs subsystem descriptions that allow an analyst to put the cost technical and programmatic data in perspective recent updates to the model include benchmarking activity with contractors and an internal assessment of the statistical fit of the historical data the model will generally do good job of estimating unless the input variables are significantly in error andor the project experiences major cost drivers not modeled by the cost estimating relationships 6e11 benchmarking msfc engineering cost group and saic msfcs nafcom development contractor worked with lockheed boeing and northrop grumman to benchmark nafcom with relevant and recently completed missions using atlas v delta iv rs68 eosaqua genesis and geosynchronous operations environmental satellite goes benchmarking was used to identify potential areas of improvement and to measure the model improvements incorporated due to the benchmarking activities results of the final phase of benchmarking showed close comparisons to actual costs at the top level except for atlas v which is attributable to the rd180 engine estimate 6e12 nafcom assessment and improvements nafcoms cost estimating relationships cers were developed using manned and unmanned spacecraft and launch vehicles each subsystem is analyzed by mission class weight class launch year etc comparing actuals to cer estimates at the total and subsystem level in addition to the benchmarking activities recent improvements included review of all subsystem cers some modifications include the addition of new cost drivers eg weightvolume ratio for ecls stratification of data according to mission type incorporation of launch year for improvements based on year of technology and removal of pre1976 missions for some subsystems eg command control and data handling ccdh the combined changes improved the goodnessoffit statistics on the average of 8 percent for correlation coefficients and 22 percent for standard error msfc continually improves the model to increase estimating capability and credibility 6e13 cost estimating methodology and ground rules and assumptions the nafcom model was used to estimate prime contractor design development test and evaluate ddte and theoretical first unit tfu costs using engineering assessments for subsystem input parameters tfu cost is defined as the cost to produce one unit at rate of one per year the total vehicle was estimated except for the crew launch escape system the was estimated by the crew exploration vehicle cev team shuttle program and contractor inputs for shuttle elements and engines were used where applicable after verification and adjustment for content by program and engineering assessments eelv inputs were based on extensive discussion and coordination with eelv contractors and an engineering teams assessment of 286 nasaspaceflightcom modifications required for human rating the eelvs all launch vehicle costs include structural test article sta and main propulsion test article ddte also includes three test flights for crewed vehicles and one test flight for cargo vehicles and facilities which are estimated outside of nafcom as discussed below software estimates were developed using the seer model with results entered into the appropriate nafcom wbs seer inputs were based on an assessment of the functional requirements for launch vehicles by the software engineering team at msfc vehicle physical integration of stages into complete launch vehicle was an additional 4 percent of ddte based on nasa experience standard fee of 10 percent was used and 25 percent reserve was added to each vehicle estimate us government oversight of 25 percent was included as full cost accounting factor the full cost accounting factor includes civil service salaries travel infrastructure upkeep utilities security cost of facilities and corporate general and administrative ga

excelbased parametric model developed for the estimation of space launch systems operations costs for the purpose of modeling in ocm launch system operations are defined as those activities that are required to deliver payload from launch site on the earths surface to low earth orbit leo the ocm wbs cost elements represent the full complement of products and services potentially required to operate launch vehicle the cost elements are arranged into four segments program p vehicle v launch operations l and flight operations f the individual wbs cost elements are assigned to one of these four segments estimating cost for every wbs cost element is not required nor is it necessarily expected for instance an unmanned vehicle would not be expected to have costs for f7 crew operations or v2 reusable hardware refurbishment figure 6e1 below shows the wbs cost element arrangement 287 nasaspaceflightcom figure 6e1 ocm cost element work breakdown structure the wbs structure is based generally on the shuttle delta and atlas program organizations the program segment elements represent toplevel program management and systems engineering activities the vehicle segment reflects all the activities and tasks required to support the launch system with the provision of flight hardware either through the refurbishment of reusable items or the manufacture of expendable items with the vehicle segment production costs can be estimated for each element in the vehicle wbs the launch operations segment generally includes those products and services provided at the launch site eg kennedy space center ksc or cape canaveral air force station ccafs while flight operations contains the products and services associated with johnson space center jsc or the center of engineering operations there are different individual cost elements for program management and support provided within each segment p1 v7 l4 and f8 this provides the flexibility to model different levels of program management for different vehicle elements contractual elements configuration items or other types of hierarchical program structures which might have multiple levels of significant program management efforts some all or none of the elements can be removed from the estimate if desired wbs elements highlighted in the above figure are not currently in use in ocm elements f5 and f9 are blank and may be employed in subsequent model version p3 system logistics is included as placeholder for future incorporation of aircraftlike operations estimating capabilities within the model for this analysis only the vehicle segment of ocm was used to estimate the recurring production costs of flight hardware elements launch operations costs as defined above were estimated by ksc personnel

linear approximation of production costs estimated at different production rates using rate curves and tfu costs derived from historical data or from nafcom an example using essme production is shown

the production capability is assumed to be 16 engines per year the area of acceptable approximation in the above figure would stretch to the right and the line representing the linear approximation would flatten out as it passed through the power curve at close to 16 engines rather than close to 10 the yintercept or fixed cost would increase and the slope or variable cost would decrease this is consistent with having to increase plant production capacity by adding equipment and staff fixed cost and decreasing the cost of materials variable cost by buying in greater quantities at the same time the gap or variance between the blue rate curve and the red linear approximation would be greater in the midrange of production than seen above indicating that engine cost estimates in the midrange of production would tend to be lower than actual costs 289 nasaspaceflightcom fixed and variable costs may be aggregated at the segment level if desired the annual cost for any production or flight rate for any hardware element can be estimated from the fixed and variable costs using the above equation this allows the analyst to estimate annual operating costs in the face of variations in production or flight rates from year to year ocm is predicated on operations as an ongoing concern that is to say while there may be variations in output from year to year such as more or fewer flights than nominal number operation is continuous with full fixed costs incurred ie staff or capacity reductions even in periods when there is little activity otherwise some means of estimating fluctuations in the fixed costs would be necessary requiring very detailed level of information on manufacturing practices 6e3 general assumptions and ground rules in general conservative approach was adopted production of hardware for all architectural configurations was estimated as for manned systems whether the vehicle was designated as crew or cargo for shadow estimates of program launch and flight operations given the high degree of uncertainty in current expendable systems programs for example the effects of boeinglockheed martin merger into the united launch alliance ula ocm factors for manned and reusable configurations were also applied to the expendable concepts the mannedreusable setting in ocm yields the highest cost for all operations elements while the unmannedexpendable setting results in the lowest this rule was applied to simplify the analyses and account for at least some of the uncertainties in conservative manner for all except the primary operations element for hardware element production expendable hardware production v1 or reusable hardware refurbishment v2 see figure 6e1 ratio analysis rather than parametrics was used in ratio analysis the costs for v3 through v7 are ratios of v1 andor v2 rather than being based on pertinent parameters the exception to this is the reusable srb and srm elements for which more detailed production data was available 6e4 recurring launch operations costs the used datadriven methodology for recurring yearly launch operations the focus on closing the gap between the retirement of the shuttle orbiters and the development of the capability to provide crewed launches for exploration had the direct effect of reducing the tradespace provided for operations analysis to elements of architectures that already exist and are operational eg solid rocket boosters srbs external tanks ets space shuttle main engines ssmes atlas or delta size diameter tanks and core boosters the differences in data quality between elements were driven by the following shuttle systems have relative wealth of operations data the principal issue of data quality is that amidst wealth of data standard set exists for the conditions required to support cost estimation and basic tool model or sets of estimating relationships exist with which diverse experts might still consistently use such data and arrive at similar conclusions 290 nasaspaceflightcom for estimation the shuttle data used was in fy 05 steadystate dollars but did not include upgrades expenditures or post columbia returntoflight effects expendable launch vehicles elvs have lack of public openness as to data as well as relatively short lived history for what data is available this has created few opportunities for the operations community to analyze

nasaspaceflightcom appendix 6f eelv modifications for human rating the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv program was intended to provide for reliable access for commercial and military payloads hence considerations for flying crew were never factored into the original design of the vehicles the mercury and gemini program used vehicles originally designed for other purposes for launching crews to orbit to do so modifications were performed to provide for increased reliability redundancy failure detection and warning and removing hardware not necessary for the crew launch mission the same considerations would be required in order to utilize the eelv fleet to launch crew to and from earth orbit 6f1 humanrating requirement drivers the technical requirements for human rating are in npr 87052a human rating requirements for space systems the document applies human rating at the system level identifying the system as launch vehicle lv and spacecraft allocation between the lv and spacecraft is provided for in subsequent system requirements documents for the elements for this study npr 87052a is the basis for evaluating the eelv fleet to ascertain the modifications necessary for carrying crew to earth orbit the main requirement drivers from npr 87052a are specifications and standards twofault tolerant systems crewsystem interactions pademergency egress abort modes software common cause failures manual control on ascent and flight termination system the eelv fleet was built primarily to company standards and processes the eelv was developed to high level system requirements and aerospace industry design practices or standards were imposed at the time the program was implemented high reliability was to be demonstrated with multiple commercial launches before committing government payloads in response to the commercial launch market collapse and resulting loss of demonstrated and envisioned reliability gains government mission assurance was ramped up with support from the aerospace corporation and the national reconnaissance office nro the new cy2005 buy iii will now include government mission assurance requirements and standards for the eelv these standards would need thorough evaluation and approval against nasa standards and processes in order to be used for flying crewed missions with changes and additions implemented to close known gaps in requirements one of the most important requirement drivers is the requirement for twofault tolerance to loss of life or permanent disability npr 87052a also states that abort cannot be used 297 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 2 for nasa internal use only in response to the first failure this implies that the lv must be at least single fault tolerant and for subsystems that are required for abort it must be twofault tolerant eelv will require upgrades in certain areas to achieve single fault tolerance in order to fly crew for any launch system the crew must have certain situational awareness and be able to react to contingencies based on that awareness as such npr 87952a contains many requirements that deal with the crews ability to monitor health and status and take appropriate actions as result of that status if required this will require upgrades in the eelv avionics architecture to accommodate an interface with the spacecraft as well as be able to accept certain commands from the crew for the lv these commands will primarily be for contingency situations and will be for things such as abort initiation retargeting aborttoorbit ato and responses to other contingencies manual control is also response to contingency although its use would primarily be limited to second stage where structural and thermal margins allow manual control the form of manual control would be the subject of future trade studies and could be classical yoke control to series of discrete commands to allow retargeting and ato scenarios another important requirement is the requirement to provide for successful abort modes from the pad through the entire ascent profile this will require the eelv to be modified to provide the data necessary for abort decisionmaking it may also require computer and software for making the decision or system that may reside with the spacecraft this is subject of future trade study regardless of the outcome of that trade significant effort on the lv will be required for health management and abort decisionmaking other requirements such as protection against software common cause failures and flight termination systems fts are not extensive as those discussed but require some effort on the lv to implement protection against common cause software failures can take several forms and is discussed in npr 87052a in the case of fts the eelvs utilize autodestruct with lanyard pull devices to initiate an fts event human spaceflight has never utilized autodestruct and the utility of using these devices needs to be examined lanyard pulls allow the booster first stage to not have dedicated receiver and command decoder unit being able to accept the commands from the second stage and being capable of autodestruct in the event of inadvertent separation removal of the autodestruct may require addition of the dedicated receiver and command decoder unit on the first stage 6f2 eelv modifications for human rating for the design reference mission drm four vehicles were examined see section 6 launch vehicles and earth departure stages of the final report only the atlas v heavylift vehicle hlv with the existing upper stage and new upper stage and delta iv hlv with new upper stage were considered for assessing modifications for flying crew in some cases detailed assessments were possible in other cases only the type of issues and resultant potential modifications were identified depending upon the fidelity of data available from the commercial launch provider in either case the goal of the analysis was to make reasonable judgments concerning the nafcom model inputs to provide valid cost assessments and ascertain potential schedule issues 298 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 3 for nasa

meets the minimum singlefault tolerant requirement those elements needed for abort are twofault tolerant in the case of the integrated lvhm option the core functions also get enhanced redundancy over the kit approach the software lines of code sloc for new build avionics system was estimated as follows events manager 50 hz 500 to 1000 sloc navigation manager 50 hz 8 to 15 ksloc guidance manager 1

sloc vehicle management software 55 to 165 ksloc total sloc 103 to 267 ksloc the large range in values is due to the vehicle management software that incorporates the lvhm fault detection isolation and recovery fdir and abort decisionmaking at present there is large uncertainty concerning the extent of lvhm that will be required and will be the subject of future trade studies the estimates for software were lowered for the avionics approach of figure 6f2 where much of the core avionics is kept intact and thus much of the flight software the software estimate for this case was 103 to 165 ksloc for the avionics approach of figure 6f3 the approach was to assume primarily totally new software load for the estimate as that approach although using some of the gnc and electrical power existing system it results in new flight computer with lvhm functionally integrated with the system 6f212 first stage main propulsion the primary focus of the effort was to examine changes required to

included the following engine trades single engine 230k to 265k 400k and 490k multiple engines 22k to 25k 60k 85k and 120k control and fault detection isolation and recovery fdir system vehicle propulsion controller and engine controllers repressurization autogenous and heated helium thrust vector control tvc hydraulic pneumatic electromechanical actuators electrohydraulic actuators and electropneumatic actuators 318 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 8 for nasa internal use only within upper stage main engines the key trade is use of single engine versus multiple engines and within multiple engines it is if and how engineout is incorporated all thrust levels identified do not necessarily apply to all vehicles the launch vehicle lv descriptions show the number of engines and thrust levels for each vehicle configuration concept for example the multiple 22k to 25k thrust engine configurations apply only to new eelv atlas v and delta iv upper stages and the higher thrust engines apply only to the shuttlederived concepts formal tradeoff studies were performed for the control and fdir system repressurization and tvc subsystems for the lv configurations under consideration these trades are not significant discriminators and therefore are not discussed the reusable solid rocket motor rsrm based clv concepts were generated with derivatives of the j2 and rs25 engines the j2based engine can be divided into two categoriesgas generator gg engines j2 as flown on the saturn sii and sivb stages and tapoff cycle engines j2s as was in development at the end of the apollo program use of the original j2 engine recreating the engine as it existed for flight in 1970 with modifications only as absolutely required due to electronic obsolescence was determined to have insufficient performance and known problems with its pressurized gas system for onorbit restart the engine team evaluated creation of new gg engine based upon the turbomachinery designed for the j2s engine and most recently used in gg cycle for the x33 linear aerospike engine in the 1994 to 2001 time period such configuration would have higher thrust and specific impulse than the original j2 engine but would require new designs for the main injector thrust chamber assembly nozzle and integrated engine system 6g5 rd180 booster engine assessment the rd180 see figure 6g1 is an orsc cycle 930k lbf thrust engine that burns liquid oxygen lox and kerosene propellants it is two thrust chamber derivative of the fourchamber rd170 and is currently being flown on the lockheed martin atlas iii and atlas v lvs it was developed by npo energomash npoe as part of joint venture with pratt whitney known as rd amross it packages the highperformance operability and reusability features of the rd170 in thrust class more compatible with us booster propulsion needs figure 6g1 rd180 booster engine 319 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 9 for nasa internal use only the rd180 is selfcontained propulsion unit that permits simplified enginevehicle interfaceswith hydraulics for control valve actuation and thrust vector gimbaling pneumatics for valve actuation and system purging and thrust frame to distribute loads all located within the engine envelope the orsc cycle used by the engine delivers 10 percent performance increase over current operational us booster engines and provide clean reusable certified for 7 starts operation it is capable of thrust 40 percent to 100 percent continuous throttling and mixture ratio control the throttling capability enables realtime trajectory matching and onpad engine checkout before launch commit control of the mixture ratio permits ascent trajectory optimization and minimization of residual propellants at engine cutoff 6g51 assessment of the rd180 as humanrated booster engine the rd180 can be human rated and americanized ie coproduced for crewed launches on the heavylift launch configuration of the atlas v booster system utilizing three common core boosters pratt whitney can begin flight engine production as early as january 2008 for delivery in mid2010 with risk acceptance of successful completion of module 3 certification explained in section 6g53 rd180 coproduction requirement summary if authority to proceed is received by august 2005 with regard to coproduction proposal for americanization of the rd180 has been submitted to lockheed martin by pratt whitney approximately 500m and 54 months to complete us coproduction certification certification would be for pratt whitney to produce the atlas v flightcertified rd180 system only humanrated rd180 derivative could be developed by pratt whitney in parallel with the baseline coproduction effort provided all licensing agreements with the government of russia and npoe are covered more extensive modifications will require engine recertification and will degrade the experience base with the baseline engine configuration the current rough order of magnitude rom recurring cost for humanrated rd180 derivative is 25m to 30m the proposed 54month coproduction schedule is constrained by the critical path at medium risk and cannot be effectively compressed without additional risk current pratt whitney production is projected at 6 units per year which can be expanded as needed to support the planned launch manifest to as many as 12 to 18 units per year 6g52 rd180 development path and issues the rd180 has several development path issues including obstacles to humanratingdriven design changes since npoe is the current design agent it has final approval authority for proposed design changes export constraints prevent pratt whitney and npoe from fully collaborating on design changes as stated earlier pratt whitney could spin off humanrated rd180 derivative in parallel to the coproduction effort provided all licensing agreements with the government of russia and npoe are covered nearterm strategies for resolving these obstacles include directing npoe to implement hardware reliability enhancements and providing npoe with specific requirements for humanrated rd180 in addition pratt whitney could develop passive background health monitoring system using development and production acceptance and flight data and component fmea 320 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 10 for nasa internal use only 6g53 rd180 coproduction requirement summary major requirement that would be imposed on the rd180 is for american coproduction capability in addition to that of npoe this is requirement levied by the national reconnaissance office nro to support launches of national security payloads the objective of coproduction would be to certify pratt whitney to produce the rd180 system certified for use on the lockheed martin atlas v lv this would be organized into three modules module 1 receipt and translation of all rd180 design data which has been completed module 2 demonstration of manufacture of critical components utilizing the transferred data and demonstrating capability to coproduce hardware which is in work module 2 success criteria include fabrication of

domestic source for which proposal has been submitted to the customer lockheed martin module 3 success criteria includes performing 10 development engine tests including 3 to 5 standcorrelation tests plus 5 to 7 tests swapping out coproduced components as they are fabricated twoengine qualification would be at rate of 5 to 7 tests per engine with an initial capability of 6 engines per year 6g54

stateoftheart in orsccycle loxkerosene engine technology total of 28 production engines have been built 26 delivered npoe current production rate is 8 per year and is expandable to 12 per year recurring engine cost is approximately 10m per unit pratt whitney planned production is 6 per year with recurring engine cost of approximately 25 million per unit 6g55 rd180 risks opportunities and

the rs68 engine assessment including humanrating considerations the rs68 seen in figure 6g2 was developed between 1995 and 2001 for the delta iv eelv the primary objective was to minimize development cost most of the original design team is still available to reduce modification risk development and certification is based on 183 starts and 18945 sec there have been catastrophic test failures and flight failures for six engines on four flights figure 6g2 rs68 booster engine 322 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 12 for nasa internal use only considerations for use in humanrated system include safety factors and design margins redundancy issues include the engine controller and valve actuation fdir and health management system instrumentation and algorithms must be assessed cracking issues with turbine blades main combustion chamber mcc liner and lox posts have been noted and need to be assessed inflight safe shutdown would be by hydraulic lockup and pneumatic shutdown or redundant actuators the gg igniter debris spf also is factor the start transient would have to be modified and fuel pumps redesigned to significantly reduce the free hydrogen fires at engine start seals would also have to be added to the hydrogen system including valves and actuators 6g7 j2s upper stage engine assessment while the j2s was one of the engine options considered it was not recommended as viable option for the following reasons flight engine delivery was better than other more producible lowerrisk j2 enginebased options due to the need for design cycles prior to production and antiquated component design especially the tube wall chamber and nozzle the predicted cost while lower than other options was highrisk area due to the lack of reliable design definition 6g71 history of the j2 engine the original j2 engine was developed in the early 1960s for the saturn ib sivb stage one engine flown nine times and saturn v sii stage five engines and sivb stage one engines flown 13 times vehicles the liquid hydrogen lh2 engine developed by boeings rocketdyne division had the following design goals high reliability efficient packaging of component restart

unclassified 13 for nasa internal use only figure 6g3 j2 engine schematic 6g72 j2s simplified history rocketdyne developed simplified version of the j2 identified as the j2s later in the j2 program phase as sustaining engineering effort the j2s was also lh2 engine with the design goals of an openloop throttle 61 ratio 5000 lb idle mode reduce thermal conditioning eliminate propellant bleed subcooled propellant requirements and start transient increase thrust and specific impulse isp improve component accessibility and same interface as the j2 the j2s depicted in figure 6g4 was totally different engine than the j2 designed with an almostcommon vehicle interface six development j2s engines were produced in the late 1960s three with watercooled mcc and 21 nozzle and three with full 401 nozzles the design featured unique tapoff cycle where pressure is tapped off the mcc these gases drive the turbines and the need for gg is eliminated the j2swas tested at santa susana and aedc j4 test sites with total of 21000 sec at main stage and 6500 sec at idle mode while the tapoff cycle engine the only one of its kind ever built had its benefits it also had design problems that were identified and addressed specifically tapoff lip erosion tapoff manifold burnout idle mode problems and highfrequency mcc instability the engine was never flown 324 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 14 for nasa internal use only figure 6g4 j2s engine schematic the 60day study team reviewed multiple documents in its evaluation of the j2s engine chief among those was study conducted by rocketdyne in 1993 that considered the possibility of restarting the j2s program the study report nas839210 april 1993 stated concern that among other things the tapoff port had production and durability concerns and the highfrequency combustion chamber oscillations 4400 hz that did not occur on all engines or tests the latter which was determined to be problem that may have been completely characterized and the cause accurately identified may not have been totally resolved from the design perspective in addition to the 1993 report the 60day study team also reviewed aedc test reports and other original j2s documentation that support these findings the study team also found the issue of incomplete drawings and documentation to be primary concern the 1993 rocketdyne study reported missing valve drawings for the original j2s design subsequently the fact that those drawings have still not been located as of 2005 poses major problem as well as the fact that configuration management data on existing drawings does not exist tooling drawings if they exist and component design drawings would possibly contain antiquated processes and design all of this leads to the conclusion that an engine design cycle would be necessary before production could start the only time saved would be that of systemlevel definition and taking pump development of critical path the fact that current pump design exists however significantly reduces development cost and risk 6g73 other j2 configurations considered j2sd and j2 two additional variations on the j2s design ie the j2sd and j2 also were considered as engine options for the 60day study each could be equipped with nozzle extensions to increase isp to 450 sec at this point these variations are both strictly theoretical designs except for the actual pumps that would be used for each the j2sd is derived j2s engine concept based on j2s cycle legacy and existing j2s mk29 fuel and oxidizer pumps the j2sd can

life nasastd5007 fracture control and msfcrqmt3019 launch vehicle qualification requirements 6g81 rl10a42 development path and issues the major issue with using the rl10a42 arises from the perspective of engine modifications for use on humanrated system these modifications include valve actuation redundancy turbopump enhancements ignition enhancements enhanced thrust chamber cooling redesign for controls redundancy full fdir capability and health monitoring development add controller channel redundancy and crossstrapping vehicle or enginemounted and assess sensor needs for full fdir and health monitoring development safe inflight shutdown mode and valve lockup mode to enable abort different operating pointassess for performance dynamic and throttling issues eg engineout philosophy and design changes required as result of the structural assessments eg fracture control strength etc 6g82 rl10a42 production and obsolescence currently there are bill of material production or obsolescence issues one possible exception is that the production facility is limited to producing more than 50 engines per year the limiting factor is the tca braze furnace cycle time pratt whitney has 331 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 21 for nasa internal use only determined that the optimum number of engines per year is 25 the actual maximum was 33 engines in single year during the mid1990s 6g83 rl10a42 test issues two major issues that require consideration are teststand modifications and an integrated stage test capability teststand modifications would be required for the upgraded rl10a42 as well as the engine processing modifications these modifications are driven mainly by humanrating requirements it should be noted however that program and mission requirements may be drivers to the overall set of modifications including those of the engine the integrated stage testing capability requires further assessment for example in the context of the selected stage configuration the existing capabilities must be understood along with the modifications required these then feed into cost schedule and requirements 6g84 rl10a42 cost and schedule data given below are government estimates of 5260 month schedule from authority to proceed with cost of 80m to 100m based in part on pratt whitney and lockheed martin cost and schedule data and on the following rl10a42 modifications all modifications identified by pratt whitney and lockheed martin exceptions exist in cases where this list identifies more stringent redesign of the system redesigns for additional controls redundancy for example actuation redundancy for all control valves on the rl10a42 fdir at least to the extent required by program mission and system requirements controller channel redundancy and crossstrapping vehicle or engine trade and additional sensor and instrumentation needs health monitoring controller channel redundancy and crossstrapping vehicle or engine trade and advanced instrumentation using full redundancy engine redlines safe inflight shutdown modes valve lockup mode to enable abort assess throttling eg engineout derated assess upgrading to smoothwall copperbased mcc which is necessary if required burn durations are significantly greater than current qualification level 332 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 22 for nasa internal use only design changes required due to structural assessments eg fracture control strength generically all redesigns due to program mission and system requirements it should be noted that these cost and schedule estimates do not include integrated stage testing ie hotfiring at the system level or the associated analyses for such testing this effort is estimated at 190m 44 m 6g9 expander cycle engine

does not rely on any existing hardware the requirements and concept development needed to generate the rfp for this upperstage option would be government led additionally an advanced development program initiated by the government would lead to risk reduction for the contractor 335 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 25 for nasa internal use only subscale development would be used to anchor fullscale design prior to the fabrication of certification engine hardware engine systemlevel testing would include the following engines and schedule 4 development engines 12 tests each at 2 to 3 tests per month 2 qualification engines 12 tests each at 4 tests per month each and 2 certification engines 10 tests each at 6 tests per month each the schedule dictates the need for access to two test stands both with vacuum simulated capability total of 16 engines would be required from the onset of the main propulsion test article mpta testing to the completion of the first human flight 6g111 lr85 description and characteristics the lr85 is an expander cycle engine using loxlh2 as propellants it would generate 85k pounds of thrust at altitude and vacuum isp of 450 sec depending on the flight envelope at nominal power level the lr85 nozzle stagnation chamber pressure is 1103 psi as new cleansheet engine the lr85 would be designed to meet all upper stage andor earth departure stage eds requirements component designlevel risk mitigation would be drawn from contractor independent research and development andor air force research laboratory upper stage engine technology development an additional benefit to cleansheet design is direct application to humanrated system the lr85 would be designed and developed from the start with human rating in mind thus compliance with npr 87052a would come without any additional costs by definition the expander cycle is relatively simple design reliability for this particular expander would be enhanced by the lack of boost pumps the use of series turbines and its fullflow design 6g112 lr85 issues and risks accelerating the development schedule would require access to two test facilities one being simulated altitude test stand for the start transient and the second being diffuserequipped stand for steady state testing examples of the types of facilities required include an e8type test stand along with plumbrook b2 or aedc j4 the primary technology challenge is the mcc see figure 6g13 the lr85 thrust level is three to four times greater than the previous experience base for an expander engine chamber walls with enhanced surface areas will be required to extract sufficient heat to drive the turbines while still providing adequate cooling 336 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 26 for nasa internal use only figure 6g13 advanced combustion chamber with enhanced surface area systematic approach and validation of analysis tools will be required for turbopump development as with any new engine development schedule is always risk this is compounded by the lack of clearly defined baseline requirements on the positive side the lr85 design would benefit from the ability to utilize domestic production capabilities table 6g8 captures four key risk areas and places them into row categories schedule stands out as the risk in greatest need of mitigation table 6g8 lr85 key risk areas area row notes operating point is 34 times greater than experience watch advances in combustion chamber design and turbopump design analysis tools provide basis for design weight watch engine concept weight models are inaccurate and engine weight is subject to component design decisions schedule risk engine system fabrication in parallel with component testing prevents test results from being incorporated into design requirement definition watch early overspecification of requirements can increase complexity leading to increased cost and decreased reliability 6g113 lr85

16 engines per year 6g12 upper stage cleansheet main propulsion system cleansheet upper stage design inherently carries more risk than utilizing modified design there are several key drivers for this increased risk new systems especially those that will be human rated require extensive ddte prior to flight certification additionally the existence of qualified hardware as well as vendors to produce humanrated hardware is limited most current flight hardware being produced supports nonhumanrated expendable launch systems while designs for humanrated components and subsystems exist these primarily represent designs for reusable shuttle systems and are not necessarily applicable for cleansheet expendable system furthermore many of the original hardware vendors have been displaced or retired the designs and fabrication rights have been bought and sold and the design drawings are not currently up to date reconstitution of the vendor base for the production of humanrated designs is required however cleansheet approach has many advantages it can be designed for increased reliability as would be necessary to meet the humanrating requirements imposed by npg 87052a extensibility could be built in to allow for commonalitygrowth without major redesign stateoftheart materials hardware and design fabrication and test techniques and processes would be incorporated facilitating potentially better more reliable system drawing of cleansheet upper stage design is shown in figure 6g18 339 nasaspaceflightcom sbu sensitive but unclassified 29 for nasa internal use only figure 6g18 cleansheet upper stage drawing cleansheet development issues include interstage space issues for multipleengine configurations structural tankage bulk and structure of the stage and pressure control of tankage autogenous onboard gas etc propellant conditioning requirements at the engine interface will drive increased complexity in the system the mps represents the critical path in the development of new upper stage system the major mps development path issues are feed lines and prevalves driven by system requirements design cycle longlead procurement times and lengthy fabrication and qualification times system integration issues are also significant with cleansheet upper stage system these include integration with both the booster stage and the payloadcev lv requirements that must be decomposed and allocated to the upper stage system drive the ddte of the upper stage system ability to meet upper stage and eds goals introduces additional development risk based on upper stage selection potential issues may be present for concurrent production to meet both clv and eelv milestones test and evaluation issues include the timely and costly teststand modifications required to support integrated propulsion test article development qualification and certification limited availability of test positions may require series operations increasing development time humanrated upper stage systems must be acceptance tested prior to delivery to the launch site for vehicle integration this may highlight potential facility constraints and must be considered 6g13 space shuttle solid rocket

the elements detailed design information will be in section 40 and integrated vehicle analyses and trades in section 50 20 clv sei analysi s approach the analysis approach used for this study consisted of applying existing engineering tools models and processes to this new vehicle configuration data was obtained from the space shuttle pro gram and project offices for existing unmodified elements eg rsrm ssme new designs and models were developed for the additional new elements once the specific discipline models and tools were developed the analyses inputs were carefully examined to assure consistency across the discipline analyses creating an integrated analysis package the systems engineering and integration sei function has the primary responsibility for systems engineering and technical integration across the system definiti on teams sei works with the business management team as necessary to support their costing business management and business case definition tasks the systems engineering approach is based on the systems engineering process shown below in figure 2 1 356 nasaspaceflightcom figure 21 systems engineering process 30 4 segment srb with 1 ssme crew

nasaspaceflightcom 31 vipa vehicle design process for referenc geometry the vipa vehicle design vvd team is one of the vipa discipline teams vvd maintains the reference geometry of the ve hicle with data from wide variety of sources and distills that data into information directly usable by the rest of the vipa discipline teams 311 design modeling process the basis of vvd reference geometry modeling is the top down layout based mode ling approach using ugsnx and managing all data in ugsteamcenter the basic modeling approach is shown in figure 33 the vipa process is based on nx best practices for wave systems engineering with slight modifications made specifically to accommodat vipas needs in vvds top down modeling approach each stage element has stage layout that has sketches surfaces or bodies as needed to define major interfaces between lower level components such as tanks each lower level component has its own co mponent layout which is linked to the geometric objects of the stage layout and adds additional detail for that specific component such as ring locations and dimensions from the component layout the create linked part clp function is used to link re quired information to the individual part files the parts are then modeled starting with the referencing geometry clp is used again from the component layout to the component assembly to provide mating data for any non vvd generated parts that are bein g used the individual parts are assembled in the stage absolute coordinate system and mating conditions are generally not needed the component assemblies are then added to the stage assembly the several stage layouts that make up the vehicle stack ar assembled into stack layout file the layouts are mated to each other by aligning datums and curves the datums from each stage layout coordinate system are then geometrically linked or waved using the nx wave geometry linker from the stage layouts to the stack layout clp is used to wave the coordinate system datums into the stack assembly allowing the stage assemblies to be robustly mated into the stack assembly by mating coordinate systems mating of coordinate systems is more robust then mati ng elements of the parts themselves because the mated objects may be changed in ways that could invalidate conventional mating conditions this approach allows control of very large assemblies with small handful of layout files that act as 3d interface control documents the structure of the files also allows for each component to travel as unit so it can be easily cloned and reused in different assemblies by reassembling and redirecting the handful of curves that define its major interfaces the l evel of detail achieved on the 60 day study would not have been possible if this process had not been used in previous vipa studies many elements of this vehicle were reused from previous exploration office heavy lift launcher study which in turn had used many elements from vipa validation exercise using the saturn v 359 nasaspaceflightcom figure 33 vvd top down layout based modeling 312 vvd interaction with other vipa teams 3121 master model vvds second major function is the extracti on of data from the reference geometry for the various analysis teams to perform this function vvd relies on the master model approach in conjunction with top down modeling all managed and access by the teamcenter product data manager notional vie w of master modeling is shown in figure 34 in this approach there is master product definition file that defines the part of interest referencing files start with the master product definition and add extract or simplify information as needed sep arate referencing files are used for drawings visualization analysis model simplificationtranslation

ugpart drawing dataset for layout item 361 nasaspaceflightcom 3122 vvd delivered analytical data the first important data delivered to analysts is the stage layout drawing already shown in figure 32 the top down modeling approach has proven to be extremely valuable to concurrent engineering as practiced by the vipa team the layout is the first piece of information required by the geometric modeling process it also contains most of the up front information required for analysts to start building their discipline models almost immediately simplified geometric models such as those needed for early stress thermal or simulation modeling can also b rapidly generated from the layout as referencing part files as needed translations in the appropriate formats are generated and automatically stored with the appropriate cad part delivered formats include parasolid step iges and stl the objectiv of vvd is to provide associative mesh ready models for each discipline that uses geometric inputs analysts are also able to access lightweight models and discipline specific data directly using teamcenters web interface as shown in figure 36 the l ightweight models are generated automatically on save and since they have the same underlying parasolid kernel as nx are mathematically exact representations of the cad parts having live versions of the models immediately available to all users allows nyone to find and measure desired data without having to wait on the availability of cad user productivity is significantly increased by freeing the designer from the task of delivering ever changing 2d representations of their work in addition the teamcenter 362 nasaspaceflightcom figure 36 teamcenter web access and visualization visualization tools include the ability to create step translation allowing analysts to generate their own import data without needing to wait on cad operator the last important data d elivered in sizing iteration after all the discipline models have been prepared is the mass properties report vvd generates the nominal dry mass properties for the systems modeling team the systems modeling team is responsible for managing margins on top of the nominal design and generating sequenced mass properties for use by loads dynamics trajectories simulation gnc etc vvd uses the nx assembly weight management function which exports all the 6dof mass properties data directly to an excel spreadsheet shown in figure 37 6dof properties for every piece part component are included and rolled up into assemblies it is important that the piece part information is part of the spreadsheet since the systems modeling team often uses sy stem oriented product breakdown rather then the vvd assembly oriented breakdown inclusion of the piece part data enables direct manipulation and sorting via spreadsheet figure 37 assembly weight management generation of full 6dof nominal mass proper ties 363 nasaspaceflightcom 3123 data organization folders within teamcenter are organized to provide familiar format for users to find information access control is handled with series of teamcenter groups each discipline has its own group and only other members f the same group can edit objects created by that group data generated by any vipa group is made visible to users in any other vipa group in addition there is vipa team group that all vipa team members are placed in and all can share and edit data this is used for shared documentation and co llaboration across disciplines 32 systems integrator r ole 321 cad and cad management compatibility the vipa team originated in 2001 to provide the technical aspects of systems engineering or analytical in tegration for the space launch initiative program vipa vehicle design has established and demonstrated the ability to deal with disparate data so that msfc can be leaders in integration relevant to this is an understanding of what tools we need to int erface with figure 38 shows the current understanding of the cad and cad management landscape across nasa and most relevant aerospace companies this is simplified presentation of very complex integration problem but couple messages are clear first the most common cad in aerospace is dassaults catia including mix of both catia v4 and v5 which are completely different cad packages second is ugss nx including both ugnx and ideas nx which have converged over the last several years into single product vvds use of nx is as consistent with industry cad usage as possible cad management in aerospace is clearly teamcenter dominated vipas use of teamcenter will simplify integration with these contractors note that ptcintralink is recently discontinued product which will be supported only through 2008 the intralink name is maintained but is now in ptc windchill database requiring full migration of existing intralink data figure 38 aerospace ca d and cad management landscape best available data standard tool some site

integration since there is variety of cad in use vipa has focused on being able to manage and manipulate this data as required previous vipa study demonstrated the use of dassault catia and ptcproe cad models managed directly in teamcenter and integrated directly into the vipa geometry definition via managed translations figure 39 shows the use of these models in heterogeneous product structure the basic vipa modeling stru cture is maintained but provided models from other systems are linked into the control and assembly structure this example shows all data flowing through the stage layout but foreign subassemblies can also be plugged directly into the assembly as neede d figure 310 shows the teamcenter thick client view of multi cad part with managed translations as separate

systematically apply hfe principles data and tools in the design and analysis of the launch vehicle hfe technical and analytical input will contribute to the definitio n identification analysis cost and efficiency estimation of the human interfaces associated with three primary areas in launch vehicle design the areas include definition of line replaceable units lrus definition of human ground interfaces to the v ehicle and vehicle component manufacturability hfe defines reviews and approves the requirements associated with identification of the lrus and identifies the associated worksites on the vehicle this effort is accomplished in collaboration with ot her systems engineering disciplines including primarily reliability the effort during the concept development phase of identifying lrus will help discern operations cost drivers early in the program this result should be used to perform programmati c trades with hfe participation to identify those components for which reliability must be improved versus those for which nasa is willing to accept the cost of ground processing as nominal the next area of focus for hfe support is in ground operations where hfe considerations impact the design of the launch vehicles infrastructure for ground support function for hfe is to apply task analyses and the associated requirements generated above to identify the human interfaces to be accessed during gr ound operations for example some components lrus will require maintenance during launch processing the tasks associated with these are analyzed by 367 nasaspaceflightcom human engineers to identify the applicable requirements one of these will be that the lru should be accessible so that maintainers are not required to remove other components to reach it nor should maintainers be required to enter the vehicle to gain access to it thereby the risk of damage to other components eg cabling is reduced logically th cost and schedule impacts associated with any damage are reduced throughout the design phase hfe will participate in trades to identify such issues with the ultimate objective of reducing operations costs later in the design phase hfe can define review and approve requirements associated with the vehicle manufacturability that affect cost efficiency and human safety by using worksite analysis modeling tools hfe will support trade studies addressing tooling robotic versus human assembly nd plant configuration hfe will have input into micro and macro analyses addressing individual work cells through factory flow terminating with vehicle assembly 332 vibration effects on humans the rsrm has longitudinal acoustic mode that causes n oscillating axial load the force is f where is as high as 80 klbf ie 160 klbf peak to peak for the 4 segment booster f is 15 hz and for the 5 segment booster f is 11 hz the effect is roughly equivalent to being accelerated at 2 g with an oscillation about 2 g of 01 02 g and frequency of 15 hz human performance is known to be affected by frequencies in the 1 30 hz range frequencies above 30 60 hz are not normally problem for humans and can be damped by cushioned couches vibration below 1 hz is not generally known to affect performance or body resonances rather is associated with motion sickness moderate vibration affects human performance in the following ways loss of tracking performance for example following target with hand controller typically there is loss in reaction times but there are exceptions visual impairment trouble reading for example but very sensitive to the type of vibration and task also dependant on posture and illumination level s early in the space program one of the rockets had strong pogo resonance at 11 hz along the long axis of the rocket due to the rocket engine the crew complained of vibration which interfered with their vision modification to headrest padding gav more subjectively acceptable vibration level currently the team believes that this is not major issue based on what is known about the duration about 2 minutes crew tasks monitoring and choosing abort if necessary crew orientation on their backs acceleration and vibration intensity frequency and direction opinion from george hamiltonev12 as the design matures this is an integration issue that should be worked for astronaut performance during the first stage 368

are number of assumptions that apply across many element s of the baseline vehicle though many of these assumptions are open to trades the assumptions are the nominal structural diameter is 2165 55m this dimension is to the outer surface of the component skins tps and flanges are external to the n ominal diameter all primary structure is friction stir welded aluminum lithium 2195 with maximum stock thickness of 185 based on material currently available for the shuttle external tank maximum barrel lengths of 14 feet to increase availability of existing tooling all barrels and rings consist of 4 radial segments tank domes are in 8 radial gores limited by stretch forming capabilities with welded end cap domes are sqrt2 tangent ellipses axial segmentgore interfaces are staggere d

joints used in the upper sta ge 413 upper stage component specifics 4131 forward skirt the forward skirt is 26 long it provides the interface between the upper stage and the spacecraft adapter the system tunnel starts at the forward skirt with lines for the spacecraft adap ter systems and the lh2 tank pressvent lines 4132 lh2 tank the lh2 tank has barrel length of 485 the feedline connects to sump on the bottom dome vortex baffle is mounted in the aft dome but slosh baffling is assumed to be unnecessary 4133 intertank the intertank is 173 long the baseline vehicle definition has separate tanks with an intertank in between the intertank has purge umbilical and filldrain umbilicals for both tanks an access panel is also provided 4134 lox tan k the lox tank has barrel length of 115 vortex baffle is mounted in the aft dome and slosh baffle rings are mounted along the length of the barrel since the lox filldrain line is forward of the tank an internally mounted fiildrain line runs dow n the inside of the tank 4135 thrust structure the thrust structure consists of cylinder 3875 long and cone 525 long the cylinder interfaces with the ring of the lox tank and provides clearance for the feedline to enter the thrust structur as well as lines from the systems tunnel it provides purge umbilical to the ground the interface to the interstage is immediately aft of the cylinder the engine is mounted on cross beams at the bottom of the cone the beam loads are transmitted into the cone by tapered longerons mounted on the thrust cone are the apus for engine and tvc power and pressurized he tank for the ssme thermal curtain is connected between the top of the rd25 nozzle perhaps using the engine mounted heat shiel d and the thrust cone this provides closed environment for purge and hazardous gas detection as well as prevention of external contaminants on the pad and recirculation gasses on ascent 370 nasaspaceflightcom dry baydry baydome joints tank rings dome

based and use hyd razine the hydrazine portions will be in c ontained line replaceable pods 4137 reaction control system rcs the rcs system is he pressurized bipropellant hydrazine system 2 rcs line replaceable pods are mounted on the aft skirt each pod includ he and propellant tanks with 3 1000lb aft pointing thrusters and 6 100 thrusters for pitch roll and yaw 4138 upper stage trades in the course of developing the baseline vehicle definition number of trades have been identified material and const ruction trade the baseline material and construction method is li isogrid for the upper stage spacecraft adapter and interstage the baseline construction approach needs to be traded against all major components isogrid alli orthogrid orthogrid dry bay components alal core honeycomb allial core honeycomb compositeal core honeycomb compositenon metallic core honeycomb separate vs nested tank trade the baseline has 2 conventional tanks separated by an intertank this needs to be traded against nested tanks with the elimination of the intertank note that the proposed nested configuration is not true common bulkhead common bulkhead has single dome between the tanks one of the nested tanks would have concave dome which nests with the other tank the intervening space would be insulated and contain thermally non conductive spacers if needed the tank with the concave dome would be determined by the higher pressure tank and if the lh2 feedline goes thr ough or around the lox tank thrust cone angle the angle of the thrust cone and the length of the aft skirt need to be optimized to accommodate the engine and tvc mounting and loads the apus and feedlines 372 nasaspaceflightcom end ring manufacturing trade in the baseline end rings of components are assumed to be 4 segments of rolled extrusions manufacturing study is required to determine if single piece forgings may be preferable nonpressurized joints the baseline connection for non pressurized joints is rolled l bracket with shear fasteners to the component skin and bolted face joint to the next component alternate possibilities are double lap shear joints which provide more efficient load path but require more tooling setup butt welded joints which w ould provide highly efficient structural path but makes destacking of components essentially impossible single vs multi piece domes current stretching and spin forming tooling cannot support the 18 baseline domes 18 spun form domes are not new chnology but the up front tooling is needed this would be manufacturing trade to determine the return on the tooling investment and if it could be ready in time if domes are spun formed then the end cap might be able to be formed directly and not b separate welded piece 42 spacecraft adapter the spacecraft adapter is shown in figure 43 most of the upper stage general design assumptions typical joints and trades apply as well to the spacecraft adapter the adapter is 105 long and maintain s the nominal 2165 structural outer diameter the length of the adapter has to be worked in conjunction with the cev nozzle length the spacecraft adapter has rigid bolted connection to the upper stage and separation system interface to the spacecr aft it also contains most of the avionics for control of the launch vehicle on the pad it will require purge and an electrical umbilical and includes an access door the baseline assumption is that passive cooling of the avionics is adequate 421 spacecraft separation system the separation uses 6 discreet separation points these are internal to the cylinder and align with the 6 internal structural panels of the spacecraft service module each point includes counterbored bracket which helps car ry shear loads within each bracket is 3 bolt pattern with explosive nuts springs are also mounted on the bracket to provide push off impulse to the spacecraft the bracket with the nuts is part of the adapter assembly with simple mechanical interface to the spacecraft 422 spacecraft adapter specific trades activepassive avionics cooling the baseline and preferred approach is that passive cooling on the pad via the purge is adequate to keep avionics cool the passive cooling assumption must be verified 373 nasaspaceflightcom figure 43 spacecraft adapter separation system explosive nuts are relatively common and clean method of payload separation to minimize shock and pyrotechnic handling concerns mechanical separation nuts such as the starsys fassn or the hishear low shock separation nut can be used both of these systems are flight proven commercially available alternatives to explosive nuts with similar actuation times and power requirements also since the spacecraft separation occurs during coas t phase slower or soft release methods are also possible the tradespace may include mechanical systems such as the lightband or pyrotechnic systems such as the superzip 43 interstage an expanded view of the interstage is shown in figure 44 most of the upper stage general design assumptions typical joints and trades apply as well to the interstage the interstage consists of the interstage cylinder and the frustum 374 nasaspaceflightcom 431 interstage cylinder the forward section of the interstage is the interstage cylinder which is 2408 long it interfaces with the upper stage and contains four solid settling motors for upper stage engine startup and two separation rings the baseline structure for the cylinder is an open truss to eliminate issues of engine bl eed flow prior to upper stage engine start an avionics conduit will pass cabling from the upper stage to the srb figure 44 interstage expanded view 432 interstage cylinder structure the truss is made of tapered composite struts with maximum diam eter at the center of 5 5 the struts are attached to end fittings of titanium to minimize galvanic issues the titanium fittings are mounted on li end rings an intermediate set of titanium brackets and an alli ring are used to reduce the slendern ess ratio of the struts to eliminate buckling without making the struts too large in diameter 433 interstage separation system separation rings are mounted fore and aft of the truss structure these are c section rings with shape charge for cutting this is essentially the same separation as in the forward skirt of the srb the stage separation is shown in figure 45 as srb thrust is tailing off the aft separation ring initiates and booster separation motors on the srb aft skirt fire to pull the booster away from the 375 nasaspaceflightcom upper stage the srb is yawed to an angle to prevent it from thrusting back into the upper stage after the booster is figure 45 stage separation 376 nasaspaceflightcom figure 46 interstageengine clearance separated the settling motors fire to allow the upper stage engine to start once the engine reaches an ssme thrust level of 100 the forward ring separates and the interstage cylinder structure falls away this is the same stage separation sequence used for the saturn v while simulations must verify the dynamic clearance of the interstage as it falls away figure 46 shows significant clearance even if the engine is gimbaled as far as 5 degrees should clearance prove to be inadequate then thrusting separation system would be needed to split the interstage cylinder and push it aside similar to conventional fairing separations 434 interstage frustum the interstage frustum is 120 long and transitions from the upper stage diameter to the srb diameter it contains the booster roll trol system the booster avionics and the recovery system it interfaces to clevis ring on the booster which is fastened to the forward segment on the pad the frustum will need umbilicals for purge of the enclosed volume and an electrical connect ion to the booster avionics 435 interstage specific trades titanium bracket manufacturing the best method of manufacturing the titanium brackets of the truss cylinder needs to be determined they could be welded cast or machined open vs closed inte rstage cylinder 377 nasaspaceflightcom the baseline cylinder is an open truss the alternative is closed cylinder this trade would be driven primarily by the upper stage mps needs and any complexities involved in getting the rs 25 engine bleed flow gases vented overboard any potential aerodynamic effects from the open cylinder must also be assessed upper stage propellant settling the baseline configuration shows solid settling motors mounted on the interstage which are fired immediately prior to rs25 start up this is the same solution used by the saturn v the alternative is to oversize the rcs pods on the upper stage to provide enough aft thrust to settle the propellant interstage cylinder separation clearance the

klb peak to peak for the 4 segment booster f is 15 hz this means that there is something like 01 02 g oscillation in acceleration out of 2 g or so total acceleration dependi ng on the time of flight the clv first axial frequencies are well separated so the structure should not tune with the 15 hz mode the second axial frequencies sweep through the 15 hz mode but this should not be problem since it is forced oscillat ion not an instability also there would be lower response at the second mode frequencies payloads may have requirement for component frequencies to be detuned from 15 hz 46 clv upper stage mps and engine overview this initial input for the expl oration system architecture study was very brief and accelerated effort resulting in rough draft concept and hopefully useful set of issues and recommended studies or technical trades for consideration this effort was organized by very small numb er of 381 nasaspaceflightcom personnel with little time for detailed analysis as yet the full technical capability of nasa and the aerospace community have not brought to bear on this task due to the required brevity and initial confidentiality of the study the upper stag main propulsion and upper stage engine information was organized by engineers from the nasa msfc propulsion systems department liquid engines and main propulsion systems branch er21 they are matt devine marc neely steve sexton and r h coates limited number of experts were consulted as time would permit for assistance with information on the ssme and shuttle mps and orbiter as well as similar propulsion systems and subcomponents assumptions the initial conceptual input for the crew lau nch vehicle clv second stage main propulsion system described herein was based on the following going in assumptions 1 one block ii space shuttle main engine aka rs 24d used in an upper stage 2nd stage application with minimal changes to the eng ine and minimal changes to interface conditions 2 single burn approximately 350 seconds with re start 3 start to 1045 percent power level percent of nominal engine main chamber pressure 4 shutdown from 1045 percent power level 5 second stage vehicle and propulsion system will not be re used ground rules the basic ground rules for our technical input to this rough draft concept were safety minimize calendar time for development there was attempt by this small team focused on the upper sta ge mps and engine subsystem to consider hardware commonality to future applications such as mps subsystem commonality between single engine and multi engine applications mps or engine subsystem commonality between the current second stage concept and any earth departure stage eds resources for this brief study the focus for the main propulsion system and upper stage engine effort was on comparable systems basic functional overviews schematics interface documents and any applicable massenergy b alance data for the following systems were utilized to initialize inputs to the study shuttle main propulsion system mps external tank et and orbiter space shuttle main engine ssme apollo saturn v s ivb 3rd stage apollo saturn v s ii 2nd stage 382 nasaspaceflightcom delta ii upper stage and delta iv boost and upper stage atlas iiiv upper stages 461 upper stage main propulsion system overview the crew launch vehicle clv upper stage main propulsion system usmps provides the second stage ascent ve locity increment from first stage separation to orbital insertion the magnitude of the velocity increment supplied by the upper stage depends on payload mass mission trajectory and system limitations the usmps consists of the following major subsystem s one upper stage main engine one main engine controller one oxygen tank one hydrogen tank the propellant management subsystem and helium subsystem two redundant auxiliary power units two thrust vector control units and two engine hydraulic thrust vector control gimbal servoactuators the upper stage main engine usme is the block ii space shuttle main engine and will also be designated the rs 24d the engine was originally designed as the reusable booster main engine subsystem for the space s huttle program the engine system will be used as an expendable engine system for the clv the engine is high performance fuel rich staged combustion rocket engine with variable thrust capability and two axis gimbal capability the propellant fuel is l iquid hydrogen and the oxidizer is liquid oxygen the propellant is carried in separate tanks in the second stage vehicle above the engine and supplied to the engine under pressure the engine can be gimbaled plus or minus 105 degrees in the yaw axis and plus or minus 105 degrees in the pitch axis for thrust vector control by hydraulically powered thrust vector control actuators the upper stage main engine usme can be throttled over range of 65 to 109 percent of the design rated power level based on main chamber static pressure in 1 percent increments however 1045 percent power is selected as the desired thrust level for nominal second stage operation the thrust level of 1045 percent power is the current nominal booster ascent thrust level f or the shuttle program value of 100 percent power level corresponds to thrust level of 469449 pounds force lbf in vacuum or 375191 lbf at sea level value of 1045 percent corresponds to 490847 lbf vacuum or 396569 lbf at sea level value of 109 percent corresponds to 512271 lbf in vacuum or 417992 lbf at sea level the upper stage main engine is currently used as booster main engine system for the space shuttle program the engine was originally intended for 75 hours of cumulative operation over span of 55 starts for the shuttle program throughout the throttling range the ratio of the liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen mixture is maintained at about 6 to1 currently 6032 for shuttle the nozzle area ratio is approxima tely 69 to1 the engine is approximately 167 inches long and 94 inches in diameter at the nozzle exit with nominal dry mass of 7748 lbm 8212 lbm wet the main engine controller is digital computer system and electronics package mounted on the engine it operates in conjunction with engine sensors valve actuators and spark igniters to provide self contained system for monitoring engine control checkout and status the controller is attached to the forward end of the engine currently on the shuttle system main engine data and status collected by the controller are transmitted to an engine interface unit eiu which is mounted in the vehicle the eiu transmits commands from the vehicle computers to the main engine controller when engine data and 383 nasaspaceflightcom status are received by the eiu the data are held in buffer until the eiu receives request for data from the vehicle computers two redundant hydraulic systems provide hydraulic pressure to position the main engine valves and servoactuators for t hrust vector control during the engines operation two redundant auxiliary power units apus provide mechanical shaft power through gear train to drive the hydraulic pumps that provide hydraulic pressure to their respective hydraulic systems both the space shuttle orbiter and the solid rocket booster srb employ apu hydraulic subsystems and both systems are similar in many respects initial evaluation of the orbiter and srb apu hydraulic systems indicates that the srb system may be better matche d to the capability required by the main engine there are hydraulically actuated flight control surfaces on the clv as there are on the shuttle orbiter it will likely make more sense to adapt the srb apu and hydraulic system to supply hydraulic powe r to the engine control valves and the thrust vector control actuators for the upper stage main engine the two thrust vector control units receive commands from the vehicle computers and send commands to the engine thrust vector control actuators the units are electronics packages mounted in the vehicle hydraulic isolation commands are directed to engine gimbal actuators that indicate faulty servovalve position in conjunction with this servovalve isolation signal is transmitted to the computers the main engine hydraulic servoactuators are used to gimbal the main engine and provide thrust vector control there are two actuators per engine one for pitch motion and one for yaw motion they convert electrical commands received from the vehicle compu ters and position servovalves which direct hydraulic pressure to piston that converts the pressure into mechanical force that is used to gimbal the engine the hydraulic pressure status of each servovalve is transmitted to the thrust vector control its the upper stage mps propellant management subsystem consists of the distribution ducts or lines and valves by which the liquid propellants pass from ground systems to the vehicle propellant tanks or from the tanks to the main engine and by which ga seous propellants pass from the engine back to the respective tanks for autogenous pressurization the oxygen and hydrogen feed lines will be 12 inch diameter the same as for the shuttle with the same size pre valves the ground supply ducts and valves umbilical disconnects and onboard upper stage fill drain ducts and valves will be sized for safety and performance the existing shuttle filldrain systems are sized for 8 inch diameters it is proposed that 2 inch diameter components be evaluated because the 2 inch size ducts valves and disconnects are used for eelv upper stage filldrain subsystems all the valves in the propellant management subsystem are under direct control of either ground based controls pre launch or vehicle control com puters flight and are either electrically or pneumatically actuated some of the same valves may be monitored and manually controlled by the flight crew as required by mission requirements the upper stage mps helium subsystem consists of series of helium supply tanks and regulators check valves distribution lines and control valves the subsystem supplies the helium used within the engine to purge the high pressure oxidizer turbopump intermediate seal and preburner oxidizer domes and to actuate v alves during emergency pneumatic shutdown the upper stage main engine will use approximately 25 lbm for the 350 second second stage burn through engine cutoff purges or roughly half the helium used on each shuttle mission per ssme this translates to roughly half the needed volumetric helium capacity including substantial margin the current engine pneumatic helium supply could be reduced to using three 3 of the existing 475 cubic foot 4500 psig helium tanks composite overwrapped pressure 384 nasaspaceflightcom vessel s this will also allow for redundant capability since two tanks could supply the helium requirement for single engine single tank could be isolated should problem occur one or possibly two more 475 cubic foot tanks could be used for the veh icle to actuate all the pneumatically operated valves within the propellant management subsystem on the vehicle and to supply any required inerting of enclosed vehicle volumes to protect against fire and explosion risks the exact requirement for the mps valves and hazardous gas mitigation must be determined 462 preliminary as sessment of contractor capability the following is very rough initial status of the engineering and production capability for subset of the major mps subsystem suppliers as used on the space shuttle system this effort must be completed and advanced development activities pursued in detail several components may be good candidates for advanced development or fabrication demonstration efforts including but not necess arily limited to large 12 inch pre valves 2 inch to 4inch filldrain valves large umbilical disconnects new simplified h2 or o2 tank vent relief valve an oxygen recirculation

qualification re qualification for new or updated designs for the clv 1 propellant feed lines and gimbal flex join ts arrowhead is the original supplier for the manifold filldrain 12 inch and 17 inch feed lines on the shuttle orbiter mps they supply atlas v and delta iv vehicles with similar components united space alliance usa recently placed an order then cancelled for complete set of shuttle mps feed lines arrowhead still has full capability to provide the main feed line systems for the ssme 2 prevalves for lh2 and lox 12 inch feed lines fairchild was the original supplier for these components but was acquired by vacco aerospace products vaccos director of aerospace engineering and programs indicated vacco has the design authority for the prevalves they have the blueprints tooling and all specifications however there are some issues tha t must be addressed vaccos drawings are not up to date usa has made several changes over the years via cumulative engineering orders eos and bypassed vaccos data management process therefore their internal specifications are not up to date nor are the blue prints b some of the tooling was unique to the original equipment that is longer available or out of date c many of the non unique tools are worn or damaged beyond use production processes will have to be modernized for the old designs to be built on current equipment specifically cnc machining 3 propellant filldrain valves and quick disconnects the original shuttle mps design uses 8inch diameter filldrain valves made by fairchild the 8 inch valves and ducts may be too large fo r the proposed size of the upper stage concept and if used would constitute weight penalty since the delta iv unmanned evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv uses 2 inch filldrain valves and ducts for their upper stage this may be functionally ca pable for the clv upper stage vacco is the current manufacturer of just 385 nasaspaceflightcom such 2 inch valves but detailed analysis of the components versus our requirements including human rating would have to be conducted to see if this component can be used as is 4 helium pressure regulators eaton was the original supplier but vacco purchased that company as well the clv upper stage may require similar components compared to the shuttle or eelv programs so this is probably relatively obtainable component depending on requirements 5 umbilicals this hardware will require advanced development effort because it will be unique to the vehicle interfaces current eelv designs atlasdelta are similar in deliverable materials and subsystem components for umbil icals for hydrogen oxygen nitrogen helium and electrical these should be evaluated however the clv upper stage will still require unique system depending on specific vehicle requirements and interface locations 6 tank ventrelief valve the orig inal supplier for this component was eaton although vacco now owns eaton and has the design authority usa has changed the contract award to ketema the ketema valve is similar to the original eaton valve but is cheaper for the clv this item needs to be an advanced development effort due to the issues and problems that have occurred with this component on the shuttle mps it has also been proposed in discussions for this study that new concept be considered the new concept would split the vent an d relief functions into two separate valves thus simplifying the functionality 7 hydrogen recirculation pump the original supplier for this component was sundstrand now part of hamiltonsundstrand and united technologiespratt and whitney pw has the design authority for this component since three pumps were used on shuttle one for each ssme the assumption for the clv upper stage is that one pump will work for the single engine but this assumption needs validated we are currently trying to contac t vendor for further status of component manufacturability also the capability for producing oxygen recirculation pump must be assessed 8 auxiliary power unit apu the current system used on the shuttle orbitermps and srb have proven to be relia ble and appears to be suitable for the clv upper stage engine valve and thrust vector control actuator needs the apu and hydraulic system on the srb may be more closely aligned with the needs of the upper stage main engine it is recommended that the re dundant apu hydraulic systems from the shuttle srb be evaluated for use on the clv upper stage other original contractor suppliers from the space shuttle program mps are listed below these should

pressure environment at the time of the abort requiring different techniques to orient the cm mode i alpha low altitude mode the used pitch motor to orient the assembly this ensured the vehicle was directed downrange for water touchdown and to escape the fireball of the lv explosion mode i bravo canards were extended from the to aerodynamically orient the cm initiated tumble in the pitch plane whic h results in the blunt end forward 393 nasaspaceflightcom mode i charlie the rcs on the cm was used to establish the proper orientation following manual jettison of the if the attitude platform was bad then tumble was introduced via the rcs aerodynamic forces result in blunt end forward for attitude like mode 1b mode ii post let jettison until sps could be used to make minimum orbit or footprint encroachment on africa for lunar missions or europe for skylab the combined command and service modules were ma nually separated from the launch vehicle followed by cm separation from the sm the cm was oriented for entry which was open loop full lift and had high gs 16g limit touchdown was also in the atlantic typically 350 to 3200 nm downrange mode i ii touchdown encroachment on africa for lunar missions through nominal orbital insertion similar to the mode ii abort except the service module sps engine performed either posigrade or retrograde burn prior to separation from the sm this abort was used to target to recovery ship which was 3350 nm downrange there is subclass of this abort late in the region defined as fixed delta v abort where the sps retrograde burn results in touchdown in the indian ocean and would be used if the cm was go for orbit mode iv overlaps some of the mode iii region and begins when orbit insertion could be achieved through use of delta v from the sps engine up to 3000 fts to make up the velocity shortfall of the launch vehicle it extends through n ominal sivb stage cutoff the burn attitude for mode iii and mode iv aborts was manual maneuver that placed the thrust vector either 317 degrees above or below the horizon using scribe line on the window few final abort related findings are of for mercuryatlas more than 90 of the mission analysis work was related to aborts abort decision criteria will be very difficult to finalize and if too tight may result in higher than anticipated abort occurrence since large percentage of f ailures are propulsion related which lead to loss of vehicle control the engine chamber pressure and turbopump speed parameters are critical for monitoring making the reliability of the measurements critical testing of the abort system against vehicle loss of control failure will be necessary to establish confidence in its adequacy rate capability of the abort system is critical and will be dependent on time of flig ht at which the failure occurs 394 nasaspaceflightcom 50 integrated vehic analyses 51 aerodynamics the aerodynamic characteristics for the clv 4 crew launch vehicle were

was incorporated into rev 2 most of the analyses were repeated within this document the reference trajectory version will be specified all trajectories were modeled using the program to optimize simulated trajectories post in addition to the ground rules several assumptions were necessary to construct the reference trajectories these ground rules and assumptions have been listed in section 531 for completeness the data used in the 3 dof trajectories is detailed in sect ion 532 for our reference trajectories some of the key events needed to be specified in future studies these need to be analyzed to determine the optimal trajectory these key events included the srb separation condition the time between the boos ter separation and full thrust of the second stage and the jettison conditions for the typical sts mission the srbs separate from the external tank around 125 seconds the thrust from each booster is around 100000 lb f since they are pushed away from the et which still has the thrust of the 3 ssmes re contact isnt concern for the clv 4 vehicle the separation conditions are greatly different at separation the upper stage has not been ignited if this vehicle used the same criteria as t he sts the booster would still be thrusting toward the upper stage by lengthening the burn time on the 1st stage the thrust is rapidly decreasing when the thrust had decreased to 15000 lb f the upper stage was able to separate cleanly since the 2nd stage ignition is not an instantaneous event finite amount of time needed to be assumed for purposes of this study 10 seconds was used after separation of the first stage there is short coast period then the ssme is ignited and the start up transient is incorporated into the trajectory after the thrust reaches 100 the engine ramps to the nominal power level of 1045 the time duration from 1st stage separation to thrust level of 100 is the assumed 10 seconds the exploration system architecture study levied ground rule for the separation criteria this stated the would be dropped 30 seconds after the 2nd stage was ignited for the clv 4 vehicle this corresponded to an altitude around 190000 to 195000 feet based on historical data from the apollo missions their was jettisoned at altitudes around 279000 to 312000 ft in the case of apollo 8 this corresponded to approximately 50 seconds after the s ic separation determination of the jettison titude must include several factors some of the primary considerations are location on the 2nd stage allows the crew to escape the still burning srb during 1st stage abort 441 nasaspaceflightcom the crew module must escape any explosion driven compression wave when th atmospheric density is high enough to be problematic after the is jettisoned the service module engine provides the abort separation burn sufficient time is needed before reentering the atmosphere for the sm burn to be completed the sm to be je ttisoned and the cm to be correctly oriented for entry separation altitudes around 190000 to 195000 ft appear to be low for conservatism this study adopted separation altitude similar to those seen in the apollo flights although there is an impact to the payload delivery capability carrying the longer and higher aids in the abort modes summary of performance and trajectory parameters for the two rev 2 reference trajectories are shown in table 533 1 the rev 1 reference trajectorie s are also included for comparison several trajectory parameters for the two rev 2 reference trajectories are plotted versus time in figures 533 1 and 533 3 the final main engine cut off meco conditions for the reference trajectories were iden tical the conditions were the geocentric radius from the earths center the inertial velocity and the inertial flight path angle in figure 533 1 difference in the geodetic altitude may be seen since an oblate model was used for the earth the altitude above the surface varies with latitude so equal distances in radius will produce different altitudes above the surface the apparent discrepancy in the relative velocity is similar situation the inertial velocities for each trajectory are identical at meco due to the slight differences in altitude and thus atmospheric density there will be differences in the relative velocities additionally the mission profiles are depicted in figures 533 4 and 533 5 trajectory parameters for several key events are shown with comparison to typical sts mission 442 nasaspaceflightcom table 533 1 reference trajectory comparison clv4 reference trajectory comparison rev 1

nasaspaceflightcom 534 trajectory trade stu dies several studies were conduct ed during this analysis cycle the parametric effects and the ssme power level studies were conducted with the revision 2 trajectory the srb studies used the rev 1 reference trajectories 5341 parametric effects on payload rev 2 trajectory the effects of different design parameters on the delivered payload were investigated this analysis allows the user to see the impact of off design conditions on the delivered payload in this study the rev 2 trajectory was used for clarity in the fo llowing figures the parameters are grouped into three categories each parameter has been compared to the delivered payload for the reference trajectory in each of these scenarios only the payload capability was determined any effects on other fligh t phases such as the abort situations have not been analyzed figure 534 1 shows the parameters where the component weights have been changed these component changes are 1 1000 lb increase in the boosters jettison weight 2 1000 lb in crease in the launch escape system 3 10000 lb increase in the 2nd stage propellant but increase in the stage weight 4 20000 lb increase in the 2nd stage propellant but increase in the stage weight 5 10000 lb increase in t he 2nd stage propellant and increase in the stage weight constant stage mass fraction without the engine weight was used to determine the new stage weight 6 20000 lb increase in the 2nd stage propellant and increase in the stage weigh t constant stage mass fraction without the engine weight was used to determine the new stage weight the increased propellant cases show an increased delivery capability however these situations do not account for any structural growth of the upper stage necessary to accommodate the increased propellant also shown on this chart is the net effect of increasing the propellant and corresponding increase to the structural weight of the upper stage the larger propellant capability requires an in creased structure that effectively negates any payload increase figure 534 2 shows the effect on the payload capability when structural growth is permitted constant stage mass fraction was used throughout 448 nasaspaceflightcom in figure 534 3 the effects of differe nt trajectory shaping parameters are shown the varied elements are 1 10 increase in the aerodynamic reference area 2 10 increase in the base force 3 the jettison altitude is increased by 2000 feet which is approximately 2 seco nd delay 4 the 1st stage separation time is reduced by 2 seconds the separation criterion becomes the time when the thrust 38000 lb f 5 limit the maximum acceleration to 38 gs 6 limit the maximum acceleration to 32 gs of these six elements only the change in the booster separation time assists the vehicles payload capability in this case the separation thrust of the first stage is greater than the reference trajectory the effect of this higher thrust on the success of stage s eparation was not addressed when the engine characteristics are changed in either stage there will be an effect on the payload capability these sensitivities are shown in figure 534 4 the parameters shown are 1 1 increase in boosters thrust level with changes to the flow rate when the flow rate is left unchanged the increase in thrust effectively increases the isp 2 2000 lb increase in the boosters propellant the isp is assumed to be constant 3 4 º increase in t he propellant mean bulk temperature of the booster the equations to modify the burn time thrust and

on delivered payload rev 2 trajectory 453 nasaspaceflightcom 5342 srb trades rev 1 trajectory the reference design for the launch vehicle uses an inline solid rocket motor this motor is modification of the srm currently flying with the space shuttle the motor consists of 4 segments and it uses pban propellant the reference data used in this analysis assumes 60 deg propellant mean bulk temperature pmbt and the ksc mean annual wi nds for these trade studies the rev 1 reference trajectory was used several trade studies concerning the first stage have been conducted these include the pmbt of the motor the type of propellant and the number of segments and the effects of knoc kdown the knockdown phenomenon is described in section 5325 changing the temperature of the propellant impacts the payload capability of the launch vehicle as shown in table 534 1 the reference motor is compared to motors typically seen in febru ary cold and july hot for each of these trajectory runs the corresponding ksc monthly winds were incorporated these trajectory results were provided to the 6 dof simulation as potential payloads for this vehicle become heavier the delivery capa bility needs to be augmented two possible upgrades were investigated 1 use htpb as the propellant in the 4 segment booster and 2 use 5 segment booster the 5 segment booster also uses the htpb propellant the payload increases with these upgra des can be seen in table 534 2 to more accurately model the srb the effect of knockdown was incorporated into the simulation the modifications are based on trajectory

rev 2 trajectory for the rev 2 reference trajectory the upper stage follows start transient which is detailed in section 5323 until it reaches 100 this is followed by thrust ramp up of 10 per second to the nominal power level npl the reference npl for these studies is 1045 since the upper stage is an expendable component increasing the operating thrust will help the payload capability of the vehicle the effect of the increa sed thrust is shown in table 534 4 as shown in figure 534 5 the change in the payload capability is approximately linear between the power levels of 1045 and 111 higher thrust levels may exceed the maximum acceleration limit of 50gs and then throttling would be required the decision to increase the thrust level becomes programmatic decision although the payload capability is increased the reliability of the engine is believed to be slightly reduced 458 nasaspaceflightcom table 534 4 upper stage nom inal power level study results rev 2 trajectory

the payload to the nominal meco conditions the launch vehicle places its payload into 30 x 160 nm orbit with the insertion altitude at 57 nm for purpo ses of this study it has been assumed the payload is separated from the upper stage 250 seconds after meco the optimal separation time will need to be determined by further analysis as an integral unit the upper stage and adapter will reenter the atm osphere the reentry aerodynamics as shown in table 535 3 was provided by joe lowery ev33 on june 20 2005 since the orientation of the upper stage may vary three sets of drag coefficients were provided when it reenters on its side angle of attack 90 º the drag causes upper stage to impact quicker with an end entry angle of attack 0 º the impact location is further downrange tumbling reentry gives an intermediate impact distance since the atmospheric conditions are not consta nt this study also varied the atmospheric density by 30 the impact zones shown in figure 535 2 and figure 535 3 encompass the maximum and minimum impact locations the shortest downrange distance represents more dense atmosphere 30 density mu ltiplier and side entry orientation on the upper stage the furthest impact

the mission this has an impact on the available launch times the first launch of mission buildup will not be restricted to specific orbit plane the inclination will be predetermined but the ascending n ode isnt fixed by the rendezvous requirements any subsequent launches must perform the rendezvous missions and they must be launched into the orbit plane of the first component the effect of the earths rotation and the need to launch into the require d orbit plane as the launch site rotates past the target orbit is shown as payload penalty in figure 536 1 the curve for the 285 º inclination orbit is not symmetrical about the zero time point since the bottom of the curve is very flat the optimi zation program post chose zero point that was shifted to the left of symmetrical location the zero point could be moved to the right without changing the results the following figure figure 536 2 shows the penalty for each total launch window duration in this study the subsequent launches are allowed to optimize the launch azimuth as well as perform yaw steering after the first stage is separated the reference trajectory does not allow the yaw steering 500050010001500200025003000

rendezvous additional constraints are placed on the mission this has an impact on the available launch times the first launch of mission buildup will not be restricted to specific orbit plane the inclination will be predetermined but the ascending node isnt fixed by the rendezvous requirements any subse quent launches must perform the rendezvous missions and they must be launched into the orbit plane of the first component the effect of the earths rotation and the need to launch into the required orbit plane as the launch site rotates past the target rbit is shown as payload penalty in figure 537 6 the curve for the 285 º inclination orbit is not symmetrical about the zero time point since the bottom of the curve is very flat the optimization program post chose zero point that was shifted to the left of symmetrical location the zero point could be moved to the right without changing the results by launching into slightly higher inclination the launch window for due east mission can be increased when the vehicle is launched in to the 290 inclination two launch opportunities are present within short period of time these opportunities represent the ability to launch into either the ascending leg of the orbit or the descending leg this produces the payload penalty oscillat ion seen in figure 537 6 0100010203040506070809101112131415 80604020020406080100120140time from nominal

against higher rcs system weight carried to orbit relative to separate roll control systems wherein the upper stage r cs hardware would be relatively light small solid motor will have to be added to the srb to pitch it over at separation if all the roll rcs is moved to the upper stage there is 101 ratio of payload penalty due to carrying weight on the upper stage versus carrying the weight on the

ascent trajectories iss reference trajectory iss february trajectory and iss july trajectory abort landing ground tracks are provided for an iss reference trajectory and due east reference trajectory summary of all key trajectory parameters and worse case abort times is provided note that aborts during an iss mission tend to have slightly higher maximum acceleration dynamic pressure and heat rate than aborts during due east mission also note the high probability that an abort during clv 4 mission will end with landing in the mid atlantic the peaks in eyeballs out and eyeballs down figures 5433 1 and 5433 2 accelerations occur because the aborts at high dynamic pressure involve 3 second acceleration eyeballs in followed by free motion the crew module with spent launch escape system attached is at high dynamic pressure and is relatively light immediately following burnout the crew module is decelerated rapidly by the drag force hence the large eyeballs out acceleration the pitchover following burnout made while dynamic pressure is still high causes the large eyeballs down acceleration 493 nasaspaceflightcom the eyeballs down peak can be reduced by postponing the rotation to trim angle of attack the eyeballs out acceleration is unavoidable since we have relatively light vehicle traveling at high speed and at high dynamic pressure thus the crew will experience high acceleration followed immediately by high deceleration this rapid change in acceleration ma be an issue for crew health and may for example lead to requirement that their heads be restrained this brings up further issue with regard to abort near maximum dynamic pressure the provides an acceleration of about 4g at its minimum just before 50 sec figure 5433 1 this value is low due to the drag force induced by the relatively high speed at low altitude the srb stack without the crew module at this time is accelerating at roughly 17 g towards the crew module assuming the abor t was caused by something other than srb shutdown vehicle disintegration or loss of control so the differential acceleration of the crew module relative to the stack is only 23 g which is not very good for escaping potential explosion compression wave after 3 seconds the crew module acceleration is replaced by about 75 g deceleration allowing the srb to continue burning towards the crew module is obviously not acceptable therefore we have derived requirement to be able to shut the srb d own in case of abort trade is how to perform this shutdown blowing the nozzle off blowing the aft dome off and separating at the aft segment are options an alternative that would reduce the initial separation but aid in the later separation would be to command srb actuator hard over to change the direction of thrust this maneuver would likely result in vehicle breakup very shortly after abort potentially when the cev is still too close larger is necessary in order to increase the esca pe capability however larger to provide higher acceleration introduces problems as an example providing 10 g for 3 seconds accelerates the crew module by 960 ftsec nearly doubling the relative velocity the increase in velocity increas dynamic pressure by factor of about 32 and increases the deceleration level felt after burnout by the same factor study is necessary for trading size versus deceleration levelsdynamic pressures versus successful abort escape simulati on of the escape dynamics is needed to understand these effects clearly while examining solutions the significant deceleration that is felt immediately after burnout could create problem with respect to being too close to an explosive environment round the failed launch vehicle 494 nasaspaceflightcom maximum gx accelerationeye balls in 024681012

system 5441 description the baseline thrust vector control system tvc designs fo r first and second stage were chosen to be the same basic system as currently used on the rsrm in order to keep to the aggressive schedule for this vehicle and to keep cost down commonality between the booster and upper stage was seen as an advantage pro duction for the current srb auxiliary power units apu is still active while production for other tvc components could be reinstated within schedule to meet tvc system delivery furthermore only delta qualification program would be required for the up per stage tvc while qualification program would likely be needed for the booster new technologies will be required and the only modifications for upper stage tvc are likely to be limited to mounting structures hydraulic lines and possibly the add ition of cooling for the apu transmission oil the tvc system has redundancy in the apus and the actuator servovalves the tvc system schematic is shown in figure below each apu is cross fed to both actuators so that if one fails hydraulic supply wil l still be fed to both actuators at slightly degraded velocity capability 3 degsec vs 5 degsec 512 nasaspaceflightcom 5442 tvc requirements the current design srb tvc requirements are 5 degrees gimbal angle 6 degsec gimbal angle rate under rated load of 63348 lbf 2 radsec2 acceleration under rated load preliminary 6dof simulations in maveric are given in the following figures for nominal non dispersed vehicle or environment failures flight with reference wind among the models included in maveric are preliminary autopilot third order transfer function model of the tvc actuators and propellant slosh dynamics these preliminary results show that gimbal angles are well within current design requirements the srb an d ssme gimbal rates are also well within requirements except for transient just before srb burnout this is not realistic effect however as srb nozzle null commands prior to separation are not yet implemented in the simulation the effects of slosh ca n be seen in the ssme gimbal and gimbal rate plots 513 nasaspaceflightcom 514 nasaspaceflightcom 515 nasaspaceflightcom 545 clv 3dof simulation with comparisons to post this section includes post tomaveric comparison for the 285 deg inclination aka lunar mission and the 516 deg inclination aka iss mission revision 1 3 dof reference trajectories using the clv 4 launch vehicle model as described elsewhere in this report 5451 ground rules and assumptions the following ground rules and assumptions were used to generate these results clv4 lunar and iss reference trajectories rev 1 output from post provided by msfcev42 maveric ii version 200 with same general assumptions and modeling as those used in the post simulations described elsewhere in this report open loop guidance during firststage using post derived attitude vs altitude data followed by closed loop vacuum guidance during second stage closed loop guidance uses the same target radius inertial speed inertial flight path angle and orbital inclination as post in the 516 deg case the ascent guidance in maveric also targets for specified nodal value to emulate the requirement for rendezvous in particular orbital plane maximum command maneuver rates are set to 1 degsec each body axis applied to the guidance comm ands during second stage flight to stay within expected vehicle maneuverability limits 5452 comparison results figures 545 1 545 11 on the following pages show the 285 deg trajectory comparisons while the post m averic ii traje ctories have slight differences in some of the trajectory parameters eg altitude ground track angles of attack and sideslip the overall results compare very well most of these subtle differences are caused by differences in the steering and optimization formul ations between post and maveric for example the closed loop ascent guidance algorithm neglects the aerodynamic forces even though there is enough aerodynamic force at the beginning of second stage flight to perturb the trajectory post takes into accou nt aerodynamic forces throughout the trajectory and also has perfect knowledge of the environment whereas the ascent guidance in maveric emulates an onboard software implementation and hence merely has estimates of the environment and vehicle states figures 545 12 545 13 show the 516 deg trajectory comparisons of altitude and ground track the other trajectory parameters have very minor differences comparable to the 285 deg mission comparisons and thus the corresponding plots are omitted t he injected mass toorbit difference between the post and maveric ii simulations is typically less than 100 lbm 516 nasaspaceflightcom 5453 guidance description and results the ascent guidance uses reference euler angles vs altitude tables for first stage flight and close dloop vacuum guidance for second stage flight the closed loop guidance uses an optimal control solution with simplifying assumptions to achieve maximum payload to orbit cf reference 1 the trajectory as simulated within the guidance is divided int the same flight phases as the events controller but with simplified startend conditions for example the launch escape system is jettisoned at particular altitude during the maveric simulated trajectory but internal to the guidance calculations th is jettisoned at some specified time after start of the second stage burn where the specified time is determined from the nominal trajectory guidance phases can also end at particular vehicle mass and each phase has an end ofphase jettison mass possibly zero associated with it this simplified guidance formulation keeps the complexity of the onboard guidance software manageable while negligibly impacting guidance performance even in the presence of dispersions mass jettisons could be negl ected in the guidance calculations particularly when the jettison mass is small compared to the vehicle mass but the resulting guidance attitude commands and predicted cutoff times have undesirable albeit small discontinuities in the region of the jett ison event figure 545 14 shows the predicted ssme cutoff time computed by guidance that is the predicted time at which the launch vehicle will attain the target orbit the prediction is nearly constant over the duration of second stage flight chang ing by about one second over 250 sec of flight figure 545 15 shows the implicitly commanded angular velocity magnitude vs time which verifies that the guidance is not commanding rates above 1 degsec as specified via i load figure 545 16 shows the number of iterations per guidance cycle an iteration consists of semi analytical trajectory prediction constraint error calculation and independent variable correction most of the guidance cycles require one iteration with the worst case guidan ce cycle requiring nine in the transition from open loop to closed loop flight 517 nasaspaceflightcom

includes three parts the first is description of the baseline separation plan used for this vipa cycle this section describes some of the rationale for choosing this separation plan next is list of few alternative ways to do separation that we did not use in this cycle finally separation simulation results are displayed stage separation plan when axial acceleration drops below level corresponding to srb thrust of 1 5000 lbf tbr command firing of two bsms immediately we chose acceleration as the deciding factor because it directly ties to srb thrust and we remove any chance that we might command separation while thrust is still too high we can change to pc late r if that makes sense after more detailed analysis the bsms are on the aft skirt our separation condition holds the srb longer than it is held for shuttle and longer than optimal performance would give so that the thrust level required for separation is not too large for example at typical separation time 10 sec earlier in our srb model 056 g would be required for 01g separation this would require 6 bsms for the first second followed by more in the 2nd second and more in the 3rd at sepa ration the srb would be accelerating towards the stack at 046 g if we did not fire the bsms delaying separation reduces this substantially b timed for when bsm thrust has built up milliseconds later command the shape charge ring at the base of the i nterstage to separate the srb c bsms fire for approximately 0805 seconds to pull the srbs back from the stack they provide about 20000 lbf thrust each d use rcs jets on second stage to provide 001 g acceleration for the duration of the stack coast sta rting immediately after srb separation to provide for settling of propellants starting 05 seconds tbr after separation fire the roll control rcs jets on the srb using timer set when the command to the bsms is sent to rotate the srb in the pitch plane the purpose of this is two fold it removes the parachute area from the line of fire of the 2nd stage engine when it ignites and it ensures that any residual thrust from the srb will not move it towards the stack an option here is to also comman d the srb actuator to hard over in the direction that will assist the roll we wont consider this right now since the magnitude of its help may have significant dispersions and is likely to be somewhat less than what we get from the rcs command the rcs jets to stop the rotation at about pitch angle of 90 deg note that this stopping of the roll probably needs to be modified in the next cycle since tumbling is necessary to initiate the recovery process for the shuttle srbs f start the 2nd stage ig nition process timed so that significant thrust will not occur until the parachutes are sufficiently out of the line of fire for now we are assuming that the ssme is at full thrust 10 seconds after srb separation g at 01 sec tbr after ssme at full thr ust separate the interstage up to the thrust cone with another shape charge use thrusting joints to separate the interstage in 2 halves tbr trade is to separate the interstage prior to ssme startup some alternative separation schemes that we re not using for the baseline fire in the hole this is simpler in certain respects but raises issues of parachute survival and engine start shock wave reflection parachute survival becomes non issue if the srb is not recovered b using the to pr ovide separation we dont know whether or not we still need the for later aborts at this early design stage also this makes successful solid burns part of the nominal mission success it means we need to work the structural 550 nasaspaceflightcom impacts of tension throughout the second stage service module and crew module caused by the pulling the stack off the srb it would yield increased payload performance other things being equal c mechanism on the srb to kill the thrust and remove the performance impac t of holding the srb longer than performance would dictate and to reduceremove the need for the bsms we thought this would cause reliabilitysafety issues for the vehicle however we will probably need method to kill the srb thrust for aborts anyway separation simulation results assumptions and other information relative motion due to the various separation thrusting forces is numerically integrated the effects of gravity are assumed to be equal on the two components b the origin is at the back end of the 2nd stage measurements are relative to the back end of the 2nd stage c 2nd stage is accelerating at 001 g forward d 2 bsms provide initial srb separation srb is also still in the thrust tailoff phase roll control thrusters used to provide pitch to rotate srb away from 2nd stage nozzle f starting position of srb cg is directly behind end

just touching the stability margin boundary represented by the half triangle 549 srb slag impacts slag accumulates in the rear of the srb during flight it sloshes and sometimes slos hes overboard into the srb plume this sloshing causes slosh forces internally and also changes the thrust slightly when it comes out there is slosh frequency associated with this motion the slag can also come out as the srb burns out at the end of flight reference is shuttle sts 54 pressure perturbation investigation by charles martinmsfc aiaa 95 2882 charles martin is good reference for additional information on the slag we did not analyze the slosh effects due to slag during this s tudy cycle since the slosh mass is close to the gimbal point this tends to mitigate the bad effects of the sloshing we also did not analyze the effects of the thrust forces at the slosh frequency these delta forces are fairly small but should be an alyzed they may be small compared to the effects of the srb acoustic mode thrust oscillation operating at nonzero gimbal angle we did not analyze these effects during this cycle because they seemed at first glance to be smaller than the other conside rations we were examining for stability such as the upper stage slosh modes and the vehicle vibration modes 558 nasaspaceflightcom we do not know the precise effects of the slosh movement when the srb is pushed backward at separation as opposed to earlier when it is accelerat ing this needs to be studied to ensure there is bad impact on the separation success 5410 cev separation cev separation was not simulated or analyzed during this early conceptual design study because the upper stage and cev will be in orbit whe n cev separation occurs and because the ssme will not be thrusting at the time any torques or forces on the stack should be very small thus simple separation procedure with springs should be sufficient to result in clean separation without adding separation motors the stack should be controlled to stable attitude for the separation it may be possible to do this with the rcs engines that are already on the upper stage should more control capability be necessary it makes sense to do this w ith the cev control system rather than to add more rcs engines to the upper stage just for stability for separation 5411 liftoff clearance liftoff clearance was not worked during this early conceptual design study analysis of liftoff clearance inclu des simulation of the clearance of the hold down posts as well as simulation of the clearance of the launch tower this analysis must include worst case winds and dispersions to ensure that positive clearance always results the design of the pad struct ures was not sufficiently mature to conduct the study at this time and the team felt that liftoff clearance is not likely to be problem since the vehicle has high acceleration level immediately after liftoff 559 nasaspaceflightcom 55 aerothermodynamics clv4 aerotherm odynamic environments have been defined for two flow phenomena aerodynamic heating and plume induced heating all aerothermodynamic environments were generated using nominal trajectories trajectory dispersions caused by atmospheric wind systems and other variations have not been taken into account at this time development of thermal design specific trajectories will take place at later stage of vehicle development 551 aerodynamic heating environments aerodynamic heating is induced on external surfaces of the clv4 launch vehicle during supersonic and hypersonic flight conditions during first and second stage ascent and re entry ascent aerodynamic heating environments were not defined at this time for flight after first stage separation on asc ent or for second stage re entry from preliminary design perspective the peak aerodynamic heat rate is encountered before first stage separation due to the relatively low overall magnitude of the first stage flight ascent aerodynamic heating the cond stage flight heat rate contribution is minimal to the overall thermal design re entry aerodynamic heating is the dominant aerodynamic heating concern for the first stage solid rocket booster second stage reentry aerodynamic heating will be require d to support future re entry break up analysis thus second stage re entry aerodynamic heating is not required at this time in addition localized aerodynamic heating amplification due to protuberances should also be assessed these environments will be generated at later time as the vehicle configuration matures 5511 first stage ascent aerodynamic heating launch vehicle ascent aerodynamic heating peaks during the first stage of flight for typical large launch vehicles peak ascent aerodynamic hea ting will occur above mach 20 and at altitudes below 150 kft virtually all launch vehicles begin lift off with turbulent flow heating and then transition to laminar flow heating later in flight as the ambient flow density rapidly decreases turbulent fl ow is result of the rather long overall surface running length surface roughness and assorted protuberances encountered on most large launch vehicles preliminary design level first stage aerodynamic heating environments were defined for the clv4 launch vehicle configuration at several axial stations down the vehicle length the local heat transfer coefficient for each axial body point was computed using the local running length boundary layer edge properties and the schultz grunow turbulent flat pla heating correlation the appropriate mangler transformation was applied to the flat plate turbulent heating correlation for each body point location the local boundary layer edge pressure was approximated by modified newtonian impact theory or shock xpansion theory as appropriate for the local geometry the local flow properties were evaluated using eckerts reference temperature concept the enclosed environments were generated for the clv4 iss reference trajectory rev 1 dated june 6

peaks around t80 to 87 seconds at mach numbers of approximatel 285 325 depending on body point location the highest levels of heating were encountered on the cev nose and srb aft skirt due to the

generated using the state computer code the state program is heating analysis code that establishes heat transfer coefficients heating rates and heating loads for the space transportat ion system solid rocket boosters srb during reentry from space the state program is uniquely designed to model the tumbling and rolling trajectory of the rsrb that produces nearly every vehicle flow field orientation possible complete analysis can be performed on some 200 monte carlo trajectories to establish 0 50 95 and 100 percent maximum heat load trajectories or single reentry trajectory the preliminary clv4 first stage re entry aerodynamic heating environments were generated using nom inal 3dof re entry trajectory this trajectory provides the altitude and velocity of the vehicle but does not accurately model the tumbling and rolling which results in distribution of the peak heating stagnation line environments over the circumferenc of the vehicle the result of this analysis is that the clv4 re entry environments generated by state are overly conservative comparison of the nominal clv4 environments with the 95 design rsrb environments for the rsrb zone 4 bp 67 show factor of 139 in the peak heating rate and factor of 230 in the total heat load similar comparison in the total heat loads using the swept cylinder heating indicator model at the peak heating circumferential location produces factor of 20 in the total heat load preliminary re entry aerodynamic heating environments have been generated for the clv4 vehicle by applying the 20 factor to the existing rsrb environments for each body point of interest this factor is conservative assuming that the rsrb aerod ynamics accurately model the clv4 re entry vehicle the rsrb environments are generated using monte carlo set of 200 trajectories which incorporate critical aerodynamic parameters which define the vehicle flight the parameters differ greatly from the p roposed clv4 vehicle for example the rsrb has significant roll which is produced by variety of factors not existing in the clv4 vehicle the rsrm has forward and aft separation motors which produce roll the rsrb separation motors and attach structur effect the cg and aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle also effecting roll because of differences in the aerodynamics and cg of the clv4 and rsrb the trim angle of the clv4 is likely to be different than the rsrb trim angle of 164 degrees the in ternal aft skirt thermal design has small margins trim angle approaching 180 degrees will result in negative margins in the current tps

or missiles the exhaust plumes and plume interaction flow fields combine to produce an environment affecting the aft end of the vehicle commonly referred to as the base heating environment the base heating environment has three components radiation from the hot gases to base region surfaces convection resulting from air or recirculating plume gases flowing over the base surfaces and direct impingeme nt of plume gases on base or other structures second stage clv4 plume radiation and convection environments were not generated for this analytical cycle second stage radiation and convection will both be relatively low due to use of lo2lh 2 propellants which produce little radiation at high altitudes and the low convective levels at these altitudes associated with single engine configuration these analyses w ill be conducted in the future 5521 first stage plume radiation and convection clv4 plu radiation and convection is induced by the single four segment rsrm plume the rsrm uses composite propellant with 16 powdered aluminum aluminum oxide formed during combustion of the rsrm propellant is the dominant contributor to plume radiation clv4 plume convection will be largely limited to the immediate base and nozzle area and will be caused by plume freestream flow field interaction this interaction will cause recirculation 564 nasaspaceflightcom zone to form on the aft portion of the nozzle exterior and t lesser degree the thermal curtain and aft edge of the aft skirt the current analysis uses existing space shuttl srb base environments at θb 225º clv4 and space shuttle ascent trajectories are similar enough to allow use of the shuttle heating time histories at this preliminary stage of analysis clv4 plume radiation and convection from the single rsrm plume w ill be similar to the space shuttle environments at the θb 225º location because this area does not experience heating from the three ssme or opposite rsrm plumes these are the lowest environments on the current shuttle srb base future analyses will utilize actual clv4 design trajectories plumes and base structures since the existing srb base area structure has been used as the basis for clv base structure and the clv environments will be lower than existing shuttle environments base structure should easily accommo date the clv plume induced radia tive and co nvective heating environments 5522

scenarios mission and the resulting effect of these variables on the aerothermal environments selection of the optimum tp s for launch vehicle is complex and challenging task that requires consideration of not only weight but also operability maintenance durability cost and integration with the vehicle structure including cryogenic propellant tanks tps is used to protect the launch vehicle from the extreme temperatures experienced during launch and entry environments tps is not single material but is system of materials working together in the most efficient manner factors that influence tps design are n atural and induced environments structural temperature limits subsystem and component temperature requirements and propulsion system requirements the objective of the tps is to minimize the vehicles weight using materials whose thermal and mechanical integrity are maintained throughout the mission cycle tps is key element in the vehicle design and critical to its ultimate

not consider protuberances over the external surfaces these will locally increase the heating to the exterior skin and could cause areas where thicker than on the current srb tps is needed protuberances could also disrupt flow near the aft end of the second stage interstage region if the external flow separates and reattaches on the open interstage it could cause areas of localized heating that might compromise the structure the cable systems tunnel runs axially along the current srb mcc 1 and cork are currently used on the srb to keep it within its temperature limit this will

environments are more severe than current srb re entry environments the aft skirt thermal curtain closes out the i nterior aft skirt against the heating environments experienced during flight this flexible thermal curtain consists of several layers of blanket insulation that allows the nozzle system to gimbal while protecting the tvc system from plume radiation and r ecirculating hot gases and

currently some of the stringers near the tvc violate the 300ºf limit for short time an increased re entry environment would cause longer and possibly more critical violations base heating was not

environment and box heat input the preliminary analysis herein predicts the bulk temperature for each avionics box without considering radiati on or conduction to the mounting surface or surrounding environment bulk temperature rise was predicted based on the launch timeline for both the core booster avionics boxes and the upper stage avionics boxes this preliminary analysis was performed t determine any components of particular concern for development of passive tcs modeling approach preliminary analysis was performed assuming an initial avionic box temperature of 21c at the time of launch the box input power and mass was obtained from the avionics equipment list 1 it was assumed conservatively that the box power input was all dissipated within that box for two components the s band power amplifier and gps transmitter estimated power dissipations 583 nasaspaceflightcom were used 2 any thermal contact of the avionics box with radiation or conduction to the mounting surface or surrounding environment was neglected for the purpose of the analysis all boxes were assumed to be aluminum 2219 the analysis herein estimates bulk temperature rise for the whole avionic box which is considered comparable to the base plate temperatures of the avionics box determination of resulting internal component peak temperatures will require packaging analyses and evaluation of variance between base plate tempera tures and these bulk avionic box temperature rise estimates for each box the duration over which the input power was applied varied depending on the mounting location the upper stage avionics are mounted in the spacecraft adapter at the top of upper st age upper stage avionics are assumed operational from launch until upper stage separation the duration from launch to main engine cut off meco is 473 seconds 3 it was assumed that separation occurs instantaneously after meco for the purpose of t his analysis any additional avionics operational time after meco will be needed to be evaluated at later date the core booster avionics are mounted on the frustum at the top of the booster the core booster avionics are assumed to be operational for 333 seconds from launch until 15000ft 3 and an additional 59 seconds to splashdown 4 for total duration of 392 seconds results preliminary bulk temperature rise for each upper stage avionics box was estimated and the results are shown in tabl 561 1 the temperatures shown are assumed equivalent to the avionic box base plate temperature internal component temperatures will need to be determined by packaging analysis for these components the estimated temperature rise varies from 0c to 5c for all but four components the four components with higher preliminary temperature rise estimates are listed below sband transceiver estimated 9c temperature rise sband power amplifier estimated 12c temperature rise cband transponder estimated 7c temperature rise and gps transmitter estimated 30c temperature rise preliminary bulk temperature rise for each core booster avionics box was estimated and the results are in table 561 2 the temperatures shown are assumed equiva lent to the avionic box base plate temperature internal component temperatures will need to be determined by packaging analysis for these components the estimated temperature rise varies from 0c to 3c for all but one component the rate gyro has pr eliminary temperature rise estimate or 10c conclusions the objective of this preliminary study was to estimate the base plate temperature rise to provide data for preliminary evaluation of the thermal control system methodology needed for the majori ty of components the temperature rise was 5c or less although the bulk temperature rise was low for these components the heat transfer path needs to be considered to adequately evaluate the design for instance if component with high heat dissipat ion is not in adequate thermal contact with the box exterior it may exceed its temperature requirement for the remaining five components the temperature rise was estimated to be between 7c to 30c and they will require more detailed analysis to determin in passive cooling method can be used for these components this shows that more work will be needed to determine if passive thermal 584 nasaspaceflightcom control system is feasible for the avionic system any updates to the timeline that would increase avionics operati onal time will have significant impact on preliminary results herein and may impact the ability to provide passive thermal control system for example operation of the upper stage electronics beyond meco will result in larger temperature rise predicti ons in addition to these preliminary results the component temperature requirements and heat conduction path to the box base plate are needed the factors relevant to tcs design for the clv avionics include internal and external environments the avio nic box internal environment is determined by the following thermal heat dissipation and distribution for the box power input conduction path from internal components to the box base plate and flight operational timeline the avionic box external envir onment is determined by the following design of the base plate mounting surface and interface material including possible use of phase change devices design of mounting locations to optimize heat dissipation ascent and re entry environmental influen ces on avionics boxes and prelaunch purge conditions that define initial avionics temperatures determination if passive thermal control system is feasible for the avionics cannot be made based on the information provided herein more detailed analysi s of any areas of concern including those identified by this preliminary analysis is required to determine if passively cooled tcs is feasible once environments are determined and temperature requirements for components are defined the tcs approach can be adequately evaluated the final determination of tcs design is pending additional design definition and more detailed analyses that will be completed as the design matures any additional analysis will need to consider the factors listed above we will facilitate modeling improvements as design and operational details emerge while the design matures table 561 1 preliminary upper stage avionics box base plate temperature estimates 585

configurati on during ground hold operations all contributions from equation 1 were incorporated into this model to evaluate performance under various environmental conditions ambient temperature wind speed and relative humidity the individual terms in equation 1 are described in detail in reference 562 2 this analysis does not consider the chilldown transients that occur as cryogenic propellant tank is being loaded if the surface temperature is below the dew point temperature t dp and the freezing temp erature water vapor is assumed to be deposited on the surface in the form of icefrost the code does not distinguish between ice and frost condensation is formed if the surface temperature is greater than freezing but below t dp the tank is assumed t be fully loaded inner wall of the tank is assumed to be at the propellant temperature the model calculates condensation or icefrost rate of formation this rate is an instantaneous rate and if applied to the time period for loading to determine thickness will produce conservative results since the frostice layer is not modeled in reality as frost layer forms it has an insulating effect which causes the frosting tps surface to rise in temperature as the frost ages it increases in density and thermal conductivity which allows further growth this continues until the frost becomes ice and further 590 nasaspaceflightcom increase in conductivity is not possible since the conductivity is now constant the ice thickness increases until the outer surface reaches 3 2f or the dew point if lower than 32f and there is further increase in thickness future work should include modeling the frostice layer and including this transient effect also not considered is the transient variation of the input conditions for example the wind speed may vary with time as mentioned previously the inner tank boundary condition is held constant at the propellant temperature film boiling is not considered future work should include film boiling

dynamics ld team for this study was threefold the first objective was t initiate the ld assessment of provided point ofdeparture vehicle podv these initial assessments are designed to drive out and assess the major load and dynamic contributors to the design given that the provided podv relied on existing hardware specifically the shuttle srb the second objective was to compare the existing capabilities to the new configurations loads the third objective was to provide insight to others regarding ld considerations that will be present in the new design while derstanding its too early to quantitatively assess them detailed description of the data used analyses conducted and recommended design loads for the point ofdeparture vehicle is contained in the crew launch vehicle clv system structural dynamic s loads and models databook revision 00 tbd these recommended loads should be used for the next phase of clv system design and analysis 572 point ofdeparture vehicle and previous studies vipa ld has participated in several studies pertaining t the definition and assessment of crew capsule launched on shuttle srb with liquid upper stage the first study was human rating study lead by gary langford in the march to april 2005 timeframe this concept consisted of 4 segment srb and 5 meter upper stage with 4 expander cycle engines as described in figure 572 1 figure 572 1 human rating study concept description 598 nasaspaceflightcom early in the 60 day study podv was chosen that consisted of 5 segment srb and 5 met er upper stage with either 4 expander cycle engines or 1 j 2s engine this concept is described in figure 572 2 finally the vipa team was directed to work on what has emerged as the 60 day studys podv this concept consisted of 4 segment srb and n upper stage with single ssme rs25 or derivative figure 572 3 shows this concept the pictured concept originally was 5 meter upper stage but this was soon changed to 55 meters vipa ld was able to perform sufficient analysis on these three c oncepts to formulate assessments of different aspects of their loads and dynamics behavior taken all together they form sound basis for an assessment of the general concept figure 572 2 early 60 day study concept descrip tion 599 nasaspaceflightcom figure 572 3 emerged 60 day study concept description 573 loads and dynamics assessments number of different assessments were made by the vipa ld team and are discussed here 5731 structural modeling all the st ructural finite element models fems for the three concepts were very similar the srb models were the same models used to generate shuttle level ii integration models and provided by united space alliance usa 5th segment was copied from the forwa rd center segment to generate the 5 segment srb model the upper stage crew module and escape tower are simple beam element models generated for this task finally the mobile launch platform mlp model is the same model used for the shuttle rollout

structural frequencies for the d ifferent concepts are shown in figure 5731 2 these results indicate some low frequencies particularly when constrained to the mlp this indicates supporting tower with vehicle support will likely be required on the mlp this is particularly tru for the mlp rollout gross liftoff weight glow free free or flight frequencies are around 1 hz which is comparable to saturn v 601 nasaspaceflightcom figure 5731 2 concept structural frequencies 5732 sizing cycle at the start of the 60 day study an initial sizing effort was conducted on the upper stage of the 5 segment cept the design loads were taken from the human rating study pre launch and 3 σ maximum dynamic pressure case factor of 15 was applied to these loads to account for unknowns the vipa stress team used an isogrid stiffening spreadsheet by chiroux 12 2002 to size the upper stage structure the resulting weight was found to be comparable with the intros primary structure weight provided by advanced concepts this result offers more confidence that the vehicle weight is reasonable 5733 pre launch ground winds prelaunch ground winds were looked at for all three concepts figures 5733 1 through 5733

simple steel cas design of the srb the 4 segment design loads should equally apply to the 4 aft most segments of the 5 segment srb likewise the directional bias shown in the srb design moments should only be an artifact of the databook and not the structure itself i t can be seen that for the most part the pre launch loads fall near or below the srb design moments the longer vehicles are beginning to encroach on the design loads table 5733 1 shows the srb hold down post loads for the three configurations as wel l as the capability indicators from the srb loads databook reference 575 6 all

concepts number of assumptions were made to facilitate these early assessments first only quasi static loads were considered in this case the vehicle fem was considered to be in equilibrium between applied and inertia loading for each time point in the traj ectory that was analyzed the vehicle was considered to be in trimmed state ie the roll pitch and yaw rotational accelerations were trimmed to zero using engine control forces this trimming can be affected by the inertial properties of the vehic and hence how they are modeled in the fem the fem masses were based primarily on intros data provided by advanced concepts these masses were distributed over the length of the vehicle as logically as possible during the modeling to provide reasona ble approximation to the rotational inertia characteristics of the vehicle dynamic or stiffness effects have yet been assessed these would include static aeroelastics gust buffet etc the effects of these dynamics can be significant design drive rs and can accounting for load increases on the order of 25 30 the impact of these effects will be one of the first priorities as concept is selected and dedicated effort is begun second aerodynamic loading distributed down the length of the ve hicle was not readily available during these studies net total normal force lift drag and center ofpressure data was available primarily for performance work but also available to the vipa ld team for this reason ld constructed some simplified engineering aerodynamic models of the vehicle using the zonair code produced by zona technologies as documented in previous vipa vac04 report reference 574 5 these models tend to predict normal force data significantly lower than that provided by the vipa aerosciences team as well as having centers ofpressure farther forward the previous report also indicates that the zonair code significantly under predicts the normal force coefficient on the srb aft skirt therefore to provide an alternate aerodynamic loading distribution an additional normal force coefficient was added to the aft skirt of such magnitude to correct for the displaced center ofpressure the resulting distribution was then scaled to match the provided net total normal forc coefficient both sets of aerodynamic distributions were assessed to provide confidence that the loads were adequately enveloped the altered distribution generally produced the worst loading additionally these zonair predictions are linearly increa sing with aoa this assumption does not necessarily hold for large aoa during the later portions of flight as the dynamic pressure declines the vehicle tends to fly at increased angles of attack the combination of these two effects could produce unrea listically high loads during this low dynamic pressure flight for this reason the aerodynamic loads were reduced by the following two rules if the altitude was above 150000 feet and the dynamic pressure was below 100 psf the aerodynamic loading was r educed by 50 if the altitude was above 150000 feet and the dynamic pressure was below 50 psf the aerodynamic loading was reduced by 75 the provided performance drag loads were used for both sets of distributions obtaining realistic aerodynamic env ironments and assessing the impact of these assumptions will also be one of the first priorities as concept is selected and dedicated effort is begun finally these assessments generally do not have 6 dof control simulation with dispersions available at the time of the loads analysis this was true for the 5 segment rsb and the 4 segment rs25 configurations for these cases the 3 dof performance trajectory is used to define the loading environments an additional aoa and sideslip dispersion are added to the trajectory data to simulate possible dispersions that would result from 6 dof simulation in this 605 nasaspaceflightcom case 5 degree dispersion was added to both aoa and sideslip this results in worst case dispersion of little over 7 degrees this dispersion would normally be considered severe however it was deemed prudent at this point given the othe r assumptions the human rating study had defined 3 σ dispersed trajectory that was used for that configurations load assessment without additional aoa and sideslip dispersions added by ld maximum acceleration loads were also calculated in these asse ssments with the exception of the human rating study ascent bending moments trimmedsrb mlp 4244 in 20000020000400006000080000100000120000140000 010002000300040005000nose vehicle station in tailbending

figures 5734 1 and 5734 2 show comparisons of the resulting ascent bending moments and axial loads for the various concepts the axial load plot figure 5734 2 shows the podv with and without an srb tension load due to 900 psi internal pressure this is for comparison purposes with the srb design data which includes internal pressure 607 nasaspaceflightcom figure 5734 3 derived srm capability envelope additionally the vipa stress team took resulting loads from the human rating study 3 σ design case and compared them to the srb casing capability these results assume simple st eel cylinder of comparable thickness and benefits from pressure within the srb from figure 5734 3 one can easily see the design loads are well within the derived srm case capabilities these plots indicate the ascent loads are currently within the design of the existing srb the 5 segment concept analysis did not recover loads within the srb however the trends from the plots are apparent the maximum dynamic pressure bending moments for the podv are encroaching on these design limits however given the relatively simple steel case design of the srb the 4 segment load capabilities should equally apply to the remaining aft segments of the srb 5735 srb actuator hard over failure one of the key aspects looked at during the human rating study wa s that of an srb actuator failure there were several assumptions made to define credible failure complete actuator failure such as structural failure or complete loss of hydraulic pressure was not deemed credible rather the failure was assume d to be from software or command failure or gradual hydraulic pressure release which would eliminate the ability to control the vehicle this led to 6 dof simulation where the srb failure took finite amount of time to develop secondly the actua tor failure was not assumed to be coincident with 3 σ design case 1 σ case was used thirdly the srb failure was assumed to be initiated 5 seconds prior to design wind gust hitting the vehicle finally the actuator failure was assessed for 2 cases failure up which would contribute to the pitch up of the vehicle due to angle ofattack aoa and failure down which would pitch the vehicle down against the initial aoa and push it through zero into growing 608 nasaspaceflightcom bending moment 1sigma maxq 44145sec hardover

study the analysis calculated vehicle responses displacements and accelerations due to vehiclepad interface rele ase while applying dynamic thrust build up and static wind forces only one load case

method for the x33 vehicle 57361 models the 5 segment configuration of the clv is depicted in figure 5736 1 this vehicle is essentially space shuttle 5 segment booster with liquid fueled upper stage the mathematical model used for the vehicle in the li ftoff analysis was constructed in msc patran and preliminary analysis performed in nx nastran figure 5736 2 shows the finite element model in msc

craig bampton mass and stiffness matrices these matrices contained 12 physical degrees of freedom and 54 generalized degrees of freedom the 12 physical degrees of freedom corresponded to the attachments points of the launch pad and are constrained to the launch pad until the commanded release time the remaining 54 generalized degrees of freedom contain the cantilever ed component modes up to 35 hertz propellants were modeled using rbe3s and concentrated masses the fem of the mlp was also constructed in msc patran and craig bampton reduction was performed in nx nastran the mass and stiffness matrices were extr acted from nx nastran and used in the liftoff analysis along with the mass and stiffness matrices load transformation matrices for the clv were also extracted from nx nastran for data recovery these load transformation matrices ltms were formulate d using the modal acceleration technique in order to minimize modal truncation errors 1520 925 522 2967 122 164 611 nasaspaceflightcom 57362 analysis once the models and ltms are extracted from nastran the liftoff analysis is performed in three main phases as listed below 1 model transformation to coupled equations of motion and formatting of ltms and transient and dynamic loads 2 transient response analysis of coupled equations simulating various liftoff load cases ie different wind loads release times etc 3 data recovery of desired r esponse quantities using aforementioned ltms one half percent modal damping was used for all modes in the response analysis this is true for both the vehicle and pad models this number is probably low for the srb segment of the model but should be co nservative for further details of each of these phases see reference 575 3 figure 5736 3 approximated 5 segment srb thrust

the liftoff bending moment with the pre launch wind and ascent loads gene rated for the 5 segment concept the results for the srb were not computed for this concept figure 5736 4 does indicate that the ascent case is the primary load driver for the majority of the upper stage it also indicates that liftoff dynamics may be the principle loads driver for the spacecraft and the extreme f orward end

with basic force balances the vehiclempl interface forces did match the vehicle weight and wind moment and the rigid body vehicle acceleration after release did match the expected acceleration due to steady state thrust forces in general the liftoff events for the load case analyzed seem relatively benign this is due primarily to the commanded release time being so early in the thrust build up profile which prevents any significant elastic energy from being stored and then released addition of overpressure loads and hydrodynamic propellant models would increase the accuracy of the analysis may increase responses of some components but such an increase is not expected to be drastic 5737 ssme rs25 loads dynami cs life comments the ssme rs25 today is human rated development engine its complexity and capability to both operate successfully and survive structurally between extremes demand carefully maintaining balance between inspections and diagnostics c are should be taken during evolution of this engine to revised mission for this reason vipa ld asked msfcer41 propulsion ld to provide comments on the proposed ssme rs25 usage and development plan based on their extensive experience 57371 flee t leader logic fleet leader logic is the methodology used to certify that the ssme rs25 in the present space shuttle system is safe for flight it states that if component or system can be tested to certain amount of time with anomalies then iden tical hardware can be flown safely to 50 of that time without incident and without need of any additional inspections second fleet leader criteria is used when component hardware has been found cracked due to low cycle fatigue high cycle fatigue or verload during flight this documented wavier criteria is based upon combination of testing and analysis that allows the hardware to continue to fly safely while the root cause of the anomaly is investigated the wavier criteria will usually consider the amount of time on the component how many engine starts the component has experienced and the type of crack growth that was determined through inspection as inspections continue throughout the fleet to determine the severity of the issue the waive r constrains the components life to 50 and requires an inspection at 25 of the components fleet leader life therefore to maintain human rating of transitioned assets it would be necessary to carry along or accommodate the associated fleet leader ex perience for appropriate engine flight hardware it is important to maintain component hardware pedigree data because all internal engine interface design loads are based upon analyses and environments that evolved with design changes at differing timelin for individual components design loads assumptions are unique to each piece part fleet leader databases provide way to normalize the variability of individual hardware experience by careful accounting of hot fire operational ground and flight expe riences 57372 certification certification for the ssme rs25 has been accomplished as with all engine programs by deciding requirement for certification that includes certain number of starts for defined number of engines in the case of the ssme rs25 the definition of certification was defined most recently for the atd pumps to be 2 engines with 22 starts this allowed the program to come out of the certification program with fleet leader status that would theoretically qualify the pumps for 1 green run and 10 flights holding to the 50 fleet leader rule 626 nasaspaceflightcom the ssme rs25 is reusable in the space shuttle program through inspections of the returned flight hardware this program has had the ability to identify issues that were missed by th ground testing the inspections have served as valuable tools identifying the lpotp nozzle vane cracking issues and hpotp knife edge seal cracks which happen at very high frequencies and are of low statistical samplings as nasa considers moving into the next evolutionary stage of making the ssme rs25 expendable and changing the requirements to run possibly at new uncertified power levels or reducing the complexity that comes with reusable engines the certification process must be re examined an evaluation needs to be considered whether hardware issues can be properly identified by using the current certification series knowing that the hardware will not have the advantage of postflight inspection as seen during the space shuttle program it is t herefore recommended that developmental testing and inspection continue during the life of the program to enable the expensive long life version of the ssme rs25 to evolve to lower cost units that are more quickly manufactured as with channel wall noz zle rather than the current tube walled nozzles without sacrificing safety 57373 system testing engine system and mps certification testing will be required similar to the main propulsion test article mpta testing of the 1970s and 1980s hot fire test series of an engine integrated with the new flight vehicle feedlines and thrust structure would provide the most significant risk mitigation data for the largest design uncertainty which is system loads by enabling the characterization of pre selected set of mission based self induced engine operational environments in addition this testing will identify enginemps fluid structure interaction affected by turbopump backflow coupled with feedline acoustics and components and it will provide operational statistical variation to validate key design assumptions finally limited number of test flights of the entire system would be helpful to capture small number of low frequency data using special low frequency accelerometers to confirm fl ight design loads envelopes during rollout ferry ignition and steady state for rapid preliminary evaluation of the certification status coupled system frequencies and modes should be validated through modal tests these tests are comparatively inex pensive particularly while the hardware is integrated for the purposes of mpta testing modal testing is desirable for several reasons first several design and operational requirements are affected by the coupled enginevehicle dynamics guidance and control gnc indicates that low frequency modes of the engine system below 35 hz can affect vehicle flight dynamic stability and controls in addition there may be active flight pogo modes in this regime second integration hardware between the ssme rs25 and vehicle will likely become candidates for re certification or redesign from certification standpoint this integration hardware provides the structural load path between the vehicle and engine and is especially critical for transient loads and other low frequency dynamic events this includes structural members such as the thrust vector control gimbals and actuators thrust structure and supporting attachment hardware possibly the engine quadropods finally integrated modal testing would b cheap way of evaluating the availability and sustainability of remaining resources and evolutionary hardware critical transfer functions design spring rates and damping data to provide design operational loads insight can be verified with an integra ted engineaft vehicle thrust structure modal test 57374 component vibroacoustic environments there are number of areas for wh ich engine self induced vibroac oustic environment changes may affect component and system loads components which are do minated by low frequency behavior may be more affected by the mission change that is the addition of new transient events additionally changes in the power level operation and duration may affect some fatigue 627 nasaspaceflightcom design life calculations of few high tim component units for example not much operational engine system experience exists for 109 111 po wer level associated vibroac oustics environment updates may require some statistical evaluation to extend fleet leader databases to account for low sampl populations and operational variability in addition to possible revision of operating environments including fluctuating pressures it would be good idea to revisit range safety vibroac oustic environment requirements for potential impact due to ope rational changes block ii engine systems level change accepted strain gage histories as primary method of design loads validation some consideration from the higher level block ii turbopumps environments is the potential benefit credit to an overal l system level recertification during this evolution work of the engine to revised mission original design requirements may need to be revisited to determine potential benefits which if positive cost trades result may substantially improve operation reliability in areas such as production automation materials in process production inspections mechanisms and eee parts components currently in use are sensitive to changes in their operating environments it would be productive to review turbo machinery component analyses for possible changes in resonance conditions in addition to these assessments components that are driven by the engine transients such as the nozzle would require assessment of t he strain gage history vibroa coustic and uns teady pressure environments should be updated for the expected new mission profiles valves actuators sensors and other electronics may require new qualification specifications 5738 srb acoustic mode thrust oscillations srb acoustic modes similar to organ pipes create thrust oscillations due to changes in the pressure at the nozzle for the shuttle 4 segment rsrm this is around 15 hz the 5 segment srm mode is around 11 hz as demonstrated by the engineering test motor etm3 test this phenome non is stationary and does not couple like pogo however it can excite coincident structural modes avoiding these frequencies is the best approach during design of structure the first axial modes from the human rating study and the current podv 6 9 hz and 8 11 hz will not resonate with the 15 hz rsrm mode there may be some issues with the podv 2nd axial mode passing through 15 hz from 13 164 hz similarly the 5 segment axial mode may couple while passing through 11 hz from 9 13hz these possible issues are not deemed significant to the overall system for several reasons first the structure should only pass through these oscillations briefly and not cause sustained resonance as mentioned this phenomenon doesnt lock in like pogo mode cond some local design effort such as crew seat or critical component isolation can alleviate problems without impacting system weight significantly finally atk believes that the thrust oscillations can be substantially reduced by joint chamfering and inhibitor changes the odd segment number of the 5 segment booster also alleviates this effect because the acoustic anti node does not coincide with case joint it is the inhibitors at these joints that trigger this effect m uch like blowing across reed 574 significant findings prior to and during this 60 day study vipa ld performed various analyses and assessments on three similar concepts consisting of shuttle srb and liquid propulsion upper stage to carry spacecraft to orbit these ana lyses taken all together form sound basis for generating confidence in the general concept structural frequencies for the different concepts were estimated the results indicate some low frequencies particularly when constrained to the mlp indicatin g the need for vehicle support 628 nasaspaceflightcom incorporated on the mlp particularly rollout the lowest free free or flight frequencies are around 1 hz which is comparable to previous launch vehicles srb acoustic modes which generate thrust oscillations do not app ear to be significant design drivers there may be instances of passing through structural frequencies that resonate with the oscillations however these resonances should be short lived and can be treated as design problems rather than concept drivers an initial sizing cycle was performed on the upper stage using loads from an early cycle the results indicated that the preliminary weights for primary structure from advanced concepts are reasonable prelaunch loads fall near or below the srb design moments the longer vehicles are beginning to encroach on the design loads all configurations indicate srb hold down post loads are within capability indicators ascent loads for the three configurations are currently within or just encroaching on the design of the existing srb an initial reconstruction of the srb casing capability based on its steel construction indicates the actual srb capability is higher than the current design loads study of an srb actuator failure was conducted it indicate d time period of roughly 06 seconds before the vehicle 3 σ design loads were realized for the srb structure the spacecraft and upper stage loads reached design levels much sooner there is some debate regarding the credibility of this failure these cases will necessitate further study as crew safety and abort scenarios are considered preliminary liftoff analysis of the 5 segment configuration indicates that the ascent case is the primary load driver for the majority of the upper stage it also indicates that liftoff dynamics may be the pri nciple loads driver for the spacecraft and the extreme forward end of the upper stage the liftoff events for the load case analyzed seem relatively benign compared to shuttle msfcer41 propulsion ld has reviewed the proposed ssme rs25 usage and devel opment plan based on their extensive experience in structural dynamics of propulsion systems integrating this engine system into new vehicle with new flight requirements will require recertification for changes to both operational environment new powe r levels and altitude starts and due to new feedline and structural system changes further certification will be needed as the ssme rs25 evolves into more easily manufactured cost effective expendable engine and the changes associated with this pat h of improvement additional flight instrumentation will likely be required to offset the loss of post flight hardware inspections also due to the lack of flight hardware inspections periodic testing program needs to be developed to address statisti cally anomalies that are not captured during the initial certification testing 575 references 1 j r admire and j brunty transient response method for
