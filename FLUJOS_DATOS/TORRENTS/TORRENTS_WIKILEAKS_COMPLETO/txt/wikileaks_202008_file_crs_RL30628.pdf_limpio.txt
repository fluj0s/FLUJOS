record on human rights fidel castro has ruled since he led the cuban revolution ousting the corrupt government of fulgencio batista from power in 1959 with the cutoff of assistance from the former soviet union cuba experienced severe economic deterioration from 19891993 although there has been some improvement since 1994 as cuba has implemented limited reforms since the early 1960s us policy toward cuba has consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions the clinton administration essentially continued this policy of isolating cuba the principal tool of policy remains comprehensive sanctions which were made stronger with the cuban democracy act cda in 1992 and the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act in 1996 often referred to as the helmsburton legislation another component of us policy consists of support measures for the cuban people this includes private humanitarian donations and ussponsored radio and television broadcasting to cuba under this rubric of support for the cuban people president clinton announced several policy actions in march 1998 these included the resumption of direct charter flights and cash remittances to cuba and the streamlining of licensing procedures for the sale of medicines in january 1999 the president announced additional measures including broadening of permissible cash remittances increasing direct charter flights expanding peopletopeople contact and authorizing the sale of food and agricultural inputs to independent entities in cuba although us policymakers agree on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several schools of thought about how to achieve that objective some advocate policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an approach sometimes referred to as constructive engagement that would lift some us sanctions that they believe are hurting the cuban people and move toward engaging cuba in dialogue still others call for swift normalization of uscuban relations by lifting the us embargo nume rous measures were introduced in the 106th congress that reflected the range of views on us policy toward cuba legislative initiatives proposed both easing and increasing sanctions against cuba in the end legislation passed reflected both approaches it allowed the export of food and medicine to cuba but prohibited any us financing

against cuba and iran as provided for in this bill president clinton waived such payments in the interest of national security when he signed the bill into law on october 28 2000 economic conditions with the cutoff of assistance from the former soviet union cuba experienced severe economic deterioration from 19891993 although there has been some improvement since 1994 estimates of economic decline in the 198993 period range from 3550 the economy reportedly grew 07 in 1994 25 in 1995 and 78 in 1996 while the cuban government originally was predicting growth rate of 45 for 1997 growth for the year was just 25 largely because of disappointing sugar production for 1998 the governments goal was for growth rate of 2535 but another poor sugar harvest severe drought in eastern cuba and the effects of hurricane georges resulted in an estimated growth rate of just 12 in 1999 the economy grew 62 and growth rate of 5 is projected for 2000 socialist cuba has prided itself on the nations accom plishments in health and education for example according to the world bank the literacy rate is 94 and life expectancy is 76 years compared to 79 and 68 years average for other middleincome developing countries the united nations childrens fund unicefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs2 1 crackdowns restrictions sour investors in cuba miami herald june 10 1999 p 1areports that cubas infant mortality rate per 1000 live births was just 79 in 1996 the lowest rate in latin america and among the worlds top 20 countries for this indicator nevertheless the countrys economic decline has reduced living standards considerably and resulted in shortages in medicines and medical supplies when cubas economic slide began in 1989 the government showed little willingness to adopt any significant marketoriented economic reforms but in 1993 faced with unprecedented economic decline cuba began to change policy direction since 1993 cubans have been allowed to own and use us dollars and to shop at dollaronly shops previously limited to tourists and diplomats selfemployment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993 most in the service sector and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations other cuban economic reforms included breaking up large state farms into smaller more autonomous agricultural cooperatives basic units of cooperative production ubpcs in 1993 opening agricultural markets in september 1994 where farmers could sell part of their produce on the open market opening artisan markets in october 1994 for the sale of handicrafts allowing private food catering including home restaurants paladares in june 1995 in effect legalizing activities that were already taking place approving new foreign investment law in september 1995 that allows fully owned investments by foreigners in all sectors of the economy with the exception of defense health and education and authorizing the establishment of free trade zones with tariff reductions typical of such zones in june 1996 in may 1997 the government enacted legislation to reform the banking system and established new central bank bcc to operate as an autonomous and independent entity despite these measures the quality of life for many cubans remains difficult characterized by low wages high prices for many basic goods shortages of medicines and power outages moreover some analysts fear that the government has begun to backtrack on its reform efforts regulations and new taxes have made it extremely difficult for many of the nations selfemployed at one point estimated at more than 200000 but now estimated at 160000 or lower out of total labor force of some 45 million some home restaurants have been forced to close because of the regulations some foreign investors in cuba have also begun to complain that the government has backed out of deals or forced them out of business1 political conditions although cuba has undertaken some limited economic reforms politically the country remains hardline communist state fidel castro who turned 73 on august 13 1999 has ruled since the 1959 cuban revolution which ousted the corrupt governme nt of fulgencio batista from power castro soon laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime by consolidating power and forcing moderates out of the government in april 1961 castro admitted that the cuban revolution was socialist and in december 1961 he proclaimed himself to be marxistleninist from 1959 until 1976 castro ruled by decree httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs3 constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the communist party as the leading force in the state and in society with power centered in politburo headed by fidel castro the constitution also outlined national provincial and local governmental structures executive power is vested in council of ministers headed by fidel castro as president legislative authority is vested in national assembly of peoples power currently with 601 members that meets twice annually for brief periods while assembly members were directly elected for the first time in february 1993 only single slate of candidates was offered elections for the national assembly were held for second time in january 1998 voters again were not offered choice of candidates from october 810 1997 the cuban communist party held its 5th congress the prior one was held in 1991 in which the party reaffirmed its commitment to single party state and reelected fidel and raul castro as the partys first and second secretaries pope john paul ii visited cuba from january 2125 1998 and conducted series of openair masses across the country that were televised in cuba numerous catholic groups from the united states traveled to cuba for the popes visit as did thousands of journalists from around the world while much of his visit was spent on pastoral issues such as encouraging cubans to come back to the church the pope also made more political statements he criticized the us embargo as unjust and ethically unacceptable but also criticized the cuban government for denying freedom to the cuban people he asked the government to release prisoners of conscience and vatican officials gave cuba list of more than 200 prisoners on february 12 1998 the vatican announced that cuba had freed dozens of detainees noting that this step represented prospect of hope for the future there was much speculation about what effect the popes trip to cuba might have on the political situation the trip did not spark unrest from those opposed to the regime nor did the government take any actions to loosen the tight political control of the state and party over the longerterm however the popes visit could result in elevating the profile of the catholic church in such way that it emerges as an important actor in cubas civil society an enhanced profile could improve its chances to influence the policies and actions of the government human rights cuba has poor record on human rights with the government sharply restricting basic rights including freedom of expression association assembly movement and other basic rights it has cracked down on dissent arrested human rights activists and indepen dent journalists and staged demonstrations against critics although some anticipated relaxation of the governments oppressive tactics in the aftermath of the popes january 1998 visit gover nment attacks against human rights activists and other dissidents have continued since that time estimates of the number of political prisoners in cuba vary considerably since the cuban government does not allow human rights organizations to monitor prisons according to the state departments human rights report covering 1999 human rights groups inside cuba estimate the number of political prisoners at between 350 and 400 the overall number of political prisoners probably increased slightly in 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs4 compared to 1998 when cuba released almost 100 prisoners many of whom were on list given to castro by vatican officials during the popes visit on july 23 1999 human rights watch issued highly critical report on the human rights situation in cuba cubas repressive machinery human rights forty years after the revolution the report describes how cuba has developed highly effective machinery of repression and has used this to restrict severely the exercise of fundamental human rights of expression association and assembly according to the report in recent years cuba has added new repressive laws and continued prosecuting nonviolent dissidents while shrugging off international appeals for reform and placating visiting dignitaries with occasional releases of political prisoners the full report is available on the human rights watch site on the internet at httpwwwhrworghrwreports1999cuba the state department maintains that the human rights situation deteriorated in 1999 according to its human rights report the authorities routinely continued to harass threaten arbitrarily arrest detain imprison and defame human rights advocates and members of independent professional associations including journalists economists doctors and lawyers often with the goal of coercing them into leaving the country in early march 2000 the cuban commission for human rights and national reconciliation noted that political repression increased considerably from november 1999 when cuba hosted the iberoamerican summit through february 2000 in may 2000 cuba released three prominent dissidents from prison on may 23 cuba released rene gomez manzano while marta beatriz roque was set free on may 15 and felix bonne on may 12 all three were leaders of the dissident working group and had been imprisoned since july 1997 all three have vowed to continue their peaceful opposition to the cuban government one remaining leader of the group vladimiro roca remains in prison the four leaders were convicted by cuban court on march 15 1999 on charges of sedition under the cuban penal code after oneday trial on march 1 sentences ranged from 3 ½ years for roque to 4 years for bonne and gomez manzano and 5 years for roca just before the dissidents trial scores of human rights advocates independent journalists and other activists were detained so that they could not cover or protest the trial the four dissidents had released document in june 1997 entitled the homeland belongs to us all httpwwwcubanetorgcnewsy97jul97homdochtm that strongly criticized draft report of the 5th congress of the cuban communist party that was going to be held that october the dissidents also urged cubans not to vote in legislative elections and encouraged foreign investors not to invest in cuba unchr resolutions from 1991 until 1997 the commission on human rights unchr called on the cuban government to coop erate with special representative later upgraded to special rapporteur designated by the secretary general to investigate the human rights situation in cuba but cuba refused to cooperate with the special rapporteur and the unchr annually approved resolutions condemning cubas human rights record on april 21 1998 however the unchr rejected by vote of 16 to 19 with 18 abstentions the annual resolution sponsored by the united states that would have condemned cubas rights record and would have extended the work of the special rapporteur for another yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs5 us officials and human rights activists expressed deep disappointment with the vote observers maintained that the vote did not signify any improvement in human rights in cuba but rather was an expression of disagreement with the united states over its policy toward cuba in 1999 and 2000 the unchr again approved resolutions criticizing cuba for its human rights record although it did not appoint special rapporteur on april 23 1999 the unchr resolution was approved by vote of 2120 with 12 abstentions on april 18 2000 the unchr resolution sponsored by the czech republic and poland was approved by vote of 2118 with 14 abstentions outlook observers are divided over whether the castro government will endure while some believe that the demise of the government is imminent there is considerable disagreement over when or how this may occur varying scenarios range from coup or popular uprising possibly with support from or acceptance by the cuban military to the voluntary resignation and selfexile of castro some point to castros age and predict that the regime will collapse without fidel at the helm other observers maintain that reports of the impending collapse of the cuban government have been exaggerated and that castro may remain in power for years they point to cubas strong security apparatus and the extraordinary system of controls that prevents dissidents from gaining popular support moreover observers maintain that cubas elite has interest in castros overthrow and that castro still enjoys some support in part because of the social benefits of the cuban revolution but also because cubans see alternative to castro even if castro is overthrown or resigns the important question remaining is the possibility or viability of stable democrati c cuba after castro analysts point out that the castro government has successfully impeded the development of independent civil society with private sector independent labor movement and unified political opposition for this reason they contend that building democratic cuba will be formidable task one that could meet stiff resistance from many cubans us policy toward cuba overview in the early 1960s uscuban relations deteriorated sharply when fidel castro began to build repressive communist dictatorship and moved his country toward close relations with the soviet union the often tense and hostile nature of the us cuban relationship is illustrated by such events and actions as us covert operations to overthrow the castro government culminating in the illfated april 1961 bay of pigs invasion the october 1962 missile crisis in which the united states confronted the soviet union over its attempt to place offensive nuclear missiles in cuba cuban support for guerrilla insurgencies and military support for revolutionary governments in africa and the western hemisphere the 1980 exodus of around 125000 cubans to the united states in the socalled mariel boatlift the 1994 exodus of more than 30000 cubans who were interdicted and housed at us facilities in guantanamo andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs6 2 for more on the background of

administration has essentially continued this policy of isolating cuba the principal tool of us policy remains comprehensive sanctions which were made stronger with the cuban democracy act cda of 1992 and with the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104114 often referred to as the helmsburton legislation the cda prohibits us subsidiaries from engaging in trade with cuba and prohibits entry into the united states for any vessel to load or unload freight if it has engaged in trade with cuba within the last 180 days the helmsburton legislation enacted in the aftermath of cubas shooting down of two us civilian planes in february 1996 combines variety of measures to increase pressure on cuba and provides for plan to assist cuba once it begins the transition to democracy among the laws sanctions is provision in title iii that holds any person or government that traffics in us property confisca ted by the cuban government liable for monetary damages in us federal court

broadcasting to cuba radio and tv marti according to the administration the twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people meets both us strategic and humanitarian interests in the aftermath of the popes january 1998 visit to cuba the clinton administration made several changes to us policy intended to augment us support for the cuban people in march 1998 president clinton announced 1 the resumption of licensing for direct humanitarian charter flights to cuba which had been curtailed after the february 1996 shootdown of two us civilian planes 2 the resumption of cash remittances up to 300 per quarter for the support of close relatives in cuba which had been curtailed in august 1994 in respons to the migration crisis with cuba 3 the development of licensing procedures to streamline and expedite licenses for the commercial sale of medicines and medical supplies and equipment to cuba and 4 decision to work on bipartisan basis with congress on the transfer of food to the cuban people the president stated that his actions would build further on the impact of the popes visit to cuba supp ort the role of the church and other elements of civil society in cuba and help prepare the cuban people for democratic transition in january 1999 president clinton announced five additional measures to support the cuban people 1 broadening cash remittances to cuba so that all ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs7 residents not just those with close relatives in cuba are allowed to send 300 per quarter to any cuban family and licensing larger remittances by us citizens and non governmental organizations to entities independent of the cuban government 2 an expansion of direct passenger charter flights to cuba from additional us cities other than the current flights from miami and to cities other than havana direct flights later in the year began from angeles and new york 3 the reestablishment of direct mail service to cuba which was suspended in 1962 this measure has not yet been negotiated with the cuban government 4 authorization for the commercial sale of food to independent entities in cuba such as religious groups and private restaurants and the sale of agricultural inputs to independent entities such as private farmers and farmer cooperatives producing food for sale in private markets and 5 an expansion of peopletopeople contact through twoway exchanges among academics athletes and scientists over the years although us policymakers have agreed on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several schools of thought about how to achieve that objective some advocate policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an approach sometimes referred to as constructive engagement that would lift some us sanctions that they believ are hurting the cuban people and move toward engaging cuba with dialogue still others call for swift normalization of uscuban relations by lifting the us embargo in general those advocatin g loosening of the sanctionsbased policy toward cuba make several policy arguments they assert that if the united states moderated its policy toward cuba through increased travel trade and diplomatic dialogue that the seeds of reform would be planted in cuba which would stimulate and strengthen forces for peaceful change on the island they stress the importance to the united states of avoiding violent change in cuba with the prospect of mass exodus to the united states and the potential of involving the united states in civil war scenario they argue that since castros demise does not appear imminent the united states should espouse more realistic approach in trying to induce change in cuba supporters of changing policy also point to broad international support for lifting the us embargo to the missed opportunities to us businesses because of the embargo and to the increased suffering of the cuban people because of the embargo proponents of change also argue that the united states should adhere to some consistency in its policies with the worlds few remaining communist governments and also maintain that moderating policy will help advance human rights in cuba on the other side opponents of changing us policy maintain that the current twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people through measures of support is the best means for realizing political change in cuba they point out that the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 sets forth road map for what steps cuban needs to take in order for the united states to normalize relations including lifting the embargo they argue that softening us policy at this time without concrete cuban reforms would boost the castro regime politically and economically enabling the survival of the communist regime opponents of softening us policy argue that the united states should stay the course in its commitment to democracy and human rights in cuba that sustainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs8 sanctions can work and that the sanctions against cuba have only come to full impact with the loss of large subsidies from the former soviet bloc opponents of loosening us sanctions further argue that cubas failed economic policies not the us embargo are the causes of the economys rapid decline numerous measures have been introduced in the 106th congress that reflect the range of views on us policy toward cuba legislative action in the second session has focused on initiatives to ease restrictions on us food and medic exports to cuba and initiatives to ease restrictions on travel to cuba at the same time there has been legislative action to increase sanctions by conditioning aid to russia on closing the russian signals intelligence facility at

us judgments for violations of international law however the provision also includes presidential waiver for national security interests which the president exercised october 21 1998 the clinton administration opposed the provision maintaining that it would undermine the authority of the president to use assets of countries under economic sanctions as leverage when sanctions are used to

to serve justice provision in section 118 of the senateapproved version of hr 2490 the fy2000 treasury appropriations bill would have limited the ability of the president to prevent frozen assets from

organization wto until midapril 1997 the eu had been pursuing its case at the wto in which it was challenging the helmsburton legislation as an extraterritoria l application of us law the beginning of

to develop an agreement on agreed disciplines and principles for the strengthening of investment protection relating to the confiscation of property by cuba and other governments as part of the understanding the eu agreed that it would suspend its wto dispute settlement case subsequently in midapril 1998 the eu agreed to let its wto challenge expire talks between the us and the eu on investment disciplines proved difficult with the eu wanting to cover only future investments and the us wanting to cover past expropriations especially in cuba nevertheless after months of negotiations the eu and the united states reached second understanding on may 18 1998 the understanding sets forth eu disciplines regarding investment in expropriated properties worldwide in exchange

the original owner although pernod ricard cannot market havana club in the united states because of the trade embargo it wants to protect its future distribution rights when the embargo is lifted

provision in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill according to an internal memo prepared for the united states trade representative that was cited in the press the language of the provision violates our obligations under the trips trade related aspects on intellectual property rights agreement8 however the administration did not move to make any changes to the provision of the law food and medical exports in recent years the us sanctions regime has allowed the sale of both food and medical exports but with restrictions the agricultural appropriations bill for fy2001 that was passed by congr ess in october 2000 pl 106387 terminates unilateral medical and agricultural sanctions broadening what can be sold and to whom but it also maintains the prohibition against the us financing of such sales and limits licenses to one year several restrictions on commercial medical exports were set forth in the cuban democracy act of 1992 on march 20 1998 president clinton announced that the administration would develop licensing procedures to streamline and expedite licenses for the commercial sale of medicines and medical supplies and equipment to cuba the simplifie d procedures were put in place by the commerce and treasury departments in may 1998 with regard to commercial food sales in 1999 president clinton authorized the sale of food and agriculture inputs to independent entities in cuba such as religious groups private farmers and private restaurants treasury and commerce department regulations for these sales were issued may 13 1999 with an effective date of may 10 the administration hoped the policy change would support cubas small private sector to date however it appears that actual food sales have been negligible some in the business community argue that the changes in policy have not amounted to much because they still do not allow financing for the sales nevertheless us agribusiness companies continue to explore the cuban market for potential future sales the cuban government told group of us farmers who traveled there in nove mber after passage of the new law that it was interested in buying us agricultural exports but refuses to buy any us food under the financing restrictions imposed by that new law opponents of easing restrictions maintain that us policy does not deny medical sales to cuba and since may 1999 does not deny food sales to independent groups in cuba moreover according to the state department since the cuban democracy act was enacted in 1992 the united states has licensed more than 25 billion in private humanitarian donations including 227 million in donations of medicines and medical equipment oppon ents of easing us sanctions further argue that easing pressure on the cuban government would in effect be lending support and extending the duration of the castro regime they maintain that the united states should remainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs14 steadfast in its opposition to any easing of pressure on cuba that could prolong the castro regime and its repressive policies supporters of easing restrictions on food and medical exports to cuba argue that the restrictions harm the health and nutrition of the cuban population they argue that licensing procedures set up for the commercial sale of medical exports to cuba are so complex that they essentially constitute ban on such exports because of long delays and increased costs they argue that although the us government may have licensed more than 25 billion in humanitarian donations to cuba since 1992 in fact much smaller amounts have actually been sent to cuba some supporters of easing sanctions believe the embargo plays into castros hands by allowing him to use us policy as scapegoat for his failed economic policies and as rationale for political repression other supporters of eased restric tions argue that us policy has complicated relations with our allies who have adopted constructive engagement approach toward cuba us agribusiness companies that support the removal of trade restrictions on agricultural exports to cuba believe that us farmers are missing out on market of some 700 million so close to the united states legislative initiatives in the 106th congress the most significant action in the first session of the 106th congress occurred durin g august 4 1999 senate consideration of the fy2000 agriculture appropriations bill s 1233 modified ashcroft amendment was approved requiring congressional approva l before the imposition of any unilateral agricultural or medical sanction against foreign country however under the modified amendment agricultural and medical exports to state sponsors of international terrorism which includes cuba would be allowed pursuant to one year licenses issued by the us government and without any federal financing or export assistance an attempt to table the ashcroft amendment before it was modified to restrict exports to sponsors of international terrorism was defeated by vote of 28 to 70 on august 3 1999 the senate subsequently approved s 1233 and incorporated the language into hr 1906 with the ashcroft amendment included as subsection 748 k the house version of the bill had such provision and ultimately the ashcroft provision was not included in the conference report several senators expressed strong disapproval with the manner in which the issue was decided when the conference committee came to stalemate over the ashcroft provision on sanctions and another provision on dairy prices the house and senate majority leadership brokered an agreement that dropped the ashcroft provision in the second session of the 106th congress there have been effor ts in three legislative vehicles the foreign aid authorization bill s 2382 fy2001

srept 106257 the bill contains provision similar to the ashcroft provision on sanctions in the senate version of the fy2000 agriculture appropriations bill described above title i subtitle c of s 2382

subcommittee on agriculture approved an amendment by repr esentative george nethercutt that would lift restrictions on food and medical exports and allow licensed exports of these goods to countries classified as state sponsors of international terrorism which includes cuba subsequently on may 10 the full house appropriations committee defeated by vote of 2435 an attempt by representative tom delay to delete the title in hr 4461 that would lift restrictions on us food and medical exports worldwide continued opposition by the house gop leadership and some members to the sanctionsloosening effort led to june 27 compromise agreement hammered out among the house gop leadership the house sponsors of the provision and members who opposed the initiative under the reported compromise us food and medical exports to cuba would be allowed pursuant to oneyear licenses but us government or us private financing could be provided for the transactions the agreement includes provision stating that licensed us travel to cuba may not include travel for tourist activities as well as another provision that would prohibit all us government assistance to cuba without any presidential waiver authority critics charged that the restrictions were so great that sales would be practically impossible and that the new provisi ons on travel would tighten restrictions on certain categories of nontourist travel currently allowed by the treasury department regulations when the house debated hr 4461 on july 10 2000 the title dealing with food and medical exports was deleted on point of order by representative diazbalart against legislation in an appropriation measure however the compromise language agreed to on june 27 was reportedly the basis of the house position in the conference to hr

eliminating funding to implement provisions in the foreign assistance and other statutes that prohibit us exports to cuba was ruled to be nongermane in the final version of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations bill that was signed into law on october 28 2000 the sale of agricultural and medical products to cuba is allowed but any us financing public or private is prohibited the bill also

was eliminated from new version of the fy2001 treasury department appropriations bill hr 4985 introdu ced on july 26 this version with mention of cuba was subsequently appended to the legislative branch appropriations bill hr 4516 on july 27 travel restrictions restrictions on travel to cuba have been key component in us efforts to isolate the communist government of fidel castro for much of the past 40 years over time there have been numerous changes to the restrictions and for 5 years from 1977 until 1982 there were restrictions on travel on june 30 1999 an attempt in the senate to end

the conference report hrept 106796 on the legislative branch appropriations bill hr 4516 on july 27 as noted above in the discussion of hr 4461 the fy2001 agriculture appropriations bill the final version of the food and medical provision states that licensed us travel to cuba may not include travel for tourist activities moreover the law imposed tighter restrictions on nontourist travel previously allowed by the treasury department regulations major arguments made for lifting the cuba travel ban are it hinders efforts to influence conditions in cuba and may be aiding castro by helping restrict the flow of information it abridges the rights of ordinary americans and americans can travel to other countries with communist or authoritarian governments major arguments in opposition to lifting the cuba travel ban are american tourist travel would support castros rule by providing his government with millions of dollars in tourist receipts there are legal provisions allowing travel to cuba for humanitarian purposes that are used by thousands of americans each year and the president should be free to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons for more details see

decided not to add cuba to the annual list of major drug transit countries according to the department of state cuba was not placed on the list of major drug transit countries because there is clear evidence that cocaine or heroin are transiting cuba on the way to the united states in quantities that significantly affect the united states daily press briefing november 10 1999 some members of

language russian intelligence facility in cuba some member s of congress have raised concerns about the russian signals intelligence facility at lourdes cuba the facility at lourdes was built in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30628crs18 aftermath of the cuban missile crisis of 1962 it allows russia to monitor us communications including milita ry communications that russians contend ensure compliance with arms control agreements in the 104th congress the enacted cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act pl 104114 contains provision that would reduce us assistance for russia by an amount equal to the sum of assistance and credits provided in support of intelligence facilities in cuba however the legislation also provide s that such restriction does not apply to most categories of assistance moreover the legislation also provides presidential waiver if such assistance is important to us national security and if russia has assured the united states that it is not sharing intelligence collected at the lourdes facility with officials or agents of the cuban government in the 106th congress on july 19 2000 the house approved 275146 hr 4118 the russianamerican trust and cooperation act of 2000 that would have prohibited the rescheduling or forgiveness of any outstanding bilateral debt owed to the united states by russia until the president certified that russia had ceased all its operations at removed all personnel from and permanently closed the intelligence facility at lourdes cuba the bill would have provided the president with national interests waiver for the prohibition against rescheduling bilateral debt owed to the united states by russia but not for debt forgiveness the bill also required the president to instruct the us representative to the paris club of official creditors to use the voice and vote of the us to oppose rescheduling or forgiveness of any outstanding bilateral debt owed by russia presidential waiver was provided for this provision the senate version s 2748 remained in committee those supporting the bill argue that the listening post which reportedly has been upgraded in recent years permits the collection of us military diplomatic and commercial data and allows the invasion of americans privacy they argue the compensation paid by russia to cuba estimated at between 100 300 million annually helps prop up the castro government financially those opposed to the bill argue that facilities such as that at lourdes help both russia and the united states to have confidence that international arms controls agreements are being respected they maintain that the bill attempts to undermine us leadership on engagement with russia and could threaten us leadership in paris club negotiations for debt rescheduling and forgiveness the clinton administration opposes the legislation maintaining that it could call into question us signals intelligence facilities that perform activities similar to the

commission maintaining that the idea was intended to alter us policy on january 4 1999 state department officials stated that the clinton administration had decided not to set up bipartisan commission at that time year and half later the issue of bipartisan commission was raised in legislative proposal by senator christopher dodd on june 20 2000 during consideration of s 2549 the fy2001 defense authorization bill the senate tabled by vote of 5941 dodd amendment that would have established national bipartisan commission on cuba to evaluate us policy toward cuba the original proponent of such commission senato r warner did not support the dodd amendment because he believed it could be an impediment to the passage of the defense authorization measure those argui ng in favor of such commission maintained that the work of the commission would provide new ideas and thoughts for the next presidential administration to take office in 2001 that human rights activists inside cuba support rethinking of us policy and that there is double standard regarding the sanctionsbased us policy toward cuba which contrasts with the us policy of engagement toward such nations as china vietnam and now even north korea those opposing the establishment of such commission argued that it was political attempt to change us policy toward cuba outside of the normal conduct of foreign policy by the legislative and executive branches that it would tie the hands of the next president to set his own cuba policy and that there should be movement to change us policy until there is
