responsib for tracking drug trends colombia produces most6 of the world supply with 90 of the cocaine entering the united states originating in or transiting thr ough colombia the country also

the national institute on drug abuse nida reported that drug use among young people has declined by 11 from 2001 to 2003 and again by 6 from 2003 to 20048 while these surveys report declining trend in overall drug use they so report that the use of cocaine and heroin has remained stable in fact the nationa l survey on drug use and health reported that there was change in the overa ll rate of illicit drug use between 2002 and 20039 the same report showed that cocaine and heroin use has remained stable over the same time period at 23 million pe rsons not limited to young americans and 119000 users respectively some observe rs criticize the value of these types of surveys because they rely on selfreporting10 some observers have expressed cauti on in interpreting the ondcp figures on price purity and availability they maintain that shortterm fluctuations are not uncommon and may not be sustainable11 there are several reasons why prices and supply remained stable for such long pe riod in testimony before congress in june 2004 john p walters of ondcp argued that interdiction efforts take time to show their impact on price and availability and that the effect would begin to show in the next 12 months12 some argue that an increase in the street price of cocaine and heroin is unlikely to appear in the near term because of the large profit margin even if the availability of coca leaf and opium poppies is decreasing and consequently the price for the raw materials is increasing they constitute very small fraction of the us retail price traffickers are easily able to absorb

to development as the only sustainable met hod to reduce drug crop cultivation in the long run20 they believe the focus on counternarc otics at the level of coca cultivation causes serious problems for growers who rely on illicit crops for their livelihoods they contend that spray dr ift has destroyed licit crops and that growers seeking compensation as provided by law are regularly denied benefits21 some observers also contend that eradication of crops in one area results in their displacement to other areas and they cite coca production incr eases in bolivia of 17 in 2003 in the same period cultivation in peru dropped 15 in 2004 cultivation increased slightly in bolivia and fell slightly in peru accord ing to ondcp this information counters the prediction of an official with perus antinarcotics agency that acreage devoted to growing coca probably increased in 2004 and that further increases could be expected in 200522 some observers believe that reporting the acreage of crops sprayed does not reflect actual cultivation and that the technology used does not produce accurate assessments fumigation cau ses defoliation but does not always kill the plant further spraying does not prevent alt hough it may discourage the replantings of illicit crops surveys of the area under cu ltivation conducted by the united states often differ from those of the united nations see tables below according to us government sources the acreage under coca cultivation has dr opped by 7 since 1999 while the united nations shows 50 decrease there ar also indications that growers are resorting

based on the decrease in kidnappings and roadblocks in the region in 2004 military operations conducted by up to 17000 troops turned to regaining farc territory in the southern and eastern regions of the country anecdotal evidence indicates that the colombian military has forced the farc to change tactics by atomizing into smaller cells to avoid detection and reducing the number of largescale
