gdp is significant in seven countries located in central and south asia afghanistan iran kyrgyzstan pakistan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan its share ranges from about one fifth in tajikistan to more than one half in afghanistan those employed in the agricultural sector account for large portion of the entire labor force in all seven countries agricultural workers account for almost onethird of all employment in iran in afghanistan farmers and related workers represent more than twothirds of the labor force large desert regions and extreme mountainous terrain limit the amount of arable land in most of these countries irrigation systems are vital in most countries in directing limited water supplies to agricultural producing areas all seven countries are net food importers meaning they do not produce enough to cover all their food needs even with food purchases the world bank considers portion of each countrys population to be malnourished due to poverty hunger in some areas has been further exacerbated by food shortages some countries have in recent years experienced successive years of drought which has resulted in decline in agricultural output largely for these reasons the united nations world food program reports that afghanistan and tajikistan are in need of emergency food assistance over the next year to cover sizable food deficits afghanistans food aid needs have increased since midseptember 2000 reflecting refugee movement toward border regions and disruptions and logistical problems that personnel expect in distributing food aid due to military conflict and the onset soon of harsh winter conditions afghanistans agricultural sector has deteriorated during more than two decades of conflict and made large portion of the countrys population reliant on international food aid by comparison pakistan and iran have introduced some agricultural reforms in recent years seeking to raise productivity and to bolster their agricultural sectors contribution to their national economies of the former soviet union republics kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkme nistan and uzbekistan kyrgyzstan appears to have modified its policies the most by transfering formerly stateowned farmland to agricultural producers and by introducing elements of marketoriented agricultural policies tajikistan has also introduced some reforms but its agricultural sector faces serious problems following two years of drought cotton production heavily reliant on irrigation is major component of the agricultural sectors in tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan cotton exports from these three countries are important in generating much needed foreign exchange as well as transfering resources to other economic sectorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190contents

recent years agricultural production is constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water irrigation systems are primitive some existing irrigation networks and other agricultural facilities were destroyed in military conflict between the taliban and opposition forces in 1999 relatively little use is made of machines chemical fertilizer or pesticides food shortages caused by successive years of drought have been exacerbated by the countrys already limited transportation network which has deteriorated further due to damage and neglect resulting from war and the absence of an effective central government according to what may be dated information the agricultural sector contributes slightly more than half of gdp and employs almost 70 of the labor force grain primarily wheat production is the countrys traditional agricultural mainstay other major farm products are fruit nuts karakul sheep pelts wool and mutton afghanistan has the productive capacity to more than meet its food needs according to some observers in the mid1990s overall agricultural production and livestock numbers were less than onehalf of what they were just before the soviet invasion in 1979fighting against soviet forces followed by another decade of civil war instability in rural areas prolonged drought and deteriorated infrastructure have all contributed to this reduction many years of conflict had also led to migration to the cities and refugee flight to iran and pakistan further disrupting agricultural output lately the economy has consisted of little more than subsistence farming and cross border trade opium became source of cash for many afghans especially after the breakdown in central authority following the withdrawal of soviet military forces in early 1989 opium poppies are easy to cultivate and transport and offered quick source of income for returning refugees and impoverished afghans in 1999 afghanistan was the worlds largest producer of opium poppies and heroin trafficking was major source of revenue in reversal the taliban in mid2000 banned opium poppy production citing religious reasons this has apparently been adhered to as wheat almost completely displaced poppy cultivation in 2001 despite the ban the taliban has been flooding the world market with heroin in recent months to draw down its large opium stocks according to the

opium still grown is in those areas controlled by the northern alliance opposition forces1 agricultural output rebounded in 1997 and 1998 due to sufficient precipitation and territorial consolidation by the taliban livestock herds also were rebuilt somewhat however 7090 reduction in precipitation during the fall 1999 rainy season led to total failure of the 2000 rain dependent crops and major reduction in the output of irrigated areas as result afghanistan faced cereal shortfall of almost 60 of its annual requirements the severity of the situation compelled the uns world food program wfp to begin emergency food drops in june 2000 in an effort to prevent imminent loss of life subsequent food aid shipments from the united states and other western countries most distributed by the wfp covered much of the need food and agriculture organization fao alert issued in june 2001 stated that three consecutive years of drought and worsening economic problems had jeopardized afghanistans food supply putting millions in danger of starvation fao then estimated that 5 million afghans almost onefifth of the population have little or access to food largely because jobs are scarce due to the end of poppy cultivation and the decline of other cash crops low livestock prices herd depletion and refugee displacement the populations movement toward borders and to their rural homes subsequent to the us military response following the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states disruptions in wfp food aid deliveries and continued economic disruption and conflict have worsened the humanitarian crisis within afghanistan the wfp in early october 2001 estimated that as many as 75 million afghans 28 of the population were at risk of hunger and will need food aid through march 2002 the wfp continues with its plan to stock up warehouses with 300000 metric tons mt of grains and other foods before winter snows block roads and to prepare to airdrop food into the most remote areas if needed during the winter in order to avert famine as of midnovember 2001 the wfp reported that despite the hazards of operating in the country it has met its monthly food aid target of shipping 52000 metric tons using five overland supply routes2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs4 iran population millions 640 agricultures share of gdp agricultures share of labor force 20 33

agricultural sector accounts for one fifth of gdp and employs one third of the labor force food processing particularly sugar refining and vegetable oil production also is an important industrial sector with its large population and limited arable land iran is not selfsufficient in food and is major food importing country in the region iran enjoys wide diversity of climate and terrain enabling its farmers to produce the traditional staple cereals wheat and barley rice sugar beets as well as tobacco and tea it is the worlds largest exporter of highquality pistachio nuts over the last decade as part of policy to generate nonoil export earnings the government has promoted the expansion of exportbased specialty products such as pistachios dates and flowers by bringing largescale irrigation projects online these and other efforts sustained healthy economic growth in the agricultural sector in the 19851998 period marked by increased yields and additional land put into cultivation by the mid1990s iran was importing just 5 of its wheat rice vegetable oil sugar and meat needs drought in 1997 arrested the upward trend in irans cereal producing regions and resulted in leveling off of wheat output and fall in barley production though agricultural production recovered in 1998 three successive years of severe drought 19992001 combined with government restrictions on the import of fertilizers and pesticides have thwarted growth in irans agricultural sector despite government efforts to mitigate the impact of rainfall fluctuations on the sector by building dams and irrigation and drainage networks agriculture remains sensitive to weather also the countrys inadequate packaging processing and distribution networks have kept production costs high making it more cost effective to import grains and rice iran is now one of the largest wheat importing countries in the world covering much of its needs from australia in spite of these developments government policy still aims to develop niche export markets for flowers fruit concentrates and fruit juices in europe the gulf states and neighboring exsoviet republics one analysis suggests that greater use of irrigation supported by renewed world bank loans to iran will help boost production of wheat corn and vegetables but that the countrys demand for cereals together with the rising cost of imported fertilisers makes it unlikely that grain imports will fall significantly in recent years irans government has continued to reduce its role in agriculture by encouraging private sector activities and the growth of cooperatives it sees its role as limited to providing infrastructure needs such as dam construction and irrigations systems the amount of subsidies for agricultural inputs pesticides and fertilizers has been reduced in real terms subsidies for some basic commodities in particular wheat account for about 80 of total direct subsidies according to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs5 imf the government sets procurement prices for agricultural products using cost based approach that allows for 2025 gross profit margin and that also takes into account world prices about onethird of the value added in agriculture occurs in the livestock sector consisting largely of small farms that produce milk and meat other major agricultural products include wool and caviar in the food processing industry rice milling is an important subsector barley corn and other grains are processed primarily for animal feeds and packaged snacks fruit and vegetable canning expanded in the 1960s as increasing populations in the cities accelerated the demand for canned produce the food and agriculture organization fao reported in early september 2001 that three years of drought have resulted in an acute scarcity of drinking water in both urban and rural areas and devastated crops and livestock although the 2001 drought affected fewer regions than in previous years fao states that its impact on food supplies and peoples livelihoods has been much greater for some communities for example large numbers of rural residents and their livestock in the most adversely affected provinces have started to migrate to other areas in search of water kyrgyzstan population millions 49 agricultures share of gdp agricultures share of labor force 39 52 gross domestic product billion 126 arable

country to be generally selfsufficient in meeting its food needs cotton wool and meat are the main agricultural products as well as exports tobacco potatoes vegetables grapes fruits and berries and wool are also produced the agricultural sector contributes 39 of total gdp employs more than half of the labor force and accounts for one fifth of export earnings because of its topography pastures and meadows cover nearly half of the countrys total area only 7 is arable land of which nearly half is used for fodder crops consumed by its sizable livestock sector food processing is an important manufacturing sector kyrgyzstan reportedly has been one of the most progres sive countries of the former soviet union in carrying out market reforms following successful economic stabilization program which dramatically lowered inflation during the mid 1990s attention turned toward stimulating growth in 1995 land use rights were extended from 49 to 99 years and the government implemented unified land registration system as result of 1998 referendum land can now be privately owned in 1999 the government and legislature are reported to have modernized the laws related to the creation of land market relations between landlords and renters and the use of the land reserve fund which had been the property of the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs6 favorable weather and economic reform measures adopted in the agricultural sector have served to make agriculture source of underlying strength for the kyrgyz economy according to the imf reflecting these developments agricultures share of economic activity increased from 34 in the late soviet period to over 40 now reforms freed controls on commodity prices and sales broke up most state and collective farms introduced new mechanisms and means for agricultural financing and extended land use rights the imf notes though that the increase in agricultural output has been achieved against background of serious decline in both the level and growth of productivity except for sugar beets potatoes and vegetables yields have not increased since the mid1990s suggesting to imf observers that output growth primarily reflects the expansion of arable land and an increase in livestock numbers despite recovery and growth in the sector over the last decade the world bank reports that rural incomes on per capita basis fell substantially due to 40 increase in agricultural employment and decline in nonfarm rural income factors viewed as hindering growth in the agricultural sector according to the imf include the lack of modern equipment poor quality or lack of inputs ie low yielding seeds fertilizers and irrigation systems financial constraints caused by poor access to credit and the need for better land management some of these problems were to be addressed in an agricultural reform program adopted by the kirghiz government in 1999 but it apparently has not been fully implemented major components of the program announced were to 1 increase the cultivation and processing of sugar beets and corn 2 increase production of cotton tobacco fruits and vegetables by supplying farmers with high quality seeds fertilizers and pesticides fuel and lubricating materials and by providing agricultural machinery servicing 3 to increase meat production by helping farmers improve cattle and poultry selection and build efficient marketing and auction systems 4 to open rural credit associations and 5 to work out legal basis for corporate management for agriculture and introduce corporate management practices to agricultural enterprises the food and agriculture organization fao reported in early september 2001 that drought and water shortages have had less impact in kyrgyzstan than in the neighboring countries this is primarily due to sufficient water being available from the rivers that originate in the country but supply the region with irrigation water fao noted that the overall food supply situation remains satisfactory but that access to food among the poorest groups is expected to be tight due to the lack of purchasing power and unemploymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs7 pakistan

irrigation systems in the world agriculture accounts for just over one quarter of gdp as well as for large share of export earnings the sector employs 44 of the labor force and supports about 75 of

vegetables milk beef mutton and eggs despite intensive farming practices the country remains net food importer pakistan exports rice cotton fish fruits and vegetables to cover the needs of its large population imports include vegetable oil wheat cotton lentils and consumer food products this year to draw down large stocks from last years bumper crop pakistani traders plan to export wheat to nearby countries some agricultural commodities provide raw materials for key industries including textiles and sugar in particular cotton is important to pakistans economy by providing the primary input for its fabric and garment industries in turn cotton derived products dominate the countrys exports the economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence in 1947 when its share of gdp was around 53 over the last decade according to the food and agriculture organization fao agriculture grew at an average annual rate of 45 with some fluctuations due to weather conditions pakistans agricultural sector though suffered severe setback during 200001 due to an unprecedented drought situation and shortage of irrigation water this resulted in 25 decline in agricultural output compared to an impressive growth of 61 the previous year both factors contributed to lower production of cotton rice sugarcane and wheat irrigation water shortages were due to two consecutive weak monsoons and inadequate glacier and snow melt due to below normal snowfall and cooler than normal temperatures since the 2001 monsoon rains started well expectations are that water reserves will be fully recharged and that irrigation water levels will return to normal others observe that the longerterm cause for the irrigation shortage is poor resource management and planning as result chronic irrigation shortfalls are expected to become an increasingly important factor in pakistans agricultural outlook in july 2001 fao reported that the prolonged drought in parts of pakistan had decimated livestock and severely affected fruit and rainfed cereal production while large cereal stocks from last years bumper crop are anticipated to cover this years shortfalls in production it noted that

force 19 44 gross domestic product billion 73 arable permanent cropland of total 6 per capita income 1140 permanent pastures of total land 25 tajikistan is reportedly the poorest and least economically developed of the former soviet republic s in part due to the economic specialization that central planners in moscow imposed on the country through the early 1990s this policy fostered excessive dependence on the production and export of cotton still its most important crop and hindered econom ic diversification the country is mostly mountains and deserts arable land comprises only 6 of its land area tajikistan though is well endowed with water resources unlike its neighbors this has enabled irrigation of 80 of the arable land and contributed to its specialization in cotton production cotton alone accounts for about half of the countrys agricultural output followin g the former soviet unions dissolution agricultural output declined considerably as civil war floods and economic dislocation dramatically reduced cotton yields and output the agricultural sector accounted for 19 of tajikistans gdp in 2000 down from 38 in 1995 about 44 of the labor force is employed in this sector the country is climatically well suited for raising fruit and vegetables producing much more than is domestically consumed livestock primarily sheep is also an important part of tajik agriculture besides cotton various fruits and vegetable oils are also exported grain and flour together with other food products are imported in early 2000 analysts expected that agriculture and agroprocessing would play major role in tajikistans economic recovery pointing to its comparative advantages and the potential for productivity improvements an international monetary fund imf report

recent information and reports on wfp activities in tajikistan see httpwww wfporgcountry_briefindexcountryaspcountry32 as accessed on november 16 2001activities the report mentioned that there has been little change in the prereform market infrastructure this gives established production and commercial entities unusual market power which has contributed to relatively slow pace of change in the restructuring of incentives and production decisions in the agricultural sector the land reform process received boost in 1998 when president rakhmanov issued several decrees confirming the right of farmers to have inheritable and transferable land share and use rights for up to 99 years the government also began dismantling the large state agricultural enterprises into privatelyowned peasant farms as result by 2000 these farms held over 40 of the arable land compared to 30 in 1997 these developments have contributed to improved productivity on private farms and attracted foreigners to invest and participate in the cotton sector despite these positive prospects crop failure in late 2000 due to drought significantly changed the outlook the uns world food program wfp reported in august 2001 that tajikistan faced serious food deficit for the second year in row leaving one million vulnerable people 16 of the population in remote areas in need of food assistance this drought further exacerbated structural problems and the deteriorating conditions of the agricultural sector the report stated that shortage of financial and technical resources has also resulted in near collapse of the countrys irrigation systems agroprocessing industries agricultural input production and supply units as well as the severe deterioration of farm machinery and equipment the wfp laid out its estimate of estimated food aid needs for the vulnerable population particularly those living in the remote border areas and the mountainous regions it called for urgent assistance to rehabilitate the countrys collapsing irrigation infrastru cture repair farm equipment procure quality cereal seeds and establish an adequate rural finance system without such measures the report said it is likely that agricultural production will continue to decline regardless of the climatic conditions4 sovecon reports that because the 2001 grain harvest was poor for the second year in row tajikistan will need to import significant quantities of wheat to cover its needs as of midnovember sovecon reported that the country could only pay for about half of its needs and was seeking to cover the balance in the form of food aid commitments from international organizations turkmenistan population millions 48 agricultures share of gdp agricultures share of labor force 27 44 gross

so the countrys agricultural sector accounts for 27 of gdp and employs more than 40 of the labor force its agricultural sector is also centered around cotton to which almost half of the arable land is allotted it is among the worlds top 10 cottonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs10 producers and leading exporter in the late 1990s cotton sales contributed about one quarter of the countrys export earnings turkmenistan also produces variety of fruits and vegetables as well as grain and sugar beets even so food production in the soviet era suffered due to cotton specialization the result of central planning that provided extensive free irrigated water to cotton producers turkmenistan unlike its neighbors is well endowed with natural mineral resources primarily natural gas and oil that are exported to western europe earnings from these exports enable turkmenistan to import the balance of its food needs primarily grain and grain products meat dairy products sugar and beverages following the dissolution of the soviet union the major objectives of turkmenistans agricultural policy have been to achieve selfsufficiency in grains earn foreign exchange through continued exports of cotton and redistribute the earnings from agriculture to other sectors for investment in public buildings infrastructure and industry with large portion of the economy still reflecting sovietstyle principles economic reforms have been introduced very slowly the government continues to exercise extensive control over the agricultural sector primarily through the system of state orders for cotton and wheat the countrys two main crops this system makes input subsidies and belowmarket credit available as well as the promise of land ownership in return for farmers growing these two crops meeting output targets and selling both commodities at governmentset procurement prices the turkmen governmen t has taken an approach to land reform and farm restructuring that differs from that adopted by the other former soviet republics the collective land holdings are divided into lots that are leased to families while retaining the overall collective structure and state ownership of all farmland leases of land are made to farmers who have the possibility of transferring ownership to other family members once the farmer has established good track record in farming land is given under 10 to 15 year leases to families and tied to meeting conditions for producing cotton and wheat under the state order system the government though has been reluctant to confirm rights of ownership following the twoyear probationary period accordingly few ownership certificates have been issued reasons offered are that farmers have not met their production targets or that they would not be able to effectively operate the farm on private basis though other crops and livestock are not marketed through state order the government reportedly influences farmers decisions through land allocations implicit price controls administered by the state commodity exchange and the availability of agricultural inputs during the 1990s the government pursued program to achieve selfsufficiency in grain as production targets for wheat have been met imports of wheat and flour have fallen portion of the wheat and flour produced each year is stored in state reserve in early september 2001 the food and agriculture organization reported that drought and shortages of irrigation water for the second year in row were expected to significantly lower crop production to cover immediate needs experts expect that turkmenistan will import wheat and other food products from russia paying for these purchases with natural gas saleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs11 uzbekistan population millions 247 agricultures

dry landlocked country of which onetenth consists of intensely cultivated irrigated river valleys it was one of the poorest areas of the former soviet union agricultures importance to uzbekistan is illustrated by the links between the cotton sector and the rest of the countrys economy cotton is also its dominant crop accounting for about 40 of total agricultural output uzbekistan ranked among the worlds top five producers of cotton during much of the 1990s and is leading cotton exporter as its largest source of foreign currency 4045 of total export earnings followed by gold cotton is likely to continue to be the countrys most important commodity even though the quality of uzbek cotton is reportedly below that of most other cottonproducing countries in recent years the government has switched acreage from cotton to wheat and feed grains in an effort to achieve selfsufficiency in grain production usda reports that uzbekistan had by 2000 nearly reached this objective and that the government planned to initiate major program to reform the cotton sector in order to boost foreign exchange from increased exports see below the countrys agricultural sector accounts for 35 of gdp and employs about 40 of the labor force this reflects the fact that more than 60 of its population lives in denselysettled rural areas and is largely dependent on farming for its livelihood about 30 of the countrys labor force is engaged in cotton farming in small rural communities in addition the food industry sector contributes an estimated 13 to uzbekistans economy other major agricultural products produced are silk fruits and vegetables virtually all agriculture involves significant irrigation during the soviet era intensive production of white gold cotton and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies the world bank notes that the aral sea is uzbekistans most pressing environmental problem as poor water management over long period of time resulted in its partial drying up and contamination by agricultural chemicals this crisis it adds now has strong negative impact on economic activity and on the general health of the population since the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 uzbekistan has followed gradual approach to introducing macroeconomic and marketoriented structural reforms however according to the world bank reforms in the agricultural sector have not occurred it points out that the government has not introduced measures to reduce the market clout of the monopolies that sell inputs to farmers to improve producer prices and reduce mandatory procurement of cotton and wheat and to liberalize export marketing the bank notes that prospects for growth and improvement in rural living standards are being undermined by these government policies that continue to extract resources from the agricultural sector primarily cotton to meet other economic priorities similarly the imf reports that changes made to the structure and organization of the former state farms have not resulted inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31190crs12 much change from how they operated prior to the early 1990s collective enterprises still account for almost all cotton production and 90 of wheat output and their importance to meeting national economic objective s has limited change however rural families have expanded their traditional household plots which now dominate meat and milk production these plots also account for about half of fruit and vegetable output though new land code that passed in 1998 clarified some issues the imf notes that these do not support changes in farm structure and land tenure that would lead toward more productive units the food and agriculture organization fao reported in late summer 2001 that severe water shortages and second year of drought have significantly affected production of wheat rice and cotton the worst affected areas are in the northwestern part of the country the uzbek government has appealed for international assistance to rehabilitate the irrigation systems install desalinization equipment and provide targeted food aid in some areas
