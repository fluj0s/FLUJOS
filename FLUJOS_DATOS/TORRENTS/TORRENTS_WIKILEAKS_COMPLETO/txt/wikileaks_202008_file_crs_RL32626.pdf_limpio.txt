become the fair and accurate credit transactions fact act2 the california law became effective on july 1 2004 it governs the rights of california residents w ith respect to the dissemination of nonpublic pers onal information by financ ial institutions in some respects it diverges from two federal laws that impose restrictions on the dissemination of customer information by financial institutions 1 the privacy title of the grammleach bliley act of 1999 glba3 and 2 1996 amendments to the fair credit reporting act of 1970 fcra4 it includes requirement that before sharing nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third pa rties financial institutions obtain an optin ie affirmative consent from their customers5 before such information may be shared with affiliates not in

credit reporting business it does not require such businesses to register or be chartered inst ead it defines certain functions and regulate s businesses performing t hose functions under the

affiliated companies to share with one another customer information without implicating fcra obligations and requirements11 with respect to coverage of interaffiliate information sharing fcra preempts

nonpublic personal information with non affiliated third par ties it does not address any such requirement for interaffiliate sharing glba does however require financial institutions to notify their customers of their privacy policy including their policies with respect to information sharing among affiliates glba also has savings clause preserving the operation of fcra13 the fact act provisions the fact act provision on information sharing among affiliated companies amends fcra14 as amended in 1996 fcra regu lates the credit reporting business by prescribing standards for the credit re porting business and for users of consumer credit reports it generally defines consumer reports and limits the purposes and conditions under which consumer reports ma be furnished by consumer reporting agencies15 under the 1996 amendments the finition of consumer report was amended to exclude communication of tr ansaction and experience information among corporate affiliates also excluded provided the consumer was afforded an opportunity to prevent it ie opt out was communication of other information concerning the consumer among affiliates16 essentially this permits companies to share with their affiliates certain information respecting their transactions and experience with customer without any notification other customer information such as credit reports and information supplied or gathered in connection with applying for loans or other services may be shared with other companies in the corporate family if the customers are give n clear and conspicuous notice about the sharing and an opportunity to direct that the information not be shared17 under the 1996 fcra amendments what had been th fcras general antipreemption clause preserving more protective state law was

sharing22 preemption analysis preemption analysis begins with the supremacy clause of the us constitution23 under it congress may override state laws in conflict with the exercise of powers delegated to it under article i of the us constitution when congress has done so preempted state laws are unenforceable determining whether federal statute has preemptive effect is matter of statutory analysis if congress enacts legislation under one of its dele gated powers that includes an explicit statement that state law is preempted the supreme court generally will give effect to that legislative intent24 where there is language of preemption the court is likely to find preemption when it identifies direct conflict between the federal law and the state law or when it concludes that the federal governme nt has so occupied the field as to preclude enforcement of state law with respect to the subject at hand25 since the fcra clause on affiliate information sharing contains explicit language of preemption the issue is one of statutory construction ie discerning and giving effect to congressional intent26 generally that intent is determined by examining the statutory language giving effect to its plain meaning in relation to its context in the statute and if further elaboration is nece ssary its legislative history27 in dealing with matters traditionally with in the power of states to protect public health and safety ie the police pow er the supreme court often applies presumption against preemption28 in some recent decisions upholding an express federal preemption however the

exception to fcras general antipreemption clause 15 usc 1681ta pres erving state laws 40 the court appears to have overlooked the fact that the vermont statutes coverage of credit reports was broader than fcras cove rage of consumer reports and therefore would have covered affiliate information sharing but for the exclusion 41 145 cong rec s13789 november 3 1999 daily edapply with respect to subsection or c1 of section 2480e of title 9 vermont statutes annotated as in effect on september 30 199639 it noted that the fcra language on its face seems to preempt all state laws on affiliate sharing of consumer information it then reasoned that interpreting the language of preemption that way would encompass broader coverage than the underlying legislation and ther eby cover all information rather than just consumer credit information or cr edit report information the court reasoned that since information sharing among affiliates is exempted from the fcras definition of consumer re port it would make sense for the fcra to exclude affiliate information sharing from fcra coverage in that manner in one clause and in another bring it with in the ambit of the statute by precluding states from regulating it the court saw this reasoning reinforced by the fact that the same clause that preempted state law with respect to affiliate sharing of information specifically preserved vermont law fro m preemption which applied state credit reporting law to affiliate sharing of information40 glba was also factor in the court s decision that its notice requirement applies to affiliate information sharing led the court to read the glba anti preemption clause to cover californias ri ght to enact its optout requirement for affiliate information sharing to s upport this conclusion it quoted from the legislative history including the following remark by senator sarbanes the sponsor of the antipreemption clause we were able to include in the conference report an

that the nationwide integrated financial services companies authorized by financial modernization legislation46 relies on the three laws at issue and that contrary to the district courts interpretation the fcras 1996 amendments and the fact act provide comprehensive regulation of customer information sharing among affiliated financial companies they appear to fault the district court

share broad range of consumer in formation without becoming consumer reporting agencies the 1996 legislation also expressly preempted state laws that impose requirements or prohibitions with re spect to the exchange of information among persons affiliated by common owne rship or common corporate control 15 usc 1681tb92 the type of in formation covered by this preemption was not limited to consumer report information the combined effect of these provisions was to set national uniform requirements for the sharing of consumer information among affiliates54 they argue that glbas antipreemption clause does not permit the states to enact restrictions on affiliate information sharing rather it is limited to the provisions of glba and does not affect the preemptive force of fcra california supported by 27 states55 and the district of columbia argues for upholding the district courts ruling calif ornia has four major arguments the first is that the presumption against preemption in state police power cases requires unambiguous statutory language california maintains that the right of the states to legislate within their historic police power to protect consumers requires that the preemptive language be given narrow reading to preempt only state consumer reporting laws rather than all state laws56 it sees the language at issue as ambiguous it contend that even the american bankers association is not advocating literal reading of the plain language of the preemptive clause of the fcra and that such reading would invalidate all state laws respecting information sharing financial or consumer or otherwise among affiliated corporations57 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32626crs12 58 id at 23 59 id at 2 60 authorities cited included solid waste agency v united st ates army corp of engineers 531 us 159 2001 and pension benefit guar corp v ltv corp 496 us 633 1990 61 id at 10 62 id at 64the state offers second argument that the fcra preemption provision preempts only state laws regulating c onsumer reporting this draws on 1996 legislative history for support according to california the motivating factor and main purpose of preempting state laws with respect to information sharing among affiliates was to eliminate the possibility that affiliated companies would be treated as credit reporting agencies under the f cra and under state credit reporting laws the state argues that the banking associ ations have not cited anything in the legislative history of the 1996 amendmen ts supporting their interpretation that congress intended the fcra to reach be yond the scope of consumer reporting to void state financial privacy ws like the california law58 third argument characterizes the american bankers associations resort to fact act legislative history as muddyin g the waters and legally and logically irrelevant in discerning the intent of congress when it added the affiliatesharing preemption provision to the fcra in 199659 according to california the fact act did not alter the meaning of the preemption clause it merely eliminated provision by which it was scheduled to suns et it asks the court to refrain from drawing any inference that californias law was considered preempted by any failure by congress to enact any proposed amendments60 final argument relies on the savings clause in glbas privacy title according to the state glba expressly preserved the ability of the states to enact consumer protection statutes providing greater privacy pr otection and that this is precisely what california did61 the brief relies on legislative history particularly the statement by senator sarbanes supra at 8 that was quoted in the district courts decision62 analysis of the dist rict court s decision the district courts ruling with its refusal to limit itself to the strict language of the fcra preemption clause and its narrow reading of fcras potential reach and of the legislative history of the 1996 and 2003 amendments may have surprised legislators regulators nd financial services trade groups it may have been welcomed by consumer groups privacy advocates and opponents of increasing federal power whether the decision is ultimately reversed or not the ruling is interesting because it appears to embr ace view of provision the temporary enactment and permanent extension of wh ich was hotly debate d widely discussed and almost universally acknowledged to be precisely what the court ruled it was not the reason for the disparity between th perception during the debate and the interpretation of the court six months later may

14 2004 the district cour t held local ordinances invalid as having been preempted by the fcra language on appeal of another issue the decision was vacated as mootillumination to followers of the legislative process the straight language of the affiliate information sharing preemption was not freestanding legislation but was surrounded by the language structure and purposes of the fair credit reporting act it was the placing of this language within the confines and constrictions of law that had limited purposes that was viewed by the district court as requiring contextual analysis rather than limited parsing of the verbiage of the simple language of the affiliate information sharing preemption despite this fact however there are various issues that the district courts opinion raises that might lead an appellate court to reach different conclusion among them are the following 1 did the court do sufficient job of analyzing what the fcra regulates fcra regulates consumer reporting agenci which by definition would likely include financial services companies that share with their affiliates the kind of information that is covered by the fcra definition of consumer report specifically financial services companie s share nontransaction and nonexperience information bearing on consumers credit worthiness which is used or expected to be used to serve in determining eligibility for credit insurance employment or other purposes covered by the fcra63 such information is regulated by the fcra when it is disseminated among affiliated companies unless the company disclosing such information to its affiliates provides consumers with notice and an optout without the notice and optout the disclo sure would constitute consumer credit report under fcra and thus by inference the disclosing company would be subject to regulation as credit reporting agency 2 the court in construing the statute overlooked the statutory history of the 1996 amendments while there is considerable ambiguity in this legislative history it may provide support for the view that c ongress intended to preclude any state law placing further limits on interaffiliate sharing of information on consumers64 3 the courts analysis of glba may be open to question as the court in bank of america na v city of daly city65 recognized most commentators have read glba to be law regulating the sharing of nonpublic personal information about consumers by companies with nonaff iliated third parties not general law regulating the sharing of such informati on among affiliates nd nonaffiliated third parties its only provision respecting sharing of information among affiliates is the requirement that the institutions policy with respect to sharing information among affiliates be disclosed in its privacy notice its only specification with respect to this notice is that the notice under the fcra optout requirement be included in the glba privacy noticehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32626crs14 66

writing the glba rules has taken the position that the fcra preemption provision ensures that affiliated entities may share customer information without in terference from state law and subject only to the fcra notice and optout requirements if applicable the preemption is broad and extends beyond state information sharin g statutes to preempt any state statute that affects the ability of an entity to share any information with its affiliates congress intended the preemption provision to establish national uniform standard in this area 66 the ninth circuit ruling american banker s association v gould67 on appeal the us court of appeals fo r the ninth circuit re versed the district court and held that the california law was preempted by the fcras affiliate informationsharing provisions the court was careful to limit its holding by emphasizing that the preemption extended only to information covered by the fcra definition of consumer report68 the court outlined fcra as regime governing consumer reporting agencies and consumer reports which exempts from its coverage the sharing of cons umerreport informati on among affiliated companies under certain conditions to reach these conclusions it set forth premises on which its analysis of the preemptive scope of federal legisla tion was based 1 preemption depends on congre ssional intent 2 in an area of traditional state authority such as consumer protection congressional intent must be clear 3 analysis must begin with the plain statutor language which is to be viewed within the overall context of the regulatory
