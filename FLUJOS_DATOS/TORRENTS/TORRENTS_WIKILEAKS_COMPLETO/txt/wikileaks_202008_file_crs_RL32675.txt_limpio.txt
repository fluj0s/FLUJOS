metropolitan area designations by omb history current definitions and uses summary on december 27 2000 the office of management and budget omb announced its uniform criteria or standards for defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the current decade these areas together are termed core based statistical areas cbsas also announced were the standards for defining new england city and town areas nectas which are conceptually similar to cbsas the 2000 standards superseded those for defining metropolitan statistical areas in the 1990s cbsas consist of counties and countyequivalents in the united states and puerto rico each cbsa must contain at least one urbanized area of 50000 or more persons metropolitan statistical area or at least one urban cluster of 10000 to 49999 persons micropolitan statistical area cbsas have one or more principal cities and central counties outlying counties are included in cbsas on the basis of commuting data counties that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in cbsas are classified as outside core based statistical areas nectas are classified similarly to cbsas and designated as either metropolitan or micropolitan nectas omb issued effective june 6 2003 the actual lists of cbsas the titles of the areas with their principal city and county components nectas and their components are listed as well the lists were derived by applying the omb standards to population and commuting data from the 2000 decennial census conducted by the bureau of the census each year until 2010 omb will announce any revisions to cbsas that are justified by the census bureaus annual population estimates the most recent revisions were announced on february 18 2004 in principle standard metropolitan area definitions are to be used solely for descriptive statistical purposes in practice however they have other applications including their use in formulas for allocating federal grant program funds straightforward procedure exists for calculating the exact amount of money distributed through all federal grant programs that use metropolitan area definitions or for determining the effects of changes in these definitions on the total amount of funds allocated to specific jurisdiction even identifying comprehensively which programs use metropolitan area designations would require reviewing the statutes regulations and formulas associated with the programs assuming that such an identification were feasible it would be only the first step toward determining whether inclusion in or exclusion from particular metropolitan area or its components directly translates into an increase or decrease in the federal funds particular jurisdiction might receive from all federal grant programs that rely on these designations again the question would have to be addressed on programby program basis and posed to department or agency program staff this report will be updated to incorporate any relevant legislative developments or announcements by omb contents background 1 brief history of metropolitan area standards 1 introduction to the current standards 2 the 2000 standards in detail 2 metropolitan and micropolitan

omb history current definitions and uses background many members of congress at times have questions about metropolitan areas especially when the uniform criteria or standards for defining these areas are revised and constituents ask how the changes might affect the federal funds distributed to their jurisdictions on the basis of certain grant program formulas that use the definitions this report briefly presents the history of standard metropolitan area definitions notes the december 27 2000 announcement of the current standards for defining these areas and the june 6 2003 release of lists showing the actual delineations of the areas gives details about the 2000 standards and discusses the difficulty of ascertaining how metropolitan area designations affect federal funds allocation brief history of metropolitan area standards standard metropolitan area definitions represent an attempt to describe systematically the linkage between large population concentration and the territory surrounding it these definitions came about because of the realization during the 1940s that the value of metropolitan data produced by federal agencies would be greatly enhanced if agencies used single set of geographic definitions for the nations largest centers of population and activity at the time agencies were defining variety of statistical geographic areas at the metropolitan level using different criteria applied to different geographic units the result was that one agencys statistics were not directly comparable with another agencys statistics for any given area1 accordingly in 1949 the bureau of the budget issued the first standard definitions of metropolitan areas the bureau and then its successor omb have been in charge of designating these areas since 1949 except for the period from 1977 to 1981 when this responsibility rested with the office of federal statistical policy and standards in the department of commerce in addition to the 2000 revisions the standards underwent modifications in 1990 1980 1975 1971 and 19582 1 office of management and budget standards for defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas federal register vol 65 249 dec 27

the current standards on december 27 2000 the office of management and budget omb announced the standards for defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the current decade3 these areas together are termed generically core based statistical areas cbsas core refers to large population concentration that is integrated with surrounding territory this term like micropolitan is new the 2000 standards superseded those adopted in 1990 for defining metropolitan statistical areas the december 27 2000 notice also contained the standards for defining new england city and town areas nectas which are conceptually similar to cbsas omb issued effective june 6 2003 lists showing the actual delineations of cbsas the titles of the areas as well as their principal city and county components4 nectas and their components are listed too producing these lists involved applying the omb standards to population and commuting data from the 2000 decennial census conducted by the bureau of the census hence although omb sets the criteria for defining metropolitan areas the identification of the specific areas is census based the designations matter to congress because they matter to congressional constituents omb noted that the metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas defined through these standards represent areas in which people reside work and spend their lives and to which they attach considerable amount of pride5 cbsa designations also can influence decisions by businesses about where to locate or how to identify their markets thus variables like the territory included in an area the territory excluded and the areas title can generate great interest among diverse constituents including local officials business groups and nonprofit organizations this interest is heightened insofar as the standards are used in ways unintended by omb especially to implement nonstatistical programs and allocate program funds the 2000 standards in detail core based statistical area is geographic entity associated with at least one core of 10000 or more population plus adjacent territory that has high degree of 3 office of management and budget standards for

puerto rico counties that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in cbsas are classified as outside core based statistical areas7 omb defined besides cbsas set of new england city and town areas acknowledging the particular importance of these jurisdictions to this sixstate census division nectas are intended to be used if appropriate for new england but omb recommended that persons who need areas defined according to nationally consistent geographic components counties use cbsas in new england following are the highlights of the 2000 standards metropolitan and micropolitan categories each cbsa must contain census bureau defined urbanized area of at least 50000 population or census bureau defined urban cluster of at least 10000 population urbanized areas and urban clusters are collectively called urban areas8 cbsas are categorized as metropolitan or micropolitan according to the criteria below metropolitan statistical areas have urbanized areas of 50000 or more persons micropolitan statistical areas have urban clusters of at least 10000 but fewer than 50000 persons they represent an acknowledgment that certain entities while less populous than metropolitan statistical areas resemble them in some characteristics and are not well described as simply nonmetropolitan new england city and town area is classified similarly to cbsa and is designated either metropolitan or micropolitan necta principal cities of cbsas cbsas have one or more principal cities which include the largest incorporated place in the cbsa with 2000 census population of at least 10000 persons or if the cbsa contains such place the largest incorporated place or census designated place cdp9 6 ibid p 82236 7 ibid 8 ibid for detailed discussion of urban areas see bureau of the

residents central and outlying counties of cbsas cbsas have one or more central counties central county receives this designation under either of the following conditions at least 50 of the residents live in urban areas of 10000 or more persons or the county boundaries contain population of at least 5000 persons located in single urban area of 10000 or more persons to qualify as an outlying county of cbsa county must meet either of two requirements both of which concern commuting to and from work at least 25 of the outlying countys employed residents must work in the central county or counties of the cbsa or workers who live in the central county or counties of the cbsa must hold at least 25 of the outlying countys jobs the counties of cbsa must be contiguous and county may be included in only one cbsa if county qualifies as central in one cbsa and outlying in another it is assigned to the cbsa in which it is central county that qualifies as outlying in more than one cbsa is assigned to the cbsa with which it has the strongest commuting tie based on the commuting criteria stated above10 two adjacent cbsas are merged into single cbsa if the central county or counties as group of

defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas p 82236 crs5 counties as group of the other cbsa according to the above commuting criteria11 combining cbsas adjacent cbsas may form combined statistical area based on the employment interchange measure this measure is the sum of two figures for any two adjacent cbsas the percentage of employed residents of the less populous cbsa who work in the more populous cbsa plus the percentage of jobs in the less populous cbsa held by workers who live in the more populous cbsa if the employment interchange measure is 25 or higher the two cbsas are combined automatically if the measure is at least 15 but less than 25 the decision about combining depends on whether local opinion as reported by the congressional delegations in both areas favors combination12 the 2000 standards assign different meanings to combine and merge two merged cbsas form single entity combined cbsas in contrast retain their separate identities while having joint identity13 divisions of metropolitan statistical areas and nectas the largest metropolitan statistical areas each with single core containing at least 25 million persons may be divided into smaller groups of contiguous counties called metropolitan divisions county is termed main county of metropolitan division if at least 65 of its employed residents work in the county and the ratio of the number of jobs in the county to the number of employed county residents is 75 or higher county may receive secondary county classification if at least 50 but under 65 of its employed residents work in the county and the ratio of the number of jobs in the county to the number of employed county residents is 75 or higher 11 ibid 12 ibid pp 8223782238 13 for example the

for metropolitan division however for secondary county to qualify as the basis for forming metropolitan division it must join with either contiguous secondary county or contiguous main county with which it has the highest employment interchange measure 14 this measure must be 15 or higher necta with single core of at least 25 million persons may be divided into smaller groups of contiguous cities and towns called necta divisions the minimum population size for each necta division is 100000 persons main city or town of necta division must have at least 50000 residents and lower than 20 rate of outcommuting to another city or town titles of cbsas combined statistical areas metropolitan divisions and necta divisions the title of any of these areas includes the name of the areas principal city with the largest 2000 census population if the area has several principal cities the name of the largest appears first followed by the second and third largest exceptions are noted below if the most populous principal city of cbsa is census designated place the title uses first the name of the largest incorporated place of 10000 or more persons that is principal city and second the name of the cdp combined statistical area may have suitable regional name provided that it does not duplicate the title of component metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area or metropolitan division15 local opinion is taken into account in naming combined statistical areas if metropolitan division has principal city the title uses the names of up to three of the divisions most populous counties from largest to smallest if necta division has principal city it is named for its most populous city or town the title of an area also includes the names of any states in which the area is located updating cbsas during the current decade as previously mentioned omb issued the census2000 derived lists of core based statistical areas on june 6 2003 each year for the rest of the current decade 14 office of management and budget standards for defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas p 82237 15 ibid crs7 omb will announce any updates to cbsas that are justified by the census bureaus annual population estimates16 the most recent updates announced on february 18 2004 include designations of new micropolitan and combined statistical areas together with changes in the titles of certain areas and principal cities17 intended and unintended uses of the standards the success of standard metropolitan area definitions omb pointed out is evident from their widespread application including to inform the debate and development of public policies 18 omb emphasized however that the purpose of the standards is strictly statistical to provide nationally consistent definitions for collecting tabulating and publishing federal statistics for set of geographic areas the definitions are not in other words intended or approved for other purposes omb does not take into account or attempt to anticipate any nonstatistical uses that may be made of the definitions nor will omb modify the definitions to meet the requirements of any nonstatistical program thus the definitions should not be used to develop and implement federal state and local nonstatistical programs and policies without full consideration of the effects of using these definitions for such purposes these areas should not serve as generalpurpose geographic framework for nonstatistical activities and they may or may not be suitable for use in program funding formulas19 an acknowledgment nevertheless followed omb recognizes that some legislation specifies the use of metropolitan statistical areas for program purposes including the allocation of federal funds and will continue to work with the congress to clarify the foundations of these definitions and the resultant often unintended consequences of their use for nonstatistical purposes20 notable unintended uses of metropolitan area designations occur in certain federal grant programs to establish applicant or beneficiary eligibility for instance or as an element in formula and matching requirements following are three specific examples of such programs taken from the catalog of federal domestic assistance 16 ibid 17 office of management and budget update of statistical area definitions and additional guidance on

urban development states entitlement grants will be awarded by formula to states and qualifying cities for eligible metropolitan statistical areas emsas with the largest number of cases of aids worth mentioning in this discussion is that if statute mandates particular program use of metropolitan area designations the department or agency administering the program has choice but to apply the designations in the way the law specifies difficulty of determining how the standards affect federal funds distribution direct procedure exists for calculating the exact amount of money distributed through all federal grant programs that use metropolitan area definitions or for determining the effects of changes in these definitions on the total amount of funds allocated to specific jurisdiction even generating comprehensive list of programs whose funding formulas refer to these definitions would be problematic22 21 the contents of the catalog of federal domestic assistance may be viewed and searched at httpwwwcfdagov visited sept 27 2004 an updated version of the cfda is released annually in june with supplement issued each december 22 the same points apply to other censusbased statistical area designations such as of urbanized areas crs9 limitations of searching the catalog of federal domestic assistance single source provides straightforward means of identifying with certainty every program in the catalog of federal domestic assistance that in some way uses metropolitan area definitions to distribute money the general program descriptions in the cfda do not present all the variables used in determining applicant and beneficiary eligibility for assistance programs in other words the descriptions do not give the user enough detail to determine every factor that might figure into awarding grant funds for example conducting search with the phrase metropolitan statistical area or the abbreviation msa yields fewer than dozen hits however since the cfda search involves program descriptions not the statutes regulations and variables in mathematical formulas associated with the programs this small number of hits does not accurately reflect every instance when program relies on some feature of metropolitan area definitions related limitation is that certain federal programs have subprograms not presented separately in the cfda other strategies finding comprehensively which programs use metropolitan area designations would require reviewing the statutes regulations and formulas associated with the programs the government accountability office gao conducted partial review using the terms metropolitan statistical areas and msa to search the us code for report issued in june 2004 on the 2000 standards and their possible impact on certain federal programs23 gao identified 32 programs noted in the code that use these terms in determining program eligibility and mentioned briefly how the new standards might affect the distribution of program funds24 gao cautioned that its search was limited to the united states code and was not intended to serve as an exhaustive list of federal programs that refer to metropolitan statistical areas25 although gao did not repeat its search strategy with the code of federal regulations cfr combining the results of code and cfr searches might yield longer list of these programs an alternative approach would be to consult the program staff at the department or agency administering each program the cfda provides contact information for every federal assistance program along with the program description 23 us government accountability office metropolitan statistical areas new standards and their impact on selected federal programs gao report gao04758 washington june 2004 p 7

available it would be only the first step toward determining whether inclusion in or exclusion from particular metropolitan area or its components directly translates into an increase or decrease in the federal funds particular jurisdiction might receive from all federal grant programs that rely on these designations again the question would have to be addressed on programby program basis and posed to department or agency program staff gaos recent research is once more illustrative this time indicating the intensive effort necessary to investigate just few programs of the 32 programs it identified by searching the code gao presented detailed information about the new standards effects on four the department of housing and urban developments community development block grant program

white care act program to determine how the 2000 standards affected these programs gao wrote we reviewed relevant documentation such as analysis performed by the program offices on the impact of new standards attended public hearings and interviewed agency officials overseeing these programs26 to do likewise for all programs and to keep the information current would be of questionable feasibility especially because omb might update the designations of core based statistical areas as often as annually 26 ibid pp 67 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32675
