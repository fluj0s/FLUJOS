federal employees 4 28 usc 1346b 2674 because the united st ates is liable under the law of the state where the tort occurred state tort reform statutes such as those imposing caps on noneconomic damages apply in suits under the ftca for general information on the ftca see crs report 95717 federal tort claims act cu rrent legislative and judicial issues 5 united states v sm ith 499 us 160 1991smallpox vaccine manufact urers and administrators section 304c of the ho meland security act of 2002 amended the public health service act by adding 42 usc 233p which provides that covered person shall be deemed to be an employee of the public health service with respect to liability arising out of administration of covered countermeasure eg vaccine against smallpox to an individual during th effective period of declaration of public health emergency by the secretary this language immunizes from tort liability any covered pers on which the statute defines to include manufacturers and distributors of smallpox vaccine h ealth care entities under whose auspices smallpox vaccine is administered and li censed health professionals or other individuals who are authorized to administer the vaccine the secretary of health and human services issued the specified declaration making it effective as of january 24 20032 the reason that the provision just quot ed immunizes covered persons from tort liability is that it deems such persons to be employees of the public health service for tort liability purposes the public health service is federal agency and the federal tort claims act ftca makes all federal employees immune from liability for torts they commit within the scope of their employment3 they are immune that is from liability under state tort law they may be held liable for violating the us constitution or federal statute that authorizes them to be sued at the same time that the ftca immunizes federal employees and those deemed federal employees for liability purposes from liability for torts they commit within the scope of their employment it makes the united states government liable for such torts under the law of the state where the tort occurred in the same manner that private employers are generally liable for the torts of their employees4 the ftca however does not permit awards of punitive damages and does not allow jury trials it also contains exceptions under which the united st ates may not be held liable even though private employer in th same situation coul d be held liable under state law even when one of these excep tions precludes the united states from being held liable the ftca continues to immunize federal employees from liability for torts they commit within the scope of their employment5 strict liability the exceptions under which the united states may not be held liable include suits by military pers onnel for injuries sustained incident to service the feres doctrine suits based on the performance of discretionaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31649crs3 6 under 28 usc 1346b liability must be based on negligent or wrongful act or omission and the supreme court has constr ued this to preclude strict liability see dalehite v united states 346 us 15 4445 1953 7 in the case of some vaccines not including smallpox one may not file civil action for damages in an amount greater than 1000 against vaccine or administrator until one first files petition for compensation under the na tional childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 42 usc 300aa11a2 and the united st ates court of federal claims issues judgment on the petition this statute is di scussed below under vaccine components and ingredientsfunction ie policy judgment suits fo r assault or battery or specified other intentional torts claims arising out of combatant activities claims arising in foreign countries and others for present purposes however the ftcas most significant exception to federal government liability is that the united states may not be held liable in accordance with state law imposing strict liability6 strict liability means liability regardless of negligence and manufactur ers and sellers of defective products including vaccines may be held strictly liable under state law7 product may be found defective under state law not only wh it was defectiv ely manufactured but when it was defectively designed in the sense that it feasibly could have been designed to be safer or when warnin g that might have prevented injury was not provided the fact that the ftca does not permit strict liability apparently means that under the homeland security act of 2002 the government will not be liable for injuries caused by smallpox vaccine unless the plaintiff proves that the vaccine manufacturer or other covered person d been negligent in which case the government may be held liable if other exceptions in the ftca preclude liability some other features of section 304 section 304 also provides that the united states may be held liable for injuries caused by smallpox vaccine only if the vaccine was administered by qualified pe rson person authorized by state law to administer the vaccine during the eff ective period of declaration of public health emergency by the secretary of homeland security and only if the person receiving the v accine was within the category of individuals covered by the declaration or the person administering the vaccine had reasonable grounds to believe he was if person who did not receive the vaccine contracts vaccinia the smallpox virus and resides with an individual who did receive the vaccine then he shall be rebuttably presumed to have contracted vaccinia from the individual who received the vaccine this means that unless the government proves that the person who did not receive the vaccine contracted vaccinia from source other than the individual who did receive the vaccine the person who contracted vaccinia may sue the government as if he had contracted vaccinia from the vaccine sellers of antiterrorism technologies the safety act section 863 of the homeland secur ity act of 2002 titled litigation management is part of the support an titerrorism by fostering effectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31649crs4 8 for additional information see http wwwsafe tyactgov 9 the safety act does not explicitly preempt state causes of action but appears to do so implicitly section 863a2 gives federal dist rict courts exclusive jurisdiction but the statute does not state that the federal cause of action is exclusive it would not seem reasonable however to construe the statute not to preempt state causes of action because if it did not preempt them then because state causes of action in some states do not include liability limitations similar to those in the safe ty act plaintiffs in those states would bring state causes of action albeit in federal court and the safety act would have effect in those states 10 68 fed reg 4141941432 july 11 2003 6 cfr part 25 11 68

the application of another states law then the first state may apply the second states law 14 28 usc 1332 allows state ca uses of action to be brought in federal court only if the plaintiffs and defendants are from different states and the amount in controversy ex ceeds 75000 15 the reason that the statute created federal cause of action rather than simply requiring state causes of action to be brought in federal court may be that it might have been unconstitutional to allow state causes of acti on between plaintiffs and defendants from the continuedtechnologies act of 2002 or the safety act8 section 863 created federal cause of action against sellers of antiterrorism technologies fo r claims arising out of an act of terrorism when qualified antiterror ism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such an act prior to enactment of this section suits against sellers of qualified antiterrorism technology would have been brought under state law but the new federal cause of action apparently precludes suits from being brought under state law9 under the new federal cause of action liability against qualifie d sellers of antiterrorism technologies is more limited than it generally is under state law th secretary of homeland security shall determine whether an antiterrorism tec hnology qualifies for lia bility protection and shall place each technology that does on an approved product list for homeland security and issue it certificate of conformance the department of homeland security issued proposed rule to implement the safety act10 then an interim rule which took effect on october 16 200311 and then final rule which took effect july 10 200612 under the new federal cause of action the substantive as opposed to procedural law that governs liability is the law of the state in which the acts of terrorism occur except for the federal liability limitations discussed below13 the significance of creating federal cause of action is that suits may be brought in federal court regardless of the domicile of the parties and regardless of the amount of damages that the plaintiff seeks14 in fact section 863 requires that suits be brought in federal court though federal causes of acti on generally may also be br ought in state court this particular cause of action may not be as section 863 provides that the appropriate federal district court sha ll have exclusive jurisdiction15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31649crs5 15 continued same state to be brought in federal court see in re tmi litigation cases consol

continuedexceptions to the application of state law although the substantive law of the state in which the acts of terrorism occur governs the new federal cause of action section 863 prescribes some rules that preempt state law section 863 prohibits awards of punitive damages and of interest prior to judgment section 863 prohibits joint and several liability for none conomic damages noneconomic damages ar damages for pain and suffering and other losses that do not constitute monetary expenses such as medical bills and lost wages jo int and several lia bility is the rule that if more than one defendant is found liable for plaintiffs injuries then each defendant may be held 100 percent liable the plaintiff may not recover more than once but he may recover all his damages from one defendant with that defendant then entitled to seek contribution from other liable defendants the reason for joint and several liability is that the common law viewed it as preferable for wrongdoer to pay more than his share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full compensation to which he is entitled under secti on 863 in lieu of jo int and several liability for noneconomic damages noneconomic damages may be awarded against defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility for the harm to the plaintiff joint and several liability w ill continue to apply to economic damages except when state law provides otherwise section 863 eliminates the collateral s ource rule this is the rule that allows an injured party to rec over damages from the defendant even if he is also entitled to receive th em from third party collateral source such as health insuran ce company or an employer the collateral source rule may allow doubl recovery for the plaintiff but the common law viewed it as better for the victim than for the wrongdoer to profit from the victims prudence as in buying health insurance or good fortune in ving some other collateral source available section 863 provides ny recovery by plaintiff shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation if any that the plaintiff has receive d or is entitled to receive section 863 permits the government co ntractor defense this is defense created by the supreme court pursuant to federal common law that product manufacturers ma use in products liability cases that allege design defect or failure to warn16 these are caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31649crs6 16 continued warn 17 71 fed reg 33149brought under state law in which the plaintiff alleges that his injuries were caused by product that was defective in that the manufacturer failed to use the safest feasible design for the product or failed to provide adequate warnings of product hazard that could not be eliminated by feasible safer design in its defense the manufacturer may assert that it manufactured th product pursuant to government contract and that the design or warning it used was required by contract specifications when it ccessfully asserts this defense it may not be held liable under section 863 however as interpreted by the department of homeland security sellers of qualified anti terrorism technologies need not desi gn their technologies to federal government specifications in order to obtain the government contractor defense under the safety act instead the act sets forth criteria for the departments certif ication of technologies that are eligible for the defense17 under section 863 that is the government contractor defense would be available when qualified antiterrorism technologies approved by the secretary have been deployed and the secretary will be ex clusively responsible for the review and approval of antiterrorism technology for purposes of establishing government contractor defense this indicates that the secretarys approval of antiterrorism technology for purposes of establishing g overnment contractor defense is separate from his determination that antiterrorism technology qualifies to be subject to suit under section 863 instead of under state law section 863d provides should product liability or other lawsuit be filed relating to qualified antiterrorism technologies approved by the secretary there shall be rebuttable presumption that the government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit this presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to the secretary this presumption of the government contractor defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the seller arises from sale of the product to federal government or nonfederal government customers on its face this language seems to immunize government contractors from liability for injuries caused by defects that were not necessarily required by contract specifications including defect s that were not even design defects but that occurred in the manufacturing process in other words it appears to provide immunity to sellers in all cases in which the seller did not engage in the specified fraud or misconduct one might argue however that when section 863 says that the government contractor defense applies it means only that it applies in the general circumstance in which it ordinarily applies namely in design defect cases in which the defendant followed government contract specifications the department of homelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31649crs7 18 id 19 it is not apparent the circumstances in whic h an air transportation security company would both be an agent of citizen of the united st ates who provides air transportation and have contracted directly with the faa it is so not apparent why companies who provided air transportation security on september 11 2001 are required to have contracted with the faa by february 17 2002 in order to benefit from the liability limitationsecurity apparently takes this position when it states that except when the presumption in favor of the g overnment contract is rebutted it is clear that any seller of an approved technology cannot be held liable under th act for design defects or failure to warn claims the department believes that congress incorporated the supreme courts boyle line of cases as it existed on the date of enactment of the safety act rather than incorporating future developments of the government contractor defense in the courts18 liability insurance section 864a of the homeland security act of 2002 provides that sellers of antiterrorism technology to federal and nonfederal government customers must obtain liab ility insurance in such amounts as the secretary shall require and such insurance shall protect in addition to the seller contractors subcontractors suppliers vendors and customers of the seller and contractors subcontractors suppliers nd vendors of the customer section 864b provides that the seller shall enter into reciprocal waiver of claims with its contractors subcontractors suppliers ve ndors and customers and contractors and subcontractors of the customers under wh ich each party to the waiver agrees to be responsible for the losses that it sustai ns section 864c pr ovides that sellers liability shall be limited to the amount of liability insurance coverage that it is required to mainta in under section 864a air transportation security companies section 890 of the homeland security act of 2002 limits the liability of air transportation security companies and their affiliates for claims arising from the september 11 2001 air crashes it limits their liability to the amount of liability insurance they had on that date section 890 more precisely limits the liability of persons engaged in the business of providing air transportation secu rity and their affiliates if they are employees or agents of c itizen of the united states unde rtaking to provide air transportation and if agents have contr acted directly with the federal aviation administration on or after and commenced services later than february 17 2002 to provide such security and have not b een or are not debarred for any period within six months from that date section 890 limits the liability of such persons ie air transportation security companies and their affiliates only for claims arising from the terroristrelated crashe s of september 11 2001 and it limits it to the amount of liability insurance cove rage maintained by that person19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31649crs8 20 49 usc

liability limitation on air carriers for terrorist attacks that might have ccurred after september 11 2001 it provides that for acts of terrorism committed on or to an air carrier during the 180day period following the date of enactment of this act the secretary of transportation may certify that the air carrier was victim of an act of terrorism and shall not be responsible for losses suffered by thir d parties as referred to in section 2055b1 of title 14 code of federal regulations that exceed 100000000 in the aggregate for all claims by such parties arising out of such act if the secretary so certifies making th air carrier not liabl for an amount that exceeds 100 million then the government shall be responsible for any liability above such amount punitive damages may be awarded against an air carrier or the government taking responsibility for an air carrier under this paragraph under cause of action arising out of such act the section in the code of federal re gulations that section 201b mentions refers to persons including nonemployee cargo attendants othe r than passengers these are apparently the third parties to whom section 201b refers for whose losses above 100 million the government but not an air carrier would be responsible pl 10742 as noted was enacted on september 22 2001 which means that it sunset on march 21 2002 section 1201 of the homeland security act of 2002 extended the period during which section 201b would apply to d ecember 31 2003 it also gave certifying authority for operation of the liability limitation to the secretary of

explained above under smallpox vaccines that the federal government may be sued under the federal tort claims act this is apparently the case even when federal flight deck officer is gu ilty of gross

program which is funded by tax on vaccines provides more limited recovery than is genera lly allowed under state tort law but provides relatively fast nofau lt compensation it was hoped that the relative certainty and generosity of the systems awards will divert significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation23 recovery under the program is limited to actual unreimbursable expenses up to 250000 for pain and suffering and emotional distress 250000 in the event of vaccinerelated death actual and anticipated loss of earnings and attorneys fees and other costs but punitive damages pe titioner dissatisfied with his recovery under the program may sue vaccine manufacturer or administrator under state tort law with some limitations manufacturers are not liable for failure to provide warnings directly to the injured party as warning to the vaccine administrator is deemed sufficient there are rebuttable presumptions that manufacturers who comply with federal regulations are not subject to suit for failure to warn or to punitive damages petitions for compensation under the progr am are filed for vaccinerelated injury or death and that term does not in clude an illness injury condition or death associated with an adulterant or conta minant intentionally added to such vaccine24 homeland security act amendments sections 17141716 of the homeland security act of 2002
