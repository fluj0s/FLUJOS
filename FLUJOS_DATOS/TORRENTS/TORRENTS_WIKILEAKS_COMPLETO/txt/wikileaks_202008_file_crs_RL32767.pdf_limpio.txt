hold stock of bank under the bank holding compan act ie to be bank or financial holding company their primary federal regulator is not the federal reserve which regulates bank holding companies but the fdic although prominent large ilcs include subsidiaries of securities firms their owners also include automotive and retailing companies the ilc form reflects persistent tendency to combine the financing of business with its operations standard in many countries especially germany and japan but in disfavor in amer ica ilcs therefore have developed against long us twoway tradition of the separation of banking and commerce 1 ownership interests that nonfinancial firms may have in ba nks are generally 25 or less 2 banks may generally hold only nominal amounts of corporate stock ilcs evoke two major policy concerns first should congress grant ilcs powers that would allow them to be nationwide banks while in competition with community banks second could the comb ination of state and fdic regulation provide oversight comparable to that for nationwide banks especially for bank holding companies the interest shown by walmart in controlling an ilc with nationwide potential has heightened interest in these issues the 108th congress considered these issues in two bills th at passed the house hr 758 would have allowed ilcs to provide business check ing accounts while hr 1375 would have allowed ilcs to open branches nationwide these measures could have transformed ilcs into parallel banking system regulated primarily by few states growing into large institutions with commercial ownership in 2005 walmart announced that it was again applying for an ilc charter daimlerchrysler did likewise later in the year in the 109th congress hr 1224 allowing business checking accounts pa ssed the house on may 24 2005 it would prevent ilcs owned by nonfinancial bus inesses from becoming more banklike hr 3882 independently seeks to make an company that controls an ilc become financial holding company as define d above the house passed hr 3505 regulatory relief measure on march 8 2006 this bill would restrict ilcs from opening interstate branches hr 5746 was introduced july 10 2006 it would give the fdic the authority to regulate the owners of ilcs and prohibit some ilcs from branching into new states on decem ber 7 2006 107 members of congress asked the fdic to continue moratorium on depos it insurance applications by ilcs owned by commercial firms the members said this would provide time for the 110th congress to act on the policy concerns this report

committee on financial services july 12 2006 p19industrial loan companiesbanks and the separation of banking and commerce legislative and regulatory perspectives introduction industrial loan companies ilcs are statechartered nd stateregulated depository institutions whose deposits the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic may insure congress specifically exempted them from being defined strictly as banks in statutes nonetheless state banking codes may define them as industrial banks although they are subject to fdic inspection and the same banking laws that apply to all fdicinsured institutions parent companies may own them without becoming bank holding companies or financial holding companies and therefore are not subject to supervision by the federal reserve fed ilcs are now typically found in few western states in recent years large companies such as gmac volkswagen target and harleydav idson have created or acquired ilcs to provide inhouse financial services incl uding financing customers accounts an additional 14 have app lications pending for new ilcs or transfers of ownership1 ilcs are arguably an institutional manifestation of persistent tendency to combine the financing of business with its operations entrepreneurs may view this combination as efficient so that it em erges in this country periodically yet policymakers and especially the fed have often opposed it in america industrial firms may have only noncontro lling interests in banks as defined in statutes generally 25 or less of bank shares the combin ation of banking and commerce however is found in many other nations with differe nt financial systems germany and japan are perhaps the most prominent nations mixing capital sources and uses directly the 108th congress considered legislation tailed below allowing ilcs to be like regular commercial ba nks similar legislation resurfaced in the 109th congress especially after the government account ability office completed its study of these institutions and walmart revived its attempts to control an ilc there are two policy issues concerning il cs first if such measures become law could ilcs become alternative na tionwide banks owned by commercial and industrial and financial bus inesses that would cont ravene longstanding policy prohibiting nonfinancial companies from ow ning banks second could state and federal the fdic rather than the fed supervisors regulate the resulting ilcs and their owners comparably to other banking institutions and their holding companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32767crs2 2 12 stat 665 significantly amended by the national bank act of 1864 13 stat 99 some observers believe that should ilcs be allowed to ex pand lessregulated banking system controlled by very large securities firms and nonfinancial businesses would emerge contrary to longstanding laws if so deeppocket companies could operate nationwide ilcs as extensions of their corporate treasuries in competition with community banks threethousandormore branch bank of walmart could be the first of many such ilcs others note that existing ilcs are small players on the field of finance they would continue to be regulated by states and the fdic maintaining their safety and soundness desp ite ownership by retailers securities firms and others this report addresses the c ontroversy over expansion of ilcs by line of business and by branching across the nation as follows providing 1 an historical overview of the us separation of banki ng and commerce 2 information on ilcs and their regulation and 3 analysis of relevant legislation in congress banking and commerce in american economic development overall analysts think of banking as source of funds nd all other activities including commercial and industr ial business as use of funds much of the history of banking in the united states revolves around the desire to avoid mixing the two in the rest of the world such combinations are prevalent problems have occurred when they have mixed particularly when users of funds have treated bank as captive financier of business activities or an adjunct to corporate treasury the potential for bank failure has been higher in such cases the combination may heighten potentials for systemic risk in which the failure of one major lender leads to failures of others when regulatory oversight is not sufficiently strong nineteenth century following calamitous combinations of banking with commercial activities in the early 1800s new york and georgia led the way into having banks be purely lending and deposittaking businesse s in 1838 chartered banks generally moved away from commercial activities the national banking system which congress created to finance the civil war2 patterned itself on the limited new york banks other state banking systems included banks with significant commercial activities one notable example of stat elevel bankindustry combination was the bank of california which owned extensive gold and silver mining properties in nevada unincorporated private banks of ten partnerships combined financing and investing activities under one r oof later in the century the morgan and rockefeller commercialfinancialbanking empires were prominent among these aggregations their deposits financed investments in stocks often controlling other firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32767crs3 3 48 stat 162 20 21 26 32 4 an analysis of such struct ures appears in crs report rs21680 affiliates in banking finance and commerce development and regulatory backgr ound by william d jackson 5 70 stat 133early 20th century at the start of the 20th century many incorporated commercial banks emulated private bank operations through department s while trust companies investing in corporate stock investments emerged deposits essentially funded both types of banks allowing them large bases of assets the spread of mixed commercialinvestment banking lessened the distinction between financing an enterprise through credit and controlling it through ownership losses did occur especially after the stock market collaps in 1929 when many banks believed to have had significant stock holdings could not meet depositor demands for their money runs to withdraw deposits caused the failu re of many other banks including those that had not suffered losses because lthough they had opera ted safely and were solvent they lacked adequate funds on hand liquidity to pay depositors seeking withdrawals quickly many critics blamed the great depression that followed on financiers who abused banks in the service of nonbank business in reaction the glasssteagall act3 divided banking and industry including securities operations and their corporate investments into separate businesses after 1933 the morgan rockefeller and othe r complex business combinations with financial firms were split in to separate banking and nonbanking parts glass steagall prohibited most banks from hol ding significant amounts of stock in commercial businesses the new securities firms longer able to invest for their own account based on deposit funding becam transactional fi

bank participa tion in commercial operations turned to the holding company form that seemingly maintained certain separation while gaining some efficiencies this form of an unregulated statechartered corporation with potentially unlimited authorities could control hold the stock of regulated banks and any number of unregulated financ ial and nonfinancial businesses the archetype of this diversification was the giant transameri ca corporation transamerica owned the bank of america other large banks in several western stat large insurance companies real estate and oil development operations fish packer metal fabricator ocean shipping and taxicab ope rations provisions addressing companies holding bank stock in the 1933 act did not prevent its rise repeated federal reserve fed

interstatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32767crs4 6 84 stat 1760 7 92 stat 3683 expansion the fed became the supervisor of multibank holding companies and quickly limited their commercial ties and interstate operations large businesses continued to find it adva ntageous to own just single bank onebank holding company coul d own only one bank which nonfinancial businesses could then contro l without restraint by 1970 more than 700 of these companies had emerged in that year major amendments to the bhca6 limited such combinations the amended bhcas definition of bank applied only to institutions that both accepted demand deposits checking accounts and made commercial loans the 1956 statute specified that control of banks occurred when single company such as nonfinancial business or investment ente rprise owned 25 or more stock ownership of voting shares in banks with significant exceptions this figure still critically defines the span of prohibited control of bank by nonfinancial company the change in bank control act of 19787 extended the 25 value to unincorporated firms individuals etc nonbank banks shortly afterwards limited service nonbank banks nbbs arose nbbs 1 accepted either demand or other deposits or 2 made commercial loans but critically not both corporate buyers would purchase or create bank with national or state charter and divest either its bus iness loans or its posits payable on demand thus their banking operations fell outside the bhcas redefinition in 1970 yet the fdic insured their deposits the office of the comptroller of the cu rrency which charte rs national banks chartered the first such institution in 1982 this agency soon became flooded with applications because nbbs fell outside th strict legal definition of bank they their parent corporations nd related companies were not subject to bhca activity and interstate banking restrictions mo st apparently accepted deposits but made commercial loans prominent nbbs thus became known as credit card banks others apparently functione d as extensions of corporate treasuries and invested largely in money market instrument s this nonbank bank loophole allowed financial
