parks summary for at least decade the use of snowm obiles in yellowstone and other national parks has been controversial because of the potential impacts on wildlife and until recently the absence of standards for snow mobile emissions and noise the national park service has attempted to address the issue by developing winter use plans that establish regulations and limits at individual park units these plans have been the subject of numerous legal challenges on september 15 2008 the us district court for the district of columbia vacated the national park services most recent winter use plan for yellowstone national park the plan would have allowed up to 540 snowmobiles per day into the park beginning in the 20082009 winter season provided that they met noi and emission standards and that the riders were accompanied by commercial guides the nps plan was opposed by environmental groups and the vast majority of public co mmenters with the rule vacated it is unclear what limits will apply in the coming winter season current model snowmobiles emit signif icant quantities of pollution in one hour new model snowmobile emits as much hydrocarbon as 2008 model auto emits in about four years 54000 miles of driving th environmental protection agency epa promulgated regulations limiting air emissions from snowmobiles in 2002 but the regulations have the effect of allowing the machines to emit as much hydrocarbon pollution in day as new auto emits in its lifetime snowmobiles also emit significant amounts of noise epa has snowmobile noise standards the national park service has allowed snowmobile use in 43 units of the national park system in many cases in pparent violation of executive orders from the nixon and carter years outside of alaska where snowmobiles are permitted in most national parks by law the most popular national park for snowmobiling has been yellowstone which saw more than 87000 snowmobile visits in the 20012002 winter season under the clinton administr ation the park service decided that the emissions and noise from snowmobiling were incompatible with protecting the park and promulgated rules that would have phased out snowmobiles from yellowstone by the winter of 20032004 the bush ad ministration revisited these rules and announced modifications in march 2003 that would have allowe d continued use of snowmobiles the 2003 rules and the clin ton administration action have been the subject of conflicting court rulings federal court in wyoming has vacated and remanded the clinton administrations phaseout while dc federal court has vacated and remanded the bush administration rules for the last four winters yellowstone and two neighbor ing park units have opera ted under temporary plan that permits 720 snowmobiles per day in ye llowstone

of the clinton administration proposals by the national park service to enforce longstanding policies that regulated the use of snowmobiles in national parks raised number of questions regardin g the potential regulation of such vehicles these questions continue to be debated as the national park service nps explores optional winter use plans for yellowstone and other units of the national park system and as various parties challenge the actions of the nps in court national park system units account for only about 3 of the land mass of the united states and possess few trails and roads suitable for snowmobiles compared to areas available on other federal nds but for both proponents and opponents the question of snowmobile access to the parks has taken on far greater importance to the snowmobile industr and to many in communities neighboring national parks snowmobiling is an impor tant part of the economic engine that supports northern communities winter tourism1 to environmental groups snowmobiling is one of the most environmentally devastating recreational activities permitted by the park service resulting in adverse impacts to park wildlife air and water quality vegeta tion park ecology and park users2 underlying the debate are broader questions concerning regulation of emissions and noise from the vehicles and the degree to which restrictions may serve as precedent or stigma affecting snowmobile and motorized recreation3 use more generally snowmobile use in national parks in the 1990s snowmobiles were allowed access to 43 units of the national

all units of the national park service in response the service surveyed units of the system to assess the extent to which they were complying with the executive orders according to interior department testimony the results graphically demonstrated that the national park service was not complying with its statutory and regulatory ma ndates consequently main taining the status quo with regard to snowmobiling was simply not an option8 on april 27 2000 the department of the inte rior and the national park service announced that snowmobiling for general recreational pur poses will be prohibited

are of concern because they contain benzene formaldehyde and at least three other substances that are known or suspected human carcinogens snowmobiles meeting epa regulations also emit as much carbon monoxide co in an hour as 2008 model auto doe s in 1 050 mile s of driving carbon monoxide is poisonous gas that at low levels can affect those who suffer from cardiovascular disease such as angina the impact of co emissions on ambient air quality is of at least equal concern as th at of hydrocarbons because of the tendency for atmospheric accumulation of co in winter in preparing the 2000 environmental im pact statement for the decision on snowmobile access to yellowstone the national park service measured emissions from snowmobiles and compared them to ot her emission sources in the park the service also estimated the concentrations ambient levels of carbon monoxide co and particulate matter pm present in the air and compared these concentrations to air quality standards the eis concluded that the 8hour maximum concentration of carbon monoxide at the west yellowstone trance to the park exceeded the national ambient air quality standard for co by nearly 70 concentration of 1515 parts per million vs the standard of 934 the analysis also concluded that snowmobiles accounted for 979 of the co at west yellowstone during winter monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31149crs11 35

argue that the parks are special places whose remoteness beauty and quiet inspire reflection and awe the noise of engines is incompatible with this atmosphere they argue as the national park service itself states in its record of decision snow mobile use in historical numbers is inconsistent with winter pa rk landscapes that uniquely embody solitude quiet undisturbed wildlife and the enjoym ent of these resources by those engaged in nonmotorized activities35 snowmobile enthusiasts counter that the parks cover vast areas and that snowmobiles are restricted to few roads the same roads traversed by cars recreational vehicles and buses in summer they also assert that snowmobile use is compatible with the nps responsibility to promote visitor use and enjoyment of park resources park service studi indicate that the sound of snowmobiles can be heard for significantly greater distances than that of automobiles however and in the late 1990s was essentially continuous during the winter at key locations in yellowstone snowmobile noise could be heard 95 of the time by visitors at old faithful and 87 of the time at the grand canyon of the yellowstone according to npss december

register november 8 200237 as shown in table 2 the regulations require reduc tion of both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions from new snowmobiles by little more than 30 starting in 2006 and by an average of 50 by 2012 with an intermediate step in 2010 the regulations did not require any controls on snowmobiles sold before 2006 for comparison table 2 also shows the yellowstonespecific standards that have been imposed by the national park service according to epa the 20062007 reductions can be achieved without major changes in technology in part because th ey apply to the average of manufacturers fleet emissions rather than to individual machines this allows manufacturers to provide range of models some with advanced emission controls and others without while some advanced technologies such as twost roke direct injection and fourstroke engines would be found in some models many models would s till be equipped with twostroke engines with relatively minor engine modifications resulting in minimum emission reductions while some models may not even have any emission controls38 epa estimates the cost of th phase 1 controls at 73

engines produce more power than similar size fourstrokes and are easy to start in cold weather the agency expects the industry to continue to manufacture mostly twostroke engines even in 2012 although many would be modified with direct injection technology to reduce emissions according to the agency potential scenario for meeting these standards could be mixture of 50 percent direct injection 20 percent fourstroke engines and 30 percent with engine modifications39 the cost of these changes would average an additional 131 per snowmobile in 2010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31149crs13 40 ibid table

although 73decibel snowmobile would be quieter it did not satisfy the judge in the yellowstone winter use plan case citing the winter use plan itself judge sullivan concluded that sound measuring 70 decibels is perceived to be noisy the equivalent of being in room with running vacuum cleaner he found that the model used to estimate the percent of time that noise would be audible in the park underestimated the sound level when compared to actual field measurements and that it failed to account for temperature inversions which are common in yellowstone and which cause sound to travel much farther he found that the park servic used parkwide audibility in order to obscure the impacts in areas frequented by visitors and he cited nps itself as admitting that the percent time audible impact will be maj or and adverse september 15 2008 opinion continuedaccording to epa but the costs would be offset by 286 in fuel savings and improved performance so that lifetime co sts would actually be 155 lower the same is true of th 2012 sta ndards the added cost of 89 per snowmobile is offset by 191 in fuel savings and improved performance according to epa for net savings of 102 per vehicle40 the costs of each of the three phases are incremental thus when fully implemented the standards would cost an additional 293 per snowmobile according to the agency lifetime operatin g costs however would decline by 534 combining these two factors the standa rds would decrease total costs by 241 per snowmobile when fully implemented the standards do not include noise limits while acknowledging that the agency has the authority to set noise standa rds the proposal stated that at this time we do not have funding to pursue noise standards for nonroad equipment that does not have an existing noise requirement41 an agency source confirmed that the proposed standards would have essentially impact on noise42 despite receiving comments from number of organizations th at the standards should address noise the agency restated in its response to pub lic comments that it w ould not address the issue adding that congress would need to provide appropriations for the agency to begin any noise control

be sufficiently lenient to permit the continued production of all existing snowmobile mode ls and 2 the analysis and evidence underlying the agencys conclusion that dvanced technologies can be applied to more than 70 of new snowmobiles by 201246 epa has not yet responded to the remand and does not expect to do so until 2010 at the earliest47 the international snowmobile manufact urers association isma has argued that epa grossly underestimated the costs of compliance and that the standards will lead to the elimination of entrylevel snowmobiles from the market cleaner quieter machines can be made according to isma but they cost more are heavier and can only be ridden on groomed roads isma has estimated that the cleanest fourstroke engines cost an additional 1700 about 30 more than average prices even modest improvements to twostroke engines will cost 350400 per machine according to the association48 bluewater network on the other nd the environmental group most identified with

college students are able to build cleaner and quieter machines surely the billiondollar snowmobile industry can do as well said bluewate r public land director sean smith53 both bluewater and the snowmobile manufacturers argue that epa has misinterpreted the legal authority on which the new standards rely bluewater as well as other environmental groups and the national association of clean air agencies formerly stappa the asso ciation representing state air pollution program administrators argue that epa has promulgated sta ndards that are less stringent than the law requires section 213a3 of the clean air act requires the agency to promulgate standards that achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable giving appropriate consider ation to the cost and to noise energy and safety factors fourstr oke engine technology achieving greater emission reductions than the agency promul gated is already available they note machines using this technology are on the market cost noise and energy factors cannot be used as arguments against adopti on of this technology the lifetime cost of such engines would be lower than that of current engines according to the agencys own analysis the technology uses far less energy and could be substantially quieter than current engines thus according to these groups the agencys standards do not meet the requirements of the act snowmobile and other nonr oadvehicle manufacturers on the other hand focus on section 213a2 of the act which ties th agencys authority to regulate nonroad engines to finding by the administrator that emissions from such engines or vehicles are significant c ontributors to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in more than 1 area which has failed to attain the national ambient air quality standards for ozone or carbon monoxide epa addre ssed this issue before beginning the process of developing regu lations on june 17 1994 the agency made an affirmative determination that emissi ons from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone co and particulate matter in more than one nonattainment area54 on december 7 2000 the agency issued finding that recreational vehicles including snowmobiles are among the sp ecific categories of nonroad vehicles that contribute to such pollution55 in its october 5 2001 federal register notice which proposed the snowmobile standards the agency identified 7 areas in alaskahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31149crs16 56 66 federal register 5110551107 october 5 2001 the preamble to the final rule revised the list of 7 areas identifying 6 nonattainment areas in which the agency believes snowmobiles are significant contributors to co concentrations the agency added that there are 6 additional areas that have not been classified nonattainment but where air quality monitoring indicates need for co control see preamble to the final rule previously cited p 18 57 none of the seven was still classified nonattainment in

snowmobiles and have failed to attain the air quality standard for co56 manufacturers of snowmob iles and other nonroad vehi cles note however that carbon monoxide concentrations have declined chiefly as result of auto emission standards and that none of the 7 areas id entified by the agency has exceeded the co standard in recent years even if they we re still formally cla ssified as nonattainment at the time of the proposal57 co nonattainment today is essentially problem in urban hot spots according to manufacturers and snowmobiles make contribution to that problem58 legislative issues members of congress both from western and other states have expressed an interest in whether there w ill be continued snowmobile access to national parks at least five hearings have been held on these issues since the 106th congress59 and congress has on three occasions approved language in appr opriations bills to require that nps temporary winter use rules permitting snowmobiles in yellowstone and grand

108th congresses conclusions snowmobile issues remain far from resolved despite actions by congress epa the national park service and the courts congress and the nps have provided temporary resolution of th yellowstone access issue si nce 2004 but the issue is now returning to the limelight as federal distri ct court has vacated final regulations for yellowstone access for third time the velopment of these rules showed that public interest in snowmobile issues remains significant and that the national park services preferred alternatives for snowmobile access to yellowstone remain overwhelmingly unpopular the draft yellowst one area winter use plan that was open for comment from march thr ough june 2007 generated 122190 public comments of which only 193 01 supported the nps preference61 among those opposed environmental groups and individua ls that want snowmobiles banned from the park form solid majority they are joined by 7 of the 8 living former directors of the national park service itself the environmental protection agency was also critical of the spring 2007 preferred altern ative noting that it would result in five times more carbon monoxide emissions nd 17 times more hydrocarbon emissions than the exclusive use of multipassenger snowcoaches epa concluded that either the preferred alternative s hould be modified or diffe rent alternative should be selected that meets the resource protections identified by the national park service62 this level of opposition would seem to guarantee that members of congress will retain an interest in the resolution of these issues continued action is also likely in the courts as the national park serv ice responds to the latest court decision
