2002 sports gambling in school sketch of proposals to strengthen federal prohibitions charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary the national gambling impact study commission reported widespread sports gambling on college campuses and alt hough closely divided recommended that gambling on collegiate and amateur athletic events be completely outlawed as in the 106th congress the sports gambling measures introduced thus far in this congress fall into two categories those that impose complete ban on amateur sports gambling s 718 mccain et hr 1110 graham et and those that seek to reduce campus gambling and illegal sports gambling s 338 ensign et hr 641 gibbons et this is sketch of those proposals and an abridged version of crs report rl30954 sports gambling in school legal analys is of proposals to strengthen federal prohibitions background there are more than few federal gambling laws most but not all are designed to reenforce state gambling laws several refer to sports gambling and others have sufficient breath to encompass it for example the wi re act 18 usc 1804 which proscribes the interstate transmission of be ts or gambling information speaks of gambling on sporting events and contests specifically th travel act 18 usc 1952 which cr iminalizes interstate travel to conduct the affairs of various unlawfu l activities and the federal prohibition on illegal gambling business 18 usc 1955 on th other hand do not mention sports gambling as such but reach illegal gambling generally not all federal gambling laws impose criminal penalties the professional and amateur sports protection act paspa 28 usc 37013704 for instance merely entitles the attorney general and various sports organizations to federal court order enjoining governmental entities and their contractors from sponsoring licensing or engaging in sports gambling and alt hough the lottery broadcast ban 18 usc 1305 carries criminal penalties it is enforced primar ily through the regulatory authority of the federal communications commissionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20905crs2 since federal gambling laws have often been crafted to mirror state gambling policies when gambling policies in the states became more ambivalent so too did federal law early recognition of this fact led to the creation of the national gambling impact study commission pl 104169 110 stat 1482 1996 in its final report the commission recommended that the state nd federal governments act under the presumption that state governments are best equipped to regulate gambling within their borders with two exceptions tribal and internet gambling but urged that the betting on collegiate and amateur athletic events that is currently legal be banned altogether t he national gambling impact study commission final report recommendations 31 37 1999 when reporting out sports gamblin g legislation in the last congress the committees in each house characterized the commissions sports gambling recommendation as third exception to the state primacy recommendation both the house judiciary committee and the senate committee on commerce science and transportation re ported sports gambling proposals favorably but the 106th congress adjourned before any further acti on could be taken the proposals have been reintroduced in this congress however by senator mccain s 718 and congressman graham hr 1110 the senate comme rce science and technology committee approved the mccain bill w ith amendments on may 14 2001 killing off grandfathersmonopolies s 718 the amateur sports integrity act as introduced consists of two titles the first which deals with athl etic performance enhancing drug s is beyond the scope of our discussion the s econd essentially replicates the proscriptions of the professional and amateur sports protection act 28 usc 37013704 with respect to olympic high school and college gambling but without the exceptions grandfathered into existing law as practical matter its impact is to outlaw sports gambling with respect to high school college or olympic contests in every state but its impact would be felt primarily in the only state where such gambling is now legal nevada hrept 106903 at 2 the professional and amateur sports protection act forbids any governmental entity or any of its contractors from sponsoring operating licensing or authorizing sports gambling the attorney general or aggrieved sports organizations enforce the act through court orders which enjoin furthe r violations the acts prohibitions are inapplicable to sports gambling in states where it was lawful at the time the legislation was proposed the exceptions were grounded in reluctance to apply the proscription retroactively in states where sports gambling had been legalized the senate bill adds its provisions to the chapter of the united states code that incorporates the united states olympic committee 36 usc ch 2205 the house bill hr 1110 as introduced in contrast simply amends section 3704 its effect however is the same as the senate proposal proponents of the two proposals argue that they implement the recommendations of the gambling commission by closing loophole in existing law mitigate the threat that gambling poses to the integrity of amateur athletics and reduce the extent of illegal sports gamblinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20905crs3 opponents respond that the proposals have substantial and unfair economic impact on the state of nevada and one of its principal employers whose regulated gambling activities do not imperil the integrity such as it is of amateur athletics and that there are effective ways to reduce the extent of illega l sports gambling an objective the proposals do not achieve they also argue that the proposals are constitutionally suspect as an impermissible intrusion on state prerogatives and governmental taking without just compensation there is also the suggestion that the propos als are incompatible with the principles of federalism perhaps unconstitutionally so whatever their congruity with the principles of federalism the proposals do not appear to exceed congress legislative prerogatives under the commerce clause as lopez explained and morrison confirms congress commerce clause powers extend to activities that have substantial affect on interstate commerce and to economic enterprises which even if intrastate have an impact on commerce sports gambling particularly when conducted within casino in nevada appears to fit comfortably among the exampl of economic activity which the supreme court finds within congress power under the commerce clause although matter lies within congress authority under the commerce clause efforts to exercise that authority may fail if inconsistent with the principles of federalism reflected in the tenth amendment thus congress in the name of commerce may not compel state to enact federal regulatory scheme nor compel the state or its officers to enforce such scheme congress within the commerce power may regulate state activities however as long as it does not compel the states to exercise regulatory authority over others for instance the dr ivers privacy protection act 18 usc 2721 2725 bans the state departments of motor vehicles from rel easing certain motor vehicle registration information information which some have traditionally sold except for federally approved purposes the act survived federalism challenge based on new york and printz because it was deemed to constitute th regulation of state activity not the control of state regulation of the activities of others the prohibitions against state sponsorship or operation of spor ts gambling activities are clearly an example like the supreme court cases in condon and baker of federal regulation of state activity whether the licensing prohibition merely constitutes ban on state activity or crosses the line as federal command that the state regulate its citizenry per federal instruction is much closer question of course the eleventh amendment comes to mind whenever statute enacted under claim of commerce clause powers purpor ts to vest federal court jurisdiction for private suit against state or its officials the eleventh amendment proscription however is subject to limitation which permits some injunctive relief against state officials for violati ons of federal law ex parte young 209 us 123 1908 this seems to be precisely what the proposals contemplate critics face less formidable obstacles in any effort to establish takings clause claim as threshold matter party challenging governmental action as an unconstitutional taking bears substantial burden for not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be taking in the constitutional sense eastern enterprises v apfel 524 us 498 523 1998 in the absence of physically intrusive taking where regula tion places limitations on property that fallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20905crs4 short of eliminating ll economically beneficial use taking nonetheless may have occurred depending on complex of factors including the regulations economic effect on the property owner the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investmentbacked expectations and the character of the government action palazzolo v rhode island 533 us 606 617 2001 when the challenged governmental action occurs within field of highly regulated activity like gambling the task of establishing taking may be even more daunting eastern enterprises 524 us at 528 proponents might well point out that th proposals introduce new constitutional questions they merely follow the legislative path established by the professional and amateur sports protection act they might argue that passage of act suggests that congress saw constitutional impediment to enactment of the original statute moreover they may contend that the provision in s 718 for prompt judicial review of the proposals constitutionality preclude s objection on constitutional grounds study prosecution and admi nistrative enforcement the national collegiate and amateur athl etic protection ac t of 2001 s 338hr 641 proposes series of research prosecutori and administrative initiatives to eliminate gambling on college campuses and reduce illegal sports gambling it instructs the attorney general to establish coordinating sports gambling task force and authorizes appropriations of 28 million for the task force it increases the criminal penalties for sports related gambling so that the penalty for point shaving becomes imprisonment for not mo re than 10 years instead of not more than 5 years the maximum penalties for transporting gambling paraphernalia 18 usc 1953a for conducting an illegal gamblin g business 18 usc 1955a and for violations of the travel act 18 usc 1952 also rise from 5 to 10 years when gambling on any sporting event or contest is involve d and the maximum term of imprisonment for wire act offenses grows from 2 to 5 years the proposal calls for justice department di rected research on the extent of illegal sports gambling by juveniles as well as multifaceted study on sports gambling with particular emphasis on the co llege level illegal gambling it requires colleges receiving federal education funds to implement an illegal gamb ling reduction program which includes withholding athletica lly related student aid from those guilty of engaging in illegal gambling the proposal ends with congressional plea to educational and governmental tities as well as to the ncaa national collegiate athletic association to develop and execute youth gambling education and prevention programs the principal criticism of this ensigng ibbons proposal to date is that while its components might constitute welcome suppl ement it is substitute for the mccain graham proposal unstated t hus far except perhaps in the gaming commissions general recommendation may be the view that both proposals interject the federal government into matter appropriately left to the states
