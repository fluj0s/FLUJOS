jennifer k elsea legislative attorney american law division richard f grimmett specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133declarations of war and aut horizations for the use of military force historical background and legal implications summary from the washington administration to the present congress and the president have enacted 11 separate formal declarations of war against foreign nations in five different wars each declaration has been preceded by presid ential request either in writing or in person before joint session of congress the reasons cited in justification for the requests have included armed attacks on united states territory or its citizens and threats to united states rights or interests as sovereign nation congress and the president have also on number of occasions enacted authorizations for the use of force instead of declarations of war most commonly such measures have authorized the use of force ag ainst either named country or unnamed hostile nations in given region in most cases the president has requested the authority but congress has sometimes given the president less than what he asked for in contrast to the declarations of war not all authorizations for the use of force have resulted in actual combat both declarations and authorizations require the signature of the president in order to become law in contrast to an authorization declarati on of war in itself creat state of war under international law and legitimates the killing of enemy combatants the seizure of its property and the apprehension of enemy aliens at one time declaration was deemed necessary legal prerequisite to war and was also t hought to terminate diplomatic and commercial relations and most treaties between the combatants in the modern era the international legal consequences of declarations ve become less determinate in fact declarations have rarely been issued since world war ii perhaps most important neither declaration nor an authorization is necessary to trigger application of the laws of war such as the hague and geneva conventions for that the fact of armed conflict is the controlling circumstance with respect to domestic law declaration of war automatically triggers many standby statutory authorities conferring special powers on the president with respect to the military foreign trade transportation communications manufacturing alien enemies etc in contrast standby authorities ppear to be triggered automati cally by an authorization for the use of force most standby authorities do not require declaration of war to be actualized but can be triggered by declaration of nationa l emergency or simply by the existence of state of war declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force waive the time limitations otherwise applicable to the use of force imposed by the war powers resolution this report provides historical background on th enactment of declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force and analyz their legal effects under international and domestic law it also sets forth their texts in two appendices because the statutes that confer standby authority on the president and the executive branch potentially play such large role in an armed conflict to which the united states is party the report includes an extensive listing and summary of the statutes that are triggered by declaration of war declaration of national emergenc andor the existence of state of war the report concludes with summary of the congressional procedures applicable to the enactment of declaration of war or authorization for th use of force and to measures under the war powers resolution the report will be updated as circumstances

president has cited what he deemed compelling reasons for doing so these reasons have included armed attacks on united states territory or its citizens and attacks on or direct threats to united states rights or interests as sovereign nation in the nineteenth century all declarations of war were passed by the congress in the form of bill in the twentieth century all declarations of war were passed by the cong ress in the form of joint resolution in every instance the measures we re adopted by majority vote in both the house and the senate and were signed into law by the president3 the

singular st to all the others mckinleys request for declaration of war on april 25 1898 was approved by voice vote of both houses of congress on that date his reque st was made after spain had rejected us ultimatum that spain relinquish its sovereignty over cuba and permit cuba to become an independent state this u ltimatum was supported by joint resolution of congress signed into law on april 20 1898 that among other things declared cuba to be independent demanded that spain withdraw its military forces from the island and directed and authorized the president to use the us army navy and militia of the various states to achieve these ends the war with spain in 1898 in short was not principally based on attack s on the united states but on us effort to end the cuban insurrection

declarations of war by congress were ba sed on findings by the president that us territory or sovereign rights had been ttacked or threatened by foreign nation although president wilson had tried to ma intain us neutrality after the outbreak of the first world war he regarded the german decision on february 1 1917 to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare against all naval vessels in the war zone including those of neutral states to be an unacceptable assault on us sovereign rights which the german government had previously pledged to respect wilsons request to congress for declaration of war against germany on april 2 1917 stated that war had been thrust upon the united states by germanys actions congress passed joint resolution declaring war wh ich the president signed on april 6 1917 wilson delayed requesting war declaration against austriahungary until december 4 1917 he did so then because that state german ally in the war had become an active instrument of germany against the united states congress quickly passed joint resolution declaring war which the president signed on december 7 19176 president franklin d roosevelt requested declaration of war against japan on december 8 1941 because of direct military attacks by that nation against us territory military personnel and citizens in hawaii and othe r outposts in the pacific area the house and the senate passed

active military actions against the united states and had themselves declared war on the united states congress passed separate joint resolutions declaring war on each of these nations the president

exists between the united states and the other nation with the one exception of the declaration of war agains t austriahungary on december 7 1917 the other seven declarations characterize th state of

61 stat 1757 key statutory authorizations for the use of military force from the administration of president john adams to the present there have been various instances when legislation has been enacted authorizing the use of military force by the president instead of formally declaring war in most cases such legislation has been preceded by specific request by the president for such authority during the presidencies of john adams and thomas jefferson these chief executives noted in messages to congress th at congressional authorizations for use of force would be appropriate to enable the united states to protect its interests from predatory actions by foreign powers in pa rticular attacks on us commercial vessels and persons on the high seas by france and by tripoli congress responded with specific authorizations for the use of force under the presidents direction in 1798 against france and in 1802 against tripoli in 1815 president james madison formally requested that congress declare war against the regency of algiers in response to its attacks on us citizen s and commerce in the mediterranean congress responded with an act authorizin g the president to utilize us armed vessels to be used against algerian naval attacks but did not declare war in the period following world war ii presidential requests for authority to use military force when made have usually been for broad authority to use us military force in specific region of the world in order to defend us interests or friendly states as the president deems appropriate more recently due to an expansive interpretation of the presidents constitutional authority as commanderinchief of the armed forces and of his inherent powers to use force without congressional authorization the president has welcomed support from the congress in the form of legislation authorizing him to utilize us military forces in foreign conflict or engagement in support of us interests but has not taken the view that he is required to obtain such authorization what follows is brief overview of key legislative authorizations of the use of military force by the president from the administration of john adams to the present9 appendix 2 provides the complete xt of these specific authorizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs7 9 continued englewood cliffs prentice hall inc 10th

supreme court decisions the administration interprets the joint resolution to authorize any measures that can be charact erized as fundamental inci dents of the conduct of war even where such measures are otherwise prohi bited by statute at least so long as the statute in question contemplat statutory exception thus the administration has cited the joint resolution to support the pr esidents power

he would seek congressional support in the near future for action deemed necessary to deal with the theat posed to the united states by the regime of saddam hussein of iraq the president also indicated that he would speak to the united nations shor tly and set out his concerns about iraq on september 12 2002 president bush ddressed the general assembly and set out the history of iraqi misdeeds over the last two decades and the numerous times that iraq had not fulfilled its commitments to comply with various security council resolutions including di sarmament since the gulf war of 1991 he stated that the united states would work w ith the security council to deal with iraqs challenge however he emphasized that if iraq refused to fulfill its obligations to comply with security

president bush noted that by passing this legislation the congress had demonstrated that the united states speaks with one voice on the threat to international peace and security posed by iraq he added that the legislation carried an important message that iraq will either comply with all resolutions rid itself of weapons of mass destru ction and its support for terrorists or will be compelled to do so while the president noted he had sought resolution of support from congress to use force against iraq and appreciated receiving that support he also stated that my request for it did not and my signing this resolution does not constitute any change in the longstanding positions of the executive branch on either the presidents constitutional authority to use force to deter prevent or respond to aggression or other threats to us interests or on the constitutionality of the war powers resolution the president went on to state that on the important question of the threat posed by iraq his views and goals and those of the congress were the same he further observed that he had extensiv consultations with the congress in the past months and that he looked forward to continuing close consultation in the months ahead he stated his intent to submit written reports to congress every 60 days on matters relevant to this resolution48 the central element of pl 107243 is the authorization for the president to use the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states agai nst the continuing threat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq as predicates for the use of force the statute requires the president to communicate to congress his determination that the use of diplomatic and other peaceful means will not adequately protect the united states or lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations secu rity council resolutions and that the use of force is consistent with the battle against terrori sm like pl 1021 and pl 10740 the statute declares that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution it also requires the president to make periodic reports to congress on matters relevant to this joint resolution finally the statute expresses congress support for the efforts of the president to obtain prompt and decisive ac tion by the security council to enforce iraqs compliance with all releva nt security council resolutions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs21 49 in march 2003 president george w bush reported to congress the determination that was required by pl 107243 regarding his ex ercise of authority for

report rs21820public law 107243 clearly confers broa d authority on the president to use force in contrast to pl 1021 the authority granted is not limited to the implementation of previously adopted secu rity council resolutions concerning iraq but includes all relevant resolutions thus it appears to incorporate future resolutions concerning iraq that may be adopted by the security council as well as those adopted prior to the enactment of pl 107243 the authority also appears to extend beyond compelling iraqs disarmam ent to implementing the full range of concerns expressed in those resolutions unlike pl 10740 the presidents exercise of the authority granted is not dependent upon finding that iraq was associated in some direct way with the september 11 2001 attacks on the us moreover the authority conferred can be used for the broad purpose of defe nding the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq nevertheless p l 107243 is narrowe r than pl 10740 in that it limits the authorization for the use of force to iraq it also requires as predicate for the use of force that the president determine that peaceful means cannot suffice and that the use of force against iraq is consistent with the battle against terrorism49 p l 107 243 further limits the force used to that wh ich the president determines is necessary and appropriate fi nally as with pl 10740 the statutory authorization for use of force granted to the president in pl 107243 is not dependent for its exercise upon prior authorization by the security council pl 107243 does not contain explicit time requirements or call for the withdrawal of us troops by any specific date or set of crite ria presumably continued force is authorized so long as ir aq poses continuing threat to the united states and the us military presence is not inconsistent with relevant resolutions while it may be argued that the specific threats posed by iraq during saddam husseins regime th at were emphasized in the preamble to pl 107243 longer exist it seems reasonable to conc lude that the authorization to use force includes authority to use the military to occupy iraq consistent with the international law of armed conflict until new government is able to maintain control over the territory50 this conclusion is bolstered by security council resolutions adopted in the aftermath of the invasion despite the initial lack of consensus regarding the legality of the invasion the security council adopted subsequent resolutions recognizing the occupation of iraq and

the event the security council reaches an impasse on extending the mandate is less clear congress is free to alter through legislation the nature of us participation at any time implications under international law traditionally peace and war have been deemed under international law to be distinctive forms of relations between states thus peace has been defined as condition in which states maintain order and justice solve their problems by cooperation and eliminate violence it is condition in which states respect each others sovereignty and equality refrain from intervention and the threat or use of force and cooperate with one another in accordance with the treaties which they have concluded52httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs23 53 hyde charles cheney international law chiefly as

general principles governing the conduct of war as follows as soon therefore as we have declared war we have right to do against the enemy whatever we find necessary for the attainment of that end for the purpose of bringing him to reason and obt aining justice and security from him the lawfulness of the end does not give us real right to anything further than barely the means necessary for the attainment of that end whatever we do beyond that is reprobated by the law of nature is faulty and condemnable at the tribunal of conscience hence it is that the right to such or such acts of hostility varies according to circumstances what is just and perfectly innocent in war in one particular situation is not always so on other occasions right goes hand in hand with necessity and the exigency of the case but never exceeds them 56 cushman k davis treatise on international law 1901 at 141 stated war abrogates all treaties between the be lligerents its suspends all commercial intercourse and relations between their respective subjects and makes them unlawful it dissolves all partnerships between subjects of the belligerents it suspends the operation of all executory contracts during the war it open great gulf of nonintercourse between the two nations and imposes disability upon the subjects of each to do any kind of civil business with those of the other 57

declar ation of war has been deemed in and of itself to have the effect of creating state of war and changing the relationship between the states involved from one of peace to one of war that has been

contracting powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning in the form either of reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war although this treaty remains in effect for its pa rties its requirement regarding declaration of war has generally fallen into desuetude and declaration generally is

depredations or those which were on our coast for the purpose of committing depredations and they might retake an american vessel captured by such an armed vessel this statute is fair illustration of the class of laws enacted at this time they directed suspension of commercial relations until the end of the next session of congress not indefinitely they gave power to the president to apprehend the

country were open to the other an impossibility were war in progress diplomatic and commercial intercourse were admittedly suspended but during many years there was intercourse between engl and and

the nations turned into an enemy of the other in such manner that every citizen of the one became the enemy of every citizen of the other finally there was not that kind of war which abrogated treaties and wiped out at least temporarily all pending rights and contracts individual and national59 whether this traditional understanding of war and of the effect of declaration of war continues to be viable is matter of considerable dispute among scholars the right of state to initiate war many contend has been outlawed by such international agreements as the kelloggbriand peace pact and the charter of the united nations in the kelloggbriand peace pact60 for instance the parties stated that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instru ment of national policy in their relations with one another61 after world war ii the nuremberg tribunal gave teeth to this commitment by ruling that the pact rendered aggressive war illegal

waging war as well as of the general prin ciples of necessity and proportionality and brings into play the geneva conventions but its other legal consequences seemingly have become less determinate perhaps as consequence of these velopments declarations of war have fallen into disuse and are virtually ne ver issued in modern conflicts one commentator asserts that since 1945 there are cases of fo

only authorizati ons for the use of force thus declarations of war may have become anachronistic in contemporary international law the legal right of states to engage in war has seemingly become constrained for other than defensive purpos and the most salient international laws regarding the means of waging war and the protection of certain categories of persons apply to the circumstance of arme d conflict regardless of whether war has been declared that circumstance can arise in the wake of an authorization to use force as well states likely still retain right to issue declarations of war at least in exercising the right of selfdefense and such declaration seemingly would still automatically create state of war but it is not clear that the legal consequences under international law

to an authorization for the use of force implications under domestic law early american jurisprudence drew di stinction between general or perfect war and limited or imperfect war and understood declar ation of war under article i 8 of the constitution to commit the nation to general war justice washington in bas v tinghy 74 described the distinction as follows it may i believe be safely laid down that every contention by force between two nations in external matters under the authority of their respective governments is not only war but public war if it be declared in form it is called solemn and is of the perfect kind because one whole nation is at war with another whole nation and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorised to commit hostilities against all the members of the other in every place and under every circumstance in such war all the members act under general authority and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition hostilities may subsist between two nations more confined in its nature and extent being limited as to places persons and things and this is more properly termed imperfect war because not solemn and because those who are authorised to commit hostilities act under special authority and can go farther than to the extent of their commission still however it is public war because it is an external contention by force between some of the members of the two nations authorised by the legitimate powers75 justice chase more simply stated congress is empowered to declare general war or congress may wage limited war limited in place in objects and in time76 thus at least in the 18th and 19th centuries authorizations for the use of force were understood to be included within cong ress power to declare war and to have narrower legal consequences than declarati ons of war declarations were reserved for general war against particular countries and empowered the president to use the whole land and naval force of the unite d states united kingdom in 1812 to employ the militia naval and military forces of the united states mexico in 1846 or to use the entire land and naval forces of the

security council resolutions regarding iraqin the modern era authorizations have sometimes been quite broad77 and some have arguably been quivalent in scope to decl aration of war but the domestic legal consequences that flow from such authorizations still are substantially more limited than those that would flow from declaration of war both declarations of war and authoriz ations for the use of force have the effect of eliminating the time limits otherwis imposed on the presidents use of the armed forces under the war powers resolu tion and both may gitimate the killing of foreign officials that might otherwis be prohibited by the executive order on assassinations the capture of enemy combatants on the battlefield and their detention until hostilities have subsided is implied in an authorization to use ground forces just as it would be include d in formal declaration of war but declaration of war automatically brings into effect number of statutes that confer special

automatically extends enlistments in the armed forces until the end of the war can make the coast guard part of the navy gives the president substantial discretion over th appointment and reappoin tment of commanders and allows the military priority use of the na tural resources on the public lands and the continental shelf an authorization for the use of force does not automatically trigger any of these standby statutory authorities some of them can come into effect if state of war in fact comes into being after an author ization for the use of force is enacted and the great majority of them including many of the most sweeping ones can be activated if the president chooses to i ssue proclamation of national emergency but an authorization for the use of force in itself and in contrast to declaration of war does not trigger any of these standby authorities the following subsections give an ove rview of some of the more salient domestic legal consequences of declarati on of war or authorization for the use of force they are followed by section setting forth detaile d list of the standby statutory authorities that can be triggered by declaration of war state or war andor

for the use of force have si gnificant implications with respect to the war powers resolution wpr78 the wpr was enacted over president nixons veto in 1973 purportedly to restore cong ressional role in authorizing the use of force that was thought by many to have b een lost in the cold war and the vietnam war to that end the wpr mandates that the president consult with the congress in every possible instance prior to introducin g us armed forces into hostilities and regularly afterwards section 4a of the wpr further requires the president in the absence of declaration of war to re port to congress within 48 hours in any case in which united states armed forces are introduced 1 into hostilities or in to situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances 2 into the territory airspace or waters of foreign nation while equipped for combat except for deployments which relate solely to supply replacement repair or training of such forces or 3 in numbers which substantially enlarge united states armed forces equipped for combat already located in foreign nation section 5b of the resolution in turn re quires that if report has been submitted or was required to be submitted under 4a1 above the pres ident shall terminate the involvement of us forces unless congress 1 has declared war or has enacted specific authorization for such use of united states armed forces 2 has extended by law such sixtyday period or 3 is physically unable to meet as result of an armed attack upon the united states79 thus congressional enactment of either declaration of war or an authorization for the use of force pursuant to 5b has th effect of tolling the 6090 day withdrawal mandate of the wpr each of the last three authorizations for the use of force enacted the 1991 gulf war authorization the septembe r 18 2001 authorization with respect to terrorist attacks and the october 16 2002 au thorization with respect to iraq have explicitly stated that they constitute the authorization required by 5b of the wpr each in other words has tolled the 6090 day limitation that the wpr otherwise would impose on the use of military force by the president all three authorizations have further specified that nothing in this resolution supercedes any requirement of the war powers resolution that ppears to mean that the consultation and reporting requirements of the wpr still apply trading with the enemy act and the international emergency economic powers act two related statutes the trading with the enemy

to be triggered by an authorization for the use of force unless and until in the case of twea state of war actually develops other economic authorities as noted declaration of war gives the president full authority over trade relations with the enemy other statutes triggered by declaration give the president the aut hority to order plants to convert to the production of armaments and to seize

authorizes the president to deport detai n or otherwise condition the stay of alien enemies in the us in cases of decla red war or any invasion or predatory incursion perpetrated attemp ted or

presidents power to order the removal of all enemy aliens rejects the notion that courts may pass judgment upon the exercise of his discretion 101 50 usca 22aliens undelayed and unhampered by litig ation has been deemed throughout our history essential to wartime security95 the president must publicly proclaim the event that gives rise to activation of the act and make regulations regarding the treatment of those aliens but once he does so his power to appreh end restrain secure and re move enemy aliens extends to all natives citizens denizens or subjects of the hostile nation or government being of the age of fourteen years and upw ard who shall be in the united states and not actually naturalized96 the president may intern or remove enemy aliens or set lesser restraints on them nd may adopt any regulati ons which are found necessary in the premises and for the public safety97 thus president woodrow wilson for example barred alien enemies during wo rld war i from possessing firearms and explosives coming within half mile of military facility or munitions factory residing in certain areas possessing certain communications equipment and publishing certain types of materials president roosevelt authorized similar restrictions during world war ii and additionally set up over 100 community hearing boards to make internment recommendations to the attorney general98 the procedural rights of aliens who are subject to the alien enemy act are drastically restricted compared with those that aliens otherwise enjoy including hearing rights under the removal provisions of the immigration and nationality act99 the scope of judicial review is equally circumscribed100 among the few rights recognized under the act alien enemies subj ected to removal may if not chargeable with actual hostility or other crime agai nst public safety be entitled to the time allowed by applicable treaty or orde r to wind up his or her affairs here101 very limited right to judicial review under pe tition for writ of habeas corpus also is recognized generally however the power of the president to control alien enemies under the act is extraordinary as noted the act does not appear to be triggered solely by an authorization for the use of force criminal law there are number of civilian federal criminal law provisions that apply explicitly to specifi ed conduct in time of war they do not appear to distinguish between circumstances involving declaration of war and other situations in which state of war may exist absent declaration of war thus

insurance contracts another domestic legal issue implicated by declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force is their effect if any on insurance contracts particularly with respect to clauses that exclude coverage for acts of war the overwhelming characteriz ation of the events of september 11 2001 as an act of war by public officials sovereigns interna tional organizations and the media for instance caused concern that insurance companies and the courts would interpret so called war risk exclusion clauses in the pertinent insurance contracts to deny claims related to the ttacks however even declaration of war by congress does not appear to have an authoritative effect upon the construction of material terms contained in private contracts the intent of the parties not the description of congress is what is most relevant to understanding whether the events of september 11 or any future terrorist ttacks constitute acts of war within the meaning of private contracts120

wa r or of national emergency declared by congress and allows reserve forces to be called to active duty for the duration of the war or national emergency and for six months thereafter the standby reserve as di stinguished from the ready reserve and selected reserve forces can only be ca lled to active service under the authority conferred by section 12301 see section 12306 while the retired

called to active service under sections 12301 12302 and 12304 this m eans that when persons have been called to active service for the duration under the authority conferred by section 12301 otherwise applicable rules concer ning promotions retirements and separations may not apply t hus for all of these sections declaration of war is not necessary predicate but it can trigger the application of s

directs in the declaration or when the president directs the coast guard sha ll operate as service in the navy 130 thus congressional declaration of war is not indispensable to bring the coast guard under the control of the navy but it would have that effect tax provisions there are several provisions of the internal revenue code which apply to taxpayers involved directly or indirectly with war congressional declaration of war is not needed to re nder any of these provisions applicable perhaps the most significant relevant provision of the internal revenue code is section 112 under which some or all of the pay received by members of the uniformed services for activ service in combat zone is excluded from gross income ie is received taxfree the term combat zone is specially defined for purposes of this rule and means an area so designated by the president of the united states in an executive order and such an executive order must be issued to make the tax exemption apply reference is made in this provision to any declaration by congress of the existence of state of war and by its expre ss terms it applied to service in the korean and vietnam conflicts the pay of pows and those listed as missing in action is also exempt see irc 112dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs44 131 for list of periods of war see crs report rs21405 periods of war by barbara salazar torreon for

designated under irc 112 or who dies as result of wounds disease or injury suffered in such combat zone see irc 2201 an exemption from federal income tax for the current taxable year and the preceding taxable year is allowed under irc 692 for member of the armed forces who dies in combat zone design ated under irc 112 or who dies as result of wounds disease or injury suffered in ch combat zone and such an exemption is also allowed in the case of civilian federal employee killed in any military action involving the united states see irc 692 special rules for spouses of persons w ho become missing in action also appear in the code see irc 2a3 and 6013 disability and death subchapter ii of chapter 11 of title 38 of the united states code 38 usc 1110 et seq relates to wartime disability compensation relevant disability must result from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active military naval or air service during period of war131 thus there is explicit requirement of congressional declaration of war on the other hand such declaration would obvious ly assure that the particular period of hostilities in question is indeed period of war some

procedures for declaring war or authorizing the use of force the following section discusses how c ongress would act on joint resolution or bill to declare war or authorize the use of force if the house and senate were to consider that measure under the regular pro cedures of each house it also describes how measure declaring war or authorizing the use of force would be considered under the procedures contained in the war powers resolution of 1973141 regular procedures the senates published precedents do not suggest that measure proposing to declare war or authorize the use of force if considered outside the framework of the war powers resolution woul d be immune from the potentia lly laborious process to which other bills and joint resolutions are subject except those that benefit from special expedited procedures under rulemak ing statutes for example joint resolution declaring war or authorizing th use of force presumably would not be eligible for immediate floor cons ideration at the time it is intr oduced and it presumably would be subject to possible delays resulting from the senators exercise of their right to debate at length similarly the precedents of the house apparently do not grant privilege to joint resolution declaring war or authorizin g the use of force either under the leave to report authority that house rules nd precedents give to certain house committees or as question of the privileges of the h ouse concerning the latter former house parliamentarian wm holmes brown has observed that rule ix on questions of privilege is concerned not with the privilege s of the congress as legislative branch but only with the privileges of the house itself thus neither the enumeration of legislative powers in article i sec 8 of the constitution nor the prohibition of thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs78 142 wm holmes brown house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house washington us govt print off 1996 p 692 143 the house floor discussion on april 4 1917 concerning procedures for considering hjres 24 supports this interpretation by implicationarticle against any withdrawal from the treasury except by enactment of an appropriation renders measure purportin g to exercise or limit those powers question of the privileges of the house142 because joint resolution declaring war or authorizing the use of force proposes to exercise constitutional power of the congress as legislative branch not of the house alone it would seem therefore not to qualify as question of privilege if so the house would consider the joint resolution according to its established procedures for dealing with other legislative measures143 unless the proposed declaration or authorization were to be considered under the terms of the war powers resolution congress has adopted eight declarations of war during the 20th century two at the outset of us involvement in world war i and six in the course of world war ii house and senate consid eration of the initial declarations in each of these wars is illustrative of the process that cong ress followed on both occasions the house and senate acted to declare war in res ponse to urgent presidential requests made personally before joint sessions of congress in light of the importance that most members attached to these requests it is not surprising that in both cases the two houses acted on the joint resolutions quickly and without following all their regular legislative procedures by way of illustration the following is brief summary of how the house and senate considered the in itial joint resolutions to declare war in 1917 and 1941 world war i congress convened on apr il 2 1917 and on that evening president wilson addressed both houses to re quest that congress declare war against germany immediately after the presidents address senator martin introduced sjres 1 to declare war which was referred to the committee on foreign relations also on april 2 representative flood introduced companion resolution hjres 24 which was referred to the committee on foreign affairs the senate committee reported sjres 1 with an amendment on the following day senator lafollette objected to nimous consent request that the senate consider the measure immediately consequently the joint resolution had to lie over for day pursuant to paragraph 4a of senate rule xvii on april 4 the senate agreed by unanimous consent to consid er the joint resolution agreed to the committee amendment and after considerable debate passed the joint resolution by roll call vote of 826 the house committee reported hjres 24 on april 4 and the house then agreed by unanimous consent to consid er the measure on the following day under the general rules of the house becau the joint resolution once reported was placed on the union calendar the general rules of the house required that it be considered in committee of the whole consequently when the house convened onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs79 144 these expedited procedures are ambiguous in several respects the description presented here should not be considered substitute for consultations with the house or senate parliamentarian 145 other examples of rulemaking provisi ons of law are the various congressional continuedapril 5 representative flood moved that the house resolve into committee of the whole to consider hjres 24 before the house agreed to his motion however it also agreed to representative floods nimous consent request that the house instead consider sjres 1 which the sena already had passed after much debate and after rejecting two amendments in committee of the whole and motion to recommit with instructions in the house the house passed sj res 1 by roll call vote of 37350 world war ii on december 8 1941 president roosevelt addressed joint session of congress and asked for declara tion of war against japan immediately after the joint session ende d the senate reconvened and following live quorum call senator connolly introduced joint resolution declaring war at senator connollys request and by unanimous consen t the senate agreed to consider the joint resolution immediately without committ ee consideration within minutes and after brief statements by senators conno lly and vandenberg th senate passed the joint resolution by roll call vote of 820 also immediately after the presidents address the house acted by considering and agreeing to representative mccormacks motion to suspend the rules and pass hjres 254 which representative mccorm ack introduced at that time december 8 being monday suspension motions were in order on that day immediately after the house passed hjres 254 by roll call vote of 3881 the house received message from the senate that it already d passed its joint re solution now numbered sj res 116 the house then agreed to representative mccormacks unanimous consent request that the house take the senate joint resolution from the speakers table and agree to it this action was n ecessary in order for both houses to pass the same measure making it eligible to be presented to the president for his signature congressional procedures under the war powers resolution enactment of the war powers resolu tion in november 1973 created special expedited procedures by which the house and senate can act on joint resolutions or bills to declare war or authorize the use of force if those measures are considered in accordance with the other related provisions of that law144 these expedited procedures were enacted into law as part of the war powers resolution as an exercise of the constitutional rulemaking powers of the house and senate article i of the constitution empowers each house to set its own rules when congress enacts into law provisions th at affect only the internal operations of the house or senate or both those provi sions are known as rulemaking provisions of law that are enacted pursuant to this gr ant of power under article i such rule making provisions have exactly the same force and effect as provisions contained in the standing rules of the house and senate145 consequently the house to whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs80 145 continued procedures enacted as part of the cong ressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 and related laws and the

adopt special rule or the senate could agree to unanimous consent request that would supersede some or all of the proce dures described here section 4a of the war powers resolu tion directs the president to submit report to congress within 48 hours after u s armed forces are introduced into hostilities or into situations where imminen t involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances146 section 5a provides for the receipt and for the referral to committee of any such presiden tial report under section 5b the president is required to terminate use of the armed forces within 60 calendar days 90 days in some circumstances after submitting his report unless congress takes any one of several actions one of these actions is to declare war another is to enact specific authorization for such use of unite d states armed forces as an alternative to declaring war under another secti on of the war powers resolution congress can also adopt bill or joint resolution at any time requiring the president to remove the armed forces unless declaration of wa r or statutory authorization has been enacted147 section 6 of the war powers resolution contains the expedited or fasttrack procedures that were included in the law to enable the house and senate to act within the 60 calendarday period on bill or joint resolution contemplated by section 5b148 if under section 6a such measure is introduced at least 30 calendar days before the end of the 60day period the meas ure is referred to the house international relations committee or the senate foreign relations committee as the case may be that committee is required to report one such measure with its recommendations not later than 24 calendar days before th end of the 60day period this provision suggests that the committee can report th measure with the committees proposed amendments if any the subsection also provides that its provisions are to govern unless such house shall othe rwise determine by the yeas and nays in other words the house or senate can by rollcall vote decided by simple majority release its committee from the obligation to report meas ure proposing to declare war or to take some other action enumer ated in section 5b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs81 if the house or senate committee does report it is not required to report the measure favorably instead it may report it unfavorably or w ithout recommendation but what if either the senate or house committee fails to report covered bill or joint resolution within the time permitted the senate parliamentarian has stated that the senate foreign relations committee would be automatically discharged if it failed to report as required by this subsection the house parliamentar ian has stated that should the house international relations committee fail to report in timely manner privileged motion to discharge that committee would be in order on the house floor section 6b governs initial house and senate floor consideration of joint resolution reported from committee pursuant to section 6a under section 6b the bill or joint resolution once reported or once the comm ittee is discharged shall become the pending business of the house or senate as the case may be by making covered measure the pending bus iness on the house or senate floor the war powers resolution evidently makes the measure privileged for floor consideration in the house without the need for the rules committee to report special rule for that purpos or obviates the need for motion that usually is debatable to proceed to the measures cons ideration in the senate because section 6b contains provisions to the cont rary the measure presumably would be amendable on the floor of either house to the same extent as any other b ill or joint resolution that house consider s or could be tabled section 6b goes on to require that the house or senate vote on final passage of the measure within three calendar days after having become the pending business unless such house shall othe rwise determine by yeas and nays the effect of this subsection probably is more significant for the senate than the house because it is designed to preclude filibuster on the nate floor in add ition the last provision of the subsection evidently gives either house options to adjust the timing and length of floor consideration by adopting any of several conceivable motions by rollcall vote for example either house might ag ree by motion to postpone consideration of the measure to date certain alterna tively either house might dispose of the measure by rollcall vote in favor of motion to table or recommit it or to postpone its consideration indefinitely under the same authority the house or senate also might be able to shorten the debate to less than three calendar days or to extend the time for debate sections 6c and 6d address the pr ocess for the house and senate to reach agreement when each has passed measure covered by section 5b in summary section 6c provides for expedited co mmittee and floor action in one house on covered measure that the ot her house already has passed finally section 6d states that if conference is necessary to reach compromise between house and senate versions of covered measure the confer ees are to be appointed promptly the conferees are to report in either agreem ent or disagreement within specified time periods and the two houses are to act on th conference report before the end of the 60day period these last two subsections raise the probl em that rules or rulemaking statute can compel the house and senate to reach agreement all that expedited procedures can do is to require that the conferees re port and that the house and senate act on their report by time certain the war powers resolution cannot ensure that bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs82 houses will agree on the same position by th end of the 60day period if the two houses were unable to agree by the end of the 60 days that situation presumably would be reflected in 1 votes by one or both houses to reject conference report in agreement or 2 votes by both houses to agree to conference report in disagreement in other words votes in each house to accept the report of the conferees that they were unable to reach agreement within the time allotted them in either case there is nothing in the st atute that would precl ude the two houses from appointing new conference committee that might present new conference report in agreement at some later date however conference report filed in the senate after the expiration of the 60day period might well be subject to extended debate because presumably consideration of th report longer would be governed by section 6 instead the report would be considered under the senates regular procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs83 appendix 1 texts of formal declarations of war by the united states war with great britain 1812 act of jun

october 16 2002 hjres 114 to authorize the use of united st ates armed forces against iraq whereas in 1990 in response to iraqs war of aggression against and illegal occupation of kuwait the united states forged coalition of nations to liberate kuwait and its people in order to defend the national security of the united states and enforce united nations security c ouncil resolutions relating to iraq whereas after the liberation of kuwa it in 1991 iraq entered into united nations sponsored ceasefire agreement pursuant to which iraq unequivocally agreed among other things to eliminate its nuc lear biological and chemical weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them and to end its support for international terrorism whereas the efforts of internationa l weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical wea pons and large scale biolog ical weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear w eapons development program that was much closer to producing nuclear weapon th an intelligence reporting had previously indicated whereas iraq in direct and flagrant violation of the ceasefire attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors to identify and destroy iraqs weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and development capabilities which finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from iraq on october 31 1998 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31133crs106 whereas in public law 105235 aug ust 14 1998 congress concluded that iraqs continuing weapons of mass destru

president to take appropriate acti on in accordance with the constituti on and relevant laws of the united states to bring iraq into compliance with its international obligations whereas iraq both poses continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively s eeking nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring rrorist organizations whereas iraq persists in violating resolution of the united nations security council by continuing to engage in brutal repression of its ci vilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region by refusing to release repatriate or account for non iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by iraq including an american serviceman and by failing to return property wrongfully seized by iraq from kuwait whereas the current iraqi regime has demonstrated its capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction agai nst other nations and its own people whereas the current iraqi regime has demonstrated its continuing hostility toward and willingness to ttack the united states including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former president bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the united nations security council whereas members of qaida an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the united states its citizens and interests including the attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 are known to be in iraq whereas iraq continues to aid and harbor other intern ational terrorist organizations including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of united states citizens whereas the attacks on the united st ates of september 11 2001 underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the ac quisition of weapons of mass destruction by international terrorist organizations whereas iraqs demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction the risk that the current iraq i regime will either employ those weapons to launch surprise attack against the ited states or its armed forces or provide them to international terrorists who woul d do so and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the united states and its citizens from such an attack combine to justify action by the united states to defend itself whereas united nations security counc il resolution 678 1990 authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce united nations secur ity council resolution 660 1990 and subsequent rele vant resolutions and to compel iraq to cease certain activities that threaten international peace and security including the development of weapons of mass

use of military force against iraq resolution public law 1021 that iraqs repression of its civilian population violates united nations secur ity council resoluti on 688 and constitutes continuing threat to the peace security and stability of the persian gulf region and that congress supports the use of ll necessary means to achieve the goals of united nations security council resolution 688 whereas the iraq liberation act of 1998 public law 105338 expressed the sense of congress that it should be the polic of the united states to support efforts to remove from power the current iraqi regime and promote the emergence of democratic government to replace that regime whereas on september 12 2002 president bush committed the united states to work with the united nations secur ity council to meet our common challenge posed by iraq and to work for the necessa ry resolutions while also making clear that the security council resolutions will be enforced and the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable whereas the united states is determined to prosecute the war on terrorism and iraqs ongoing support for international terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under the 1991 ceasefire and other united nations security council resolutions make clear that it is in the national security interests of the united states and in furtherance of the war on terro rism that all relevant ited nations security council resolutions be enforced including th rough the use of force if necessary whereas congress has take n steps to pursue vigorously the war on terrorism through the provision of aut horities and funding requested by the president to take the necessary
