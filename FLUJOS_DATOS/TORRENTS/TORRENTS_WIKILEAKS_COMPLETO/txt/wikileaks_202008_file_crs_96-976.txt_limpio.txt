activity during the 105th congress although many members of congress and many aging organizations were concerned about the delay in enactment of reauthorization legislation ultimately the 105th congress did not take final action the controversy raised by certain proposals in the 104th congress bills and devising ways to modify approaches to these proposals were major factors in the delay in

labor and human resources committee which has responsibility for the act did not introduce legislation in the 105th congress by early summer 1998 some members of congress were concerned that there appeared to be action on reauthorization in response to rising criticism from constituents and constituent organizations about the lack of action two bills were introduced that would have reauthorized the act through fy2001 senator mccain introduced s 2295 on july 13 1998 and representative defazio introduced companion bill hr 4344 on july 29 1998 the bills would have simply reauthorized the act and made substantive program changes they received substantial congressional support s 2295 had 67 cosponsors and hr 4344 had 188 cosponsors other reauthorization proposals were introduced these were s 390 older americans act amendments of 1997 mikulski and hr 1671 older americans act amendments of 1997 martinez these bills were similar to the reauthorization proposals suggested by the administration during the 104th congress they differed from hr 4099 and bills reported by the house and senate committees during the 104th congress in number of ways for example they would not have consolidated authorizations of appropriations for the acts programs nor would have made major structural changes in the community service employment program other 105th congress bills include s 948 grassleyhr 2167 schumer the pension assistance and counseling act of 1997 these bills would have amended the research training and demonstration program authorized under title iv of the act to create tollfree telephone number for individuals who are seeking information and assistance regarding pension and other retirement benefits among other things the house education and the workforce committee held reauthorization hearings on the act on july 9 and 16 1997 the subcommittee received testimony from administration officials and representatives of state and area agencies on aging services providers and indian tribal organizations issues in reauthorization the following discusses issues that have been raised as part of the reauthorization process crs3 consolidation and restructuring of older americans act programs similar to the 104th congress house and senate committee reported bills hr 4099 would have consolidated and restructured certain older americans act programs and given more flexibility to states in the operation of aging service programs current law authorizes 20 separate programs under the act although some have never been funded hr 4099 would have reduced the number of separately authorized programs to eight while the bill proposed major changes in the structure of the act it would have preserved core functions of the state and area agency on aging programs under title iii these include responsibilities of these agencies to plan and coordinate service programs on behalf of older persons and to advocate for programs and services on their behalf current law requirements that state and area agencies develop state and area plans on aging taking into consideration the needs of older persons with the greatest social and economic need would have remained intact similar to the 104th congress legislation hr 4099 would have eliminated number of specific plan requirements that were viewed as burdensome to state and area agencies hr 4099 would have consolidated the authorization of appropriations for the congregate and homedelivered nutrition programs now under two separate authorities under this approach states would have received one allotment of funds for congregate and homedelivered meals but would have been expected to assess the need for both types of nutrition services there appeared to be consensus around this issue in the 104th congress the bill would have retained separate authorization of appropriations for the us department of agriculture portion of the nutrition program one aspect of proposals to consolidate programs remained controversial at the end of the 104th congress the house committeeapproved bill would have eliminated separate authorization of appropriations for the longterm care ombudsman program and elder abuse prevention services and separate title for elder rights activities some aging advocates feared that these proposals would have jeopardized funding for elder rights activities unlike the 104th congress house committeereported bill and in response to concern about its approach hr 4099 would have retained separate authorization of appropriations for the longterm care ombudsman program and for elder abuse remediation under new title iv table 1 lists programs separately authorized under current law and in hr 4099 table 2 presents fy1999 appropriations for older americans act

authorized under title v of the act provides opportunities for parttime employment in community service activities for unemployed lowincome older persons who have poor employment prospects the program is funded at 440 million in fy1999 representing 30 of older americans act funds it is administered by the department of labor dol which awards funds directly to national sponsoring organizations4 and to states hr 4099 would have made changes in 1 the distribution of funds by the federal government 2 formula allocations to grantees and 3 requirements regarding use of funds by grantees for enrollee wages and fringe benefits administration and other enrollee costs like the 104th congress committee reported bills hr 4099 would have restructured the program in part to respond to 1995 general accounting office gao report that report reviewed certain administrative issues related to the program including dols method of awarding funds formula allocation of funds and grantee use of funds5 hr 4099 would have given states more control of the administration of the program and introduced competition for funds among prospective grantee organizations in addition hr 4099 would have retained the community service employment program as separate older americans act title and retained dol as the federal administrative authority the 104th congress legislation would have eliminated the separate title and moved the program to aoa distribution of community service employment funds by the federal government currently 78 of funds are awarded by dol directly to 10 national organizations on noncompetitive basis 22 of funds is distributed to states the 104th congress bills would have transferred all funds now administered by national organizations to states in contrast hr 4099 would have transferred only portion of funds now administered by national organizations to states so that by fy2003 50 of total funds would have been distributed to national organizations and 50 to states the national organizations share of total funds would have decreased from 78 of the total to 50 by fy2003 and the states share would have increased from 4 the 10 national organizations are american association of retired persons asociacion nacional personas mayores green thumb national asian pacific center on aging national center and caucus on the black aged national council on aging national council of senior citizens national indian council on aging national urban league and the us forest service 5 general accounting office senior community service employment program delivery could be improved through legislative and administrative actions gaohehs964 november 1995 crs8 22 to 506 in addition the bill would have required that funds to national organizations be awarded on competitive basis this approach is in part based on goal of reducing the number of national organizations that operate in each state and of giving states more control in the administration and coordination of the program national organizations receive funds to administer the program in all but three states in many states multiple national organizations administer programs in addition to designated state agency some state agencies have been concerned about the duplication of national organizations activities that affect the distribution of employment positions within state in its report gao noted that there is inequitable distribution of funding within some states as well as duplication of effort among national and state sponsors proponents of the approach to equalize funds for national organizations and states indicate that costs of program administration and duplication of effort within states would decrease since there would be fewer organizations that would administer the program in some states proponents also say that giving states more leverage in funding decisions would increase coordination of effort among all grantees in states the restructuring of the senior community service employment program generated substantial controversy during the 104th congress some existing national grantees expressed concern that their continued existence would be threatened if more program funding were to be shifted to states and if states rather than the federal government were to make decisions about which organizations would be grantees they were also concerned that restructuring could result in disruption of jobs for some existing enrollees7 number of organizations and some members of 6 despite requirements in the authorizing statute that states are to receive larger portion of funds appropriations law for many years has stipulated that 78 of funds be distributed to national organizations and 22 to states this has been longstanding issue in the 1978 reauthorization of the older americans act the senate labor and human resources committee expressed concern about thecircumvention by the appropriations committee of the authorizing committee formula in more recent action on the funding split for fy1997 the house appropriations committee proposed to increase the amount of funding allocated to states to 35 of the total thereby reducing funds to national organizations to 65 this action was taken in part based on recognition that the house authorizing committee was moving toward transferring all title v funding to the states however in final action on fy1997 appropriations pl 104208 congress continued to stipulate the 7822 split for national organizations and states as it has done in the past 7 the modifications to the program were debated during markup of the bills by the house eeo committee and the senate labor and human resources committee in the 104th congress with certain members of the committees voicing objections to the proposed restructuring some members were concerned about the bills approach to completely turn over the program to the states and that such transition could be disruptive to enrollees there was also concern that there would be loss of the national organizations expertise in administering the program an amendment to s 1643 to maintain direct award of funding to national organizations by the federal government offered by senator mikulski during the labor and human resources committee markup was not approved senator mikulski stated that the continued crs9 congress indicated that the program has operated well under the national organizations administration and that because of the longstanding association of some of the organizations with the program they have expertise to continue administering the majority of funds formula allocations to grantees tile v funding is distributed to national organizations and states using combination of factors including hold harmless for employment positions held by national organizations in each state in 1978 and formula based on states relative share of persons aged 55 and over and per capita income in fy1998 57 of funds were distributed according to the hold harmless provision 252 million out of 4402 million for july 1 1998june 30 1999 program year the balance is distributed according to each states relative population of persons aged 55 and over and per capita income because the hold harmless provision is based on 1978 statebystate distribution of positions held by national organizations it does not ensure equitable distribution of funds based on relative measures of age and per capita income in its report on the program gao recommended that if congress wishes to ensure equitable distribution of funds it should consider eliminating or amending the hold harmless provision the formula in hr 4099 builds upon the current methodology but it would have moved the hold harmless amount to 1998 the bill would have required that funds for fy1999fy2003 be distributed to states based on the share of funds they received in fy1998 any funds appropriated in excess of the fy1998 level would have been distributed on the basis of states relative share of persons age 55 and over and per capita income funds would have then been distributed to national organizations and to state agencies as described above use of funds for enrollee wagesfringe benefits administration and other enrollee costs currently funds are used for 1 enrollee wages and fringe benefits 2 administration and 3 other enrollee costs dol regulations require that at least 75 of funds be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits the law specifies that grantees are allowed to use up to 135 of federal funds for administration and up to 15 in certain circumstances any remaining funds may be used for other enrollee costs that under current dol regulations may include recruitment and orientation of enrollees and supportive services for enrollees among other things in its review gao found that most national organizations and some state sponsors had budgeted administrative costs in excess of the statutory limit by inappropriately classifying them as other enrollee costs hr 4099 would have established new minimum amount of grant funds that must be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits specify limit on other enrollee costs and redefine such costs first it would have required that minimum of 85 of grantees funds be used for enrollee wages and fringe benefits compared to 75 in dol regulations of these funds up to 5 could be used for 7 continued restructuring of the title v program would be revisited when s 1643 reached the senate floor similar amendment was proposed by representative kildee during the markup of hr 2570 but was also rejected by the eeo committee crs10 other enrollee costs the bill would have defined these as costs for employment related counseling supportive services and transportation this approach was designed to limit funds for administration by prohibiting funds categorized as other enrollee costs to be used for administration the bill would have retained the same limit on administrative costs as in current law that is up to 135 of grantees funds with waiver up to 15 if approved by the secretary under this approach grantees would have paid for enrollee assessments and training from their administrative costs performance standards hr 4099 would have required the secretary of labor to publish regulations establishing performance standards8 the standards would have included requirements that at least 20 of participants are placed in unsubsidized employment and that they remain in unsubsidized jobs for at least 4 months after placement there be specific percentage reduction in participants dependency on public assistance as result of program participation specific percentage of participants receive employment and training through other federal state and local training programs and there be specific percentage increase in employment opportunities in underserved areas the bill also specifies penalties and adjustment to grants if grantees fail to meet the standards interstate funding formula for supportive and nutrition services the way in which aoa distributes nutrition and supportive funds to states continued to be at issued during the 105th congress as it had during the 104th congress current law requires the administration on aging aoa to distribute title iii funds for supportive and nutrition services to states based on their relative share of the population aged 60 and older in addition to specifying certain minimum funding amounts the law contains hold harmless provision requiring that state receive less than it received in fy1987 aoa distributes funds for supportive and nutrition services in the following way first states are allotted funds in an amount equal to their fy1987 allocations which were based on estimates of states relative share of the total us population in 19859 second the balance of the appropriation is allotted to states based on their relative share of the population aged 60 and over as derived from the most recently 8 development of performance standards for the program was also discussed during the 104th congress during markup of the senate bill by the committee on labor and human resources senator mikulski introduced an amendment that would have established certain performance standards for the program 9 there is usually twoyear time lag in availability of estimates of state population from the us census bureau therefore for example 1998 funding allotments relied on 1996 state population estimates crs11 available estimates of state population and third state allotments are adjusted to assure that the minimum grant requirements are met the effect of this methodology is that the majority of funds are distributed according to population estimates that do not reflect the most recent population trends for example for fy1998 84 of total title iii funds were distributed according to the fy1987 hold harmless the remainder of funds appropriated was distributed according to 1996 population data the method that aoa uses to meet the 1987 hold harmless provision has received some scrutiny in 1994 report gao concluded that title iii funds are not distributed according to the requirements of the statute10 gao concluded that the method employed by aoa does not distribute funds proportionately according to states relative share of the older population based on the most recent population data and therefore negatively affects states whose older population is growing faster than others gao recommended that aoa revise its method to allot funds to states first on the basis of the most current population estimates and then adjust the allotments to meet the hold harmless and statutory minimum requirements hr 4099 would have followed the gao recommendation by requiring that funds be distributed first according to the most recent data on states relative share of persons 60 years and older the bill then stipulated that state would receive less than it received in fy1998 thereby creating 1998 hold harmless requirement the intent of this approach was to have more of total funding distributed according to the most recent population data as total funding increases over the fy1998 level but at the same time assuring that states allotments would not go below their fy1998 levels the actual effect of this approach in fy1999 would have been that states would have generally received approximately the same amount as they received in fy1998 because funding for nutrition and supportive services did not increase between those years hr 4099 differed from the 104th congress house committeereported bill which would have gradually eliminated the 1987 hold harmless requirement over period of years some states were concerned about this approach indicating that without hold harmless provision they would have lost funds hr 4099s hold harmless provision may have ameliorated concerns of some states that would have lost funds under the 104th congress bill11 targeting of services to lowincome minority older persons targeting of services to lowincome minority older persons continued to be subject of review during the 105th congress as it has during past reauthorizations of the act current law contains numerous requirements that state and area agencies 10 us general accounting office older americans act title iii funds not distributed according to statute gaohehs9437 january 1994 11 the senate committeeapproved bill would have taken different approach to changing the formula it would have based allotments for supportive and nutrition services on two factors composite measure that attempts to capture the relative size of states relative elderly inneed ein percentage and measure of states relative total taxable resources compared to the states relative ein crs12 on aging target services to persons in greatest social and economic need with particular attention on lowincome minority older persons it also requires that the agencies set specific objectives for serving lowincome minority older persons and that program development advocacy and outreach efforts be focused on these groups service providers are required to meet specific objectives set by area agencies for providing services to lowincome minority older persons and area agencies are required to describe in their area plans how they have met these objectives the house bill as introduced in the 104th congress would have retained requirements that the title iii program focus on older persons who have the greatest social and economic need but would have deleted number of provisions on specific targeting on lowincome minority older persons that are in current law these deletions were debated during markup of the bill by the eeo committee an amendment to the bill that would have restored certain targeting requirements contained in current law was rejected hr 4099 contains targeting provisions that are similar to those contained in the th 104 congress house committeereported bill but also contains other references that were not in the committeereported bill it would have required that 1 state agencies develop formula to distribute funds within the state taking into account the geographical distribution of older individuals with greatest social or economic need 2 preference be given to providing services to older individuals with greatest social and economic need with particular attention to lowincome minority older individuals 3 state and area agencies evaluate the need for services by older individuals with the greatest social and economic need with particular attention to lowincome older individuals and 4 state and area agencies conduct outreach to older individuals with the greatest social and economic need and to lowincome older individuals the bill did not contain all references to lowincome minority older individuals that are in current law therefore the targeting issue continued to be debated during the 105th congress costsharing for services by older persons one of the most frequent issues to arise in past reauthorization legislation has been whether the act should allow mandatory cost sharing for certain social services under current law and regulations mandatory fees are prohibited but nutrition and supportive services providers are allowed to solicit voluntary contributions from older persons toward the costs of services older persons may not be denied service because they will not or cannot make contribution funds collected through voluntary contributions are to be used to expand services in the past congress has resisted any attempts to allow older americans act programs to charge fees for services hr 4099 would have allowed states to apply cost sharing to most title iii services on sliding scale basis it would have prohibited cost sharing for certain services these are information and assistance outreach benefits counseling case management and ombudsman and other protective services it would have prohibited states from imposing cost sharing on individuals with low income as crs13 defined by the state but lower than 125 of the federal poverty level and would have required that incomes of older persons be determined on selfdeclaration basis it would have prohibited states from denying older persons services because of an inability to pay and would have continued to allow older persons to make voluntary contributions for services as under current law this costsharing provision is the same as that in the 104th house committeeapproved bill the administrations bill for the 104th congress also proposed new provision on costsharing it contained some of the same elements as the house and senatecommittee approved bills but would have also exempted nutrition services from costsharing state and area agencies on aging have been in favor of policy that would allow them to impose cost sharing for certain services arguing in part that such policy would eliminate barriers to coordination with other statefunded services programs that do require cost sharing and would improve targeting of services to those most in need some representatives of aging services programs such as those representing minorityethnic elderly have been opposed to cost sharing arguing in part that mandatory cost sharing policy would discourage participation by lowincome and minority older persons and would create welfare stigma in the 1987 and 1992 reauthorizations of the act congress considered but ultimately rejected proposals to change the current voluntary contributions policy for other versions of this
