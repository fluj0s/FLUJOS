to guarantee minimum of 075 as required by section 1014 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 of total appropriations for shsgp and letpp to each state dc and puerto rico each us insular area is guaranteed 025 minimum of total appropriations hr 1 proposes to amend section 1014 of the usa patriot act and reduce the minimum guaranteed amount from 075 to 025 for states without international boundaries dc

dcs and us insular areas proportion of the total national and us insular area population12 risk and anticipated effectiveness as noted above risk and effectiveness will be the primary tool for distributing funds to the states and insular areas state and local risk will be determined by dhs using risk and anticipated effectiveness formula developed by the office for grants and training renamed the office of grant programs in january 2007 in conjunction with other dhs and federal entities distribution of shsgp letpp and uasi funding will be based on this risk and effectiveness formula the specific formula however is not publicly available at this time and may not be available in the future due to its possible security classification more generally dhs has indicated that risk calculations are based upon the following threat the likelihood of an attack occurring and vulnerability and consequence the relative exposure and expected impact of an attack13 the risk model dhs intends to use to allocate shsgp letpp and uasi funds will incorporate the potential risk of terrorism to people critical infrastructure and economic sectors for these risk assessments dhs will use population in geographic areas at possible risk population density and specific location characteristics that might contribute to risk when considering threat dhs intends to use the us intelligence communitys threat assessments for identifying potential targets dhs plans to identify vulnerability and consequence by considering the expected impact of successful terrorist attacks occurring at specific geographic locations to people economic sectors and national critical infrastructure and national security facilities risk assessments of individual applicants will be worth

investment justifications will be scored through peer review process which was begun for fy2006 the office of grant programs intends to provide additional assistance during the application period to states and urban areas as they develop their justifications which would include applicants submitting draft justifications to the office of grant programs prior to final submission anticipated effectiveness will be worth onethird of their final application score17 hr 1 the bill proposes to allocate hsgp funding excluding mmrs and ccp18 in the following manner from shsgp and letpp programs dhs would allocate 100 of funds based on an analysis of risk and anticipated effectiveness each grant applicant states dc and puerto rico without an international border will receive minimum of 025 of total appropriations applicants states with an international border or bordering body of water with an international boundary will receive minimum of 045 and us insular areas 008 if state dc puerto rico or us insular area were to have an urban area that receives uasi grant award that award would be incorporated into the amount used to determine if the state or insular area meets the required minimum from the uasi program each eligible urban area is to receive grant based on dhss determination of risk and anticipated effectiveness19 specifically hr 1 proposes to require the dhs secretary to evaluate and prioritize grant applications based on the degree to which the application would achieve maintain or enhance applicant homeland security capabilities lessen the vulnerability and consequences to people including transient commuting and tourist populations and critical infrastructure the evaluations and prioritization would be based upon current risk assessments20 hr 1 requires

nations population fy2007 hsgp program guidance and application kit program guidance and application kit crs12 estimating shsgp and letpp grant allocations for fy2007 under hr 1 and s 4 the previous sections of this report described the dhs programs and the departments methods for allocating grants in fy2006 and fy2007 for the shsgp and letpp programs grants that are not to be less than statutorily set minimums22 moreover hr 1 as passed by the house and s 4 as passed by the senate would both lower the minimums that are currently in effect for those two programs question that immediately arises is how those changes would affect total shsgp and letpp grant amounts that the states the district of columbia puerto rico and the insular areas can expect to receive answering that question precisely however is not feasible because dhs does not disclose the risk and effectiveness scores it assigns to the applications it evaluates accordingly any effort to calculate rough estimates of grant amounts for fy2007 under the current statutory minimum as interpreted by dhs program guidance and under hr 1 or s 4 proposed minimums must make three fundamental assumptions23 assumption 1 dhs risk and effectiveness scores for each applicant for fy2007 and under hr 1 and s 4 will equal those for fy2006 this assumption is valid only to the extent that the determinants of risk and effectiveness that pertain to each applicant and the dhs scoring system do not significantly vary from one year to the next assumption 2 proxy for each grant recipients undisclosed risk and effectiveness score in fy2006 can be found in the ratio of the amount of the recipients fy2006 total grant that was based on risk and effectiveness to b the sum of risk and effectiveness amounts for all recipients in other words if one assumes that if recipient received 5 of the total funds available for allocation on the basis of risk and effectiveness in fy2006 then that recipient will receive 5 of the total funds available for allocation on the basis of risk and effectiveness in fy2007 and under hr 1 and s 4 assumption 3 the total appropriation for fy2007 for the shsgp and letpp programs was 900 million in order to estimate grants under the provisions of hr 1 one assumes the same total appropriation of 900 million for whatever fiscal year congressionally enacted and presidentially approved hr 1 were to go into effect 22 as described earlier in the report in fy2006 each state and the territories received base amount calculated by formula states then received an additional allocation based on potential risk and effectiveness the effectiveness as judged by peer review of each jurisdictions risk mitigation strategy was used to adjust the amount of the riskbased portion of the total allocation thus some states received more or less than they would have under the fy2005 formula which was based only on population an admittedly imperfect indicator of risk for fy2007 however dhs has decided to allocate grants first on the basis of risk and effectiveness and then to adjust the subminimum grants upwards as of this writing the department had not identified its method for reducing grants greater than the minimum so as not to exceed the appropriated amount 23 this is but one option for making the estimates other approaches may yield other results crs13 caveat as with all assumptionbased estimates the estimates that are presented in the following discussion should be interpreted carefully and used with great caution actual grant allocations will almost certainly differ from the estimates presented here calculating the estimates estimating grants for each eligible recipient involves the following steps the results of which are shown in tables 2 3 4 and 5 1 establish the proxies for risk and effectiveness table 2 col g 2 allocate the total available 900 million 913180500 for s 4 in proportion to the proxies 3 when recipients risk and effectiveness allocation is less than the statutory minimum allocate an additional amount to reach the minimum tables 3 4 and 5 col c recipients of additional amount are shown in italics 4 because this results in total greater than 900 million proportionally reduce the grants of all recipients in excess of the minimum to prevent exceeding the appropriation of 900 million tables 3 4 and 5 col d 5 display the resulting adjusted estimated allocations tables 3 4 and 5 col each of these steps is discussed below establishing proxies for risk and effectiveness scores in fy2006 congress appropriated total of 912 million for the shsgp and letpp programs of that total 40 365 million was required to satisfy the minimum allocation for every eligible recipient the remaining 60 547 million was allocated based on risk and effectiveness24 examination of column g in table 2 shows for example that california received 1518 of the 547 million new york 852 texas 805 and florida 68225 these percentages and the corresponding percentage for each grant recipient serve as proxy for each jurisdictions riskandeffectiveness score for the crs estimated allocations for fy2007 and as proposed under hr 1 estimating risk and effectiveness the dhs guidance for fy2007 hr 1 and s 4 would allocate total shsgp and letpp amounts by risk and assessment 24 the precise amounts were 914975000 368277000 and 546919000 respectively 25 table 2 presents the fy2006 actual statebystate distributions for the shsgp and letpp programs the table also shows the portion of the total allocation distributed to each state in fy2006 by the risk and effectiveness parameter for the amounts for all dhs programs from fy2003 through fy2006 see crs report rl33770 department of homeland security grants to state and local governments fy2003 to fy2006 by steven maguire and shawn reese crs14 subject to statutory minimums generally lower under hr 1 and s 4 than under existing law in order to estimate the risk and effectiveness allocations for each eligible jurisdiction we multiply the proxy percentage discussed above by the total appropriation of 900 million for fy2007 under dhs guidance this unadjusted amount is shown in column c of table 3 the corresponding amounts under hr 1 and s 4 are shown in column c of table 4 and table 5 respectively meeting the minimums as noted earlier existing law sets two minimum amounts based on the total appropriation 075 per state the district of columbia and puerto rico 025 for other us insular areas given an appropriation of 900 million these minimums are 6750000 and 2250000 per state or insular area respectively under hr 1 however there would be three minimum amounts based on the total appropriation 045 for international border states 18 states 025 for states without an international border 32 states the district of columbia and puerto rico and 008 for the other us insular areas with an appropriation of 900 million these minimums would be 4050000 2250000 for the two categories of state respectively and 720000 for insular areas the riskandeffectiveness proxies give some jurisdictions less than the required minimum column h of table 2 shows that the fy2007 method does not provide the minimum to 18 states puerto rico the district of columbia the us virgin islands guam and the northern marianas those jurisdictions can be seen in the italicized entries in columns and c of table 3 examination of the italicized entries in columns and c of table 4 shows that risk and assessment allocations do not meet the hr 1 minimums for 14 states the district of columbia puerto rico the us virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islands the italicized entries in columns and c of table 5 shows that risk and assessment allocations do not meet the s 4 minimums for 15 states the district of columbia puerto rico the us virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islands tables 3 4 and 5 show that when all minimums are met adjustments will be required to avoid exceeding the annual authorization an excess of 96558345 under dhs program guidance for fy2007 an excess of 24109768 under hr 1 an excess of 44470354 under s 4 allocating the excess amount to avoid exceeding the annual authorization the reductions to cover the excess must be distributed among the jurisdictions whose riskandeffectiveness allocation exceeded the minimum for fy2007 152 reduction in the unadjusted grant amount for those jurisdictions would be needed under hr 1 31 reduction would be required under s 4 reduction of 60 would be required26 26 the base for the adjustment percentage is the sum of all riskandeffectiveness allocations that exceed the minimum the denominator in the ratio is the sum of amounts required to bring all grants up to the minimum in the case of fy2007 allocations the ratio is 96558345 636558345 or 0151688 in the case of estimates under hr 1 the ratio is 24109768 747720000 or 00312372 s 4 the ratio is 44470354
