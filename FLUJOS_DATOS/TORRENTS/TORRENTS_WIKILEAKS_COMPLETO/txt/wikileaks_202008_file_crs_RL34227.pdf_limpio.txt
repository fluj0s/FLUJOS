channels according to usda usda estimates that from 21 to 23 of us agricultural production crops and livestock is exported3 exports account for almost half of wheat production more than onethird of soyb eans and fifth of corn the share of exports of specialty crops such as alm onds is 70 while for other specialty crops such as walnuts or grapefruit the export share is as high as 40 export share of livestock produc ts is lower than for crops as most meat and dairy products are consumed domestically us agricultural exports generate employment income and purchasing power in both the farm and nonf arm sectors according to usda each 1 received from agricultural exports stimulates another 164 in supporting activities to produce those exports recent data show that agricultural exports

subsidy dispute both by randy schnepf 11 httpwwwwhitehousegovombexpectmoresummary100020202004htmlexport credit guarantee program issues export credit guarantee programs have become an issue in wto dispute settlement as result of dispute raised by brazil against certain aspects of the us cotton program10 the wto dispute panel in the cotton case ruled in 2005 that three us export credit guarantee programs gsm102 gsm103 and scgp we re prohibited subsidies because the financial benefits returned to the governme nt by these programs did not cover their longrun operating costs this ruling by the dispute settlement panel applied not only to cotton but to other commodities as well the panel recommended that the united states take steps to remove the adverse effects of these subsidies or to withdraw them entirely the administration suspende d operation of gsm103 in 2006 and asked congress to repeal the legislative author ization for the prog ram and make other changes in the presidents fy2007 and fy2008 budget requests the effectiveness of the credit guarantee pr ograms also has been an issue the office of management and budget omb reviewed the programs and found that export credit guarantees were only moderately effective in meeting program goals11 omb noted also that there were substantial defaults particularly in the sgcpprogram situation that led usda to suspend operations of scgp in 2006 administration proposals the administration in its farm bill trade proposals recommended changes in ccc export credit guarantee programs that would bring them into compliance with the findings of the wto dispute resolution panel in the brazil cotton case to accomplish this the administration asked congress to remove the 1 cap on fees th at can be collected under the shortterm credit guarantee program gsm102 and to eliminate specific legislative authority for the intermediate export credit guar antee program gsm103 and the sgcp usda also proposed repeal of the sgcp because of appr oximately 227 million in defaults and evidence of fraudulent activity the administration proposed to change the facility guarantee program fgp to attract users who commit to purchasing us agricultural products fgp funds have been allocated under the current farm bill congressional action both versions of the f arm bill make the changes in usdas export credit guarantee programs recommended by the administration repeal of gsm103 and the sgcp and remova l of the 1 cap on origination fees for gsm guarantees the gsm102 program is extended through fy2012 export subsidies the current farm bill author izes direct export subsid ies of agricultural products through the export enhancement progra m eep and the dairy export incentive program deip the last year of subs tantial eep activity was 1995 and there hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34227crs6 been eep spending under the current farm bill deip spending which has varied considerably averaged 18 million per year under the 2002 farm bill table 2 table 2 export subsidy programs spending under the 2002 farm bill program purposefarm bill average millions fy2002fy2006fy2006 million eep direct subsidies of agricultural products00 deip direct subsidies of dairy products18 0 source usda annual budget summaries eep and deip eep was established in 1985 first by the secretary of agriculture under authority granted in th commodity credit corporation charter act and then under the food security ac t of 1985 pl 99198 eeps main stated rationale at its inception was to combat unfair trading practices of competitors other subsidizing countries such as th european union in world agricultural markets the general sales manager administers eep most eep subsidies have been used to assist sales of wheat many ex porters have received subsidies but from 1985 to 1995 three exporting firms received almost half the total of all eep subsidies which totaled more than 7 billion th united states agreed to reduce its agricultural export subsidies under th 1994 wto uruguay round agreement on agriculture and in ongoing multilateral trade negotiations advocates that all agricultural export subsidies be eliminated deip most recently reauthorized in th commodity program title not the trade title of the 2002 farm bill was establishe d under the 1985 farm act to assist exports of us dairy products its purpose was to c ounter the adverse effects of foreign dairy export subsidies primarily those of th european union wto export subsidy reduction commitments apply also to deip export subsidy program issues eep has been controversial since its inception many oppose the program outri ght on grounds of economic efficiency eep they argue like all export subsidies interferes with the operations of markets and distorts trade others noting that the uruguay round agreement on agriculture restricts but does not prohibit agricultural ex port subsidies point out that as long as competitors such as the european union use export subsidies the united states should also be prepared to use them the effectiveness of eep also has been an issue several studies of the use of eep found that wheat exports would have declined if eep were eliminated suggesting that the eep program increased wheat exports other analysts however found that subsidizing wheat exports under eephttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34227crs7 12 see for example the article by paarlberg and seitzinger simulation model of the us export enhancement program for wheat in the presence of an ec response at httperaeoxfordjournalsorgcgicontentabstr act164445

agriculture negotiations see crs report rl33144 wto doha round the agricultural negotiationsresulted in displacing exports of unsubsidized grains12 while many oppose subsidizing dairy products for reasons s imilar to those held by eep opponents deip has strong support in congress omb also has evaluated the effectiveness of eep and deip13 omb found that the export subsidy programs were only moderately effective in meeting program goals of countering export subsidies or unfai r trade practices of other countries in ombs judgment the export subsidy programs have not been able to demonstrate an ability to permanently expand exports or build us market share in targeted countries the agency does note that deip was successful in offsetting eu export subsidies for dairy products to mexico which pe rmitted the united states to develop and maintain market for dairy product exports to that country administration proposals the administration proposed the repeal of eep because it argued eep is not useful tool for us agricultural exports it has been inactive for many years and eliminating it would not materially affect us agricultural exports the administration notes also that using eep would be inconsistent with the us goal of iminating export subsidies in the wto doha round of multilateral trade negotiations14 the administration made proposals for either eliminating or reauthorizing deip however congressional action the senate version of the farm bill calls for the repeal of eep while the house bill exte nds authority for eep through fy2012 both the senate and house farm bills also extend the authorization for deip in title i the commodity title through fy2012 export market development programs the 2002 farm bill authorizes mandatory f unding for four programs to

the products thereof produced in the united states except wheat feed grains oilseeds cotton rice peanuts sugar and tobacco the types of activities c overed include seminars and wo rkshops study tours field surveys pest and disease research and preclearance programs the 2002 farm bill authorizes 2 million of ccc funds each fiscal year through fy2007 for the tasc program export market development program issues basic issue raised by map and fmdp and in some cases all the export programs is whether the federal government should have an active role in helping agricultural producers and agribusinesses market their products overs eas some argue that map and fmdp are forms of corporate welfare in that they fund activities that private firms would and could fund for themselves others argue that the principal beneficiaries are foreign consumers and that funds coul d be better spent for exampl to educate us firms on how to export program supporters count er that foreign competitors especially eu member countries also spend mone on market promotion and that us marketing programs help keep us produc ts competitive in thirdcountry markets ombs reviews of the effectiveness of the market development efforts determined that the programs were moderately effective but that the programs did not necessarily serve clear need15 many of the groups that receive market development funds it reported receive at least some co rporate funding and could afford to support their own export promoti on efforts omb did note that the tasc program has helped to reduce barriers to us agricultural exports citing the example of tascfunded efforts to open taiwan s apple market to us apples administration proposals the administration proposed an increase in mandatory funding for map by 250 million over 10 years the additional funds would be used to address perceived inequities between farm bill program crops grains oilseeds and cotton and nonpr ogram crops especially specialty crops organic agriculture would be allowed to compete for map funding to help develop the export of organic products in additi on the administration proposed to increase mandatory funding for tasc to 68 million over 10 years and to increase the maximum allowable project award to 500000 to address sps issues generally the administration called for the establishment of new grant program of 20 million over 10 years to further focus resources on international sps barriers for all agricultural commodities to enhance usda participation in international standardsetting bodies such as the code x alimentarius the international plant protection convention and the worl d animal health organization thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34227crs10 administration requested the authorizati on of longterm mandatory funding

by 100 million over the five fiscal years fy2008fy2012 while the house bill increases map funding by 125 million both bills specifically authorize map to promote exports of organically produced commodities the house bill authorizes ccc funding for fmdp through fy2012 with change in the funding levels authorized in the 2002 fa rm bill ie 345 million the senate bill reauthorizes fmdp through fy2012 but increases its funding by 22 million over five fiscal years hr 2419 also incr eases funding for tasc which the 2002 farm bill authorizes at 2 million of ccc funds per fiscal year total funding for tasc in hr 2419 over five years would amount to 38 million the senate bill provides total of 292 million for tasc over five years other farm bill trade title provisions both bills authorize discretionary appropr iations such sums as necessary to assist limited resource persons and organizations associated with agricultural trade to address unfair trade practice of foreig n countries and to reduce trade barriers included among trade title proposals from th administration this measure would help smaller groups and indus tries who want to challeng trade practices of other countries but lack the t echnical and analytical ex pertise to successfully m ount challenge the housepassed bill also authorizes discretionary appropriations to enhance us participation in international standardsetting organizations such as the codex alimentarius commission or the world organization for animal health the intent of this measure also proposed by the administration is to help bring us interests to bear in standardsetting organizations when sanitary phytosanitary or technical trade are on the agenda
