toward latin america they point to the momentum for free trade in the region nd to the assistance and support provided to colombia and its neighbors as they combat drug trafficking and terrorist

the andean region has focused almost exclusively on counternarcotics efforts that is cu rbing the cultivation of coca leaf its transformation into cocaine and its subsequent trafficking success in controlling coca and coca base production in bolivia nd peru seemed to be offset in the midtolate 1990s by the expansion of coca cultivation into uncontrolled areas of colombia which previously had served onl for the refinement of coca base into cocaine in the last few years drug traffickers have also begun to cultivate opium poppies and transform them into highgrade heroin in colombia eighty

colombia goal of having sprayed 50 of the countrys coca crop by the end of 2005 may have been accomplished two years ahead of schedule it should be noted that spraying does not prevent although it may discourage the replanting of illicit crops however acco rding to the administration during 2002 and 2003 coca cultivation picked up in boliv ia reversing declining trend there perus coca cultivation in 2003 decreased 15 critics of us policy contend that winning the war against drugs is losing proposition as long as demand continues th ey argue that policy should focus on the demand side because they view providi ng treatment for the users of illegal narcotics as the only permanent solution the bush administration has however recast the debate arguing that the united states faces not only threat from drug production and trafficking in the andean region but also from the increasing instability brought on by insurgent guerrilla organizations that are fueled by the drug trade to the bush administration and its supporters the assistance to colombia is necessary to help shore up democratic government besieged by drugsupported leftist and rightist armed gr oups substantial assistance to colombias neighbors is warranted they argue because of an incr easing threat from the spillover of violence from colombia and the possible resurgence of drug cultivation in some countries and its spread from colombia to others although some critics agree with this asse ssment they argue that the bush plan overemphasizes military and counterdrug assistan ce and provides inadequate support for protecting human rights and couraging peace process in colombia in particular they express concern that current military assistance is drawing the united states into colombias guerrilla conflict in support of armed forces which they charge have substan tial ties to rightist groups gu ilty of gross violations ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31726crs8 human rights this concern grew with the august 2002 inauguration of president alvaro uribe who is viewed by some as tolerating the actions of rightist armed groups despite his statements that he w ill neither tolerate violence against nor on behalf of the government in july 2003 president uribe announced that an agreement had been reached with the righ tist paramilitary umbre lla organization the united self defense forces of colombia auc that
