provide the rationale and arrangements for design ating information officially secret for reasons of national security and for its declassification as well background although formal armed forces information security orders had been in existence since 1869 security classifica tion arrangements assumed presidential character in 1940 the reasons for this late development are not entirely clear but it probably was prompted by desires to clarify the authority of civ ilian personnel in the na tional defense community to create official secrets to establish broader basis for protecting military information in view of growing global hostilities and to better manage discretionary power of increasing importance to the entire executive branch relying upon 1938 statute concerning the secu rity of armed forces installations and equipment and informa tion relative thereto1 franklin d roosevelt issued the first presidential security classification direc tive eo 8381 in march 1940 however the legislative history of the statute which the president relied upon to issue his order provided indication that congress anticipated that such security classification arrangement would be

to nonmilitary agencies which presumably had role in national security policy criticism of the 1951 order prompted pres ident dwight d eisenhower to issue replacement eo 10501 in november 1953 this directive and later amendments to it as well as eo 11652 of march 8 1972 nd eo 12065 of june 28 1978 successively narrowed the bases and limited discretion for assigning official secrecy to agency records shortly after president ronald reagan issued eo 12356 on april 2 1982 it came under criticism for reversing the limiting trend set by classifica tion orders of the previous 30 years by expanding the categories of classifiable information mandating that information falling within these categories be classified making reclassification authority available admonishing classi fiers to err on the side of classification and eliminating automatic declassification arrangements with the democratization of many eastern european countries the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold wa r president clinton shortly after his inauguration initiated sweeping review of co ld war rules on security classification in general and of eo 12356 in partic ular with view to reform2 many began to suspect that the security classification program could be improved when the department of defense secur ity review commission chaired by retired general richard g stilwell d eclared in 1985 that there were verifiable figures as to the amount of classified mate rial produced in dod and in defense industry each year nonetheless it was conc luded that too much information appears to be classified and much at higher levels than is warranted3 the cost of the security classification program became clearer when the general accounting office reported in october 1993 that it was able to identify governmentwide costs directly applicable to national security information totaling over 350 million for 1992 after breaking this figure down it included only 6 million for declassification work the report added that the us government also spends additional billions of dollars annually to safeguard info rmation personnel and property4 established in april 1993 the president s security

followed as delay in issuing the new order continue d some in congress considered legislating statutory basis for classifying information in the spring of 19946 in the fall the president issued an order declassifying select ed retired records at the national archives7 after months of unresolved c onflict over designating an ove rsight and policy direction agency compromise version of the order was given presidential approval in april 1995 clinton order the clinton order as initially issued authorizes the classification of information for reasons of national security which means the national defense or foreign relations of the united states8 regarding the threshold consideration as to whether classification action should occur the order states if th ere is significant doubt about the need to classify information it shall not be classifie d explanation of the term significant is provided nonetheless the policy of eo 12356 directing classifiers to err on the side of classification in questi onable cases is reversed eo 12958 retains three classification levels identified by the traditional top secret secret and confidential markings again reversing eo 12356 policy the clinton order states if there is significant doubt about th appropriate level of classification it shall be classified at the lower level in this regard eo 12356 had ca lled for classification at the higher level the classification categories specified in eo 12958 identifying inclusively the information subjects that may be considered for classification are the same as those of eo 12356 with one exception in eo 12356 explicit provision was made for the president to create additional classification categories such allowance is stated in eo 12958 but additional categories could be appended by subse quent order amending eo 12958 prescribing declassification unlike eo 12356 the clinton order limits the duration of classification when information is originally cl assified an attempt is to be made to establish specific date or event for declassification alte rnatively if short term time or event for declassification cannot be determined the ne w order sets 10year terminus however allowance is made fo r extending the duration of classificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97771crs4 beyond the 10year limit in selected cases nd in accordance with prescribed procedures and conditions in brief the intent appears to be that only small quantity of the most highly sensitive information would be mainta ined under security classification for periods longer than 10 years other arrangements are specified for the automatic declassification of historic government records those that are more than 25 years old and have been determined by the archivist of the united states to ve permanent historical value eo 12958 mandates the beginning of govern mentwide declassification of historic records five years hence shortly after the turn of the century allowance is made for continuing the classification of these materials in select ed cases and in accordance with prescribed procedures and conditions once again the intent appears to be that only small quantity of the most highly sensitive historic r ecords would be maintained under security classification the archivist according to the clinton order shall establish governmentwide database of information that has been declassified furthermore eo 12958 continues th mandatory declassification review requirement of eo 12356 this provision author izes person to request that almost any classified record be reviewed with view to being declassified and publicly disclosed similarly if an agency record requested pursuant to the freedom of information act is found to be security classi fied mandatory declassifica tion review also occurs controversial areas few provisions of eo 12958 may be considered controversial the clinton order states that information may not be reclassified after it has been declassified and re leased to the public under prope r authority the reference to proper authority means that the informa tion has not been disclosed through leak however some question remains as to how public the proper disclosure must be to preclude retrieval and recla ssification when some higher authority having second thoughts wants to stop disclosure similarly the clinton order states compilations of items of information which are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that 1 meets the standards for classification under this order and 2 is not ot herwise revealed in the indivi dual items of information at issue here is the socalled mosaic theory that individual items of unclassified information in aggregation result in classifiab information at dispute is the question of perception government officials classify aggregated unclassified information items because they fear that harm to the national security could result if the aggregation were publicly disclosed eo 12958 continues to allow agency offici als to refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of re quested information whenever the fact of its existence or nonexistence is itself classi fied under this order classification challenges among the new features of eo 12958 is the authorization of classificati on challenges authorized holders of information who in good faith believe that its cl assification status is improper says the order are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification status of the information in accordance with agency procedures the w illingness of federal employees to engage inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97771crs5 9 conferees on the fy1995 treasury postal serv ice and executive office of the president appropriation

to be implemented the effect of the provision c ould not be assessed eo 12958 provides an opportunity to conduct such an an alysis sometime in the future program direction eo 12958 originally vested
