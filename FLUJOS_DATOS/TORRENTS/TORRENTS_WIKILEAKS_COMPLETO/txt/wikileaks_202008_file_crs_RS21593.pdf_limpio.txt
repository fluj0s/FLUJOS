the state of georgia is covered juri sdiction under section 5 of the vra5 in contrast to section 5 section 2 of the vra applies to all jurisdictions in the us it prohibits any voting qualification or

membership in language minority6 in thornburg v gingles7 the supreme court stated that the critical question for court in deciding if vote dilution in violation of section 2 has occurred is whether as result of the challenged practice or structure plaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to participate in the political pr ocesses and to elect candidates of their choice8 in addition to review of objectiv factors from the legislative history of section 29 the court also held that in order to prevail in section 2 vote dilution claim plaintiff must prove that 1 the minority group is sufficiently large and geographicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21593crs3 10 thornburg 478 us at 5051 11 georgia v ashcroft 195 f supp 2d 25 ddc 2002 12 see georgia v ashcroft 123 s ct 2498 250708 2003 13 see id at

district court panel held that georgia state 2001 senate redistricting plan violated section 5 of the vra and was therefore not entitled to preclearance because it reduced black vo ting age population in three districts11 the attorney general representing the us g overnment argued that georgias 2001 state senate redistricting plan s hould not be precleared under sec tion 5 of the vra because the plan which was supported by the democrats in the state legislatur reduced the black voting age population in district 2 fro m 6058 to 5031 in district 12 from 5543 to 5066 and in district 26 from 6245 to 5080 in addition the government submitted evidence indicating that in all three senate districts the percentage of black registered voters dropped to just under 50 nd that racially polarized voting occurred12 bearing the burden of proof in this proceeding the state of georgia argued that notwithstanding the reduction in black votin g age population and black registered voters in the three senate districts the redistricting plan was not retrogressive in either intent or in effect in addition to submitting deta iled evidence documenting the total population total black population black voting age populati on percentage of black registered voters and the percentage of democratic votes i the likelihood that voters in particular district would vote democratic georgia also submitted testimony from persons who had participated in designing the plan which indicated that it was designed to increase black voting strength throughout georgia and to assist in ensuring continued democratic majority in the state senate13 unpersuaded by the state of georgias argume nts the threejudge district court panel found that the three senate dist rict plans at issue were retr ogressive because each district presented lesser opportunity for the black ca ndidate of choice to win election under the new plan as compared to the earlier benc hmark plan moreover the court determined that the reductions in black voting ag population would diminish africanamerican voting strength in those districts and that the retrogression was not offset by gains in other districts hence the threejudge panel held that georgia had failed to demonstrate by preponderance of the evidence that the state nate redistricting pl an would not have retrogressive effect on africanamerican voters and refused to grant section 5 preclearance14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21593crs4 15 see 204 f supp 4 ddc 2002 16 georgia v ashcroft 123 s ct 964 2003 17 georgia v ashcroft 123 s ct 2498 2509 2003 18 id at 2510 quoting

id quoting beer v us supra at 141after the court refused to grant preclearance georgia enacted similar senate redistricting plan that added black voters to districts 2 12 and 26 which the district court subsequently precleared15 party contested the propriety of the district court granting preclearance to the second plan and the us supreme court noted probable jurisdiction to consider whether the distri ct court should have granted pr eclearance to the redistricting plan as originally enacted by georgia16 georgia has asserted that it will use the originally enacted redistricting plan if preclearance is ultimately granted17 supreme court ruling vacating and remanding the district court ruling the supreme court in georgia v ashcroft held that the district court failed to c onsider all requisite relevant factors when it determined that the original georgia redistricting plan resulted in retrogression of black voters effective exercise of voting rights and refused to grant preclearance under section 5 of the vra in its 5 to 4 opinion with justice oconnor writing for the majority the court first rejected georgias argument that plan should be pr ecleared under section 5 if it would satisfy section 2 of the vra hol ding that while some parts of section 2 analysis may overlap with s ection 5 inquiry the two sections of law differ in structure purpose and application18 according to the court the essence of section 2 vote dilution claim is that certain law practi ce or structure causes an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their prefe rred representatives19 in contrast section 5 retr ogression inquiry by definition requires comparison of jurisdictions new voting plan with its existing plan20 further the court stated that it has previously held that violation of s ection 2 is not an independent reason to deny preclearance under section 521 next the court turned to georgias alternative argument that even if compliance with section 2 does not result in preclearance under section 5 the plan should nevertheless be precleared because it does not lead to retr ogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise22 acknowledging the necessity in this case to determine the meaning of effective exercise of the electoral franchise the court found that it clearly includes the ability of minority voters to elect candidate of their choice through the creation of safe districts where minority voters constitute well over 50 of eligible voters notably however in the courts view the effective exercise of the franchise can also be achieved by spreading out minority voters over greater number of districtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21593crs5 23 id at 2512 24 id at 251112 the court elaborates stating that on the one hand smaller number of safe districts with majority of minority voters ma virtually guarantee the election of the minority groups preferred candidate while on the other nd spreading out minority voters over greater number of districts may create greater oppor tunity to elect candidates of choice id 25 id 26 id at 2513 27 id since retrogressive inquiry asks how voters will probably act in the circumstances in which they live according to the court the repr esentatives of districts that were created with the purpose of ensuring continued minority partic ipation in the political sphere have knowledge about how voters will most likely behave and more specifically whether the proposed change in districts will decrease minority voters effec tive exercise of the electoral franchise idthereby creating more districts in which nority voters can have the opportunity but not near certainty of electing candidates of their choice such strategy has the potential to increase substantive representation in more districts by creating coalitions of voters who together will help to achieve the electoral aspirations of the minority group23 according to the court section 5 affo rds the states the flexibility to choose one theory of representation over the other either option will present the minority group with its own array of electoral risks and be nefits and presents hard choices about what would truly maximize minority electoral success24 in addition to the comparative ability of minority group to elect candidate of its choice the court determined that the other highly relevant factor in retrogression inquiry is the extent to which new redist ricting plan modifies the ability of minority group to influence the political process and is not limited to just winning elections hence the court held that under section 5 court must consider whether new plan adds or subtracts influence districts where minority voters may not be able to elect candidate of choice but can nonetheless play substantial if not decisive role in the election25 the court also found that comparing the vel of legislative leadership influence and power of representatives supported by minority voters w ith the level of such power existent in the benchmark plan is anot her method of assessing the minority groups opportunity to participate in the political process since lawmaker in leadership position has greater ability to exert control over the legislative process maintaining or increasing leadership positions for minority vot ers representatives of choice while not dispositive alone can be an important factor i ndicating lack of retr ogressive effect under section 526 it is also significant though simila rly not dispositive the court determined to consider whether the representatives elected from the very districts created and protected by the vra support the new redistricting plan27 finding that the district court did not cons ider all of the requisite relevant factors when it examined whether the georgia senate redistricting plan resulted in retrogression of black voters effective exercise of the ectoral franchise in c ontravention of section 5 the court vacated and remanded the case to the district court to examine the facts using the new standard announced in its opinion the district court analysis was incorrect because it focused too heavily on the ability of the minority group to elect candidatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21593crs6 28 id at 2518 citing eg reno v bossier parish school board bossier parish i 520 us 471 478 1997 according to the dissent state must not just show that minority voters in new districts may have some influence but that ch minority voters will have effective influence translatable into probable election results comp arable to what they enjoyed under the existing district scheme id 29 id at 251417of its choice in the safe di stricts without giving proper consideration to other factors such as the states creation of additional infl uence and coalition districts according to the court the dissenting opinion written by justice souter argued that before state can change from safe majority black districts to coalition districts the state has the burden of proving that nonminority voters will vot reliably with the minority voters28 noting that the dissents analysis appears to presume that the court had decided that the georgia senate plan is not retrogressi ve the court expressly disagrees stating that its holding is limited to determining only that the district court did not engage in the correct analysis indeed the court read ily acknowledges that the district court is in better position to reweigh all the facts in the record in the first instance in light of our explication of retrogression29
