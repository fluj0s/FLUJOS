and to expand resource development in both state and fede ral waters various interests argue over which policies and regulations will best minimize conf licts between competing offshore resource users while effectively sa feguarding already crowded coastal areas from further development an issue that is funda mental to the regulation of offshore activities is determining which level of government has primary jurisdiction over particular offshore areas who has jurisdiction pends in part upon the federalstate maritime boundaries unlike most countries the us federal government shares jurisdiction over its 12mile nautical territori sea with its coastal states the 1953 submerged lands act sla generally gives coastal states title to the submerged lands waters and natural resources located within three nautical miles of the coastline the waters seabed and natura l resources beyond these three miles belong to the federal government identifying where federalstat maritime boundary lies is not always an easy task federalstate maritime boundari are represented on nautical charts published by the national ocean service part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa these charts refl ect the federal gove rnments official position on where us maritime boundaries federal and state are located determining the baseline from which federalstate mar itime boundaries are determined can be difficult depending on th geography of the coast international law which guides us practice recogniz different methods for locating coastal baseline in such circumstances the us has traditionally applied measurement standard that minimizes the extent of state offshore waters but while setting maritime boundaries is primarily federal prerogative states have conti nued to challenge the national ocean service charts when us coastal state disagrees with the federal governments position on its maritime boundary the courts have been called upon to resolve the dispute often the us supreme court under its original jurisdiction under article iii of the constitution congress also may become more involved in maritime boundary and jurisdiction issues as the pace of offshore development increases and legislation to address some of these issues such as s 735 has been introduced in the 109th congress this report will be updated as circumstances

to balance the concerns of resource deve lopers resource users and coastal communities2 key factor in determining w ho can make important decisions on these and related regulatory issues is determining the location of the boundary between federal and state offshore waters established boundaries are key in knowin g what laws apply to particular situation for example before company applies for permit to build an offshore wind farm it needs to know whether its propos ed project will be in state or federal waters and whether regulatory authority over the project will reside in the federal government state government or both moreover the company needs to know whether or not the maritime boundary is likel to change over time thereby affecting its project and overall investment all of

nautical miles subject only to federal jurisdiction over commerce and navigation although there was clear legal authority for this conclusion24 it was the growing importance of seabed resources especially offshore oil that finally spurred the federal government to challenge these assumptions directly modern controversies over c ontrol of the territorial sea began in the 1920s when the state of california claiming ownership over its coastal waters issued certain oil and gas leases for the submerged lands of the santa barbara channel25 applications for oil and gas leases were also submitted to the federal government during this period and the customary response to such requests was to inform the company that the federal government lacked the nece ssary authority to grant such leases26 upon looking into the matter more closely however secretary of the interior harold ickes began to assert federal ow nership over the submerged lands congress also began to weigh in on dominion over submerged lands on the one hand the 75th and 76th congresses considered joint resolutions specifically authorizing the attorney generalto sue california over ownership to the seabed 27

states coastline to the courts47 under the sla states coastline is defined as the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters the first part of this definition seems fairly straightforward locating the seaward limit of inland waters however has proven more difficult especi ally without more specific guidance from congress48 absent domestic legislation pertai ning to inland waters the supreme court decided to adopt the definitions found in the 1958 geneva convention on the territorial sea and contiguous zone tr eaty ratified by the united states and generally now recognized as customary international law49 in adopting these definitions the supreme court dispelled concerns associated with future changes in international law by freezing the meanin g of inland waters to that of the 1958 convention50 moreover the court established single coastline for both the administration of the sla and the conduc t of the federal governments future international relations51httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32912crs9 52 article 4 also authorizes nations to c onsider economic

baseline is the lowwater mark along the shore as marked on largescale charts officially recognized by the coastal nation there are some exceptions under special circumstances international law permits coastal nation to draw straight closing lines between two distant coastal points in determining its coastal line rather than closely tracking the contour s of its ordinary lowwater mark article 4 of the 1958 convention specifically states that where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into or if there is fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity straight baselines may be em ployed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured52 the language may be employed indicates that article 4 is not mandato ry and instead is an optional provision53 thus it is ultimately the coastal nations decision as to whether it wants to use straight closing lines to determine article 4 inland waters in providing coastal nation the opportun ity to establish an otherwise complex boundary through the use of straight baselin article 4 has the concomitant effects of 1 including waters within inland waters that would be part of the territorial sea under strict contour syst em of measurement and 2 pushing maritime boundaries farther off shore figure 1 54 the united states has not adopted the straightbaseline system under article 455 this federal government policy has frustrated many coastal states who argue that portions of their coastlines are well ited for the straightbaseline method california louisiana and alaska have ll attempted to use the straightbaseline system despite the federal governments position56 the supreme court has consistently held that the choice under the convention to use the straightbaseline method for determining

exceptions under the conven tion also are applied in determining us coastal states sla boundary59 and many us coastal states have tried to capitalize on these exceptions by asserting to the supreme

to explain th at this right of occupancy may be extinguished only by the plain intent76 of congress when assessing whether or not aboriginal title exists three questions are usually asked the first is whether the federal government exercises sovereignty over the area in question if so then the next question is whether congress has clearly extinguished aboriginal title to such lands if not then it
