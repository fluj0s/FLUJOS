issues for congress updated february 22 2005 richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr programs issues for congress summary intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr functions are principal elements of us defense capabilities and include wide variety of systems for acquiring and processing information needed by national security decisionmakers and military commanders isr systems range in size from handheld devices to orbiting satellites some collect basic information for wide range of analytical products others are designed to acquire data for specific weapons systems some are national systems intended primarily to collect information of interest to washingtonarea agencies others are tactical systems intended to support military commanders on the battlefield collectively they account for major portion of us intelligence spending that according to media estimates amounts to some 40 billion annually for some time congress has expressed concern about the costs and management of isr programs with minor exceptions isr acquisition has been coordinated by the defense department and the intelligence community although there are long existing staff mechanisms for reviewing and coordinating isr programs in the context of the annual budget submissions many in congress believe that existing procedures have not avoided duplication of effort excessive costs and gaps in coverage examples that some observers cite are separate efforts to acquire new generation of reconnaissance satellites and high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle uav known as global hawk both systems acquire some of the same sorts of information and serve similar customers but they are acquired in distinctly different ways moreover in both cases procurement efforts have been beset by increasing costs and schedule delays recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of isr capabilities and require that the defense department prepare roadmap to guide the development and integration of isr capabilities over the next fifteen years an effective roadmap if developed could potentially ensure more comprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money to establish responsibility for an intelligence communitywide effort the 911 commission recommended that new position of director of national intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program but not joint military and tactical intelligence programs which would continue to be managed by the defense department this position was included after extended debate in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 that was approved by the president on december 17 2004 the implications of this legislation for isr programs are as yet uncertain but congress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in

issues for congress introduction the various systems that collect process and disseminate intelligence are encompassed in the budget category known as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr1 isr covers multitude of programs ranging from billion dollar satellites to handheld cameras the bulk of funding is for research and development rd and procurement personnel costs are comparatively low some systems are used only by military units others are national systems operated by washingtonlevel defense agencies most are surrounded in secrecy but total spending on isr while difficult to estimate with unclassified information undoubtedly runs into the tens of billions of dollars the isr programs considered in this report are managed by the central intelligence agency cia and by the large intelligence agencies and components of the department of defense dod2 isr acquisition has in recent years come under strong criticism reportedly there are technical problems with the new generation of reconnaissance satellites along with billion dollar costoverruns only small number of the planned high altitude uavs are actually deployed and there have been difficulties in ensuring that the troops who need intelligence acquire it in timely manner there is widespread awareness that isr spending much greater than in past years could easily absorb even larger portions of defense and intelligence budgets making the need for tradeoffs even more important some observers point to the possibility that satellites and uavs potentially undertake the same or similar missions but that the current system gives little opportunity for cost comparisons or tradeoffs to be made in the 1 isr as used in defense department documents refers to the sets of collection and processing systems and associated operations involved in acquiring and analyzing information about foreign countries intelligence is more general term surveillance refers to systematic observation of targeted area or group usually over an extended time reconnaissance refers to an effort or mission to acquire information about target and can mean onetime endeavor see us department of defense department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms joint publication 102 12 april 2001 as used in this report the term intelligence systems encompasses all isr systems 2 the intelligence programs of the state justice including the fbi energy and treasury departments have far fewer budgetary implications and will not be addressed herein many of the activities of the coast guard now part of the department of homeland security dhs have important intelligence implications but only some are budgeted as intelligence programs crs2 acquisition process appendix provides case study of the tradeoffs between satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs understanding the procedures for acquiring isr systems is however complicated by the fact that different isr systems are acquired in entirely different ways by different intelligence agencies or military services and are designed for different users in addition the acquisition processes are overseen by different congressional committees it is difficult to ensure efficient acquisition in the separate programs which are often based on innovative technologies it is even more challenging to envision seamless and comprehensive system of systems and to ensure the acquisition of an optimal mix of specific systems congressional concerns with isr lack of coordination although procedures for coordinating the budgeting of isr programs have long been in place some members of congress have concluded that the procedures have not been wholly effective there has been it is argued inadequate data to compare systems capabilities and costs across the spectrum of intelligence programs an imbalance between collection and analysis programs and an intelligence effort that does not reflect an optimal allocation of extensive resources expressions of congressional concern go back number of years in 1995 the senate select committee on intelligence ssci expressed its misgivings about existing cooperation among agencies and recommended joint review by the director of central intelligence dci and the deputy secretary of defense to ensure that both intelligence community and defense department equities are served in the planning programming and management of all intelligence activities and programs3 some believed that giving the dci greater management responsibilities would improve the management of isr programs including those in the department of defense dod reflecting that view the fy1997 intelligence authorization act pl 104293 included provisions that strengthened the ability of the dci to manage the intelligence community by codifying his authority to participate in the development of the budgets for defensewide and tactical intelligence4 the conference committee stated giving the dci database of all intelligence activities and requiring all national foreign intelligence program nfip elements5 3 us congress senate select committee on intelligence authorizing appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for the intelligence activities of the united states government and the central intelligence agency retirement and disability system 104th congress 1st session srept 10497 june 14 1995 p 4 4 us congress house committee of conference intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1997 104th congress 2d session hrept 104832 september 24 1996 p 38 5 there are three types of intelligence programs nfip renamed the national intelligence program nip by the 2004 intelligence reform act includes the national programs that support senior policymakers the joint military intelligence program jmip that provides continued crs3 to submit periodic budget execution reports should enable the dci to make better use of his existing authorities given to him by congress in 1992 to approve the budgets of nfip elements and to transfer funds and personnel with the concurrence of affected agency heads the conferees in considering the fy1997 legislation urged the dci to be more assertive in using these authorities6 in may 2000 the senate intelligence committee reported that the budget practices of the central intelligence agency cia and the intelligence community as whole are simply inadequate to address current requirements upper level program managers lack sufficient insight into the process to make informed and timely decisions regarding the allocation of funds and to assure congress and themselves that funds are being spent as appropriated and authorized7 the next year the committee again argued that the intelligence community is handicapped by the lack of comprehensive strategic and performance plans that can be used to articulate program goals measure program performance improve program efficiency and aid in resource planning accordingly the committee directed the dci to produce comprehensive intelligence community strategic plan and performance plan as well as complementary strategic and performance plans for the intelligence agencies within the national foreign intelligence program aggregation the committee asked that such plans be undertaken annually and made available to congressional committees by march 1 of each year8 in 2002 the senate intelligence committee acknowledged receipt of the first ever plans coordinated across the intelligence community aimed at establishing performance measures aligned with the stated goals and priorities of the director of central intelligence the committee went on however to indicate that further work is needed and suggested that developing new systems merely to acquire new capability was insufficient the capability had to meet validated intelligence needs key issue is the development of performance plans and measures that are not focused solely on the attainment of intelligence capabilities but also on the value received from such capabilities in pursuit of intelligence community missions9 despite this admonition the next year the committee called attention to the absence of 2003 performance plan submission even though the deadline had passed 5 continued support to officials throughout dod and tactical intelligence and related programs tiara that are designed to support single military service for further background see below pp 1114 6 ibid p 39 7 srept 106279 p 33 8 srept 10763 p 17 9 us congress senate select committee on intelligence to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2003 for

session srept 107149 may 9 2002 p 28 crs4 with request for an extension10 more significantly the committee noted that it is aware of capability within dod or the intelligence community for objectively independently and comprehensively evaluating alternative sensor and platform architecture and capabilities there are some capabilities within different agencies and departments but none that are available independent of the program offices to model and assess crossprogram trades without regard to the location of the sensor or platform air space land or sea or the level of compartmentation consequently although dod and intelligence community officials expend substantial effort and time evaluating program trades they do so without the benefit of the rigorous quantitative modeling necessary to optimize collection capabilities and architectures given the vast sums involved in these programs even modest increases in the efficiency of resources allocation could lead to substantial benefits further the committee notes that the national military strategy as well as the defense planning guidance have been developed in recent years without the participation of the director of central intelligence or his staff notwithstanding the growing importance of intelligence to military operations and the need to build forces commensurate to validated threats11 section 355 of the fy2004 intelligence authorization act pl 108177 required report from the dci and the secretary of defense assessing progress in the development of comprehensive and uniform analytical capability to assess the utility and advisability of various sensor and platform architectures and capabilities for the collection of intelligence and the improvement of coordination between the department of defense and the intelligence community on strategic and budgetary planning 10 us congress senate select committee on intelligence authorizing appropriations for fiscal year 2004 for intelligence and

10844 may 8 2003 pp 1213 11 ibid p 13 furthermore the committee complained that the national security agency nsa major intelligence agency had been unable to provide basic information about its acquisition efforts it is very difficult for the committee to understand what needs to be done to modernize nsa when nsa cannot provide an adequate baseline of ongoing development and acquisition programs projects and activities the committee has fenced funds over the past two fiscal years to try to bring command attention to this problem submissions to date have shown progress but are not comprehensive in identifying known projects and programs that are being funded in the ccp future funding requests will be balanced against the nsa acquisition baseline so it is in the agencys best interest to get this done right and soon ibid p 17 crs5 in separate legislation congress also urged that dod take greater role in managing isr in section 923 of the fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108 136 congress found that there is not currently welldefined forum through which the integrators of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities for each of the armed forces can routinely interact with each other and with senior representatives of department of defense intelligence agencies as well as with other members of the intelligence community to ensure unity of effort and to preclude unnecessary duplication of effort12 pl 108136 further stated that the existing structure of intelligence programming may not be the best approach for supporting the development of an intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meet the national security requirements of the united states in the 21st century accordingly the fy2004 defense authorization act directed the under secretary of defense for intelligence to establish an isr integration council to provide permanent forum for assessing isr capabilities the council is to consist of senior intelligence officers of the services the special operations command the joint staff and the directors of dod intelligence agencies the dci would be invited to participate the council would be charged with developing comprehensive roadmap to guide the development and integration of dod isr capabilities for 15 years13 in addition to its general concerns about isr programs some members of congress have specifically focused on two issues related to budget processes that they argued undermine their abilities to conduct oversight of isr efforts they argue that congressional budget justification books have been inadequate and that there has been an overreliance on supplemental appropriations to fund continuing isr programs congressional budget justification books cbjbs effective congressional oversight depends on accurate consistent information over multiyear period the house permanent select committee on intelligence 12 the accompanying committee report noted that the us has the most capable isr system in the world but as good as this system is however it is often plagued by gaps competition for assets unavailability at the required level and parallel systems socalled stovepipes that do not fully complement one another the department has continued to develop some capabilities without regard to their place within an overarching isr architecture us congress senate committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 108th congress 1st session srept 10846 may 13 2003 p 355 13 section 923 pl 108136 on april 7 2004 the senate armed services was informed that the council had recently started meeting testimony of stephen cambone undersecretary of defense for intelligence before the senate armed services committee april 7 2004 crs6 hpsci in particular has criticized the inadequacy of intelligence budget justification materials and asked for more complete budgetary submissions in the form of congressional budget justification books proposals for isr programs are to be forwarded to intelligence committees along with armed services and appropriations committees justification materials on national programs are submitted to the two intelligence committees along with classified cbjbs which include one volume for each nip program plus an additional summary volume the classified books available to members and committee staff include explanatory narrative and resource displays for all resources requested by the program also included are descriptions of base levels of efforts ongoing initiatives and new initiatives with associated resource displays cbjbs are submitted to congress within few weeks of the delivery of the budget in early february and form the basis for the committees review of the entire nip prior to the drafting of annual intelligence authorization bills once the intelligence committees complete their review generally in the spring and early summer the legislation is referred to the armed services committee which have the option of submitting separate report prior to floor consideration classified budget justification books provided by the administration to congress are the primary ways in addition to oral testimony by which congress obtains information about intelligence programs in 1997 hpsci criticized justification books for lacking several critical components necessary for the committee to ensure proper alignment of funding within the funding appropriations categories clear identification of each project its specific budget request numbers the appropriation category eg other procurement defensewide rdte navy etc the budget request line number and if research and development project the program element number are essential to this task therefore the committee directs the cms community management staff and the defense department to provide this specific data in all future budget justification documents14 in 2000 hpsci expressed its continued frustration with perceived lack of detail provided in justification books which are classified and strongly criticized financial management practices at some nfip agencies hpsci stated that 14 us congress house permanent select committee on intelligence intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1998 105th congress 1st session hrept 105135 part 1 june 18 1997 p 64 the subsequent conference report noted that the cms was then in the process of revising the structure of the cbjbs and deferred the provision pending the outcome of cms efforts see us congress house committee of conference intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1998 105th congress 1st session hrept 105350 october 28 1997 p 30 in the same year house committee on national security also concerned that all costs of all aspects of programs were not being identified directed that future cbjbs show all direct and associated costs in each budget category eg procurement research and development operations and maintenance military construction etc us congress house committee on national security national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 105th congress 1st session hrept 105132 june 16 1997 p 304 year later hpsci noted good progress by the ic in preparing submissions for fy1999 but asked for additional data hrept 105508 p 16 crs7 the nfip agencies need greater insight into their financial obligations and the capabilities that they are developing nsas baseline activity for example identified many areas of duplicative development as well as lack of investment in key strategic areas yet due to the lack of detail the cbjb did not provide this information the committee notes that at least at some agencies internal financial management practices seriously complicate this process15 in 2003 hpsci again called attention to limitations in the data included in cbjbs which is often less extensive than that routinely provided in dod budget materials the committee believes for example that acquisition program details in the cbjbs should include major milestones and deliverables for contracted projects for the entire length of contract and contain more specificity for the budget year of the request many of the project milestones in the cbjbs are however at such highlevel that the committee is unable to determine the stage of the development activity or what will be accomplished in the coming year the project descriptions are often so vague that the committee is unable to determine the value of or even what is being developed16 supplemental appropriations while procedures for annual budget submissions have long been established there has been an increasing practice in recent years and especially since the september 11 2001 attacks of providing intelligence funding in supplemental appropriations acts17 of the 1656 billion in supplemental appropriations that the defense department has received since september 2001 significant but not publicly identified portion of these sums at least 16 billion not counting funds received in the fy2004 iraq supplemental was directed at intelligence and intelligencerelated activities18 15 hrept 106620 p 24 16 hrept 108163 p 25 17 section 504a1 of the national security act requires that funds for intelligence activities be specifically authorized by the congress intelligence authorization acts including their classified annexes provide specific authorization although appropriations acts also usually have generalized language providing specific authorization to meet the 504a1 requirement the inclusion of such provisions in appropriations acts serves as authorization until authorization bills are enacted or in the absence of authorization bills as often occurs when supplemental appropriations bills are enacted even when authorization legislation is under consideration the two appropriations committees also review intelligence budget submissions and intelligence funds for most intelligence activities are included in annual defense appropriation bills supplemental appropriations that fund intelligence activities include an authorizing provision to comply with section 504 of the national security act but they are not reported by the two intelligence committees 18 during floor consideration of the fy2004 intelligence authorization bill representative hastings member of hpsci stated it is important to note that this bill authorizes only part of the operating funds for the intelligence community huge portion of intelligence funds were provided in the 87 billion iraqi counterterrorism supplemental and in the continued crs8 arguably there is less opportunity for consideration of proposed supplemental intelligence spending within the context of established programs the hpsci noted in july 2002 the advantage of the supplemental process to the intelligence community is that pressing budgetary demands can be met in shorter time and with fewer bureaucratic hurdles than the regular yearly process however by continuing to rely on supplemental appropriations year after year the intelligence community risks fostering budget process that is ripe for abuse and longterm funding gaps the house committee also argued that the defense emergency response fund derf funding initiative that permits dod to shift funds from central fund to specific appropriations accounts after enactment as required for counterterrorist operations has turned into just another vehicle to fund items that the intelligence community did not get through the regular budget and planning process19 in particular it is argued supplemental legislation can undercut established budgeting and congressional oversight procedures making it more difficult to weigh tradeoffs and adjust overall priorities it can in some situations lead to the launching of programs that are unlikely to be sustained in the regular authorization and appropriation process some question the propriety of funding core programs in emergency supplemental legislation which are intended to provide for additional unforeseen needs resulting from combat and occupation duties in june 2003 hpsci reiterated its concerns regretting that core mission and core mission support programs have also been funded in supplemental appropriations it argued that the repeated reliance on supplemental appropriations has an erosive negative effect on planning and impedes longterm strategic planning the committee hopes that the ic has finally reached plateau of resources and capabilities on which longterm strategic planning can now begin further hpsci concluded the committee cannot help but note that budgeting by supplemental consequentially limits congressional oversight the committee strongly believes that the health of the ic is directly related to the oversight from congress it receives certainly the confidence of the american people activities and programs of the ic is increased significantly as result of the transparency that exists between the ic and its congressional overseers20 concern in not limited to the house committee in its report on fy2005 intelligence authorization bill s 2386 the senate intelligence committee argued 18 continued supplementals that proceeded it congressional record november 20 2003 p h11674 19 us congress house permanent select committee on intelligence intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2003 107th congress 2nd session hrept 107592 july 18 2002 p 15 20 hrept 108163 p 22 crs9 while the practice of funding baseline expenditures using supplemental vehicles has become more prevalent in the past 10 years it is time to rein in this practice21 reprogramming issues concern for some observers of the intelligence community are the current procedures for reprogramming of previously appropriated funds reprogrammings are intended to permit shifting funds to meet unanticipated new requirements that arise during the course the year the national security act permitted the dci to transfer funds appropriated for one program within nip to another program within the nip but there were congressional concerns that reprogramming procedures did not invariably met statutory requirements22 in may 2000 the house intelligence committee complained about significant and deleterious movements of money from field stations to cia headquarters that were inconsistent with national security act provisions and asked the cia inspector general to investigate whether statutory provisions were being followed23 similar concerns were expressed by the senate intelligence committee recent actions including taxing directorates for funds to be used in other areas and moving funds within expenditure centers without congressional notification have eroded this committees confidence that appropriations are used as intended24 during floor consideration of the fy2004 intelligence authorization conference report senator roberts chairman of the senate intelligence committee commented on difficulties in the out years as the national foreign intelligence program becomes burdened with content that is more costly than the budgeted funding this underestimation of future costs has resulted in significant reshuffling of nfip funds to meet emerging shortfalls25 congress also criticized the process for reprogramming funds between nfip programs and nonnfip programs in may 2002 the senate intelligence committee expressed concern that the correspondence it receives notifying it of the 21 us congress senate select committee on intelligence to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2005 for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the united states government the intelligence community management account and the central intelligence agency retirement and

intelligence activity must be of higher priority than the one from which funds were taken the transfer must be based on unforeseen requirements and the head of the department from which funds are to be transferred must not object in addition appropriate congressional committees had to be notified procedures for reprogramming and transfers while seemingly esoteric are designed to ensure that congressional directions are followed in the expenditure of funds 23 hrept 106620 p 25 24 us congress senate select committee on intelligence authorizing appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for the

record november 21 2003 pps1535415355 crs10 reprogramming of funds from one activity to another often does not set forth clearly how the requirements of higher priority and unforeseen circumstances have been satisfied section 305 of the fy2003 intelligence authorization act clarifies the unforeseen requirement by stating that such requirement does not include the failure of the director of central intelligence to anticipate an action by congress such as an authorization or appropriation level lower than that requested in the presidents budget26 the provision was not however included in the version of the bill that was enacted as pl 107306 section 311 of the senate version of the fty2004 intelligence authorization bill would have deleted the unforeseen requirements criterion altogether but the provision was not adopted in conference momentum for reorganization given the congressional concerns indicated above number of members and outside observers have argued that major restructuring of the intelligence community would be required if certain challenges in isr efforts are to be addressed effectively the 2002 joint inquiry conducted by the two intelligence committees to review the background of the 911 attacks recommended the establishment of position of director of national intelligence who would have the full range of management budgetary and personnel requirements needed to make the entire us intelligence community operate as coherent whole27 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission also recommended establishing position of national intelligence director nid to oversee national programs but not joint military or tactical intelligence programs which would managed solely by dod furthermore senior intelligence community official larry kindsvater the dcis executive director for intelligence community affairs and subsequently deputy dci for community management argued the need to reorganize the intelligence community and proposed among other things to give the dci authority to transfer funding across agencies with congressional approval28 the publication of the 911 commissions report in july 2004 provided the impetus for congressional action in an election year the 911 commissions recommendations regarding the role of the new dni appear to have been based primarily on the perceived inability of the dci to ensure interagency communications and effectively control the allocation of intelligence assets the commission noted 26 us congress senate to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2003 for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the united states government the community management account and the central intelligence agency retirement and disability

to ensure that all agencies concentrated significant resources on the terrorist group29 the commission also noted efforts in the 1990s to address the dcis perceived lack of personnel and budget authority over intelligence agencies it further pointed out the results of intelligence reorganization legislation introduced in the 1996 the department of defense and its congressional authorizing committees rose in opposition to the proposed changes the president and the dci did not actively support these changes relatively small changes made in 1996 gave the dci consultative authority and created new deputy for management and assistant dcis for collection and analysis the reforms occurred only after the senate select committee on intelligence took the unprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense authorization bill indeed rather than increasing the dcis authorities over national intelligence the 1990s witnessed movement in the opposite direction through for example the transfer of the cias imaging analysis capability to the new imagery and mapping agency created within the department of defense30 nevertheless as former representative hamilton the vice chairman of the 911 commission testified i do not recall us finding failure of dod agency so far as we know but we certainly think that part of the problem has been an unwillingness to share the information that number of agencies had31 although some observers argued that the wall separating intelligence and law enforcement agencies may have been primary reason for the unwillingness to share information and that the wall had been effectively removed by the usa patriot act of october 2001 pl 10756 the recommendation of the 911 commission to establish dni with stronger oversight and management responsibilities for all intelligence agencies including components of law enforcement agencies was ultimately accepted by both the bush administration and the congress as described below the intelligence reform act provides the dni with important statutory authorities in the intelligence budget process it also enhances the reprogramming authorities of the dni the dni may transfer or reprogram funds within the national intelligence program with the approval of the director of the office of management and budget after consultation with heads of department affected and subject to provisions in annual appropriations acts in addition the funds must be transferred to an activity that is higher priority intelligence activity that supports an emergent need or improves program effectiveness the transfer or reprogramming out of any department or agency in single fiscal year must be less than 150 million or 5 of the amounts available to the department or agency from 29 911

these limitations do not apply if the transfer has the concurrence of the department or agency head involved multiple types of isr programs one argument that has been used by those who have proposed major reorganization of intelligence programming and budgeting is that the different categories of intelligence programs are obsolete in todays complex technological and threat environment isr programs are currently grouped into three major categories the national intelligence program nip the joint military intelligence program jmip and tactical intelligence and related activities tiara32 the three categories of intelligence activities used in programming and budgeting are based on the different consumer being served different management arrangements and different oversight in congress33 nip programs serve national decisionmaking the nip formerly nfip is defined in statute as all programs projects and activities of the intelligence community as well as any other programs of the intelligence community designated jointly by the director of central intelligence and the head of united states department or agency or by the president such term does not include programs projects or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by united states armed forces34 the nip is usually described as consisting of programs to support national decisionmakers especially the president the national security council nsc staff and heads of cabinet departments especially the secretaries of state and defense major nip programs include central intelligence agency program ciap general defense intelligence program gdip consolidated cryptologic program ccp 32 nip is defined by statute 50 usc

nonintelligence components of the military services open source materials and economic statistics that are of great importance to policy makers military leaders and to intelligence analysts but such collection is not undertaken by intelligence agencies and is not included in intelligence budgets 33 intelligence spending totals remain classified although appropriations levels for fy1997 266

geodesy program the defense general intelligence and applications program that includes subprograms managed by dia and other agencies in support of dod commands37 in its report on the fy2001

use with the jstars aircraft funds for extending naval space surveillance hyper spectral sensing systems on air force uavs and tactical video system for special operations forces40 an annual list of tiara programs is not published although some are indicated in appropriations reports41 unlike jmip programs which tend to be completely intelligence systems tiara includes related activities systems that are essentially parts of various weapons systems and that can be reclassified out of tiara over number of years it has become apparent that to consumers of intelligence distinctions among nip jmip and tiara programs are becoming indistinct as the intelligence resource managers guide noted as systems grow in complexity and capability and methods become more sophisticated increasing numbers of intelligence assets are capable of simultaneously serving both national and tactical purposes42 for example there has been for number of years program known as tactical exploitation of national capabilities tencap which is designed to facilitate the use of satellite imagery and other nip products by military commanders in some military engagements with important diplomatic and political implications lowlevel tactical intelligence acquired through tiara systems is also desired by senior officials to support their efforts at crisis management in august 2004 testimony under secretary of defense for intelligence stephen cambone stated in response to question about the existence of clear line between national and tactical intelligence 38 us congress house permanent select committee on

least during my tenure trying to merge and blur the line and distinction between what is strategic and tactical and what is national and military since its increasingly difficult to distinguish either in the product that is produced or in the capability that is applied so global hawks which are built by the air force are as significant and important as sigint satellites that are built by the national reconnaissance office and whose take is managed by the national security agency43 as result some observers argued that the three categories of isr programs cannot be meaningfully considered by themselves they must be considered as parts of greater whole and accordingly the nip jmip and tiara categories are outmoded changing the statutes regulations and rules which established the three categories obviously would be difficult and would affect organizational relationships in both executive and legislative branches one result of abolishing the system could mean devolution of acquisition to multitude of program managers throughout the military services an approach that most observers would argue could have major drawbacks some have suggested that the growing interrelationships among nip jmip and tiara systems may complicate provisions in the intelligence reform act that establish separate responsibilities for nip on one hand and jmip and tiara on the other arguably the act could complicate rather than facilitate effort to coordinate the acquisition and operation of isr systems major challenge for the office of the dni when activated will be to coordinate isr programs within the nip for which it is primarily responsible with those that are in jmip and tiara for which the defense department has primary responsibility the same types of coordinative mechanisms that have long existed will undoubtedly continue to be required in any event congress will have major influence on isr acquisition it may also choose to determine whether the enhanced authorities of the dni in comparison to those of the dci permit more effective coordination of isr programs isr programming and budgeting procedures differ among agencies programming and budgeting of isr systems have been managed by the department of defense dod and its many components and by the intelligence community through the office responsible to the dci for interagency coordination the community management staff cms the office of management and budget omb also plays critical role in allocating budgetary goals that can constrain intelligence spending proposals congressional responsibilities are spread among armed services intelligence appropriations and other committees although it would be easy to question the number of entities involved the reality is that the overlap results from the evolution of multiplicity of systems and the variety of consumers whereas nasa can singlehandedly manage moon probe intelligence agency will ordinarily by itself collect analyze and disseminate finished 43 stephen cambone undersecretary of defense for intelligence testimony before house armed services committee august 11 2004 crs16 intelligence different procedures used for different isr systems by different agencies can also complicate efforts to achieve compatibility and maximize effectiveness role of the dcidni prior to passage of the intelligence reform act the dci was responsible for facilitating the development of an annual budget for intelligence and intelligence related activities and for presenting to the president an annual budget for the nfip he participated in the development by the secretary of defense of the annual budgets for jmip and tiara observers have argued that these responsibilities did not provide for the comprehensive management of isr programs that is needed although the 911 commission did not focus at length on the role of the dci in systems acquisition it concluded that there was an urgent need to restructure the intelligence community and establish stronger authorities for the dci or dni44 consideration of intelligence reform legislation in the 108th congress included extensive debate on the role of the new dni in developing budgets and overseeing their execution on one side was determination to ensure that the dni would be effectively in charge of the entire intelligence community and able to direct its resources at the most critical threats on the other was determination to ensure that the combat support agencies of the department of defense would not be diverted by nondod officials the language incorporated in the final version that became law requires that the dni provide based on priorities set by the president guidance to departments and agencies regarding their portion of the national intelligence program then based on budget proposals provided by agency and department heads the dni is to develop and determine the annual nip budget funds appropriated by congress are to be apportioned by the omb at the exclusive direction of the director of national intelligence furthermore department comptrollers or appropriate budget execution officers shall allot allocate reprogram or transfer funds appropriated for the national intelligence program in an expeditious manner45 the legislation did not however repeal statutory authorities of the secretary of defense for managing the components of dod in addition section 1018 requires that the president issue guidelines to ensure the effective implementation and execution of the dnis authorities in manner that respects and does not abrogate the statutory responsibilities of the heads of other departments some believe that this provision reflects separate even conflicting priorities and suggest that it may be as difficult to write the guidelines as it was to draft the legislation much of the media analysis of this question tends to focus on turf battle and differences among key officials although elements of individual and bureaucratic competition are inevitable the underlying reality is that intelligence systems must 44 see 911 commission report pp 407416 45 pl 108458 section 1011 crs17 support different sets of consumers serious observers suggest that duplicate systems could be available in the foreseeable future priorities in acquisition of new systems and in tasking collection must be set and the mechanisms of coordination will inevitably be subject to different but legitimate requirements of different agencies and policymakers in recent years the cia budget the only part of the nip that has been managed solely by the dci is comprised mainly of personnel expenses the salaries of case officers assets analysts managers etc along with associated costs for equipment buildings and grounds in the past the cia was also involved in significant procurement efforts such as reconnaissance satellites manned aircraft such as the u2 and uavs46 the cia program is managed by the executive director of the cia senior staff official at cia other agencies play relatively minor role in cia acquisition efforts role of the secretary of defense the secretary of defense has had major role in developing programs to address dods intelligence needs and in managing most nip programs the national security act assigns to the secretary of defense the responsibility to ensure in consultation with the dci that 1 the budgets of the elements of the intelligence community within the department of defense are adequate to satisfy the overall intelligence needs of the department of defense including the needs of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the commanders of the unified and specified commands and wherever such elements are performing governmentwide functions the needs of other departments and agencies 2 ensure appropriate implementation of the policies and resource decisions of the director of central intelligence by elements of the department of defense within the national foreign intelligence program 3 ensure that the tactical intelligence activities of the department of defense complement and are compatible with intelligence activities under the national foreign intelligence program47 executive order eo 12333 united states intelligence activities required that the dci together with the secretary of defense ensure that there is unnecessary overlap between national foreign intelligence programs and department of defense intelligence programs48 there have been in addition number of interagency 46 in recent years such procurement has been the responsibility of dod agencies but in the first months of the george w bush administration there was considerable discussion of predator uav acquisition that is carefully documented in the 911 commission report see us national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report july 2004 pp 210214 47 50 usc 4035 48 section 15q eo 12333 was signed on december 4 1981 by president reagan and continued crs18 agreements within the executive branch that govern the coordination of intelligence programs and budget processes49 most nip programs have been managed by the defense department national programs managed by dod are gathered into several intelligence program categories the general defense intelligence program gdip the consolidated cryptologic program ccp the dod foreign counterintelligence program fcip the national geospatialintelligence program formerly the national imagery and mapping agency program nimap and the national reconnaissance program nrp50 in some cases single agency within dod has managed one program in other cases responsibility has been shared the ccp is managed by nsa the gdip largely covers the work of dia the ccp is implemented by nsa geospatial intelligence is the responsibility of the nga the nrp is the responsibility of the nro and specialized programs are found in various agencies and offices counterintelligence fcip is responsibility of all agencies satellites and sigint responsibilities of the nro nga and nsa are the largest isr programs and constitute very sizable portion of the estimated 40 billion in annual intelligence spending changes in dods management of isr overall coordination of these programs within dod was for years the responsibility of the assistant secretary of defense for communications command control and intelligence c3i but in may 2003 these functions were transferred to the under secretary of defense for intelligence newly created post headed by stephen cambone longtime associate of defense secretary rumsfeld the usdi is granted authority to lead departmental activities in programmatic processes related to intelligence and intelligencerelated programs including but not limited to program change proposals program evaluations assessments and recommendations51 cambone has noted that making decisions on isr programs early in the process could have major implications for years ahead there are lot of efforts i think perhaps more than some people appreciate that are either early in their development or just beginning or are envisioned over the next 18 months or so where choice between spending the dollar in one direction or another could have big payoff 48 continued remains in effect 49 intelligence resource managers guide 1997 edition

counterintelligence program department of treasury office of intelligence support program department of energy foreign intelligence program cia retirement and disability system ciards and the community management account cma it is to be noted that funding for only the last two programs ciards and cma is unclassified and identified in annual intelligence authorization legislation 51 see john liang and keith j costa pentagon reworking unified command structure to better exploit ncw inside the pentagon october 9 2003 p 1 crs19 downstream52 the ultimate role of cambone and his successors may not be fully determined as yet but the establishment of his office appears to reflect more centralized and coordinated approach to isr acquisition the intelligence reform act provides important acquisition and management authorities over dods national intelligence programs to the dni these authorities will have to be implemented in way that is consistent with the existing authorities of the defense department the timing and contours of the implementation process are as yet uncertain how isr funding is included in dods budget managing programs involves planning for future acquisition preparation of budget documents and monitoring expenditures intelligence funds are programmed budgeted and expended in accordance with defense department procedures53 they are contained with the budgets 050 national defense function within function 051 dod budget or function 054 defenserelated activities categories funds for cia are included hidden in the dod budget but once appropriated are transferred by omb directly to the dci for execution of the eleven major programs in dods future years defense program fydp most isr funding is in program 3 command control communications intelligence and space funding for other programs such as aircraft may include intelligencerelated research and development training and intelligencerelated functions may be in other categories these major categories are in turn divided into program elements pes that can be aggregated for different purposes including the identification of intelligence efforts slightly more than half of annual authorized intelligence spending is devoted to the agencies that are part of the nip the remainder goes to programs that are part of jmip and tiara jmip programs extend beyond one service and are included in defense authorization and appropriations bills some jmip programs are the responsibility of single defense agency while others are managed by one service as an executive agent for the rest of dod funding for specific intelligence programs is included in the budgets of the services and defense agencies this funding is largely hidden in appropriations legislation although some rdte programs with special code names are known to fund intelligence efforts other funds are included in larger pots of money such as the appropriation account om defensewide tiara programs are usually managed by single service for its own forces one analyst describes tiara as nothing more than reporting concept it is designation applied to aggregations of programs projects and activities in military service budgets that provide tacticallevel intelligence and related support to military operations these aggregations comprise two types of assets ie organic military 52 amy butler cambone dod intel community launch study for horizontal integration defense daily september 30 2003 p 8 53 except for the comparatively small intelligence accounts of the state justice and treasury departments crs20 intelligence assets and funding for servicespecific tactical intelligence programs54 as reporting concept the tiara category consists of variety of programs that may vary from year to year in some cases it may be difficult to distinguish among tiara programs and other surveillance and targeting efforts that may not be categorized as tiara to complicate matters further surveillance programs may be characterized as tiara one year but not necessarily the next55 tiara programs are perhaps the most challenging to review because they are forwarded as part of budget requests from the three military departments they have to be disaggregated and considered along with tiara programs of the other services process that is not necessarily easy and may involve program that the parent service believes to be an integral part of favored weapons system under such circumstances assessing tradeoffs among intelligence programs can become difficult similarly when weapon system with tiara component is delayed or cancelled there can be significant implications for intelligence efforts that were designed to be integrated with the delayed or cancelled effort internal dod coordinating boards number of steps have been taken in the past to ensure an integrated approach to intelligence programs whether nip jmip or tiara an unusual dod entity the expanded defense resources board consisting not only of senior dod military and civilian officials but also the dci was established in the mid1990s to provide broader executive branch review another interagency review entity is the intelligence program review group which reviews issues analyzes priorities and studies funding alternatives at the staff level prior to consideration by the expanded defense resources board coordination between dod and the ic different procedures used by the defense department and the intelligence community in dealing with the diffuse efforts that are collectively part of the collection analysis and dissemination of intelligence have long been source of concern to resource managers as noted in the intelligence resource managers guide by 1993 there was perceived need to depict intelligence capabilities and associated resources b ensure adequate levels of detail for program review and analysis c ensure that compatible processes were in place to support decisionmaking the time had come to tear down barriers that had made it difficult to identify shortfalls and unwanted nfiptiara duplication56 accordingly at congressional urging the thendci r james woolsey undertook number of measures during his tenure 19931995 to ensure comprehensive review process by adjusting schedules to ensure that dod and ic 54 intelligence resource managers guide p 58 emphases in original

crs21 milestones coincided and that there were joint tiaranfip reviews and that common budget framework was established to make characterization of nfip and tiara resources consistent the goal was to allow resource managers to peer across seams into all programs projects and activities containing dollars andor manpower assets designed to meet the same or similar types of missions57 one goal was to identify changes in one program that might have an unintended consequence eg eliminating tiara program to collect imagery by an airborne sensor might lead to requirement for additional and more expensive satellite coverage of the area previously covered by reconnaissance aircraft implementation of this effort began with the fy1995 budget and continues to be used related changes involved dod including the expanded defense resources board and the intelligence program review group an interagency mission requirements board was established by the community management staff to ensure that the national and tactical needs of all consumers were addressed the process has been coordinated by dod and intelligence community officials ranging from the secretary of defense and dci down to lowerlevel budget specialists the dci and the secretary of defense represented by the under secretary of defense for intelligence are responsible for jointly deciding major issues and negotiating any percentage reductions that might be required to meet cuts ordered by the president or omb while their respective staffs interact in defining issues and preparing submissions to congressional committees in practice some observers believe that dod has greater influence in the process given its size and the need to ensure that the military services have the intelligence they need to meet their operational responsibilities58 congressional oversight of isr programs procedures for congressional oversight of intelligence activities also affect the acquisition of isr resources on capitol hill the nip is overseen by the two congressional intelligence committees hpscis jurisdiction is specified in programmatic terms it has oversight over nip along with intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of all other departments and agencies of the government including the tactical intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the department of defense59 senate rules on the other hand focus on agencies ssci has jurisdiction over the cia dia nsa other dod agencies and subdivisions and the intelligence activities of the state department and the fbi crucial difference between the two chambers is the exclusion from sscis jurisdiction of tactical military intelligence serving national policymaking function60 hpsci oversees jmip and tiara programs coordinating with the house armed services committee in practice ssci also has an opportunity to provide comments on jmip and tiara programs to the armed services committee 57 ibid 58 see loch k johnson the dci vs the eighthundred pound gorilla international journal of intelligence and counterintelligence spring 2000 59 rule x section 11bb of the house of representatives 60 sres 400 section 14a 94th congress crs22 which has primary jurisdiction both intelligence committees have sole jurisdiction over budgets for the cia the cia retirement system and the community management staff after committee review all nip programs are included in annual intelligence authorization legislation nip programs are included as well as national defense authorization bills jmip and tiara programs are authorized by hpsci and the house armed services committee as result of differing jurisdictions of the two intelligence committees the senate armed services committees authorizes jmip and tiara expenditures ssci does not have authorizing authority over jmip and tiara but it reviews and analyzes the jmip and tiara budget request and recommends actions to the armed services committee although the relationship between intelligence committees and armed services committees is generally cooperative in some instances their approaches have differed the national defense authorization act of fy1997 pl 104201 established the national imagery and mapping agency nima despite the misgivings of members of hpsci61 the position of under secretary of defense for intelligence was established by the fy2003 national defense authorization act pl 107314 section 901 not by an intelligence authorization act similarly it was the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 section 921 that changed the name of nima to the national geospatialintelligence agency not intelligence authorization legislation conclusion despite the existence of the coordinative mechanisms described above congress formally expressed its concerns that isr has been illcoordinated in part coordination difficulties have derived from the challenges faced by large governmental organizations in managing fastmoving technological developments in addition us postcold war defense planning continues to evolve into new and uncertain approaches to wide variety of possible conflict situations this evolution may make it even more difficult to reach consensus on isr requirements in future years how the provisions of the intelligence reform act will be implemented remains unknown many complex issues will have to be addressed including the roles of congressional authorizing and appropriations committees in regard to isr systems the act provides the dni with an opportunity and staff the community management staff is to be transferred to the office of the dni to assess whether governmentwide isr requirements are being effectively addressed some observers believe that past failures to satisfy congressional concerns about coordination resulted in significant measure from the lower relative influence of the dci and the community management staff compared with that of the secretary of defense and dod the dci was arguably at disadvantage in any dispute with 61 see anne daugherty miles the creation of the national imagery and mapping agency congresss role as overseer joint military intelligence college occasional paper number nine april 2001 crs23 dod because of the latters size influence and prestige similarly questions have existed regarding the relative influence of intelligence and armed services committees and some members have suggested that certain intelligence matters should receive oversight from other committees the intelligence reform act did not specify procedures for congressional oversight but congress may choose to develop new approaches to reviewing isr programs some observers go so far as to argue that longstanding distinctions among national joint military and tactical systems have outlived their usefulness and that more comprehensive approach should be attempted since these distinctions are provided for in statutes and have been recently been included in the intelligence reform act any major changes would require further congressional action there is widespread sense that the optimal mix of isr systems has not yet been determined admittedly it would be almost impossible to design analytical processes that would identify definitive options for isr systems readily acceptable to all interested parties the diverse nature of the systems the multiple customers for data the number of intelligence agencies and the dynamics of everchanging isr technologies make multiyear roadmap extremely difficult yet more disciplined assessment of the potential advantages and disadvantages of different isr options could be required for review in the executive branch and in congressional committees given the potential for the need for future budgetary restraints on isr programs with or without new procedural framework the acquisition of expensive new systems will undoubtedly remain an especially complex challenge to government decisionmakers crs24 appendix case study in isr acquisition the future imagery architecture fia and global hawk uavs efforts to procure new generation of reconnaissance satellites and high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles uavs serve as case study that illustrates the dilemmas involved in the acquisitions of intelligence platforms and systems both of the these expensive and technologically sophisticated platforms can support national policymakers as well as military commanders each has strengths and limitations62 while serious observer would argue that us isr requirements could be met by only one approach many believe that there have been insufficient efforts to achieve an appropriate mix that provides optimal collection capabilities while avoiding unnecessary duplication or wasted resources satellite imagery has long been one of the most valuable tools of the intelligence profession the need for to obtain accurate estimates of soviet military forces in the mid1950s led the united states in order to avoid highly dangerous overflights by conventional aircraft to develop special planes that could fly at very high altitudes and ultimately to build reconnaissance satellites that could identify small objects from space satellite imagery became the cornerstone of arms control efforts in the cold war and coupled with the availability of precision guided munitions became the key to those postcold war defense tactics that rely on highly selective targeting to destroy selected targets with minimal collateral damage satellite programs are among the most expensive intelligence efforts with individual satellites costing billion dollars each the need to replace aging satellite programs led the intelligence community in the mid1990s to initiate the future imagery architecture fia program that is intended to provide greater number of smaller satellites that can provide coverage of more regions for longer periods fia has however received considerable criticism in 1998 the house intelligence committee has concluded for several years the committee has been concerned with the increasing costs of several major national reconnaissance office nro programs and the nrps national reconnaissance program through which the nro is funded growing share of the nfip budget not seeing any relief from the tight fiscal environment the committee has sought to find technological innovations and managerial reforms in the nrp that could reduce costs this goal lay behind the committees push to shift to larger numbers of smaller satellites which the committee thought also would provide better performance against hard targets 62 in the 1980s manned aircraft especially the sr71 blackbird which flew at very high altitudes had an important role in overhead reconnaissance but limited inventories of skilled pilots with highly specialized training and the potential for human casualties were among the factors that led to demise of the program u2s which fly at somewhat lower altitudes remain in service manned aircraft continue to constitute an important component of us isr capabilities see nick cook isr manned or unmanned going solo janes defence weekly november 19 2003 crs25 reduce satellite vulnerability and help to counter foreign denial and deception practices the committee in summary is not satisfied that all appropriate measures have been taken to reduce or control costs in the nrp or to adequately measure the costeffectiveness of all overhead collection activities the committee believes that the dci needs to exercise much more knowledgeable and diligent oversight of nro programs with an eye to freeing up funds for investment elsewhere wherever possible this oversight must extend from requirements tradeoffs to cost estimating to acquisition oversight the dci also needs to acquire the expertise necessary to make tradeoffs across the major nfip programs the dci can longer afford to rely on the major program managers to police their organizations and budgets the committee has recommended additional funds for the dci to accelerate the development of these capabilities63 one media account in december 2002 reported that the national reconnaissance offices nextgeneration spy satellites known as future imagery architecture are more than year delayed and almost 3 billion over cost spurring an internal pentagon debate about whether to proceed with the program at all say people familiar with the discussions64 further criticism was voiced in may 2003 by task force established by the defense science board which submitted report finding that the fia program under contract at the time of our review to be significantly underfunded and technically flawed the task force believes that the fia program thus structured is not executable65 the process of satellite procurement and the role of the dci visavis dod has come under some criticism one former cia official who worked with the nro has described an incredibly inefficient requirements process and suggested that the dcis role has been reduced to the detriment of the overall satellite reconnaissance effort the process for deriving the requirements for the new imagery architecture fia took two years and makes the point about the dcis diminished power clear dod and the joint requirements oversight council jroc played key roles in the fia requirements process now dod essentially controls all major nro requirements the dci and the cia have let dod significantly erode what 63 us congress house permanent select committee on intelligence intelligence

around 2008 absorbs major portion of the intelligence budget and reportedly continues to be plagued with serious delays and management problems67 according to one media account the program is more than year behind schedule and is forcing shift of some 4 billion from other isr programs68some observers have accordingly suggested that many of the capabilities of reconnaissance satellites could be realized by relying on less expensive highaltitude unmanned aerial vehicles such as global hawk which has recently become available for operational missions and has been used during operation iraq freedom proponents of global hawks which have been estimated to cost some 57 million per unit maintain that these vehicles could provide considerable portion of the imagery that could otherwise be obtainable by satellites that cost many times that figure69 there are advantages and disadvantages to both satellites and uavs as well as manned aircraft which can also be used advantageously in some circumstances satellites have been considered invulnerable to attacks from all but the most sophisticated adversary and can be launched from us territory70 they are in orbit for years and can be shifted from target to target as needs change on the other hand they are expensive and there are inevitably limited numbers in the us inventory global hawks on the other hand can be launched when needed and can be targeted by local commanders they do not however have the capability to remain overhead for lengthy periods sometimes termed longdwell capability and they may be vulnerable to attack while inexpensive in comparison with satellites they are far too costly to be considered expendable as is the case with some tactical uavs 66 robert kohler one officers perspective the decline of the

corresponding powerpayload upgrades are added in fact the air force projects that the average total unit cost including all program costs will exceed 75 million per copy there is now an effort to flood the global hawk program with money there are ad hoc plans for rapid major upgrades before requirements have been established and sign of serious examination of where and how global hawk fits into an overall collection architecture dod has taken serious steps to be able to relay and process the huge amounts of data from global hawk or to process exploit and disseminate all the data that fleet of 51 global hawks with highly capable sensors will generate71 satellites are budgeted under nip and operated by the nro global hawk uavs on the other hand have been budgeted under jmip and operated by air force components of regional commands these separate paths have made the possibility of potential tradeoffs between space and uav collection vastly more difficult observers sense that current procedures to integrate intelligence acquisition efforts have not led to comprehensive assessment of major issues relating to satellite and uav programs if uavs can do at least part of the work of satellites then arguably considerable budgetary savings might be realized on the other hand failure to take advantage of us satellite technological superiority could limit intelligence
