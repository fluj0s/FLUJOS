estonian government efforts to deal w ith the problem some 130000 russianspeakers in estonia are stateless about 10 of the population over 100000 more have adopted russian citizenship they are denied estoni an citizenship by estonian law because they or their ancestors were not tonian citizens before the sovi et takeover of estonia in 1940 and they have not successfully completed naturalization

estonia moved the bronze soldier world war iiera statue of soviet soldier from park in the capital tallinn to another location along with the bodies of red army soldiers buried nearby the move provoked furious reaction among some ethni c russians in estonia and from russian government leaders who viewed the acti on as dishonoring red army soldiers who liberated estonia from the nazis for their part many estonians see the liberation as the exchange of nazi domination for soviet one and not worthy of prominent commemoration in addition to harsh verbal attacks from moscow harassment of estonias ambassador to moscow by youth groups with close ties to the kremlin and violent demonstrations by hundreds of ethnic ru ssians in estonia estonias internet infrastructure came under heavy attack from hackers in late april and early may estonian officials said some assaults came from russian government web servers although many others came from all over the wo rld these cyberattacks
