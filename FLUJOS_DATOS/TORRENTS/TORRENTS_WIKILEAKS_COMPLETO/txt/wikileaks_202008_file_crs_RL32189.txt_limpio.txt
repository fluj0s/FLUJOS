specialist in resource and environmental policy resources science and industry division terrorism and security issues facing the water infrastructure sector summary damage to or destruction of the nations water supply and water quality infrastructure by terrorist attack or natural disaster could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country threatening public health and the environment or possibly causing loss of life interest in such problems has increased greatly since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states across the country water infrastructure systems extend over vast areas and ownership and operation responsibility are both public and private but are overwhelmingly nonfederal since the attacks federal dam operators and local water and wastewater utilities have been under heightened security conditions and are evaluating security plans and measures there are federal standards or agreed upon industry practices within the water infrastructure sector to govern readiness response to security incidents and recovery efforts to develop protocols and tools are ongoing since the 2001 terrorist attacks this report presents an overview of this large and diverse sector describes securityrelated actions by the government and private sector since september 11 and discusses additional policy issues and responses including congressional interest policymakers have been considering number of initiatives including enhanced physical security better communication and coordination and research key issue is how additional protections and resources directed at public and private sector priorities will be funded in response congress has provided 794 million in appropriations for security at water infrastructure facilities to assess and protect federal facilities and support security assessment and risk reduction activities by non federal facilities and passed bill requiring drinking water utilities to conduct security vulnerability assessments pl 107188 when congress created the department of homeland security dhs in 2002 pl 107297 it gave dhs responsibilities to coordinate information to secure the nations critical infrastructure including the water sector under homeland security presidential directive7 the environmental protection agency epa is the lead federal agency for protecting drinking water and wastewater utility systems recent congressional interest has focused on two legislative issues 1 security of wastewater utilities and 2 whether to include water utilities in chemical security regulations implemented by dhs in the 109th congress senate committee approved legislation to encourage wastewater treatment works to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop site security plans s 2781 similar legislation was introduced in the 110th congress s 1968 but there was further action on this legislation also in the 110th congress bills to extend dhss chemical facilities antiterrorism standards were considered but not enacted one bill hr 5533 would preserve an existing exemption for water utilities from chemical facility standards while another hr 5577 would include them in the scope of dhs security rules continuing attention to these issues is possible along with interest in how the federal government coordinates its own activities and communicates policies and information to the water infrastructure sector contents introduction 1 background 2 responses to security concerns 3 epa 7 reclamation and the corps 9 department of homeland security 9

security issues facing the water infrastructure sector introduction the september 11 2001 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon have drawn attention to the security of many institutions facilities and systems in the united states including the nations water supply and water quality infrastructure these systems have long been recognized as being potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks of various types including physical disruption bioterrorismchemical contamination and cyber attack damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country threatening public health and the environment or possibly causing loss of life further since most water infrastructure is governmentowned it may serve as symbolic and political target for some this report presents an overview of this large and diverse sector describes securityrelated actions by the government and private sector since september 11 and discusses additional policy issues and responses including congressional interest the potential for terrorism is not new in 1941 federal bureau of investigation director j edgar hoover wrote it has long been recognized that among public utilities water supply facilities offer particularly vulnerable point of attack to the foreign agent due to the strategic position they occupy in keeping the wheels of industry turning and in preserving the health and morale of the american populace1 water infrastructure systems also are highly linked with other infrastructure systems especially electric power and transportation as well as the chemical industry which supplies treatment chemicals making security of all of them an issue of concern these types of vulnerable interconnections were evident for example during the august 2003 electricity blackout in the northeast united states wastewater treatment plants in cleveland detroit new york and other locations that lacked backup generation systems lost power and discharged millions of gallons of untreated sewage during the emergency and power failures at drinking water plants led to boil water advisories in many communities likewise natural disasters such as the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes and 2007 mississippi river floods caused extensive and costly damage to multiple infrastructure systems transportation water electric power and telecommunications 1 je hoover water supply facilities and national defense journal of the american water works association vol 33 11 1941 1861 crs2 background broadly speaking water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources of untreated water for municipal industrial agricultural and household needs dams reservoirs aqueducts and pipes that contain and transport raw water treatment facilities that remove contaminants from raw water finished water reservoirs systems that distribute water to users and wastewater collection and treatment facilities across the country these systems comprise approximately 77000 dams and reservoirs thousands of miles of pipes aqueducts water distribution and sewer lines 168000 public drinking water facilities many serving as few as 25 customers and about 16000 publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities all of these systems and facilities must be operable 24 hours day seven days week ownership and management are both public and private the federal government has ownership responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures but the vast majority of the nations water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by nonfederal units of government the federal government has built hundreds of water projects primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigation development and flood control with municipal and industrial water use as an incidental selffinanced project purpose many of these facilities are critically entwined with the nations overall water supply transportation and electricity infrastructure the largest federal facilities were built and are managed by the bureau of reclamation reclamation of the department of the interior and the us army corps of engineers corps of the department of defense reclamation reservoirs particularly those along the colorado river supply water to millions of people in southern california arizona and nevada via reclamation and nonreclamation aqueducts reclamations inventory of assets includes 471 dams and dikes that create 348 reservoirs with total storage capacity of 245 million acrefeet of water reclamation projects also supply water to 9 million acres of farmland and other municipal and industrial water users in the 17 western states the corps operates 276 navigation locks 11000 miles of commercial navigation channel and approximately 1200 projects of varying types including 609 dams it supplies water to thousands of cities towns and industries from the 95 million acrefeet of water stored in its 116 lakes and reservoirs throughout the country including service to approximately one million residents of the district of columbia and portions of northern virginia the largest corps and reclamation facilities also produce enormous amounts of power for example hoover and glen canyon dams on the colorado river represent 23 of the installed electrical capacity of the bureau of reclamations 58 power plants in the west and 7 of the total installed capacity in the western united states similarly corps facilities and reclamations grand coulee dam on the columbia river provide 43 of the total installed hydroelectric capacity in the west 25 nationwide still despite its critical involvement in such projects especially in the west the federal government is responsible for only about 5 of the dams whose failure could result in loss of life or significant property damage the remaining dams belong to state or local governments utilities and corporate or private owners crs3 fairly small number of large drinking water and wastewater utilities located primarily in urban areas about 15 of the systems provide water services to more than 75 of the us population arguably these systems represent the greatest targets of opportunity for terrorist attacks while the large number of small systems that each serve fewer than 10000 persons are less likely to be perceived as key targets by terrorists who might seek to disrupt water infrastructure systems however the more numerous smaller systems also tend to be less protected and thus are potentially more vulnerable to attack whether by vandals or terrorists successful attack on even small system could cause widespread panic economic impacts and loss of public confidence in water supply systems attacks resulting in physical destruction to any of these systems could include disruption of operating or distribution system components power or telecommunications systems electronic control systems and actual damage to reservoirs and pumping stations loss of flow and pressure would cause problems for customers and would hinder firefighting efforts further destruction of large dam could result in catastrophic flooding and loss of life bioterrorism or chemical attacks could deliver widespread contamination with small amounts of microbiological agents or toxic chemicals and could endanger the public health of thousands while some experts believe that risks to water systems actually are small because it would be difficult to introduce sufficient quantities of agents to cause widespread harm concern and heightened awareness of potential problems are apparent factors that are relevant to biological agents potential as weapon include its stability in drinking water system virulence culturability in the quantity required and resistance to detection and treatment cyber attacks on computer operations can affect an entire infrastructure network and hacking in water utility systems could result in theft or corruption of information or denial and disruption of service responses to security concerns water infrastructure system designers managers and operators have long made preparing for extreme events standard practice historically their focus has been on natural events major storms blizzards and earthquakes some of which could be predicted hours or longer before they occurred when considering the risk of manmade threats operators generally focused on purposeful acts such as vandalism or theft by disgruntled employees or customers rather than broader malevolent threats by terrorists domestic or foreign the events of september 11 2001 changed this focus federal dam operators went on highalert immediately following the september 11 terrorist attacks reclamation closed its visitor facilities at grand coulee hoover and glen canyon dams because of potential loss of life and property downstream if breached security threats are under constant review and coordination efforts with both the national guard and local law enforcement officials are ongoing the corps also operates under continued high defense alert and temporarily closed all its facilities to visitors after september 11 although locks and dams remained operational most closed facilities later reopened but security continues to be reassessed following heightened alert issued by the federal government in february 2003 reclamation implemented additional security crs4 measures which remain in effect at dams powerplants and other facilities including limited access to facilities and roads closure of some visitor centers and random vehicle inspections although officials believe that risks to water and wastewater utilities are small operators have been under heightened security conditions since september 11 local utilities have primary responsibility to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize them for necessary security improvements most especially in urban areas have emergency preparedness plans that address issues such as redundancy of operations public notification and coordination with law enforcement and emergency response officials however many plans were developed to respond to natural disasters domestic threats such as vandalism and in some cases cyber attacks drinking water and wastewater utilities coordinated efforts to prepare for possible y2k impacts on their computer systems on january 1 2000 but these efforts focused more on cyber security than physical terrorism concerns thus it was unclear whether previously existing plans incorporate sufficient procedures to address other types of terrorist threats utility officials are reluctant to disclose details of their systems or these confidential plans since doing so might alert terrorists to vulnerabilities water supply was one of eight critical infrastructure systems identified in president clintons 1998 presidential decision directive 63 pdd632 as part of coordinated national effort to achieve the capability to protect the nations critical infrastructure from intentional acts that would diminish them these efforts focused primarily on the 340 large community water supply systems which each serve more than 100000 persons the environmental protection agency epa was identified as the lead federal agency for liaison with the water supply sector in response in 2000 epa established partnership with the american metropolitan water association amwa and american water works association awwa to jointly undertake measures to safeguard water supplies from terrorist acts awwas research foundation contracted with the department of energys sandia national laboratory to develop vulnerability assessment tool for water systems as an extension of methodology for assessing federal dams epa supported project with the sandia lab to pilot test the physical vulnerability assessment tool and develop cyber vulnerability assessment tool an information sharing and analysis center isac supported by an epa grant became operational under amwas leadership in december 2002 it will allow for dissemination of alerts to drinking water and wastewater utilities about potential threats or vulnerabilities to the integrity of their operations that have been detected and viable resolutions to problems3 research on water sector infrastructure protection has been underway for some time the department of the army conducts research in the area of detection and treatment to remove various chemical agents the federal emergency management agency fema has led an effort to produce databases of water distribution systems and to develop assessment tools for evaluating threats posed by the introduction of biological or chemical agent into water system the centers for disease control 2 the clinton administrations policy on critical infrastructure protection presidential decision directive 63 may 22 1998 see httpwwwfasorgirpoffdocspaper598htm 3 for additional information see httpwwwwaterisacorg crs5 and prevention is developing guidance on potential biological agents and the effects of standard water treatment practices on their persistence however in the january 2001 report of the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection ongoing water sector research was then characterized as small effort that leaves number of gaps and shortfalls relative to us water supplies4 this report stated that gaps exist in four major areas concerns that remain relevant and are guiding policymakers now threatvulnerability risk assessments identification and characterization of biological and chemical agents need to establish center of excellence to support communities in conducting vulnerability and risk assessment and application of information assurance techniques to computerized systems used by water utilities as well as the oil gas and electric sectors for operational data and control operations less attention has been focused on protecting wastewater treatment facilities than drinking water systems perhaps because destruction of them likely represents more of an environmental threat ie by release of untreated sewage than direct threat to life or public welfare vulnerabilities do exist however large underground collector sewers could be accessed by terrorist groups for purposes of placing destructive devices beneath buildings or city streets pipelines can be made into weapons via the introduction of highly flammable substance such as gasoline through manhole or inlet explosions in the sewers can cause collapse of roads sidewalks and adjacent structures and injure and kill people nearby damage to wastewater facility prevents water from being treated and can impact downriver water intakes destruction of containers that hold large amounts of chemicals at treatment plants could result in release of toxic chemical agents such as chlorine gas which can be deadly to humans if inhaled and at lower doses can burn eyes and skin and inflame the lungs since the 2001 terrorist attacks many water and wastewater utilities have switched from using chlorine gas as disinfection to alternatives which are believed to be safer such as sodium hypochlorite or ultraviolet light however some consumer groups remain concerned that many wastewater utilities including facilities that serve heavily populated areas continue to use chlorine gas to prepare for potential accidental releases of hazardous chemicals from their facilities more than 2800 wastewater and drinking water utilities water supply systems and irrigation systems already are subject to risk management planning requirements under the clean air act still some observers advocate requiring federal standards to ensure that facilities using dangerous chemicals such as wastewater treatment plants use the best possible industry practices practices that are referred to as inherently safer technologies or ists to reduce hazards5 in june 2007 the us 4 critical infrastructure assurance office report of the president of the united states on the status of federal critical infrastructure protection activities january 2001 209 p see httpwwwfasorgirpoffdocspddcip_2001_congreptpdf 5 see for example environmental defense eliminating hometown hazards cutting continued crs6 chemical safety and hazard investigation board issued safety bulletin recommending that the department of transportation increase regulation of wastewater and drinking water treatment plants and other types of facilities that receive chlorine gas by railcar to require that they install remotely operated emergency isolation devices to unload chlorine railcars for rapid shutdown in the event of leakage or other failure6 in march 2006 the government accountability office gao reported on survey of security measures at 200 of the nations largest wastewater utilities7 gao found that many have made security improvements since the 2001 terrorist attacks most utilities said they have completed or intend to complete plan to conduct some type of security assessment more than half of responding facilities indicated they did not use potentially dangerous gaseous chlorine as wastewater disinfectant however the report noted that these utilities have made little effort to address collection system vulnerabilities due to the technical complexity and expense of securing collection systems that cover large areas and have many access points some told gao investigators that taking other measures such as converting from gaseous chlorine took priority over collection system protections in 2007 follow on study gao reported that actual and projected capital costs to convert from chlorine gas to alternative disinfection methods range from about 650000 to just over 13 million factors affecting conversion costs included the type of alternative method the size of the facility and labor building and supply costs which varied considerably8 there are federal standards or agreedupon practices within the water infrastructure sector to govern readiness response to security incidents and recovery epa is not authorized to require water infrastructure systems to implement specific security improvements or meet particular security standards efforts to develop voluntary protocols and tools are ongoing since the 2001 terrorist attacks wastewater and drinking water utility organizations are implementing computer software and training materials to evaluate vulnerabilities at large medium and small utility systems and epa has provided some grant assistance to drinking water utilities for vulnerability assessments out of funds appropriated in 2002 pl 107 117 epa awarded grants to nearly 900 large and medium drinking water utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments epa also has targeted grants to train the trainers delivering technical assistance to organizations such as the rural 5 continued chemical risks at wastewater treatment facilities december 2003 14 p and center for american progress

federation that in turn can assist and train personnel at thousands of medium and small utilities throughout the country rural and small systems also have received support from the us department of agriculture with financial support from epa drinking water and wastewater utility and engineering groups developed three security guidance documents issued in december 2004 that cover the physical design of online contaminant monitoring systems and physical security enhancements of drinking water wastewater and stormwater infrastructure systems the documents provide voluntary guidelines for assisting utilities that have completed vulnerability assessments to mitigate vulnerabilities of their systems through the design construction operation and maintenance of both new and existing systems based on the three guidance documents these groups also have drafted training materials and set of voluntary standardized best engineering practices that recommend measures to protect water and wastewater infrastructure against range of threats including terrorist attacks and other sources of potential harm such as accidents chemical contamination and natural disasters9 epa epa has taken number of organizational and planning steps to strengthen water security the agency created national homeland security research center within the office of research and development to develop the scientific foundations and tools that can be used to respond to attacks on water systems the center conducts applied research on ways to protect and prevent mitigate respond to and recover from security events in september 2003 epa created water security division in the office of water taking over activities initiated by water protection task force after the september 11 terrorist attacks this office provides guidance and tools to utilities as they assess and reduce vulnerabilities of their systems it trains water utility personnel on security issues supports the waterisac and implements the agencys comprehensive research plan epa has issued both water security research and technical support action plan identifying critical research needs and providing an implementation plan for addressing those needs and strategic plan for homeland security the strategic plan which is not limited to water security concerns identifies several mission critical areas on which epa intends to focus its homeland security planning critical infrastructure protection preparedness response and recovery communication and information protection of epa personnel and infrastructure and selfevaluation there has been evaluation of some of these epa efforts preliminary review of the research and action plan by panel of the national research council identified some gaps suggested alternative priorities and noted that the plan was silent on the financial resources required to complete the research and to implement needed countermeasures to improve water security also in 2003 epas inspector general issued an evaluation report on the initial strategic plan for homeland security and concluded that the agency had not outlined how resources activities and outputs will achieve the water security programs goals moreover the inspector 9 see httpwwwasceorgstatic1wisecfm crs8 general said that epa lacks fundamental components such as performance measures for monitoring program performance against goals10 epa responded that longterm objectives for critical water infrastructure protection activities could be identified in future revised strategic plan second strategic plan for homeland security issued in october 2004 updated the initial strategy principally by reflecting projected funding and resources for the next two years on epas strategic objectives and recognizing the evolving role of the department of homeland security11 reviewing these efforts the national research council concluded in 2007that epa has developed useful contaminant information and exposure assessment tools in several key areas but that other areas such as physical and cyber security contingency planning and wastewater security have shown weaker or somewhat disjointed progress an overarching issue is making water security information accessible to those who might need it12 gao has issued two reports discussing how future federal funding can best be spent to improve security at drinking water and wastewater utilities13 both reports are based on the views of subject matter experts identified by gao in the drinking water report specific activities judged by the experts to be most deserving of federal support included physical and technological upgrades education and training for staff and responders and strengthening key relationships between water utilities and others such as law enforcement and public health agencies in the wastewater report the experts cited the replacement of gaseous chemicals used in the disinfection process with less hazardous alternatives as key activity deserving of federal funds along with improving local state and regional collaboration and support facilities vulnerability assessments asked how federal funds should be allocated both groups of experts favored giving priority to utilities that serve critical assets such as public health institutions government and military bases and to utilities serving areas with large populations key focus of epas activities since 2005 has been the water sector initiative initially known as watersentinel it is pilot project that could serve as model for water utilities throughout the country its purpose is to test and demonstrate contamination warning systems at drinking water utilities and municipalities so far epa has awarded grants to install and evaluate early warning systems to cincinnati new york and san francisco and the agency expects to award similar grants to two other cities in the near future 10 us environmental protection agency office of inspector general epa needs

funds should be spent to improve security gao05165 january 2005 70 p crs9 more broadly epa has expanded its security activities in two ways first its focus has enlarged from the post911 emphasis on terrorism to an all hazards approach emphasizing to water utilities that issues of risk identification and risk reduction also include natural disasters which were the focus of much of the industrys attention before 2001 and protection of hazardous chemicals second epa supports the establishment of intrastate mutual aid and assistance agreements known as waterwastewater agency response networks warns to facilitate flow of personnel and resources during response to emergencies they are intended to provide mechanisms for establishing emergency contacts and facilitating short term emergency assistance to restore critical operations mutual aid agreements existed in california and florida before the 2005 gulf hurricanes and more formal efforts to establish similar programs in all 50 states followed on those disasters so far warns have been established in about 20 states according to epa reclamation and the corps officials have been reassessing federal infrastructure status and vulnerabilities for several years14 the bureau of reclamations site security program is aimed at ensuring protection of reclamations 252 high and significanthazard dams and facilities and 58 hydroelectric plants after september 11 reclamation committed to conducting vulnerability and risk assessments at 280 highpriority facilities risk assessments at these facilities were completed between fy2002 and fy2006 these assessments resulted in recommendations now being implemented to enhance security procedures and physical facilities such as additional security staffing limited vehicle and visitor access and coordination with local law enforcement agencies the corps implements facility protection program to detect protect and respond to threats to corps facilities and dam security program to coordinate security systems for corps infrastructure it also implements national emergency preparedness program which assists civilian governments in responding to all regionalnational emergencies including acts of terrorism both agencies participate in the interagency committee on dam safety icods which is part of the national dam safety program that is led by fema february 2003 white house report15 presented national strategy for protecting the nations critical infrastructures and identified four water sector initiatives identify highpriority vulnerabilities and improve site security improve monitoring and analytic capabilities improve information exchange and coordinate contingency planning and work with other sectors to manage unique risks resulting from interdependencies the strategy is intended to focus national protection priorities inform resource allocation processes and be the basis for cooperative public and private protection actions

of the national strategy for protection of critical infrastructures one of its tasks is to assess infrastructure vulnerabilities an activity that wastewater and drinking water utilities have been doing since the september 11 attacks under their own initiatives and congressional mandates pl 107288 see page 15 the legislative reorganization did not transfer corps or reclamation responsibilities for security protection of dams and other facilities or epas responsibilities to assist drinking water and wastewater utilities in december 2003 president bush issued homeland security presidential directivehspd7 which established national policy for the federal government to identify prioritize and protect critical infrastructure as part of homeland security16 the directive called for dhs to integrate all security efforts among federal agencies and to complete comprehensive national plan for critical infrastructure protection in 2006 dhs issued national infrastructure protection plan nipp that is intended to set national priorities goals and requirements for effective distribution of funding and resources to help ensure that government the economy and public services continue in the event of terrorist attack or other disaster it proposes framework of partnerships between private industry sectors and the government that would work together to secure the nations vital resources for example epa would work with water treatment and wastewater systems while dams would cooperate with dhs the department established the critical infrastructure partnership advisory council cipac to coordinate federal infrastructure protection programs with similar activities of the private sector and state local and tribal governments in 2004 cipac established government coordinating council gcc and non government coordinating council for each sector the cipac water sector committee includes representatives from both the water gccfederal members and the water sector coordinating council scc the water scc consists of 24 members from state and local agencies water utilities and water affinity organizations in response to the nipp dhs and the gccs in conjunction with the sector coordinating councils prepared 17 sectorspecific plans which were completed in may 2007 the plans identify sector profiles and assets assess risks prioritize infrastructure identify sector protection plans and measures of progress the water sector plan for wastewater and drinking water focuses on four goals 1 sustaining protection of public health and the environment 2 recognize and reduce risks 3 maintain resilient infrastructure and 4 increase communication outreach and public confidence17 the sector plan for dams including federal dams is one of 10 16 the white house december 17 2003 homeland

as input to the national infrastructure protection plan may 2007 122 p continued crs11 that dhs determined presents security sensitivity issues if widely distributed thus those 10 plans were not released to the public in an early review of the sector plans gao found that the drinking water and wastewater sector plan was more developed than that of many other sectors largely because the sector has 30year history of protection and cooperation but for that reason the plan did not provide added value for the sector18 in the nipp dhs described plan to develop risk analysis method that would include uniform means of measuring risk and assessing consequences across infrastructure sectors some drinking water and wastewater treatment industry officials commented that this plan known as the risk analysis and management for critical asset protection ramcap raised concern that it could force some facilities to conduct new or revise existing vulnerability assessments drinking water industry officials are said to be concerned that new method may not recognize vulnerability assessments that many drinking water utilities have already completed under requirements of the 2002 bioterrorism preparedness act see page 15 this is particular concern for small and rural utilities many of which have used simpler security models to complete their vulnerability assessment plans and would prefer to build on that model to conduct ramcap and similar activities coordination and information sharing the homeland security departments involvement in water security concerns has been growing although under hspd7 epa continues as the lead federal agency to ensure protection of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems from possible terrorist acts and other sabotage since early 2004 dhs has been preparing guidance documents on how each infrastructure sector including water systems can protect itself from security threats for some time the two agencies have been working to clarify their roles in providing security to water utilities one of the functions of the water sector coordinating council is to be point of contact for dhs to vet potential water security policies allowing onestop shopping for federal officials in 2003 dhs created an informationsharing network called the homeland security information network hsin both it and the existing waterisac share the goal of providing security information to water utilities but they differ in some respects the waterisac is private subscription service although it receives some federal funding that provides information to about 530 water utilities and others on security matters it is the primary communication tool in the water sector the hsin software program is free federally funded platform for information sharing it is not limited to the water sector and it provides information by itself it acts as bulletin board where dhs epa and utilities can post securityrelated information distinct from the hsin and the waterisac is the water security channel watersc launched in 2004 as free service of the waterisac which disseminates epa and dhs general security bulletins at the 17 continued see

crs12 request of those agencies to more than 8400 utilities state agencies engineering firms and researchers policy issues and congressional responses congress and other policymakers have considered number of initiatives in this area including enhanced physical security communication and coordination and research regarding physical security key question is whether protective measures should be focused on the largest water systems and facilities where risks to the public are greatest or on all since small facilities may be more vulnerable related question is responsibility for additional steps because the federal government has direct control over only limited portion of the water infrastructure sector the distributed and diverse nature of ownership federal nonfederal government and private complicates assessing and managing risks as does the reality of limited resources the adequacy of physical and operational security safeguards is an issue for all in this sector one possible option for federal facilities dams and reservoirs maintained by reclamation and the corps is to restrict visitor access including at adjacent recreational facilities although such actions could raise objections from the public some operators of nonfederal facilities and utilities are likewise concerned as precaution after the september 11 attacks new york city which provides water to 9 million consumers closed its reservoirs indefinitely to all fishing hiking and boating and blocked access to some roads policymakers have examined measures that could improve coordination and exchange of information on vulnerabilities risks threats and responses this is key objective of the waterisac and also of the department of homeland security which includes for example functions of the national infrastructure protection center nipc of the fbi that brings together the private sector and government agencies at all levels to protect critical infrastructure especially on cyber issues one issue of interest is how the department is coordinating its activities with ongoing security efforts by other federal agencies and nonfederal entities that operate water infrastructure systems including its implementation of the comprehensive national plan required by presidential directivehspd7 for some time the two agencies have been working to clarify their roles in providing security to water utilities and in other areas and have negotiated agreements concerning joint research projects and coordination for specific field operations nevertheless in the conference report accompanying the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act congress directed epa to enter into memorandum of understanding mou with dhs to define the relationship of the two entities with regard to the protection and security of the nation the memorandum was expected to specifically identify areas of responsibilities and the potential costs including which entity pays in whole or part for meeting such responsibilities19 in response epa did not enter into new mou but instead in november 2005 issued report that identified general authorities that govern epas 19 hrept 108792 to accompany hr 4818 consolidated appropriations act 2005 congressional record daily edition november 19 2004 p h10850 crs13 and dhss respective actions ongoing projects that reflect coordination and existing projectspecific mous this report on roles and responsibilities still may not resolve the potential for duplication and overlap among agencies currently for example policies are being developed both by dhs and epa although both agencies are represented on dhss water sector committee through the cipac process information sharing and dissemination even in this one sector are occurring through several different mechanisms dhs supports the homeland security information network hsin while drinking water and wastewater utilities also may receive securityrelated advisories from two other sources the waterisac and the water security channel some have questioned the multiple advisory groups on top of existing entities and in particular the potential that the several mechanisms for sharing homeland security information could transmit inconsistent information and make the exchange of information more complicated not less others are optimistic that the systems and groups will sort themselves out into compatible and complementary networks of information sharing but that process could take considerable time in its march 2006 report gao commented on these multiple information services designed to communicate information to the water sector but also acknowledged epas and dhss ongoing efforts to coordinate their activities to advance water sector security gao recommended that dhs and the water sector coordinating council identify areas where informationsharing networks supported by epa and dhs especially the waterisac and hsin could be better coordinated to avoid operational duplications and overlap and to ensure that security threat information is provided to water systems on timely basis water utility industry groups responded to gaos recommendation by saying that such coordination efforts are in fact underway and dhs is reportedly reviewing hsin and considering its future role in information sharing dhsepa coordination again received congressional attention in the 110th congress in its draft report on fy2009 funding for dhs the house appropriations committee included report language urging dhs to work with epa on water security issues the report encouraged the national protection and programs directorate of dhs to work with epa to improve federal outreach to water system managers increase support and guidance on implementation of risk assessment techniques and publicize effective protective measures that can be taken to increase water system security20 beyond the water sector itself there is interest in larger coordination issues involving crosssector interdependencies of critical infrastructures as noted previously water utilities are dependent on electric power to treat and distribute power and electric power is essential to collecting and treating wastewater adequate and uninterrupted supply of water is necessary to support municipal 20 us congress house committee on appropriations draft report to accompany department of homeland security appropriations bill 2009 110th congress 2d session p 97 available from httpwwwcqcom crs14 firefighting21 when disasters occur what affects power also affects water supply also affects sanitary services also affects communications capability the national infrastructure advisory council which provides the president through dhs with advice on infrastructure security reportedly is considering using the water sector as the focus for study of sector interdependencies another information issue concerns the extent of epas ability to collect and analyze security data from water utilities especially information in vulnerability assessments submitted under the bioterrorism preparedness act discussed below epa officials believe that the act permits reviewing utility submissions for overall compliance and allows aggregation of data but precludes the agency from asking for or analyzing data showing changes in security levels as safeguard against unintended release of such information others including epas inspector general believe that epa has the authority and responsibility to review and analyze the information in order to identify and prioritize threats and to develop plans to protect drinking water supplies among the research needs being addressed are tools for vulnerability and risk analysis identification and response to biologicalchemical agents realtime monitoring of water supplies and development of information technology the cost of additional protections and how to pay for them are issues of great interest and policymakers continue to consider resource needs and how to direct them at public and private sector priorities critical issue for drinking water and wastewater utilities is how to pay for physical security improvements since currently there are federal funds dedicated to these purposes and utilities generally must pay for improvements using the same revenue or funding sources also needed for other types of capital projects congressional activity since the september 11 2001 attacks congress has conducted oversight on number of these issues and considered legislation to address various policy issues including government reorganization and additional appropriations appropriations since the september 11 terrorist attacks congress has provided appropriations to the corps the bureau and epa for securityrelated programs and activities to protect water infrastructure as shown in figure 1 through fy2008 appropriations have totaled 7944 million for both the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers appropriations immediately after september 11 were intended to support risk assessment of needed security improvements followed by implementation of measures to ensure the safety and security of the public reclamation and corps employees and the facilities for example since fy2004 both agencies have implemented physical hardening and other protective measures as well as personnel and information security both agencies continue to assess and reassess security needs at their facilities as part of ongoing efforts to ensure their longterm security reclamations security budget includes law enforcement program guards and 21 improving the nations water security p 10 crs15 surveillance facility fortification studies and review plus specific amounts designated for five national critical

vulnerability assessments carried out by large and mediumsize drinking water systems to assist them in complying with requirements of the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107288 discussed below epa appropriations support training and development of voluntary industry practices for security and grants to states and territories to coordinate activities for critical water infrastructure security efforts 5 million per year epa also provides support for water security information sharing for drinking water and wastewater utilities through the waterisac and the water security channel epa has supported two special initiatives since fy2006 pilot program to design deploy and test biological or other contamination warning systems at drinking water systems the water sector initiative see page 8 and related program the water alliance for threat reduction watr to train utility operators at the highest risk systems legislative issues in may 2002 congress approved the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107288 title iv of that act required drinking water systems serving more than 3300 persons to crs16 conduct vulnerability analyses and to submit the assessments to epa the legislation authorized grant funding to assist utilities in meeting these requirements for information see crs report rl31294 safeguarding the nations drinking water epa and congressional actions by mary tiemann legislation authorizing reclamation to contract with local law enforcement to protect its facilities also was enacted during the 107th congress pl 10769 in 2001 the house and senate considered but did not enact legislation authorizing sixyear grant program for research and development on security of water supply and wastewater treatment systems hr 3178 s 1593 some of the drinking water research provisions in these bills were included in the bioterrorism preparedness act in 2002 the house approved bill authorizing 220 million in grants and other assistance for vulnerability assessments by wastewater treatment utilities hr 5169 but the senate did not act on related bill s 3037 in the 108th congress legislation authorizing vulnerability assessment grants to wastewater utilities was approved by the house by 4137 vote hr 866 identical to hr 5169 in the 107th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved related legislation s 1039 srept 108149 further action occurred due in part to concerns expressed by some that the legislation did not require that vulnerability assessments be submitted to epa as is the case with drinking water assessments required by the 2002 bioterrorism preparedness act wastewater security issues again received some attention in the 109th congress in may 2006 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2781 srept 109345 it was similar to s 1039 in the 108th congress in that it would have encouraged wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and authorized 220 million to assist utilities with assessments and preparation of site security plans it also included provisions responding to gaos march 2006 report that found that utilities have made little effort to address vulnerabilities of collection systems which may be used by terrorists to introduce hazardous substances or as access points for underground travel to potential target22 s 2781 would have authorized epa to conduct research on this topic during consideration of the bill the senate committee rejected an amendment that would have required rather than encouraged treatment works to conduct vulnerability assessments and also would have required highrisk facilities to switch from using chlorine and similar hazardous substances to other chemicals that are often referred to as inherently safer technologies there was further action on this bill similar legislation was introduced in the 110th congress s 1968 but further action occurred another issue of recent interest has been the concerns of number of water supply and power users of bureau of reclamation facilities about paying for security costs at these facilities since september 11 reclamation has increased security and antiterrorist measures at federal multipurpose dams from 2002 through 2004 all of the incremental security costs were paid by the federal government however 22 us government accountability office securing wastewater facilities utilities have made upgrades but further improvements to key system components may be limited by costs and other constraints gao06390 march 2006 64 p crs17 since 2005 the administration has requested that users should fully reimburse government for the guards and patrols portion of site security costs in the administrations view project beneficiaries have had several years to adjust their expectations budgets and planning for current guard and patrol levels and that post september 11 cost increases should now be considered project om expenses subject to allocation among project purposes and reimbursement from beneficiaries many users have argued that security costs for which the general public is the beneficiary including obligations for national defense should properly be the federal governments responsibility the issue is especially concern for beneficiaries of reclamations five highpriority dams such as hoover and grand coulee which have the largest security needs because these users are being asked to pay proportionally higher share of total security costs than users of other reclamation facilities hearings on the issue were held by the house natural resources committee in june 2006 and the senate energy and natural resources committee in july 2007 compromise of sorts is reflected in legislation enacted in may 2008 section 513 of the consolidated natural resources act of 2008 pl 110229 requires water and power users to pay for the cost of security guards but sets an 189 million cap on the amount to be paid by users the issue of security of wastewater and drinking water utilities also was debated in connection with legislation dealing with chemical manufacturing plant security as part of bill providing fy2007 appropriations for the department of homeland security congress included provisions that give dhs authority to establish risk based and performancebased security standards at the nations chemical plants the chemical security act section 550 of pl 109295 under the legislation chemical plants are required to conduct vulnerability assessment and create and implement site security plans based on identified vulnerabilities23 during consideration of comprehensive chemical plant security bills during the 109th congress some had proposed that water systems drinking water and wastewater be included in the legislation because many store or use extremely hazardous substances such as chlorine gas that can injure or kill citizens if the chemicals are suddenly released see page 5 however water system officials argued that the water sector should be excluded because facilities have already undertaken vulnerability assessments as required for many drinking water systems under the 2002 bioterrorism act and as many wastewater utilities have done voluntarily further they argued that requirements in the legislation were potentially duplicative of risk management plan provisions in the clean air act which apply to more than 2800 of the largest water systems the chemical plant security provisions in pl 109295 endorsed these arguments and excluded water systems from the new requirements implementing regulations promulgated by dhs in 2007 exempted water systems from security standards however under the statute the dhs rules will sunset on september 30 2009 the 110th congress considered legislation to reauthorize dhss chemical security program but legislation was enacted at issue were two pending 23 for additional information see crs report rl33847 chemical facility security regulation and issues for congress by dana shea crs18 legislative proposals hr 5533 would revise and extend the chemical facility security program and would continue to exempt water facilities hr 5577 would revise the us chemical plant security program and would include drinking water and wastewater facilities in its coverage24 at house homeland security committee oversight hearing in july 2007 dhs assistant secretary for infrastructure protection bob stephan said that the water sectors exclusion from the chemical security act created regulatory gap because chemicals that are covered by the act including chlorine are found at unregulated wastewater and drinking water facilities as well as regulated conventional chemical plants he also said that dhs is reviewing ways to boost safeguards at water utilities that use large amounts of gaseous chlorine similarly in testimony before house subcommittee in june 2008 epa and dhs officials testified in support of eliminating the current exemption for wastewater and drinking water facilities from chemical security regulations water utilities oppose inclusion in the dhs program arguing that it could lead to costly new mandates the debate also raises the issue of federal agency roles and leadership some were concerned that legislation such as hr 5577 would create uncertainty about coordination between epa and dhs and whether epas lead role for the water utility sector would be altered continuing interest in these issues is possible in the 111th congress and beyond along with interest in how the federal government coordinates its own activities and communicates policies and information to the water infrastructure sector 24 ibid for other versions of this document see
