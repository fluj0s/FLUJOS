from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to iain brown ukcip iainbrownukciporguk subject re temporal interpolation for ukcip scenarios date wed sep 11 123926 2002 cc geoffjenkinsmetofficecomxlujturnpenny iain and geoff definitive explanations are always dangerous the reasoning behind this is as follows the report only analysed and pictured seasonal and annual data djfmam etc in fact nearly all published maps of climate model outputs show changes in seasonal 3month averages this applying uniform filter over 90 or 360 days the requested datasets are at monthly timesteps the default option for this is in effect applying uniform 30day filter one might also conceive of weekly or daily timestep files eg changes in week 13 for the 2050s for precip for mediumhigh or changes for julian day number 256 for the 2080s for tmin for low these are all arbitrary choices of course dictated by convention but the important point it seems to is again signal to noise issue the shorter the timeaveraging period the weaker the sn ratio ie we have more confidence that averaged over year tmin in the uk will increase by say 27degc for certain scenario than that for the same scenarios tmin on 13 june will increase on average by 26degc and on 14 june only by 23degc is this difference between 26 on 13 june and 23 on 14 june really meaningful it is most likely due to noise natural variability this reasoning suggests that as the timeaveraging period decreases one should pay less attention to small differences between adjacent timeaveraged periods eg if june precip goes down by 10 is the fact that july precip goes down by 20 and august by 5 really meaningful at 1013 110902 0100 iain brown ukcip wrote mike for the ukcip scenarios datasets both 98 and 02 temporal interpolation was applied to the raw model data in the form of 121 filter this had the effect of smoothing out monthly values so that there are not as abrupt transitions between adjacent months can you provide us with the definitive explanation for the interpolation some users eg in the recent london study have noted that there are differences between the maps they have derived from the data and the maps in the ukcip02 report best wishes iain dr iain brown uk climate impacts programme 12 st michaels st oxford ox1 2du
