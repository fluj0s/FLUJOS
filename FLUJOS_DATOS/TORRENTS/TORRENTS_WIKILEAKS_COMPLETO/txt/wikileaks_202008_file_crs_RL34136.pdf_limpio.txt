independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 hr 3221 and hr 6 sidebyside comparison introduction with recent high energy prices concerns over energy security and the desire to reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas missions there is ongoing congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels biofuels transportation fuels produced from plants and other organic materials have attracted particular interest ethanol and bi odiesel the two most widely used biofuels receive significant federal support in the form of tax incentives loan and grant programs and regulatory programs1 on december 19 2007 president bush signed the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 hr 6 an earlier energy bill the energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 pl 10958 established renewable fuel standard rfs under epact 2005 the rfs required an increasing use of renewable fuel in ga soline starting at 40 billion gallons in 2006 increasing to 75 billion gallons in 2012 lthough not an explicit ethanol mandate it was expected that the majority of this requirement would be met using cornbased ethanol2 about 40 billion gallons of corn ethanol were consumed in 2005 so the rfs in epact 2005 represented roughly doubling of us ethanol consumption over seven years however the us ethanol industry was expanding rapidly outpacing the required growth in the rfs as of january 14 2007 existing us production capacity was roughly 76 billion ga llons per year with another 57 billion gallons of capacity under construction or in the planning stages because this capacity would outpace the rfs under ep act some proponents of cornbased ethanol supported an increase in the mandated leve ls of the rfs because of the rapid expansion of us corn ethanol capacity there are concerns that the united states will soon reach the limit of ethanol that can be produced from corn critics of cornbased ethanol argue that the industry does not need continued government support and that current corn demand for ethanol is putting strain on corn and other grain markets leading to increases in other commodity prices suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34136crs2 3 for more information on the issues surroundi ng rapid ethanol expa nsion see crs report rl33928 ethanol and biofuels agriculture infr astructure and market constraints related to expanded production by brent d

rl32712 agriculturebased renewable energy production by randy schnepf 6 the house approved its version of hr 6 on january 18 2007 however this bill is less comprehensive bill than hr 3221 or the senate version of hr 6 in the debate over energy legislation on the house side hr 3221 superseded the house version of hr 6as livestock feed which then leads to higher dairy and meat prices3 critics also argue that the environmental costs of cornbased ethanol may outweigh the benefits and that more emphasis should be placed on other strategies such as improved vehicle efficiency because of concerns over cornbased etha nol as well as interest in diversifying energy supply there is growing interest in developing biofuels that rely on other sources of biomass including agricultu ral wastes municipal solid waste and dedicated energy crops such as perennial gr asses fastgrowing trees and algae this interest has led to propos als to support andor manda biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch throug h explicit requirements rd funding andor tax incentives4 noncorn biofuels include fu els produced from cellulosic material such as perennial grasses ethanol produced from sugar cane or beets and biodiesel or renewable diesel produced from vegetable or animal oils5 title ii of eisa requires dramatic expansion of the rfs under epact 2005 instead of the 54 billion gallons require d in 2008 by epact eisa requires 90 billion gallons by 2022 eisa will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel in motor fuels annually compared to an timated 86 billion gallons under epact of that 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuel defined as biofuel produced from feedstocks other than corn starch and having 50 lower lifecycle emissions than petroleum fuels key elements of eisa
