awarding bonus funds performance measures for evaluating program effectiveness and process for transition from existing programs to the new program in proposing the consolidation of vari ous community development community service and economic deve lopment programs the admin istration contends the following about the programs whos activities would be consolidated they have been judged to be ineff ective to be unable to demonstrate results or to duplicate the efforts of other programs they have unclear longterm objec tives and are not focused on long term community outcomes and they include many communities that longer need the assistance undermining the purpose of some pr ograms to help distressed communities using the community development block grant cdbg program to illustrate the point the administration contends that 38 of the programs funds currently are allocated to communities and states with poverty rates below the national average this contention has drawn criticism from observers of the cdbg program they argue that using the national poverty rate s as basis for comparison masks the community development needs of jurisdic tions that have significant pockets of poverty and urban blight even though their poverty rates may be ss than the national average4 when challenging the administrations assertion concerning the lack of need among such communities supporters of the program could note that when congress designed the cdbg program and its grant allocation criteria and formula the intent was to award funds to stat and communities based on such objective measures as the state or community s relative share of poverty housing overcrowding aged housing stock and popula tion growth rates thus states and communities with relatively greater community development needs as measured by the formula factors arguably receive greater percentage of funds per capita than communities with lesser community development needs moreover cdbg supporters also note that congress require s each state and entitlement community to allocate at least 70 of its funds to ac tivities benefitting low and moderateincome persons5 2005 study conducted by hud on the effects of the 2000 census on the allocation of cdbg funds noted that alt hough funding anomalies exist in general the formula still provides more dollars per capita to needier communities than to

narrowing the focus of the new program to economic development and job creation at the expense of the wider mission of the cdbg program in addition witnesses objected to the administrations contention that some percentage of communities cu rrently eligible for cdbg should be removed as grant recipients because their povert rates are below the national average they countered that using the national

administered by th department of housing and urban development hud see figure 1 if approved by cong ress the administrations proposed cuts c oupled with proposed increases in other programs within hud would have reduced the agencys total budget by 109 from 319 billion to 285 billion instead congress elected to fund the18 programs in fy2006 though cdbg formula grants for fy2006 were reduced by 400 million to 37 billion overall funding for the programs proposed for c onsolidation was reduced by only 300 this was due in large part to an increase in funding for cdbg setasides and earmarks in addition total funding for hud increased by 2 billion fueled by an increase in section 8 assisted housing and decr ease in offsetting fha receipts critics of the saci maintained that th program if enacted would reduce the agencys role in encouraging soluti ons to the nations housing and community development problems one of the key components of the agencys mission 42 usc 3531 critics note that

2005 the saci proposal recommended consolidating th activities of the 18 prog rams and reducing funding from 5615 billion to 37 billion the program most affected by the proposal would have been the

aggregate fy2006 funding see table 3 opponents of the change maintain that because cdbg is the largest source of federal assistance for community and economic development and neighborhood revitalization activities changing or eliminating the program would affect not only the 1178 state and local governments that receive direct allocations but it would also affect the thousands of n onprofit subrecipients of cdbg funds including community development corporations community action agencies and faithbased organizations the administration has noted that it is committed to ensuring that the new program will continue to provide local governments with high degree of flexibility but it will also require that communities demonstrate measurable results for fy2007 the administrations budget proposal would reduce funding for entitlement communities and states by 19 below the programs fy2006 appropriation this proposed reduction would be in ddition to the 10 reduction in cdbg funding from fy2005 to fy2006 it is anticipated that the proposed re duction in cdbg funding would also be accompanied by changes in the programs structure although the administration has not yet

has the administration chosen to revamp existing programs such as cdbg and eda rather than create new program the administrations initial saci proposal called for the elimination of both eda programs and cdbgs these programs were to be replaced by new block grant how will eligibility for the new rda grants and the revised cdbg programs be determined how will the new bonus program differ from the existing programs that may have divergent recipients such as cdbg which allocates funds to states and local g overnments and the community development financial instituti ons fund which competitively awards funds to financial in stitutions involved in community development lending in underserved areas how will the new program differ in its approach from the existing cdbg and eda programs what formula factors will be used to distribute funds and how will they differ from the targeting re quirements of the cdbg formula how will the new bonus program work should congress legislate changes
