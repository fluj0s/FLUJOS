participation in an expansion of the financial resources of the internati onal monetary fund imf and to appropriate annua l funding for the multilateral velopment banks mdbs in that context members of c ongress have raised questions whether the international financial institutions that is the im f and mdbs finance population or family planning programs and whether their prog rams in this area finance abortion this paper describes the policies and the activities of the imf and the multilateral banks in this regard the international monetary fund does not finance projects in its borrower countries in particular it does not fi nance projects aimed at helping countries provide family planning services or other activities aimed at limiting the growth of their population the united nations c onference on population and development held in cairo in september 1994 identif ied number of important issues and highlighted roles that bilateral and multilateral agencies could play regarding this issue it did not specify any role for the imf in this issue the imf managing director in his address to the conferen ce emphasized that rapid economic growth was principal means for cutting the link between poverty and rapid population growth and for creating the domestic nvironment in which countries could complete the transition to appropriate fertility levels the world bank and asian developmen t bank adb regularly lend to help countries undertake family planning nd population programs between 1993 and 1997 the world bank lent an estimated 870 million and the adb allocated 65 million for fa mily planning activities this was approximately 1 of total world bank lending and two tenths of 1 of adb total lending for this period in recent years the world bank and adb have moved from funding freestanding family planning programs towards programs that treat family planning as one element in more comprehensive health program the adb does not finance abortion and it normally allows other foreign aid provide rs to fund the purchase of contraceptive materials the world bank finances the pur chase of contraceptives in recent years the world bank has begun to shift its focus in the health sector from one of supporting specific autonomous projects to one of supporting comprehensive multi donor programs to strengthen national hea lth care systems in the process in countries where abortion is legal and abortion services are supplied by government health providers bank loans may help suppor t institutions that provide that service notwithstanding general understanding that the bank does not fund abortion programs one instance has been identifie d where the world bank has financed the purchase of suction equipment with the exp licit understanding that it will be used for the medical termina tion of pregnancy the interamerican development bank european bank for reconstruction and development and african development bank do not

the financial resources of the international monetary fund imf and to authorize annual fundi ng for the multilatera l development banks mdbs in that context some member s of congress have ra ised questions about whether the international financial institutions ifis that is the imf and mdbs finance population or family planning progra ms and whether their programs in this area finance abortion this paper describe s the policies and the activities of the imf and the mdbs in this regard in particular it analyzes several projects that the multilateral banks have said are exemplars of their activity and their approach to population or family planning issues development is by its very nature process entailing fundamental change development agencies often act as catalysts urging or pus hing countries to consider changes in their perceptions policies proce dures and priorities along this line the international financial institutions ifis often make significant effort to encourage countries to consider new ideas and ne w ways of dealing with their problems even so the internationa l financial institutions i fis are hesitant about imposing social or cultural values on c ountries governments may be unwilling to accept the imposition of values that contradi ct their countries basic cultural norms and the backlash against pressure of this sort can have farreaching negative effect on the an ifis relationship with that country additionally borrower countries have c onsiderable influence within the ifis themselves in the asian developmen t bank adb interamerican development bank idb and african development bank afdb regional countries own majority of the voting stock and have substantia l influence in the european bank for reconstruction and development brd the borrower countries or non regional countries that are borrowers fro m other mdbs control only 127 of the voting stock however western european countries that share close cultural similarities with the borrowe r countries in eastern nd central europe own an additional 65 of ebrd voting stock indus trial countries own majority of the voting stock in the imf and all the loans windows of the world bank but developing countries have significant sh are of the vote 39 in the imf 43 in the international bank for reconstructi on and development ibrd world banks marketrate loan window and 38 in the international development association ida the world banks concessional loan facility this gives the borrower countries considerable influence as well as sense of partic ipation and ownership that encourages cooperation and helps diminish potential donorrecipient tensions within the multilateral bodies httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98303crs2 1see for example articles of agreement of the international bank for reconstruction and development article iv section 10 tias 1503 tias 5929the ifis do not implement projects or pr ograms directly rather they help finance programs or projects implemented by their borrower country governments or the governments subsidia ries or designees the ifis may have substantial role in the project design process they may require in connection with structural adjustment loans that borrower countries adopt economic polic reforms the latter find painful for project loans the ifis may require borro wers take financial technical organizational or legal st eps deemed necessary for the success of proposed project these conditions are ge nerally related to the goal of project effectiveness and normally consistent with the principle set forth in their charters1 that only economic considerations sha ll be relevant to ifi decisions in general the international financial institutions are sensitive to the cultural values and religious belief systems of their borrower countries considering the influence that borrower countries have in the banks and the stipulation that only economic considerations shoul d be relevant the ifis nd to be circumspect about issues likely to offend the cultural or mo ral sensitivities of their borrower countries this is particularly true as regards issues such as family planning developing countries vary considerably in their attitudes and cultural norms activities and policies that are deemed acceptable or appropr iate in some devel oping countries are not acceptable in others it is in this c ontext that the multilateral agencies finance their social sector lending international monetary fund the imf does not make projects loans and in particular it doe s not make loans to finance population or family planning pr ograms imf loans are intended to help the borrower countries stab ilize their economic situati on and cover and ultimately reverse chronic deficits in their balance of payments

patterns and the increased awareness of womens role the ministers agreed that more emphasis should be given to improve the primary school enrollme nt rate improve access to family planning and related health services and to reduce maternal and child mortality in developing countries2 functions for the implementation of these goals were specified for the imf the ministers approved of the fact that th world bank had increased its lending for population health nutrition nd education programs and they welcomed the banks willingness to respond to further requests in those areas they sa id they recognized that the bank is not the principal organi zation concerned with population but that its policy dialog and wider operations give it unique opportunity to promote population policies they called on the bank donors other multilaterals such as unfpa and borrower country governments to collaborate fully in operations and in mobilizing the institutional nd financial resources needed3 the press communique issued following the development committees october 1994 meeting reports that the ministers w elcomed the outcome of the recent united nations conference on population and deve

during those years the imf has made official statements regarding family planning or population policy the closest thin g to this may be the address 5 to the 1994 population conference in cairo by imf mana ging director michel camdessus in which he noted that rapid population growth in the context of poverty was the source of many serious problems the central concern he said is the need for more

improved economic policies in developing countries and international cooperation to create more open world economic system except for the above references to ac tion by the development committee the imf does not mention population or family pl anning in its recent annual reports action by the executive board on this subj ect is mentioned and publications or studies on this topic are listed in the

loan window the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and from its concessional loan facility the international development association ida the international finance corporation ifc and multilateral investment guarantee agency miga the banks affiliates oriented towards private sector activity have not been active in this area the world bank published book in 19946 in connection with the population conference in cairo outlining its position regarding population programs it makes five basic points 1 slowing population grow th is still high priority in the poorest countries 2 population policy should be integr ated with social policies that address range of poverty reduction and human development objectives 3 population programs should provide the poor with acce ss to highquality useroriented services that offer range of choi ces for fertility regulation nd other reproductive health needs 4 country specific st rategies are required and 5 other demographic issues such as urbanization migration and aging must also be addressed the book says there is growing consensus that popula tion policy objectives should be integrated with broader social development goals nd that population program strategies should build on the linkages between demogra phic behavior and social and economic progress in particular it says interve ntions which are responsive to individual needs and aspirations are not only better fro m humanitarian and social development perspective but also more effective in lowering fertility than are programs driven by topdown demographic targets for the most part the book treats the preval ence of resort to abortion as an issue of concern especially the use of abortion as means of fertility control in some countries ukraine for example with m oderate rates of popula tion growth it also notes that women in poor countries may reso rt to abortion when the inadequacies in available methods leads to contraceptive fa ilure the book argues that the level ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98303crs5 7world bank project appraisal document for proposed loan in the amount of us1000 million to the argentine republic for second maternal and child health and nutrition project april 24 1997 report 16419arcontraceptive use will go up the health of women will be imp roved and rates of abortion will go down if women and girls are educated if family planning becomes an aspect of basic health programs and if patients are able to select from range of modern methods the birth control methods most appropriate for themselves the book notes in box 11 that the idea of offeri ng project staff or prospective recipients financial inducements in order to achieve numerical targets for the use of specific birth control techniques is cont roversial and dubious it says that targets if needed should be stated in terms of the propor tion of individuals who are provided with quality services rather than specific reductions in the fertility rate or adoption of particular methods the book also argu in box 62 that services for the management of unwanted pregnancy incl uding medical termination of pregnancy where permitted is part of the essen tial womens health package it recommends it says in the text that the components of the package will vary on countryby country basis depending on local needs nd institutional and fi nancial capacity in his introduction to the volume ar meane choki thenv ice president for human resource development and operations policy at the bank emphasized the need for action to reduce maternal and child mort ality in developing countries to increase womens education and to rais their economic and social status such investments are beneficial in their own right he sa id and will also help slow rapid population growth likewise he sa id sustainable economic grow th is prerequisite for human development and for completi on of the demographic transition current practice in its 1997 annual report the world bank indicated that it is trying to more closely link population policies with reproduc tive health policies thus integrating them into poverty reduction effort and the ove rall development agenda it said that two projects approved that year 100 million loan to argentina and 248 million loan to india illustrate this approach the argentine loan helps fund the second phase of the countrys maternal health and child welfare program all provinces th at elect to participate in the argentina government program must pr ovide the same package of services the program aims to reduce the rates of childhood and mate rnal mortality in argentina through immunization improved nutrition and bette r prenatal neonatal and postpartum maternal care it also provides family planning services the world bank estimates that approximately 31 of the money from the loan will be used to fund reproductive health activities it has separate figure for family pl anning alone spokesmen for the potential beneficiaries and for relevant nongovern mental organization ngos are supposed to participate in the design and implementation of the program there is indication in the project documents7 whether particular birth control methods will be emphasized or whether project st aff will receive incentives to encourage increased utilization of this aspect of the program the documents seem to suggest however that womens participation in the family planning aspect of the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98303crs6 8world bank project appraisal docume nt india

pregnancy p 36 will be voluntary the private sector provi des most of the medical care in argentina government programs are ba sically supplemental and di rected at specific needs abortion is not legal in argentina the loan to india helps finance an expansion of the governments family welfare program in 19 rural or tribal areas and 7 urban slums the combined population of the areas to be served is about 36 million persons according to the world bank project appraisal document8 the project aims at reducing maternal and infant mortality and morbidity and unwanted fertility thereby eventually contributing to stabilization of population gr owth it focuses on helping women and children below five years of age by impr oving health during reproductive years and early childhood and by enabling couples to space or limit births the total cost of expanding the family welfare program through this project is about 309 million over five years of wh ich 284 million will be provided by ida the world bank says the family welfare program is component of the indian government health care system when all other costs are included and allowance is made for the input by the national and st ate governments and other donors the world bank estimates that it is financ ing about 15 of the cost of the health care system the indian project will reportedly use participatory management approach to family planning the project appraisal document says this model previously called the target free approach removes management incentives that have placed excessive focus on achieving annua l methodspecific contraceptive cceptor targets the removal of all such targets or incentives by the government of india is specified condition the world bank required for execution of the loan the world bank document says that different types of contraception will be available depending on the preference of the user to meet the needs of people at different stages of their life cycle it is the central hypothesis of the project that more clientoriented service which offers greater contraceptive choice and the ability to give attention to reproductive health needs will together with reductions in infant and child mortality increase the utilization of family planning services in effect it says this means shift away from permanent methods ster ilization to tempor ary methods which allow control over the spacing of births the india loan document provides comprehensive description of the family welfare programs package of essentia l rch reproductive and child health services that will be provided by the project in the section outlining procedures for the prevention and management of unwante d pregnancy p 105 it mentions oral contraceptives condoms tubal ligations and vasectomies iuds with required screening for contraindications and counseling and medi cal termination of pregnancy within first trimester or referral to district health center for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester9 ngo and private sector services will be involved in the delivery of services though th public sector will continue to play thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98303crs7 central role ngos and bene ficiaries will be involved in monitoring implementation of the program the world bank estima tes that half the proceeds from the 248 million loan will be used for reproductive hea lth activities parate figure for family planning is available because of the high levels of poverty governmentrun programs account for substantial share of the medical care available in india abortion is legal in india and is regularly available through the health care system administered by the national government or by individual indian states the indian loan underscores what seems to be an emerging trend in foreign aid funding in the health sector consolid ated multidonor funding for general health care systems rather than targeted si ngledonor funding for specific activities according to the world bank foreign aid donors often have focu sed in the past on particular diseases or on specific issu such as immunization family planning nutrition maternal and child health or fa mily planning sepa rate administrative structures needed to be created to administer each program in order to assure that project funds were used for only the design ated purposes and to guarantee that the policy or procedural requirements for each donor were met the result could be hodgepodge of fiefdoms where programs ddressing the same problem could have different requirements pending on the source of funding and the recipient countrys ability to fund its overall health care system could be limited by the requirement that it provide local currency c ounterpart funds to match the foreign aid money provided for the special programs because the overall composition of the health care system was often beyond the sc ope of their individual projects foreign aid donors sometimes lacked opportunities to ddress general issues of priority and emphasis countries could use their own money to finance hightech medical treatment facilities for elites for example while expecting foreign aid agencies to help cover the cost of basi c care for the general public the move towards consolidated funding is reportedly an effort to remedy this situation the recipient country government includes the issues of special concern in its national health care system and th donor agencies each agree to underwrite specific share of the systems cost as long as items are on the approved list of goods and services that will be financed and they meet the pr ocedural requirements for procurement international competitive bidding for example the world bank will disburse funds to support its agreed pe rcentage share of particular aspect of the indian care system from an operational or administrative perspective the many development specialists view this new approach as an improvement it is more efficient it involves less micromanagement and it gi ves the world bank and other foreign aid providers opportunities to influence the ove rall composition of the countries health care systems from policy perspective however the new approach limits foreign aid donors scope of policy choice in the past there was general understanding that the world bank did not finance abor tion in its family planning or population programs if developing country wanted to include abortion on its menu of possible services it could seek bilateral funding fro m countries that offe red such assistance under the new approach however the world bank and other donors all finance share of all the medical services provided by the national health regime if abortion is one of the medical services the system offers then in effect the foreign aid donors will finance share of that service along with the other system costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98303crs8 10this assumption may not be sound however as the model used for family planning after 1994 involved considerably larger outlay for medical care than did the model used before that date in the case of the india loan the world bank seems to have accepted the idea that the indian government should make th basic policy decisions in this area even though it will be paying roughly 90 of the costs for the particul ar functions covered by the loan and it stated in the project document that the suction equipment financed by the loan equipment that can have nonabortion related dical uses would be provided for the purpose of medical termin ation of pregnancy world bank staff argue that they do not advocate abortion or believe that it is an appropriate birth control technique they say the bankfunde d family planning programs such as the one in india are likely to reduce the incidence of abortion because they assure women access to adequate contraception they also say that other bank programs such as education for girls have an intended effect over time in reducing the incidence of abortion they say the bank will not allow its funds to be used for sexselection activities or to fund population pr ograms in countries where such practices are likely to be supported world bank funding for family planning programs 19931997 the world bank reports that between 1993 and 1997 all but 14 of its 106 loans in the population health and nutriti on sector and 2 of the loans in its social sector involved reproductive health population and fa mily planning activities are included in the total for reproductive hea lth activities since 1995 the world bank has not regularly reported figu res for population programs one table 1 at the end of this report shows all the loans ce 1993 that reportedly he lp fund reproductive health activities the total amount for the 94 loans was 708 billion the bank says that 196 billion of this funded reproductive health activities analysis of the data suggests however that the world banks emphasis on family planning and reproductive health is probably less than these figures would suggest four of the projects on table 1 dealt only with the prevention and treatment of sexuallytransmitted disease aids etc clearly an important issue but different one from the subject addressed in this repor t several other projects some of them very large had reported outlays for re productive health these are shown as na not available on the table it is not evident why the world bank included them on its list furthermore of the 70 projects designed to finance the delivery of health services only 33 allocated third or more of their resources for reproductive health many devoted only small fraction for this purpose in 1993 and 1994 the world bank channele d into population or family planning programs some 75 of the 446 million it nt to fund reproductiv health activities other than those targeting sexually transmitted disease if this trend continued during the period 1995 through 199710 then one can estimate that 870 million of the 118 billion the world bank lent for reproductiv health programs other than the suppression of sexually tr ansmitted disease during those years went to fund family planning for the period 1993 through 1997 the total would be about 121 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98303crs9 11asian development bank population policy framew ork for assistance in the population sector manila 1994

is set forth in policy paper11 published in 1994 in preparation for the cair population conference that year the study said that integration of family planning with health and community development efforts as fully as possible is the preferred route to sustaining fertility decline in the context of general improvement in human welfare th is replaced an earlier strategy described in 1991 adb publication which said that population and health issues could be dealt with separately12 the 1994 study said that par ticular emphasis should be given to programs that reduce maternal and child mortality improve prenatal neonatal reproductive health and child welfare nd expand female education the approach stresses the availability of service wide choice of methods and reliable followup activity to monitor results the sector study said the crucial variable is the educated and healthy asian woman able to manage her productive and reproductive life in the best interest of family and society the report also specified that future health projects should consider integrating population components unless there is prohibitive reason for not doing so the policy statement said there should be clear distinction between public polices that encourage couples to have fewer children and policies that coerce couples in this respect protection of this most intimate right planning ones family is the sine qua non of humane population policy it concluded it also said that evidence regarding effectiveness doe s not provide convincing rationale for fertility policies involving c
