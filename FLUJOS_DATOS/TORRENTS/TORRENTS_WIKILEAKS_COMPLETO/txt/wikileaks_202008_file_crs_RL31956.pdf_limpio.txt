the middle east poses serious challenges for the united states and its european allies and friends the most vitriolic dispute has centered on the conflict in iraq however divisions over how best to approach the ong oing israelipalestinian conflict manage iran and syria and combat terrorism also persist the bush administration and members of congress are concerned that continued disagreements between the two sides of the atlantic could both constrain us policy c hoices in the region and erode the broader transatlantic relationship and counterterrorism coopera tion over the longer term the usinitiated broader middle east and north africa partnership project seeks to encourage reforms in the region and useuropean cooperation in tackling mideast problems this initiative was welcomed by the 911 commission which recommended that the united stat should engage other nations in developing comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism the intelligence reform and terrorism prev ention act of 2004 pl 108458 contains elements that seek to promote middle ea st development and reform and enhance international cooperation against terrorism many analysts assert that the united states and europe share common vital interests in the middle east combating terrorism and the pro liferation of weapons of mass destruction promoting middle ea st peace and stability ensuring reliable flow of oil and curtailing islamic extremism us and european policies to promote these goals often differ considerably although the european governments are not monolithic in their opinions on the middle east european perspectives have been shaped over time by common elements unique to europes history and geostrategic position many europeans believe the is raelipalestinian c onflict should be priority they view it as key driver of terrorism islamic extremism and political unrest among europes growing muslim populations in contrast the us administration stresses that terrorism nd weapons proliferation are the primary threats and must be proac tively confronted peace and stability in the region will not be possible until these twin threats are removed number of other factors such as divergent perceptions of th appropriate role of the use of force and growing european union eu ambitions to play larger role on the world stage also contribute to the policy gaps that have emerged how deep and lasting the clash over iraq and subsequent ddle east policies will be to transatlantic relations will likely depend on several factors including whether washington and european capitals can cooperate more robustly to rebuild iraq whether europeans perceive renewed us commitment to revive the middle east peace process and whether differe nces over mideast issues spill over

nowhere have tensions between the united states and its european allies and friends been more evident than on range of issues related to the middle east1 these include iraq the israelipalestinian conflict and iran some worry that useuropean differences in combating terrorism are growing wider how best to approach the challenges posed by syria may also figure prominently on the transatlantic agenda in the near futu re although the european countries are not monolithic in their opinions with respect to the middle east views among them often tend to be much closer to each other than to those of the united states this is largely because european perspectives on the region have been shaped over time by common elements unique to europes history and geostrategic position some bush administration officials nd members of congress are concerned that the recent vitriolic disputes between washington and number of european capitals on middle east issues could constr ain us policies nd erode the broader transatlantic relationship nd useuropean counterterrori sm efforts in the longer term the 911 commission report notes that nearly every aspect of us counterterrorism strategy

and domestic political unrest at home in contrast the bush administration stresses that terrorism and weapons pr oliferation must be confront ed to ensure us national security and that the conditions for peace and stability in the middle east will not be possible until these twin threats are removed these different perspectives often result in the employment of disparate tactics by the two sides of the atlantic as they pursue their foreign policy agendas in the region combination of factors lie at the root of useuropean tensions on the middle east they include different histories geography and demographics the nature of economic ties with the region somewhat di vergent threat perceptions and different views on the appropriate role of the use of force many analysts also suggest that current useuropean frictions over many middle east issues are heightened on the one hand by european views of unilatera list bush administration and on the other by growing eu ambitions to play larger role on the world stage historys impact europes long and complex history w ith the middle east shapes its views toward the region in ways that are distinct from those of the united states europes ancient religious crusades and more recent colonial experiences in the arab world still weigh heavily on its collective psyche and produce twin pangs of wariness and guilt this wariness leads many europeans for example to caution washington against overconfidence in its ability to win the battle for arab hearts and minds through force or to impose stability nd democracy residua l guilt about europes colonialist past causes many of its citizens to identify with what they perceive as struggle for palestinian freedom against israeli occupation at the same time the holocaust engenders european support for the security of israel but europeans believe this will only be ensured by peace with the palestinians finally europes own bloody history has produced broad eur opean aversion to the use of force and preference for solving conflicts diplomatically see below2 geographic and demographic differences europeans claim that the middle east is part of europes neighborhood and this proximity makes the promotion of political and economic stability key to ensuring that problems in the region do not spill over into europe as examples europeans point to several incidents of terrorism on their soil over the last three decades stemming from the israelipalestinia n conflict and recen t waves of migrants fleeing political instability and economic hardship these new migrants add to europes already sizable muslim populati on of between 15 to 20 million which has its roots in european labor shortage s and immigration policies of the 1950s and 1960s that attracted large

cautious about supporting us policies that could inflame their own arab streets and deepen divisions within european societies struggling to integrate growing muslim populations amid rising antiimmigrant ntiments conversely many analysts suggest that the politically wellorganized jewish community in the united states engenders stronger us support for israel the nature of europes economic ties europes extensive economic ties with the middle east have also received considerable public attention as key reas on for differing useuropean approaches the eu is the primary trading partner of the region although substantial element of this trade is oil and any changes in the price or supply of oil would also affect the united states overall european economic interests are more integrated with the region eu exports to the middle east fo r example are almost three times the size of us exports4 some analysts argue that many european countries are primarily motivated by the need to protect these commercial ties with th region and often do so at the expense of security concerns others point out that if such commercial interests were the drivers of french nd german opposition to the war in iraq then both countries would have served those interests better by supporting the usled war to guarantee share of the postsaddam hussein spoils still many experts agree that european countries extensiv trade and economic ties with the region heighten their desires to maintain good re lations with arab g overnments and makes them wary about policies that could di srupt the normal flow of trade and oil5 divergent threat perceptions some observers assert that since the end of the cold war american and european threat perceptions have been di verging throughout the 1990s us policy makers often complained that europe was preoccupied with its own internal transformation and largely bli nd to the new international threats posed by terrorism weapons proliferation and ot her

groups and weapons proliferators in the mideast and elsewhere the average europ ean citizen does not and in certain european countries like germany other issues such as the economy and promoting stability in the nearby balkans have taken precedence6 number of analysts suggest however that the march 11 2004 terrorist bombing s in madrid spain have heightened european perceptions of the threat of is lamist terrorism to europe one opinion poll from june 2004 found that americans and europeans now share broadly similar threat perceptions but differ sharply on the use of force for managing such threats7 different approaches to managing threats and using force as result of europes history bot h pre and postworld war ii numerous observers suggest that europeans are more prone to emphasize multilateral solutions based on the international rule of law many europeans claim that it is precisely because they have abided by such ru and worked cooperatively together in institutions such as the united nations and the european union and its progenitors that they have enjoyed decades of unpr ecedented peace and prosperity combined with the devastation they inflicted on themselves and others in the first half of the twentieth century many europeans especially germans shy away from the use of force to manage conflicts and place greater emphasis on soft power tools such as diplomatic pressure and fo reign aid they are wary of the use of preemptive force not sanctioned by the international community us critic robert kagan calls it power problem observing that eu ropes military weakness has produced european interest in inhabiting world where strength doesnt matter where international law and international institutions predominate8 most europeans however reject this thesis french and british officials in particular argue that they are not pacifists and cite their roles in the natoled war in kosovo and the usled military campaign against the taliban in afghanistan as just two examples european perceptions of the bush administration many analysts believe that european perceptions of the bush administration as inclined toward unilateralism and largely uninterested in europe are exacerbating current transatlantic tensions over the middle east and persian gulf before september 11 many european governments were critical of the administrations position on international treaties such as the kyoto protocol on climate change and its decision to proceed with missile defense the terrorist attacks swept some of these contentious issues under the rug for while but useuropean frictions returned in early 2002 many european l eaders were alarmed by president bushs characterization of iraq iran and north korea as an axis of evil other us moves ranging

mend fences and improved the atmospherics of the relationship howe ver transatlantic tensions have not disappeared and many europeans remain skeptical about the degree to which washington views europe as full and valued partner growing eu ambitions some experts assert that the eus aspirations to play larger role on the world stage have also heightened recent useur opean tensions for many years the eu has been the key donor of fi nancial assistance to the pa lestinians and has sponsored range of regionwide deve lopmental programs but the eus effort over the last decade to develop common foreign and security policy cfsp to help further eu political integration has prompted the eu to seek higherprofile role in the region that goes beyond its trad itional walle t function10 the eu has had some success in forging consensus on its approach to the middle east peace process and how best to deal with iran some say this has helped make certain eu members such as france more confident and assertive about confronting us policies with which they do not agree at the same time the eu was unable to agree on common policy on iraq key players such as the united kingdom italy and spain more closely supported the us approach to the use of force against iraq critics note that the eu still has long way to go before it is able to speak with one voice on foreign policy issues but the

of us arguments directly linki ng saddam hussein and qaeda and did not view the threat posed by iraq as immin ent in part because they believed that the 12 years of internationa l sanctions had limited iraqs ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction12 thus france germany nd others deemed contained saddam hussein as threat they could live with especially given their judgment that war with iraq would have dangerous and destabilizing consequences many europeans feared that toppling saddam could further fragment the country along ethnic and tribal lines and generate instability number of european governments also worried that war with iraq would inflame their own domestic arab streets especially given the stalemate in the middle east peace process european officials pointed out that many muslims view israeli prime minister ariel sharon in much the same light as washington did saddam hussein and reject as double standa rd the use of force against iraq even uk officials who supported the us approach to iraq were concerned that war could further antagonize muslims both in the region and in europe wit hout tangible progress on the israelipalestinian conflict moreover some europeans stressed that rather than helping to curb terrorism war with iraq would be an additional rallying point for qaeda recruiters and other militant islamic groups13 numerous europeans also opposed war in iraq without explicit authorization because in their view it risked destroying the international system of rules and laws created after world war ii to maintain global peace and stability in light of german history berlin was especially reluctant to agree to any preemptive measures not sanctioned by the interna tional community even london madrid and rome which more closely backed wash ingtons approach to iraq would have preferred second resolution explicitly authorizing the use of force many europeans now worry that the bush ad ministration has ope ned pandoras box some note that other states with territorial ambitions perhaps russia or china could feel freer to launch similar measures ag ainst border regions under the pretext of preempting threats to their national security the us action in iraq could also prove counterproductive if it encourages other c ountries to speed up or initiate programs to acquire wmd capabilities in an attempt to deter us attack the

of sanctions reduced these interests to minimum and also prohibited oil contracts agreed with saddam husseins regime from taking effect14 these officials also note that paris and berlin had somewhat larger financial intere sts in iraq prior to the 1990 invasion of kuwait but they did not hesitate then to join the coalition against iraq at that time they point out iraq had clearly breached international rules nd posed clear threat to stability in the aftermath of the war useurop ean tensions over iraq have abated to some degree but still linger us officials have been frustrated by what they view as minimal military or fina ncial assistance from some european countries throughout the usled occupation of ir aq which ended in june 2004 the role of the united nations in rebuilding iraq was major sticking point most european countries including the uk favored giving the united nations significant role to bolster the credibility of the reconstruction process in contrast washington initially favored narrow advisory role for th united nations with most activity focused on providing humanitarian assist ance and coordinating international aid donations washingtons position on limited participation in iraq won out in the immediate aftermath of the war as s een in security council resolution agreed to in may 2003 although france and germany approved this resolution they announced that they would not contribute troops or significant bila teral financial aid in light of the restricted role they like several other smaller european nations were reluctant to become

forces in october 2003 the ad ministration secured another security council resolution calling on the internationa l community to help rebuild iraq and giving the united nations marginally larger role in forging new iraqi government however it left the united states in overall control of iraqs transition as result the resolution fell short of the expectati ons of many including france and germany

states is alienating the broader muslim world whic h perceives us double standard at work european leaders have clamored for the united states to do more to get israelipalestinian negotiations back on

governments and eu officials hope that the death of pale stinian leader yasser arafat in november 2004 will create new opportunity to reso lve the israelipa lestinian conflict some us observers suggest that eu ropes more propa lestinian position is motivated by an underlying antisemitism in support of this view they point to spate of attacks on synagogues and other jewish institutions in europe strong european media bias against israel and recen t statements by some european officials criticizing israel in january 2004 two jewish leaders charged the european commission with fueling antisemitism with its clumsy handling of two reports these leaders objected to the commissions release in november 2003 of an opinion poll which showed that 59 of the europ ean public considered israel threat to world peace on grounds that it was dangerous ly inflammatory at the same time they also criticized the commissions initia l decision to shelve 2002 study from the eus racism

muslim youth eu officials contend that the report was originally withheld because it was poor ly written and lacking in empirical evidence following its leak to the press the eu made public this draft

march 2004 report identifie d perpetrators of antisemitic attacks in europe as both young disaffected white eu ropeans as well as muslim youth of north african or asian origin some jewish leaders

europeans also stress that criticism of israel does not equate to antisemitism they admit that such criticism in the european media and political classes has been fierce recently but they suggest this reflects the depth of european anger toward israeli prime minister ariel sharon and his policies many european lead ers deplore sharons tactics toward the palestinians believing them to be heavyhanded and c ounterproductive they also object to his leadership of israel in light of what they consider his history of human rights violations nd war crimes in lebanon28 historically degree of difference has always existed between us and european approaches to the israelipales tinian conflict europeans have traditionally favored parallel approach th at applies pressure to all sides this approach also places equal emphasis on the security po litical and economic velopment agendas that europeans believe are all ultimately necessary for lasting peace european officials stress that the only way to guarantee israels security is to create viable palestinian state this is also why th eu has sought to support the palestinian authority pa financially and to provide humanita rian development and

and crs report rl31017 the barcelona process the european unions partnership with the southern mediterranean in contrast the united states has more consistently shared the israeli view that serious negotiations can only take place wh there is clear palestinian commitment to peace signified by the end of violence and terrorist activity the degree to which different us administrations have rigidl adhered to this more sequential approach has varied over the years but europeans believe that septembe r 11 reinforced us tendencies to support israe li positions on the timing of potential negotiations because they hardened the bush administrations view of the palestinians the terrorist attacks also allowed prime minister sharon to position himself as natural us ally in the fight against terrorism many europeans believe the bush administration has been too easily persuaded by sharon and too beholden to israel for domestic political reasons they point out that the adminis tration draws consider able political support from evangelical christians who strongly support the state of israel and has been eager to win over traditionally democratic jewish voters31 despite the difficulties optimists asse rt that common ground exists between us and european policies toward the isr aelipalestinian conflict eu leaders have been encouraged by president bushs suppor t for palestinian state long advocated by europeans previous us administra tions had shied away from endorsing two state solution maintaining that it was for the parties themselves to determine the outcome eu officials have also welcomed the evolution of the diplomatic quartet of the eu russia the united nations nd the united states and its roadmap to negotiated settlement european lead ers did not support washingtons call to replace the late yasser arafat as the head of the pa they viewed arafat as the democraticallyelected palestinian leader and feared that any viable alternative would only

the us middle east partnership initiative mepi which was unveiled in december 2002 and signed to promote political economic and educational developmen t throughout the middle east many europeans

prime minister sharon and thenpa prime minister mahmoud abbas european officials viewed positively president bushs decisions to set up us diplomatic team in jerusalem to monitor implementation of the roadmap and to designate thennational security adviser condoleezza rice as his personal represen tative on israelipa lestinian affairs since then however many europeans ve become frustrated by the lack of progress on the roadmap amid ongoing violence and they claim that the bush administration has not done enough to caj ole the sharon government into making more concessions for peace although the administration has criticized israel for constructing security fence and at times raised concerns about some israeli anti terrorist tactics such as territorial closures and home demolitions critics say washington has not devoted the sustained attention needed they stress that the administration still remains wedded to the israeli view that palestinian terrorism must end before serious steps toward implementing the roadmap can be taken they note for example that the us monitoring team in jerusalem kept very low profile and has largely been withdrawn as resu lt it failed to provide the necessary level of public scrutiny that was supposed to have served as an incentive for both sides of the conflict to meet their respec tive obligations under the roadmap34 us support for the sharon governments unilateral disengagement plan for the gaza strip was also contentious for european governments and the eu although the eu has welcomed israels august 2005 withdrawal from the gaza strip some european policymakers remain concerned that israel views its disengagement from gaza as an alternative to the road map process they worry that israels disengagement from gaza could lead to the creation of facto palestinian state on far less territory than that nvisaged under the roadmap process many europeans were dismayed by what they viewed as shift in us policy in april 2004 when president bush appeared to implic itly endorse israels claim to parts of the west bank seized in the 1967 middle east war and to limit the palestinians right of return to israel the eu maintains th at

capital of the united states to create free and democratic palestinian state during his next term many europeans however argue that the administration has been slow to seize the opportunity offered by ar afats death to push for quick return to israelipalestinian negotiations us officials appear to favor more incremental approach they stress that progress in the peace process will depend largely on palestinian efforts to democratize reform and stop palestinian terrorism washington and european capitals welcomed the january 2005 election of mahmoud abbas who is viewed as committed to ending

its ongoing human righ ts violations heightened eu worries about the nature of irans nuclear pr ogram and its lack of compliance with international atomic energy agency iae safeguards also contributed to the stalemate on the trade pact eu members had high hopes for an october 2003 deal brokered with iran by the uk france and germany the eu3 iran agreed to accept intrusive international inspections of its nuclear facilities and to suspend production of enriched uranium at least mporarily in exchange for promises of future european exports of nuclear energy technology but this deal soon faltered the europeans viewed iran as dragging its feet in complying with iaea requirements and were angered by irans decision in july 2004 to resume building nuclear centrifuges since then some observers

ultimately if equal attention is paid to addressing the political social and economic disparities that often help foster terrorist violence european leaders were initially skeptical of the usproposed broader middle east initia tive however because they worried that it sought to democratize the middle east and impose western values although europeans would agree that more demo cratic middle east would help promote peace and stability many doubt that it can be dictated from the outside and are uncomfortable with attempts to do so because to them it smacks of colonialism and religious fervor some europeans also worry that introducing democracy into arab countries could lead to anti western factions or militant islamists winning elections thus some europeans suggest more nuan ced

and military wings of the same organization such as hamas although th eu terrorist list included hamas military wing since its first iteration in decembe r 2001 the political wing was not added until september 2003 some eu member s had argued that hamas pol itical wing provided crucial social services in the we st bank and gaza and worried that listing it would only further inflame the israelipale

administration has also set its sights on promoting more democratically acc ountable governments us officials reject the arguments of european skeptics who say this is not feasible they point out that the same doubts were raised after world war ii about the ability of germany and japan to sustain democr atic values some us commentators suggest that european governments have been slow to address th

proliferation some european officials also resent that us policies toward iraq exposed divisions among eu members at time when the eu has been seeking to shape its future structure and forge more common foreign and security policy number of observers suggest that this is key reason why the transatlantic quarrel over iraq was divisive the internal eu clashes over ir aq were in part indicative of broader power struggle among and between eu memb er states and eu candidates over the future of the union in particular th future shape of cfsp and who speaks for europe as well as what kind of relationshi p the eu desires with the united states despite several common eu statements in january and february 2003 calling on iraq to disarm experts contend these pronoun cements only papered over differences on the use of force and represented the lowest common denominator of eu opinion many analysts say the true depth of the eu rift over iraq was exposed by the january 30 2003 decision of five eu members and three aspirants to publicly call for unity with washington on iraq which was followed by similar declaration by seven other eu candidates and three balkan count ries with eu aspirations the lack of prior consultation on these statements with brussels or athens holder of the eus rotating presidency at the time outraged paris and some other eu capitals french president jacques chirac publically blasted the eu candidates stating that they were badly brought up and had misse d good opportunity to keep quiet67 some attribute chiracs outburst to fear s of dwindling french influence over cfsps development as the eu expands to include central and eastern european states that paris perceives as more proamerican68 many new eu member states still view the united states as the ultimate guarantor of european security although some new eu members may have privately shared french and german concerns about us actions in iraq they viewed th crisis as strategic choice between the united states and saddam hussein and calculated that the iraqi regime was not worth putting good relations with washingt on at risk at the same time theneu candidates were dismayed by us defense secretary donald rumsfelds comments in february 2003 that divided europe into old countries that opposed the usled invasion of iraq and new countries that supported it given th eir

bushs and secretary rices trips to europe in february 2005 ma ny believe they have gone long way toward improving the atmospherics of the relationship and that the discussions between president bush and key european leaders have helped to narrow some differences over how to manage iran and syria despite these hopeful signs skeptics asse rt that the wounds from the clash over iraq have not fully healed and us and european policies still diverge on many issues several factors will likely influence how deep and lasting the damage from the dispute over iraq and subsequent policies in the middle east will be to the broader transatlantic relationship one key determinant will be whether the united states and its european allies and friends can cooperate more robustly in the future in rebuilding iraq another factor likely to affect the shape of the future transatlantic relationship may be whether the europeans perceive renewed commitment by the united states to engage in sustained effort to revive middle east peace negotiations furthermore observers not that the overall transatlantic relationship would further deteriorate if recriminations over iraq or policy differences on other middle east issues were to weaken nato or imped the eus efforts to forge deeper and wider union some worry that washington has lost confidence in nato as result of the failure of france germany and be lgium

nato and the transatlantic link they point to the ap ril 2003 meeting of fren ch german belgian and luxembourg leaders to discuss creatin g european military headquarters this initiative was scaled back in december 2003 but some experts believe that the eu agreement to enhance its existing military planning capabilities may be the first step in driving the transatlantic alliance apart despite the fact that eu leaders also agreed to set up an eu planning cell at nato and will accept nato liaison officers at the eu to ensure transparency and cooperation between the two organizations over the last several years some europeans worried that the bush administration in part because of us european differences over iraq and other contentious middle east issues was keen to keep europe weak and divided in order to preserve us leverage on indivi dual eu member states they feared that secretary rumsfelds comments about old and new europe signaled an unofficial shift in us policy away fro m continued support for further european integration such concerns have contributed significantly to recent frictions in the broader useuropean relationship president bushs visit to the eus institutions while in brussels in february 2005 and hi s clear assertion that the united states wants the european project to succeed have helped alleviate some european anxieties71 however if future us policy
