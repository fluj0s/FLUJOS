specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protective statutes summary workers in agriculture generally have experienced different pattern of labor management relations and labor standards from those in the industrial workforce in part such disparity was related to the nature of the work and the characteristics of the workers some agricultural workers have tended to be migratory or seasonal they have tended to be employed more or less casually for short periods by any single employer who perhaps not surprisingly did not want to be burdened by regular employeremployee relationship some agricultural workers are skilled the majority are probably marginally skilled or unskilled though they perform necessary services two pieces of legislation sequentially have dealt in significant manner with migrant or seasonal agricultural labor in 1964 congress passed the farm labor contractor registration act flcra for decade little attention was paid to the statute but then in 1974 it was amended and suddenly storm of protest was heard it was argued that the wrong people were being forced to register through the next nine years various interests sought modification of the act to conform to their perceptions of the original intent of the congress in 1983 congress repealed the flcra and replaced it with the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act mspa with very few exceptions mspa has operated without controversy but at the same time some may ask has the new enactment been effective the two statutes flcra and mspa are intimately connected and have triggered similar reactions with respect to immigration policy to the inability of agricultural workers to organize and to bargain collectively and to more general labor standards some have suggested that practices under flcra and of mspa have been unduly burdensome has the concept of farm labor contractor been defined with sufficient care have agricultural interests made effective use of their employees providing them with training and with consistency of employment might better utilization of employees prove more productive and more profitable and might these changes in turn prove more attractive to domestic american workers this report is summary and survey spelling out the considerations that congress found were part of the realities of agricultural employment in 20th and 21st century america it begins in the 1960s with the advent of flcra and proceeds through the enactment of mspa and to the end of the century but it is

agricultural workers protective statutes during the late 1950s general congressional interest had developed in the condition of migratory or seasonal farm workers in the united states several exploratory hearings had been held but new legislation had been adopted then on friday evening the day after thanksgiving 1960 television program aired harvest of shame with edward r murrow harvest of shame was report on the plight of the migratory farm workers who as virtual peons kept the nations larders stocked the public reaction to it was one of surprised horror at the conditions portrayed farm organizations were horrified for other reasons charging highly colored propaganda and deceit farmers spokesmen demanded equal time1 the murrow broadcast emphasized the risks and hazards associated with crew leaders and agricultural employment at large whatever the flaws of the film it provided context for various pieces of migrant and seasonal farmworker legislation that had been and would continue to be before the congress through the next several years congress would consider number of pieces of remedial legislation focusing upon the farm environment two bills that became law are of special importance the farm labor contractor registration act flcra 19641983 and successor statute the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act mspa 1983 ff the two statutes sequentially provide the basis for regulation of migrant agricultural and seasonal agricultural workers focal point of each of the statutes however has been the farm labor contractor through nearly 50 years intermittently the congress has debated the two statutes and their implications for labor supply for immigration and for equity for the several parties involved the issues have changed little though their focus may have been altered initially up to 1974 concern was voiced with respect to farm labor contractors and their alleged excesses then after the 1974 amendments to flcra concern moved away from contractors and toward those who used migrant and seasonal workers essentially the growers and their agents in 1983 flcra was repealed and replaced with the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act the latter mspa with few exceptions notably the case of adams fruit see below has remained as written there have been numerous hearings on the act and likely more will follow this report summarizes debate over the acts and in that context the evolution of agricultural labor 1 alexander kendrick prime time the life of edward r murrow boston little brown and company 1969 p 453 crs2 part i the farm labor contractor registration act origins and congressional enactment 1964 the farm labor contractor or crew leader is the bridge between the farm operator and the migrant laborer farm operators would go south each year to meet the crew leader and arrange for migratory crews large majority of migrants belong to crews in 1960 it was reported the largest crew numbered 185 workers the smallest 13 with the usual size between 45 and 74 members the crews grew out of the need of inarticulate people to have someone to speak for them and the farmers problem of recruiting and handling labor2 in 1959 senator harrison williams dnj introduced legislation seeking through federal registration to eliminate the relatively few migrant labor contractors who are dishonest and immoral and who exploit migrant workers and growers slightly different bill was introduced by senators jacob javits rny and kenneth keating rny in the house representative james roosevelt dca was an early sponsor of such legislation3 none of these early bills were approved it would take hearings and subsequent refinement through three congresses before their adoption the various roles of the farm labor contractor in theory the crew leader is an independent businessman with varied tasks some crew leaders do little more than recruit for farm operators but for farmer several hundred or several thousand miles away from the areas of labor supply that task is monumental others become more deeply involved in the management of the crew the report to the senate subcommittee on migratory labor 1960 observed that some provide transportation for the migrant others oversee the work of the crew upon its arrival manage the camps where the migrants are housed provide the commissary and food facilities pay the crew members haul the produce from the fields to the packing sheds the profit for the farm labor contractor lies in the differential between what they are paid by the farmer and what they pay to the worker some crew leaders work on commission basis taking few cents from each item produced by crew members4 the list of alleged abuses associated with the farm labor contractor appears to have been as long and varied as those engaged in the field as the 1961 hearings commenced william batt pennsylvanias secretary of labor and industry noted 2 us congress senate subcommittee

desirable crew leaders batt noted the then standard complaints changing wage rates without explanation exploitation of child labor illegal sale of alcoholic beverages charging the workers rental fee on housing provided free by the grower importation of prostitutes with sharing of the take food profiteering in crewleaderoperated commissaries hunting deer out of season shooting and beating up other crew leaders rigged crewleaderoperated gambling games paying crew members in scrip in lieu of cash charging exorbitant transportation fees batt continued in the case of one crew leader who kept accurate wage records the services of prostitute were payroll deductible item5 matt triggs speaking for the american farm bureau federation and defending the contractors suggested that stories of abuse were told and retold with misleading implication that there is more of this than there really is6 another witness with legislation in mind argued that contractors are educationally unequipped to perform the laborious clerical function this bill would impose7 third stated that with their limited education the contractors would be unable to fill out the necessary forms that the act will require8 yet another declared they are not schooled much recordkeeping much bookkeeping is anathema to them they are not trained for it9 triggs asserted that most leaders have previously been migratory workers they are semiliterate10 and triggs affirmed you have got to realize that an awful lot of these crew leaders are very simple people11 nonetheless contractors may undertake relatively sophisticated responsibilities secretary of labor willard wirtz pointed out that in oregon it was the general 5 us congress senate committee on labor and public welfare subcommittee on migratory labor

thirds 63 percent of the areas surveyed nationally the workers were paid by the crew leaders13 similarly the crew leader is responsible in certain circumstances for making the necessary deductions and keeping payroll records with respect to social security participation14 sarah newman then of the national consumers league observed because crew leaders are under regulated responsibility to anyone their many abuses have been able to flourish15 issues in the early debate during three congresses from 1959 to 1964 numerous bills not always labor related were introduced to ameliorate the conditions of agricultural workers as these bills evolved it was difficult to keep their implications separate the following section analyses in general way deal with issues and concepts common to many of these proposals 12 hearings senate 1963 pp 3940 it would appear that the most frequent cause of concern where farm labor contractors are involved were problems associated in some manner with transportation in the us congress senate committee on labor and public welfare 87th cong 1st sess senate report 695 to accompany s 1162 august 9 1961 p 5 it is noted that these abuses include overcharging workers for transportation advances collecting for transportation expenses from both employers and workers accepting transportation advances from employers and failing to report to work or reporting with smaller crew than contracted for abandoning crew without means of transportation and failure to return workers to their homes cited hereafter as senate report 695 1961 13 hearings senate 1963 p 39 the reference was to brochure summary of farm labor crew leader practices november 1962 prepared by the farm labor service bureau of employment security department of labor 14 senate report 695 1961 p 5 during hearings house 1963 p 97 there was dialogue between representative james roosevelt and edith lowry testifying on behalf of the national advisory committee on farm labor mr roosevelt we would also for social security purposes have better way of seeing whether the proper deductions were being made and forwarded to the federal government rather than having as we now suspect but have very little way of proving many of them pay social security to the crew leader and yet get credit for it by the social security headquarters would you consider this was too onerous task for us to impose upon crew leader miss lowry i dont think so because it seems to it is essential for anybody who carries the responsibility of handling the affairs for so many people that find difficulty in fitting into our society to be required to handle these things in an orderly way i do know there is real problem in the social security matter 15 us congress house committee on labor house committee on education and labor 88th cong 1st sess hearing registration of farm labor contractors april 3 5 and 10 1963 p 70 cited hereafter as hearings house 1963 newman p 69 notes because of their dependency on the crew leader migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse by these contractors migrants she explained are usually isolated from the community sometimes never even meeting the grower whose crop they pick they are dependent on the crew leader for the next job and for their daily living arrangements crs5 state versus federal we do not believe this bill would serve any useful purpose since most farm labor contractors are already registered with one or more state employment services stated charles creuziger spokesperson for the vegetable growers association of america we believe as matter of principle that regulation of the contractors can best be handled by the states16 industry and nonindustry forces divided on the issue of federalism j banks young of the national cotton council urged that the issue was strictly local and that federal intervention would adversely restrict the availability and mobility of such workers and unnecessarily increase farm costs17 noting the alleged abuses under the current system richard oconnell of the national council of farmer cooperatives stressed the local character of the problem most states he suggested have laws prohibiting gambling prostitution unlawful narcotics and liquor sales if so the crew leaders should be indicted under the appropriate laws and having paid their debt should not be harassed18 triggs also thought local government could handle the issue even if the 9 or 10 farm labor bills now before the congress were to be enacted we believe they would represent an ineffectual approach to the problem and in some cases would be decidedly harmful to the interests of workers and farmers19 observing that the states already had regulations dealing with labor camps triggs stated that only handful of these laws are really adequate crew leaders can evade their regulations by going to other states with their crews that do not have licensing requirements if the federal government were to act it should focus on the licensing of crew leaders or contractors of migratory labor20 the problem requires the leadership of the federal government secretary wirtz advised because of the movement of contractors across state lines person involved in malpractice in this area is simply likely not to be there when somebody charges him21 others concurred fellow who is fined or barred in one state will simply duck into another state and there perhaps commit the same practices suggested arnold mayer of the amalgamated meat cutters and butcher workmen of north america the migrant labor stream is an interstate stream and dealing with it needs interstate legislation22 authority for the secretary industry spokespersons questioned the wisdom of granting new authority to the secretary of labor to manage agricultural labor 16 hearings senate 1963 p 150 references to this bill or to the bill are generic in some cases it is not clear to which bill speaker is referring or to an abstract bill further reference is to series of hearings with different bills 17 hearings house 1963 pp 141142 18 hearings house 1963 p 22 19 hearings house 1963 p 8 20 hearings senate 1961 pp 2324 21 hearings house 1961 p 116 22 hearings house 1963 p 139 crs6 supply many of the terms used are not clearly defined stated young of the cotton council as it stands the power to issue regulations under the authority of the bill is extremely broad23 the authority granted to the secretary remarked james moore of the national apple institute would inevitably result in control by the secretary of the agricultural migratory labor market24 the requirement as to their financial responsibility would impose burdens which few individuals recruiting labor could meet25 the proposed legislation would establish the secretary as judge jury and prosecutor stated delmer robinson of the frederick county virginia fruitgrowers association we do not feel that mans livelihood the contractors should depend on the benevolence of the secretary of labor26 the secretary in accord with his own rules can put out of business any contractor who has failed without justification to comply with the regulations but the proposal is completely silent as to who would decide whether or not there was justification it is presumed the secretary could arbitrarily decide this point27 defining terms through the hearings concepts to be used in the act were gradually defined still numerous concerns were voiced by industry with respect to the several bills that came before the committees defining contractor the farm bureau favored narrow definition of contractor with registration limited to crew leaders proper and not extended to all persons who may recruit or transport workers but how might one distinguish between labor contractor to be registered and persons who may recruit or transport workers28 the national cotton council argued that the concept of contractor thus far defined would require registration of fraternal religious social and other organizations which frequently provide temporary agricultural employment for their members and processors who provide workers to farmers29 others argued that the term might include charitable and religious organizations and 4h advisers30 the proposal it was suggested seems to make crew leader out of everyone who contacts more than nine people31 and could include groups such as sugar 23 hearings senate 1963 pp 302303 24 hearings senate 1961 pp 182183 25 statement from the national cotton council hearings house 1961 p 216 26 hearings senate

provide labor only as incidental to the main services they offer farmers these some felt should be excluded32 even true crew leaders often work through responsible employees who should not have to register it was argued that employees of any registered entity should not be required to register but rather have single certificate of registration for the overall recruitment activity33 the definition of contractor it was urged should be changed to cover the individual who gathers crew of workers in one state and transports them to another state and stays with them in supervisory capacity and is the actual crew leader34 again we would strongly recommend that you eliminate at least the resident concern the canner who recruits workers for farmers in the territory the sugar companies the cotton gins labor associations and others that are responsible financially35 duration of registration registration should be permanent and continue in effect until revoked for cause the farm bureau spokesman held we see valid reason for the annual licensing of crew leaders36 the department of labor dol however did recognize need for annual licensing the common phrase fly by night applies i suppose more aptly to this economic situation than to almost any other which i can think of observed secretary wirtz37 all the evidence we have indicates that there is considerable turnover among the crew leader personnel observed robert goodwin of dols bureau of employment security making it necessary really to have an annual certification goodwin took note of auto and other insurance this would be issued on an annual basis and would require determination as to whether the insurance had been purchased and was adequate and only after that determination was made could the certification be completed this would require the annual certification38 the international apple association raised the issue of fees for service while the current secretary may not anticipate significant fee future secretary might wish to put the contractors out of business and could set an unreasonable sum39 32 hearings house 1963 p l43 33 hearings house 1961 p 206 34 hearings house 1961

taking care of the administrative costs40 rulemaking authority of the secretary eliminate the rulemaking authority stated farm bureau spokesman the statute is complete in itself and requires supplemental rulemaking authority41 the rulemaking authority may have posed something of dilemma for critics on the one hand many of the concepts used in the bill are not clearly defined and will be given meaning only by regulation by the secretary conversely the terms of the bill would permit the secretary to require almost any kind of information he might desire and could lead to the control of large segment of domestic migrant farmworkers this broad grant of authority should be deleted42 we feel asserted robert rea of the virginia state horticultural society that it should be mandatory for the secretary to issue certificate of registration as migrant labor contractor to any person who files the required information and carries reasonable amount of insurance the mere threat of withholding certificate rea stated places the labor contractor under direct control of the secretary of labor this allows the secretary to in effect dictate wage rates housing and working conditions that the crew leader must agree to or be threatened with loss of the right to earn livelihood the proposal as written he said could make the cure worse than the disease43 crossing state boundaries concerning interstate commerce delmer robinsons ranch straddled the virginiawest virginia frontiers you can almost figure that an employee of mine operating wagon with 10 people on it going from one side of the orchard to the other is migrant labor contractor according to this definition i am sure he stated that is not what is meant in the context of the legislation44 the definition of contractor is so broad stated joseph dorsey frederick county virginia that it would include any growers who hire and transport workers across state lines which many of our members have to do daily in making use of labor within their various locations our association by virtue of its location draws on several states for both regular and seasonal labor45 these definitions stated another grower are so broad that even greyhound bus would require registration if 10 or more migrants were aboard46 40 hearings senate 1963 pp 227228 41 hearings house 1963 p 10 42 hearings house 1963 pp 142143 43 hearings

the house richard oconnell the national council of farmer cooperatives was asked is it not fair and reasonable requirement to expect these crew leaders who transport families of workers from one state to another to be financially responsible to the migrant workers which they transport for personal injuries and property damage oconnell thought the requirement was appropriate if the question were in fact that explicit however oconnell found the term financial responsibility to be obtuse and questioned whether it meant bonding this is one of these vague terms that if you start writing regulations on it it can mean anything47 braceros versus domestic workers during the hearings of 1961 c h fields of the farm bureau of new jersey was questioned by representative herbert zelenko dny mr fields new jersey farmers do not use migrant labor because they want to they would much prefer not to use it if there were any other labor available at wage they could afford to pay mr zelenko you said the new jersey farmer would not engage migrant labor if he could help it but that he could not get local labor at the price he wants to pay mr fields at the price that he can afford to pay i said mr zelenko would you be good enough to give this committee what the prevailing wage is in new jersey for farm laborer doing the type of work that migrant would do mr fields 110 an hour48 in the early 1960s congress had under consideration not only legislation dealing with farm labor contractors but as well with the braceros49 as it has evolved the bracero program and later the h2a program has been based upon two premises 47 hearings house 1961 pp 3233 48 hearings house 1961 p 235 mr fields went on to state that in south jersey the prevailing wage was then 100 49 the term bracero has number of translations but in general it refers to mexican workers brought into the united states under guest worker program the bracero is documented worker and should not be confused with the undocumented worker who has entered the united states illegally and if employed is employed illegally see howard n dillon foreign agricultural workers and the prevention of adverse effect labor law journal december 1966 pp 739748 and crs report rl32044 immigration policy considerations related to guest worker programs by andorra bruno crs10 there are not sufficient workers who are able willing and qualified and who will be available at the time and place needed to perform the labor or services involved b the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the united states similarly employed50 an adverse effect wage rate was devised that must be paid to both foreign and domestic workers where an effort has been made to employ the former and which was intended nominally to prevent negative impact from employment of braceros comparing braceros with domestic workers gradually domestic employment and utilization of braceros became intertwined the documentation is clear stated vera mayer national consumers league that the massive importation of cheap foreign labor has lowered wages to american farmworkers and taken away job opportunities from them51 labor secretary arthur goldberg seemed to agree there is increasing evidence of the correlation between this largescale use of foreign workers in agriculture and the employment situation of our own farmworkers he stressed that the central problems of migrant farmworkers were the lack of reasonably attractive employment opportunities and low wages52 here the secretary and ms mayer were not alone the rev john wagner associated with the national council for the spanish speaking of san antonio suggested that the impact of the bracero program is very great father wagner opined it throws another large number of unskilled workers into pool that is already overloaded with unskilled workers and there becomes mad scramble for jobs53 meanwhile father james vizzard then associated with the national catholic rural life conference posed the question what other group of farmers or workers have to compete in the marketplace with workers brought into this country by an agency of the government partly at taxpayers expense54 triggs of the farm bureau explained that the domestic worker is often severely disabled physically mentally or psychiatrically or by reason of age in such cases he stated the employer should not be required to pay the same wages as for an able bodied man whereas he added the mexican workers are carefully screened they are mostly young vigorous able bodied55 twiggs added if the farmer prepays transportation for mexican nationals it is with the assurance that the worker will not leave the job after he arrives to work for somebody else further he stated the mexican workers are unaccompanied by their families and as 50 8 usc 1188aa and b see also crs report rl32861 farm labor the adverse effect wage rate aewr by william

housing finally he stated the hours of employment are generally uniform and standardized56 both labor and management witnesses seemed in agreement with respect to domestic and mexican crews arnold mayer of the amalgamated meat cutters and butcher workmen of north america aflcio stated in the first place the bracero is very docile more so than even the domestic migrants are over the braceros head hangs the threat that he may be sent back to mexico if he complains too much or if he kicks up too much of fuss he has left his family he expects to come back with some money so he does not want to be sent back without money mayer agreed that the bracero is carefully screened so that the workers that do come from mexico are prime labor as single men the braceros have an impact on housing the growers can erect barracktype housing for them american migrants very often move with their families and housing and facilities for them are more expensive mayer stated the growers know that this importation causes surplus of labor and that this surplus is very very useful in keeping wage rates down and rather than compete for labor the foreign workers are simply made available57 sorting out the workers there is clear interrelationship between the administration of the migratory labor program and the administration of public law 78 the bracero program stated secretary wirtz if we can put domestic labor on sounder administrative basis which this bill would help us very much to do it would mean lesser need for the use of mexican nationals he referred to the floating group of american migratory workers and observed i feel quite strongly that the proper use of the crew leader can be of real advantage to the employing farmer as well as to the employees58 during hearings in 1963 representative thomas gill dhi entered into dialogue with richard shipman of the national farmers union gill observed that undocumented farm workers were sometimes cheated out of their earnings shipman replied of course if person is in this country illegally he is at the mercy of anybody they have rights gill concurred they are fair game for shoddy operator59 in some parts of oregon gill speculated undocumented labor makes up 56 hearings house 1961 p 103 57 hearings house 1963 pp 136137 father vizzard urged against the use of immigrant workers on page 149 he suggested i dont think the way to help the mexican economy or the individual mexican people is by using them as in effect strikebreakers against our own people for undercutting the wages and working conditions of our own citizens see also comments of senator williams hearings house 1961 p 53 58 hearings house 1963 p 124 59 hearings house 1963 pp 5051 crs12 about 20 of the workforce in that particular region of oregon representative roosevelt stated practically all of the recruiting was done for sugar company60 shipman concurred that the wetback problem is of long standing he stated in the total spanishspeaking migrant group approximately 20 percent enter the united states on border crosser permits on forged documents or in the old fashioned wetback manner licensing would help roosevelt suggested that under the current proposal suspension would follow if the contractor has recruited employed or utilized the service of person with knowledge that such person is violating the provisions of the immigration and nationality laws such person can be refused license but is also subject to penalty under the act he further pointed to provision allowing the secretary under authority to obtain information to conduct more specific investigation61 congressional action on contractor registration during the late 1950s and early 1960s senator williams had sought controls on farm labor contractors and though the measures were not adopted he kept trying in 1963 legislation began to move the contractor registration bill was called up for senate consideration on june 11 1963 williams explained the nature of farm labor contracting concluding that many contractors perform their functions in satisfactory and responsible manner but that others have exploited both farmers and workers62 at that point senator john tower rtx objected to passage of the bill stating i do not believe the measure is needed tower agreed that there were occasional instances of crew leaders who dont deal fairly with workers or farmers but these cases are disputable and exaggerated since many states already register farm labor contractors the proposed legislation would be redundant he stated63 other senator rose in opposition and the senate moved on to other business few minutes later the senate switched back to the farm labor contractor legislation and following brief discussion passed the bill on voice vote64 it was more than year before representative roosevelt called up the measure in the house the bill he declared was essentially noncontroversial65 representative gill the author of the bill agreed that the bill was very minimal piece of legislation but the need for this is very obvious gill stated 60 hearings house 1963 p 51 reference was to prior comments that sugar companies would not need to be covered since they were not involved or only marginally involved in recruitment and they are fixed site employers 61 hearings house 1963 pp 5153 62 congressional record june 11 1963 pp 1061910621 63

often undereducated or in many instances completely uneducated the literacy level is generally low their ability to understand their rights is minimal many of these migrant laborers have voting residence they have congressman nor do they have access to other officials who may help them with their problems therefore they are easy to victimize the bill would be of great assistance to the good

this legislation representative charles bennett dfl similarly expressed his strong support of the bill the migrant laborer should longer be neglected stated representative william fitts ryan dny this bill is belated recognition of his plight67 thereupon the house passed the farm labor contractor registration legislation by 343 yeas to 7 nays though with several changes from the senatepassed version68 as amended the bill was taken up in the senate passed by voice vote and sent to president lyndon johnson becoming pl 88582 on september 7 196469 the farm labor contractor registration act of

system of judicial review is prescribed under the act rules and regulations the secretary is authorized to issue such rules and regulations as he determines necessary for the purposes of carrying out certain provisions of this act crs17 part ii the first years of the farm labor contractor registration act 19641974 from 1964 until 1974 the flcra was given institutional life administration of the act was set in motion and patterns of interpretation were developed there was however some criticism of the act and sense that it had not lived up to the hope and expectations of its authors the inaugural period flcra focused upon one aspect of the issue of migrant and seasonal worker protections the farm labor contractor in late december 1964 secretary wirtz issued regulations under the act and the manpower administrator bureau of employment security was given the responsibility as the authorized designee of the secretary71 there followed series of directives published in the federal register dealing with insurance and financial responsibility72 however some terms used in the legislation seem to have lent themselves to vague patterns of interpretation for example see the definition of farm labor contractor the term farm labor contractor means any person who recruits solicits hires furnishes or transports ten or more migrant workers at any one time in any calendar year for interstate agricultural employment the official interpretation of the statute explores each of these concepts at some length but seemingly without resolution73 in 1969 under secretary george shultz dol underwent administrative restructuring with flcra and 28 other programs assigned to the assistant secretary for manpower74 then in 1972 under secretary james hodgson split was effected with the labor standards aspects of flcra assigned to the wagehour 71 see federal register december 22 1964 p 18157 and february 3 1965 p 1139 it was not until late 1972 that responsibility for flcra was shifted to the wagehour division which normally deals with labor standards issues see federal register january 17 1973 p 1636 72 see federal register october 12 1966 pp 1317413176 november 22 1966 pp 1477214775 may 9 1967 pp 70257026 and july 20 1967 p l0649 73 federal register march 6 1965 pp 29452950 for example the rule states if person intends to recruit five 5 migrant workers one day for farmer and the next day is requested to recruit and does recruit eight 8 migrant workers for farmer b these are separate and independent acts and do not total up to thirteen 13 for purposes of the statutory requirement however if he has contracts to hire total of eighteen 18 migrant workers for farmers x and z and he hires this number as result of three days effort the statutory amount of ten or more would be present but it concludes the application of these principles to other situations will depend on all the facts 74 federal register april 15 1969 pp 65026504 crs18 division in the employment standards administration for more general administration authority was left with the assistant secretary for manpower75 under the act the secretary was permitted to enter into cooperative agreement with state authorities where the states had roughly comparable laws where there might be refusal to authorize or reauthorize issuance of certificate of registration hearing would be scheduled before the solicitor after 1973 the associate solicitor of dol or his designee76 for marginally educated farm labor contractor if that assessment were true one might expect the total impact to have been little confusing77 certain dissatisfaction flcra had not been entirely successful complaints have grown through the years observed senator gaylord nelson d wi that this first effort of the congress was lacking in several areas78 during 1973 and 1974 further hearings were conducted on the issue the current system some suggested has been the source of massive abuse and exploitation of agricultural workers though congress had recognized the problem with adoption of flcra the abuses have shown signs of moderating79 matter how strong the vote in the congress it farmworker legislation usually seems to be filed away in some cubbyhole without any appropriations without any committee staff and the result in almost all cases has been nonenforcement in the 9 years of the existence of this bill it was suggested there has been enforcement it has been totally ineffective it has been dud80 75 federal register october 20 1972 p 22660 76 see federal register january 17 1973 pp 16361637 and august 24 1973 p 22778 77 father john kelly our lady of lourdes church seaford delaware stated that there had been tremendous overlapping of intermeshing authorities he continued we have federal regulations we have state regulations and we have local county implementation kelly further observed when one has problem you have to deal with the hour and wage laws and to deal with social security you have to deal with health education and welfare you have to deal with the local labor office and one in any of these departments is quite clear where the migrant worker is located with respect to the several jurisdictions you can spend days trying to establish relationship with any particular office and one is sure at the end of the day whether he has reason or not to handle your problem now for an illiterate perhaps nonenglish speaking person the difficulty is multiplied 1000 times and the man who is supposed to solve all these problems is the crew leader representative william ford dmi would later concede we are painfully aware that it is very difficult to tie it all together because of the multitude of federal agencies that have fragmented responsibilities in this area see us congress house subcommittee on agricultural labor committee on education and labor farm labor contractor registration act amendments of 1973 pp 179 and 183 cited hereafter as hearings house 1973 78 us

problems associated with flcra new legislation may take time to work through various impediments flcra was exception from the testimony before the house and senate committees it was clear that problems were numerous lack of penalties the departments of labor and justice seemed to feel that present penalties are insufficient to deter repeated violations and this deters them from pressing prosecutions witness stated urging greater penalties81 representative augustus hawkins dca posed the question to group of dol administrators bernard delury assistant secretary for employment standards warren landis acting administrator wagehour division and eugene bonfiglio chief branch of farm labor contractor registration mr hawkins what is the penalty at the present time for failure to register mr landis there is specific penalty in the present law unless there is willful violation and then the present law provides fine of up to 500 mr hawkins has anyone been fined and if so how many mr landis i think one mr bonfiglio since the act became operative in january 1965 we have had four cases that went to criminal court for prosecution of those four two were thrown out by the justice department and two were finally prosecuted and fined 100 in each case and in one of the cases the fine was lifted mr hawkins i assume that under the law those who commit violations can either have their registration revoked or other penalties imposed can you give us any idea how many registrations have been revoked mr delury none sir mr hawkins none mr delury none this year what about last year mr bonfiglio last year we revoked three certificates and suspended two i believe we had one employee who was denied based on past criminal action dol spokesman stepped in to explain the record does not mean that crew leaders are not violating the law or that we are not attempting to enforce the law under the regulations the due process is required we have to notify the crew leader that we intend to revoke this certificate and give him time to request 80 continued united farm workers 81 hearings senate 1974 pp 115116 crs20 hearing then there is the time factor if he requests hearing the time element usually goes beyond his stay in one place and by that time he is gone or the end of the season is on us landis then observed that unless the violation is pretty bad we think it is better to get him into compliance and let him continue his work the dialogue moved on mr hawkins well the problem itself is not evaporating though is it mr landis sir there still is problem for the migrant workers big problem82 lack of staff in response to representative hawkins it was noted that there were probably about 5000 interstate crew leaders and another 3000 intrastate crew leaders the figures are not accurate landis observed they are the best estimates that we could make and landis continued little under 2000 are registered83 with more than eight years of experience under the act mr hawkins queried are you making any effort to see that those who are not registered become registered who does the job of enforcing that landis replied well that is our job of course to register them and to call them to account when they are not registered dol was trying to deal with that through investigations and through public service announcements on radio and tv in both english and spanish84 we are not here to be critical of you gentlemen representative william ford dmi stated when introducing the department witnesses but to determine whether we can find way to make the law finally do what it was originally intended to do85 however certain amount of criticism did emerge the 1963 act was never enforced because the bureaucrats who were given the responsibility to enforce it did not get out of the regional offices argued elijah boone of the community action migrant program in immokalee florida he alleged that most of dols staff where crew leaders were concerned were recycled from old rural manpower which had already been shown to be ineffective86 alcario samudia now with the wisconsin department of labor recalled that when the crew leader act came into being in 1963 i registered but then we found out that the government did not have anybody to enforce the new laws so many of us did not even bother to register after that87 it is law explained barbara rhine an 82

attorney for the united farm workers that everyone here claims and knows is not enforced88 was the act fatally flawed or were enforcement officials jaded might the problem have more to do with appropriations according to luke danielson former investigator for the colorado migrant legal services agency dol officials had advised him that they lacked sufficient investigative staff to process complaints which resulted in this abominable enforcement record89 again mr ford how many field enforcement people were actually involved in trying to check registrations of crew leaders prior to october 1972 mr bonfiglio we had five field men in 1972 in 1965 we had 40 in 1966 that dropped to 17 and each year after that it declined down to 1972 when we had 590 elsewhere representative ford concluded it would appear that if we were operating with five people throughout the country to enforce this knowing that we have in excess of 6000 possible people to be policed that we have not very aggressively gone about enforcement of the statute91 other issues clearly other problems dogged enforcement of flcra during its first 10 years rendering the act either unenforceable or perhaps innocuous among allegations were the following the language question investigators were not always fluent in the language spoken by the workers spanish particularly in the west though some announcements appear to have been made in spanish the cultural division was such that often they were inappropriately positioned even in terms of payment and social security the pay stub may have been written in english which people dont understand92 crew leader versus grower there had been through the decade an intermittent conflict between the grower and the crew leader if we could just make the grower responsible landis stated for dol this would be the biggest boost to getting these crew leaders registered93 conversely daniel boone of the united farm workers charged that labor contractors are used by the real employers the growers to maximize the insecurity of the worker by adding yet another level of authority the grower farmer or company by the use of the contractor has insulated itself from any responsibility for payment insurance and related costs 88 hearings senate 1974 p 36 89 hearings senate 1974 p 110 90 hearings house 1974 p l09 91 hearings house 1973 p 55 92 hearings

not in fact registered make the farmer liable for the wrongdoings of the crew leader95 inflating crew levels guadalupe murguia united farm worker rankand filer testified that contractors exploit the growers by padding their payrolls with grandchildren and greatgrandchildren as an example we discovered that the contractors had people on their lists who had been dead for 4 or 5 years where there is contract work the company pays for the people that the contractor has on his payroll96 pablo espinosa also rankandfiler affirmed i used to work for labor contractor where he used to come and tell put two or three more people on the books put so and so and so on well so and so dont exist i would say well you put them on who pays for that the grower97 inspectorgrower collusion there was sense among some workers that inspectors had become an adjunct to the growers they the inspectors were educated and often spoke language different from the field workers when abuses were complained of the inspectors let them know that they are coming to inspect which from the workers perspective tended to stack the deck against honest inspection it doesnt do any good to report anybody observed jessie cruz of the united farm workers nothing is done about it98 it was only by contacting inspectors on repeated occasions danielson noted that we were able to get them to take this complaint at all99 again there is incentive to understand the act as contractors know that the act is not being enforced100 amending the statute in some respects flcra appeared to have had little impact demands for its repeal during the early years seem to have been few i think it is appropriate for to express kind of personal mea culpa suggested father james vizzard an early backer of flcra in the early 1960s he stated that under the leadership of senator harrison williams and his senate migratory labor subcommittee we were able to formulate and pass this legislation but he added hindsight tells us now that despite great deal of good will and technical competence we really didnt do very good job of it father vizzard opined 94 hearings senate 1974 pp 4950 95 hearings senate 1974 p 105 96 hearings senate 1974 p 43 97 hearings senate 1974 p 45 98 hearings senate 1974 p 41 99 hearings senate 1974 p 105 100 hearings house 1973 p 165 the speaker joe alexander is former farm labor contractor from homestead florida crs23 first at the time there was organized grassroots body with sufficient knowledge and experience to advise us of the daytoday realities of farm worker problems in all parts of our country despite extensive studies and hearings it still was principally group of us here in washington who did what we thought best and as it turned out that wasnt good enough second once legislative battle had been won and bill passed our forces tended to disperse and forgot the second half of the battle namely appropriations almost every act we passed therefore was grossly underfunded and continues to be so even to this day third and perhaps most important of all we failed to build into the program adequate and continuous enforcement without any exception that i can recall the agencies charged with enforcement have never done satisfactory or in very many cases even an honest job of enforcing these laws passed by congress101 amendments would bring forth new phase and in some respects more turbulent phase of the regulation of agricultural labor as revision of the statute proceeded number of issues emerged some old others new changing character of the farm labor contractor during hearings in the early 1960s the farm labor contractor had been somewhat disparaged decade later that view had mellowed there were still tales of shortcounts and beatings of workers who ran into disfavor with the crew chief but these were issues with which dol did not seem to become involved102 the great majority of these people suggested c h fields of the farm bureau are responsible businessmen who have made significant investment in their businesses and who make every effort to abide by the law again these people are small businessmen they operate under extremely difficult circumstances they do not have the services of accountants bookkeepers or legal advisors and the more paperwork that is required the more apt they are to call it quits and go out of business103 definitional elements entered the picture as well elijah boone of the community migrant action program immokalee florida said that there were different kinds of crew leaders contractor might be very well to do upper middleclass white businessman who has money to invest in necessary machinery that farm worker would know of the contractor might be the person in charge of the contract and then he would hire the crew leader who would recruit the labor104 who might be charged with the payment of the workers and with making deductions for social security and related matters seems to have been unclear 101 hearings house 1973 p 63 102 hearings house 1973 p 155 see also hearings house p 118 dol did have grower complaints concerning funds forwarded to cover transportation costs of farmworkers 103 hearings senate 1974 pp 154156 104 hearings senate 1974 pp 323324 crs24 defining labor dispute or strike immigration officials argued father vizzard appear to be in the pocket of largescale employers while notorious labor contractors have been allowed repeatedly to build up their strikebreaking crews with these known illegals recruited throughout the southwest105 dan pollitt now special counsel to the subcommittee questioned vizzard contractor pollitt suggested was required to explain to contract workers where they are going wages housing conditions and so on pollitt asked do you think it would be helpful to add that you must also say whether or not there is strike going on or whether contract is at its last stages of negotiations father vizzard responded yes i would106 but again there were problems guinn sinclair president national farm labor contractors association suggested an almost complete lack of legislation on labor management relations in the agricultural field as to what constitutes labor dispute sinclair questioned why should contractor be the judge when our courts have issued conflicting decisions and does labor dispute exist when the united farm workers union issues boycott of lettuce and table grapes or again when the teamsters or the united farm workers then in contest for farmworker loyalties claim jurisdiction and yet laws exist to determine the will of the workers themselves sinclair protested i dont think the contractor should be the one to decide that there is dispute107 the farm bureau argued that agriculture is exempt from the national labor relations act and farmers have legal method to deal with labor disputes and unfair labor practices again there were definitional issues what constitutes strike slowdown or labormanagement dispute and when does such condition exist at particular farm were farmer to become engaged in such issues the proposal could have the effect of determining whether or not his crop would be harvested the bureau continued fruits and vegetables tend to reach the harvest stage as determined by the inexorable laws of nature and farm cannot wait around until someone perhaps the state or the federal government decides whether there is legallyconstituted strike or labor dispute the provision it stated would seem to be an unworkable and unreasonable responsibility to place upon contractors108 delury of dol took cautious attitude suggesting that the provision was pretty broad as written109 later bruce burkdoll speaking for the central california farmers association charged that union or group of workers could create labor dispute even though the union does not represent the workers 105 hearings house 1973 p 64 106 hearings house 1973 p 92 107 hearings senate 1974 p 3233 108 hearings senate 1974 p 163 109 hearings senate 1974 p 142 crs25 involved he concluded just because student or someone else that never saw you on your ranch stops in front and waves flag we just cannot live with that110 the day haul and the shapeup the shapeup exists in most regions from which growers or contractors recruit that is the place where the people gather to find out whether there will be work that day sometimes as early as 2 am the shapeup varies from one locality to another so does the nature of the work sought111 the contractor will have the pick of the lot according to barbara rhine united farm workers attorney he will choose the strong the young the healthy or the attractive women who have to turn pretty face and act at the drivers bidding or the illegal alien whom he can have taken back by the border patrol before he pays the days wages if the character of the work is marginal then the shapeup area will be filled with the local winos the sad stumbling men and women who are so abject that all it takes is the promise of wine to get them into the fields rhine stated and so the people get on the buses and hardseated trucks and try to sleep on their way to work if they get miles into the fields and find that its not the first picking that they have been promised or that there are toilets and drinking water or that the gloves to protect their hands are torn missing or not provided at all then their choice is to work anyhow or walk back to town and miss the whole day if they complete the days work they frequently get paid less than the promise and with deductions made for fees and transportation further she alleged that if they get their slips showing the deductions for social security and disability they find out later when they are old and sick that the money somehow never found its way to the proper state or federal agency112 rhines comments focused upon california but theodore dietz of the new jersey department of community affairs explained the conditions of dayhaul workers in his part of the country casual workers employed on daily basis both federal and state minimum wage laws are consistently broken many crew leaders go unregistered they disguise their function as crew leaders by using number of cars and by carrying less than ten people per vehicle the crew leader provides either insufficient information or misinformation to the worker because there is written contract between the crew leader and worker the worker may agree to pick one crop and end up picking another at different piece rate 110 hearings senate 1974 p 172 111 hearings senate 1974 p 35 112 hearings senate 1974 p 35 see also hearings senate 1974 p 154 for an analysis by c h fields of the farm bureau crs26 social security deductions are never made for day haul workers eliminating many of them from eligibility when they reach 65 statement of earnings deductions or hours worked is provided to the worker day haul workers rarely are provided toilet facilities in the field and occasionally water children of very young age are part of the system arbitrary dismissals and blacklisting are part of the day haul system protective clothing against weeds rain or pesticides are ever provided health or first aid services are available to day haul workers113 proposed amendments tended to exclude day haul workers father vizzard now of the united farm workers expressed concern our experience he stated tells us that some of the grossest abuses against both farm workers and employers are perpetrated by day haulers the rationale for this exemption is because there are so few inspectors we think that the proper response to this fact is notable increase in enforcement staff114 david sweeney political and legislative director for the teamsters agreed we concur with the statement made by the united farm workers in their testimony we think that the proper response to this fact is as stated above notable increase in the enforcement staff115 further dietz observed that exclusion of day hauling left him in word dumbfounded116 even delury affirmed dols opposition to eliminating day haulers from coverage this exclusion would deprive laborers working for dayhaul contractor of guaranteed insurance protection and basic information about the job these guarantees delury stated are as important to the day worker as to the laborer who works for contractor over an extended period117 the administration however was divided on the issue jack donnachie rural manpower service dol raised the issue of practicality we do have some points where we supervise day haul as well as they can be supervised donnachie stated but he cautioned that you are out on public corner with day haul and you cannot stop man he argued when the recruitment takes place in public space we received lot of criticism for day haul operations and justifiably so he 113 hearings house 1973 p 174 114 hearings house 1973 p 63 115 hearings house 1973 p 94 sweeney proposed inclusion of day haulers in the bill 116 hearings house 1973 p 174 117 hearings house 1973 p 97 delury also stated in addition some dayhaul work is interstate this activity is covered under the current act we oppose change which would exempt this interstate activity see also delury hearings senate 1974 pp 117 147148 crs27 stated so we are getting out of the day haul business as fast as we can get out because we cannot control it118 as the hearings progressed representative ford noted certain level of caution if day haulers were included in the bill it is obvious that we are going to be picking up situation that for some period of time would require constant dayby day monitoring he continued mr ford so we are talking about more manpower than we have heretofore been using do you have any idea about what your additional manpower needs would be taking into account the additional enforcement power of the act have you given that any thought mr delury yes we have recently we went up before mr daniel floods appropriations subcommittee and requested supplemental budget for the employment standards administration and in the area of farm labor contractor registration work we earmarked 10 additional positions for the coming years119 in an aside to father vizzard ford stated that there was not any intent on the part of the authors of this bill to diminish our capacity to deal with the problem of day haulers we are just trying to deal in priorities with the resources we have120 interstate versus intrastate the original labor contractor legislation focused upon interstate transportation of migrant and seasonal workers ben robertson of the wagehour division explained that florida crew leaders under current law would not need to be registered until they indicated or got ready to move north they would then come under the coverage of the act because of the interstate character of the work121 an amendment to the act proposed to cover interstate intrastate operations fr vizzard applauded the new section noting that many and i would say perhaps most of the contractors operate wholly within one state it is long overdue that they be covered by the provisions of the law122 delury was equally supportive123 and alcario samudia the former crew leader from wisconsin urged that all crew leaders who recruit interstate or intrastate regardless of whether they only recruit for themselves or combination of employers be registered124 118 hearings house 1973 p 23 119 hearings house 1973 p 102 120 hearings house 1973 p 86 121 hearings house 1973 p 23 122 hearings house 1973 p 63 david sweeney and william grami both from the teamsters noted their support of intrastate coverage see hearings house 1973 p 187 123 hearings house 1973 p 97 124 hearings senate 1974 p 220 under the 1964 legislation growers who recruited solely for his own operation were not covered crs28 fields of the farm bureau argued against this expansion we strongly urge that it be made clear that it is not the intent of congress to cover the intrastate activities of farm labor contractors he stated125 george sorn of the florida fruit and vegetable association urged that flcra continue to apply only to crew leaders who cross state lines sorn stated that registration of other workers would be needless expenditure of taxpayers money he continued we believe leaders who operate only on an intrastate basis should not become subject to the federal act in those states which have adequate crew leader laws of their own126 establishing responsibility growers versus farm labor contractors in flcra as originally adopted farmer processor canner ginner packing shed operator or nurseryman who engaged in farm labor recruitment solely for his own operations shall not be included within the concept of farm labor contractor127 under the proposed amendments the issue was raised anew there was sense among advocates of stronger flcra that growers had by use of the contractor insulated themselves from responsibility for diverse range of employerassociated responsibilities128 at the same time it was argued that the farm labor contractor does not set policy but rather merely follows orders laid down by growers in south texas it was explained the contractor does not set the rate of pay or determine the hours of work he merely follows established policy and is nothing more in effect than crew foreman129 barbara rhine of the united farm workers explained that whoever recruits labor for the grower is nothing more or less than his employee130 some were willing to assign the contractor the role of an employee of the grower delury of labor however supported provision in the draft bill making growers liable for damages resulting from acts or omissions of unregistered farm labor contractors with whom they have contracted for services he also recommended provision to prohibit outright the use of unregistered crew leaders by growers131 joseph mcauliffe of the wagehour division noted an absence of responsibility someone we dont care which has to assume responsibility132 this issue grower versus contractor would remain central to the debate on flcra through the next decade much agricultural work seems to have been conducted on quasicash basis or where there were more formal processes it may 125 hearings senate 1974 p 156 126 hearings house 1973

be written in english and may be basically unintelligible for nonenglish speaking workers given the migratory character of such workers compensation information may well have been lost with the passage of time133 immigration and adverse effect section 5b6 of flcra provided that the secretary might refuse to issue or suspend revoke or refuse to renew certificate of registration if the farm labor contractor had with knowledge hired workers in violation of the immigration and nationality laws of the united states as the 1974 amendment moved through the legislative process there was an effort to restructure this provision everyone it seems knew that undocumented aliens were employed in american agriculture but beyond that awareness there seemed little agreement as to course to follow father vizzard concluded it is too easy for the crew leader or labor contractor to escape the impact of that section of the law by simply claiming innocence and who can prove to the contrary134 much of the discussion focused upon knowledge rudy juarez former farm worker experienced with crew leading operations suggested that contractors and the farmers they represent are heavily recruiting illegals from mexico many times we have reported this to the border patrol juarez stated but they do not seem to be interested until the harvest is over senator nelson inquired of juarez i understand you to say that the employers frequently pay transportation of the illegals juarez replied yes sir for many years i was contractor myself135 with one witness after another though from different perspectives the issue of use of undocumented workers was raised identity papers it was alleged were easy to acquire but once armed with fraudulent documents who was to judge since the border patrol cannot determine who is an illegal in the united states opined guinn sinclair we do not feel you should impose upon the contractor the absolute law that he should know sinclair and nelson discussed the problem of identification you know sinclair suggested to nelson that the magnitude of mexicans working in the united states is much greater than i think is conceived here part of the problem the farm labor contractor suggested rests with the governments of the united states and of mexico but notwithstanding the source of the problem the contractor has way of knowing who should be here and who should not be here136 mabel mascarenas wife of farm labor contractor questioned the should know proposal are people going to wear sign that says i am an alien or are we expected to act as immigration officers and know all the details of immigration papers much of the work on the farms deals with perishable commodities when 133 hearings senate 1974 pp 4950 134 hearings house 1973 pp 8788 see also

are the most integrated business in america137 it is our view suggested joseph phelan national council of agricultural employers that the imposition of the provision prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens would be tantamount to transferring to the employer responsibility which correctly lies with the immigration and nationalization service138 the farm bureau took similar position on the surface it noted the premise know or should know to be in violation of the immigration laws some may find appealing but the question arises as to how labor contractor is expected to know or determine whether given worker is in this country illegally the bill is silent with regard to any procedure contractor would be expected to follow we urge that this subsection be deleted and it further stated the immigration service itself has not been too successful in stopping illegal entries or discovering those who enter illegally139 father vizzard seemed unimpressed with arguments for use of illegals he suggested that if one were to raise the wages and improve the working conditions under which aliens worked american workers would be found when that happens traditionally in any part of american economic life there are american workers to do the jobs the system he stated is simply fraud and the disguise has to be stripped back again and again and again140 new statute through amendment although the issues raised during hearings on revision of flcra were of substance they seem to have attracted relatively little attention with hearings concluded the congress moved on to enactment of the farm labor amendments of 1974 bipartisanship emerges in the house in march 1974 representative ford introduced nonpartisan bill incorporating the findings of the hearings at least as they were understood141 ford thanked earl landgrebe rin especially for helping to invoke spirit of bipartisanship that has resulted in unanimous vote 137 hearings senate 1974 pp 245246 italics added 138 hearings senate 1974 p 260 phelan added moreover this provision poses the question of whether you are crossing jurisdictional lines with the committee on the judiciary you will recall that this language was included in the proposed amendment to the fair labor standards act last year and was subsequently dropped for that reason 139 hearings senate 1974 p 163 140 hearings house 1973 pp 8990

leaders recruiting for work done in the same state145 landgrebe affirmed that the secretary will now have an affirmative duty to monitor and investigate violations of the law both he and albert quie rmn stressed that the grower will need to observe certificate of registration in the possession at present representative quie stated the crew leader is required to display it but one is required to observe it quie reassured the growers we are not attempting to make the growers joint employers with the crew leaders nor are we attempting to make them responsible for the crew leaders unlawful actions146 at the end of the colloquy the rules were suspended and the bill was passed on voice vote147 the following day the bill was dispatched to the senate where it was assigned to the committee on labor and public welfare148 the senate concurs it was october six months later before the bill reached the senate floor then the senate moved to strike everything after the enacting clause and to insert its own language only two speakers addressed the issue each expressing disenchantment with the original flcra recent testimony observed senator williams indicates that the act of 1963 has failed to achieve some of its original objectives149 similarly senator javits noted after 10 years of experience we find that this act has largely been ignored and cannot be effectively enforced150 while the provisions of the bill were briefly discussed senator williams took note of one new provision which i deem to be of such importance that i wish to discuss it in some detail williams explained that farm labor contractors will be subject to criminal penalty of up to 10000 fine or prison sentence of up to 3 years or both if such contractor has knowingly engaged the 142 congressional

33746 crs32 services of an illegal alien illegal alien has been defined to mean any person who is an alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or who has not been authorized by the attorney general to accept employment illegal aliens have become an increasingly large source of farm labor in this country and the services of contractor are often utilized to procure this clandestine workforce the existing act generally prohibits such activities by making it grounds for revoking or suspending the contractors registration however if this tide of illegal immigration is to be stemmed stricter enforcement and stronger penalties must be applied against those who violate the act these additional steps are necessary in light of the adverse effect such importation of illegal aliens has had on the wages and job security of our citizens especially in times such as these of high unemployment italics added williams quoted leonard chapman of the immigration and naturalization service there are probably from six to 10 million illegal aliens in the country today they are occupying jobs that unemployed americans ought to have doubt williams asserted illegal farm labor would account for sizable share151 one else spoke apparently regarded as routine the bill was read third time and passed on voice vote but in form different from that of the house152 compromise is reached the senatepassed bill was sent back to the house where representative ford reported it certain provisions in the senate amendment explained mr landgrebe were very broad would probably discourage registration and possibly make the act more difficult to enforce landgrebe stated since this is crew leader bill and not bill covering farmers or growers certain adjustments seemed in order italics added representative quie defended the growers the senate version implicitly imposed upon growers and processors all those with whom labor contractor provided migrant workers the obligation to enforce the act in other words quie stated the senate version held them responsible for the crew leaders abuses and failures we did not believe that it was necessary to hold farmer criminally liable for the acts and omissions of another he concluded the responsibility for enforcing the act is where it belongs on the secretary of labor and not on the farmer153 the new version retained the provisions concerning undocumented aliens once again the house voted to approve the measure on voice vote and sent the new bill back to the senate154 to this point the two bodies had worked separately conference had been requested none was deemed necessary however there now developed within the senate colloquy among senators from the pacific northwest and from florida 151 congressional record october 3 1974 p

out in the pacific northwest we have number of row crops and berries which lean heavily upon the use of student labor this is usually under the leadership of school teachers or other public education employees who take the responsibility of acting as crew leaders for these students or are under the supervision of parents who collectively act as crew leaders hatfield asked question does the bill include or does it exempt such cases as i have indicated namely teachers and public education employees and parents who act as crew leaders second does the bill as currently drawn include or exclude the permanent employee of the farmer or perhaps the farmer himself who hired these people senator nelson for the subcommittee concurred with senator hatfield and with senator warren magnuson dwa in affirming that the department of labor was not to consider this type of activity when enforcing the act155 second colloquy occurred with senator lawton chiles dfl in the bill the contractor could be exempt if his recruitment activity is solely for his employer on more than an incidental basis chiles agreed that registration should be required of the individual whose sole job is to hire and recruit migrant labor but he had concerns about the term incidental he stated i do not feel that the committee intended that regular employees who may perform some duties for their employer relative to securing migrant labor are to be required to register it is my understanding he stated that the bill aims at those who on fulltime basis hire or recruit migrant labor senator nelson noted that the purpose of this provision is to prevent farm labor contractors from avoiding registration by becoming the employee of each and every grower for whom they recruit and hire migrant workers but it was not the intent of the act to include the regular employee of the grower chiles was not yet entirely clear even though this duty might be considered to be an important aspect of his job responsibility by his employer if he were permanent employee and continued to have other duties he would not be considered to have to register chiles inquired the senator is absolutely correct in the manner in which he has stated it nelson replied156 following summary statement by senator williams the senate concurred in the housepassed version of the bill the vote was voice vote157 on october 19 president gerald ford returned the bill with veto message this bill contains provisions designed to strengthen the protections of migrant farm workers which i support but he noted that the senate has added certain extraneous materials to the bill dealing with the federal personnel system he directed that congress remove them and promised to approve the bill as 155 congressional record october 16 1974 pp 3590135902 both senators hatfield and magnuson specifically endorsed the day haul provisions of the bill however for the next several congresses that provision in the context of youth labor under the fair labor standards act would remain very controversial 156 congressional record october 16 1974 p 35902 157 congressional record october 16 1974 p 35903 crs34 amended158 senator nelson had introduced s 3202 in march 1974159 that bill was now resurrected modified and reported to the senate on november 21160 and was adopted by voice vote on november 22161 the house concurred by voice vote on november 26162 on december 7 1974 the bill was signed into law pl 93 518163 the 1974 flcra amendments the 1974 amendments represented tightening up of the initial farm labor contractor registration act the focus was still primarily on the contractor inter alia it provided the following the concept of interstate was stricken affirming by implication that the new act would apply as well to those persons operating within state but having an impact upon interstate commerce the phrases ten or more and at any one time in any calendar year were deleted it exempted from coverage any farmer or processor who personally engages in any such activity similarly exempt was any fulltime or regular employee who engages in such activity solely for his employer on more than an incidental basis italics added in order to deal with students and their elders but to include day haul operators there was added any person who engaged in any such activity solely within twentyfivemile intrastate radius of his permanent place of residence and b for not more than thirteen weeks per year added to the concept of agricultural employment was the handling planting drying packing packaging processing freezing or grading prior to delivery for storage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state person shall engage the services of any farm labor contractor unless he first determines that the farm labor contractor possesses certificate from the secretary that is in full force and effect at the time he contracts with the farm labor contractor the applicant

accept employment any agreement by an employee to waive or to modify his rights under the statute shall be void as contrary to public policy except that waiver to the secretary for enforcement purposes is valid the rights and obligations of the several parties were spelled out in some detail164 though certain segments of agriculture had reservations the new amendments did not seem to represent threat and indeed they had been approved repeatedly with little debate and by voice vote part iii implementing revised statute 19741983 by nearly all assessments flcra had not been entirely successful in alleviating problems associated with migratory labor165 revisions crafted during the 19731974 hearings brought some refinement of the statute few voices in congress had been raised against the statute still the act was not perceived as threatening to users of migrant workers pressures begin to mount in october 1975 the house subcommittee on agricultural labor conducted hearings on flcra as you may know commenced representative john mcfall dca my district in california includes the central part of the san joaquin valley this is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the country and as result agricultural labor is vital part of the economic foundation of the area166 164 see pl 93518 for precise wording of the amendments 165 us congress house committee on education and labor subcommittee on agricultural labor oversight hearings on the farm labor contractor registration act hearings 94th cong 1st sess october 1 and october 11 1975 pp 113136 hereafter cited as hearings house 1975 166 hearings house 1975 p 10 crs36 mcfall explained that dol had failed to adhere to clearly expressed congressional intent but had also failed to provide its field personnel clear directions on the implementation of these 1974 amendments it dol had required farm or ranch foreman to register as farm labor contractor though he performed many other duties beyond worker recruitment mcfall had written to labor secretary john dunlop but had not yet received response while he was not opposed to flcra or to the 1974 amendments i believe there is need to ensure that farm labor is not exploited by labor contractors he said his concern was over the dols failure to provide an equitable and clearly defined implementation of the act167 prior to the 1974 amendments the focus had been on the plight of agricultural workers now it shifted to employers and to the structure of the industry the wrong people it was argued were being caught up in the departments net general problems of administration we have had statements of concern and some compliments that dol was too vigorous in its administration of the act and conversely that it is not vigorous enough stated chairman ford of the house agricultural labor subcommittee the congress has used every device possible he noted to prod criticize and sometimes castigate the labor department to push for vigorous enforcement of laws still the committee does not want to make compliance with the law so unpalatable that we end up litigating while farmworkers receive real factual benefits from the enactment of the legislation168 regulations had not yet been proposed ford reminded dol we are in fact developing considerable body of controversy in administration of this law because of the absence of these regulations169 dol intends to continue our enforcement efforts and our multimedia information campaign delury stated and will get as many farm labor contractors registered as possible so that the benefits of the law will be available to the crews170 then he turned to administration we have total of 19 manyears assigned to the 167 hearings house 1975 pp 1011 on congressional opinion see pp85 and 9394 168 hearings house 1975 p 15 169 hearings house 1975 p 16 dols failure to publish regulations for the 1974 amendments seemed to permeate the entire proceedings robert mills salinas valley independent growers association p 284 stated i think the whole effort of the testimony here today is please may we have some definitive regulations from the department of labor and not try to define what we believe the intent of congress is similarly donald dressler western growers association p 273 taking note of litigation then before the courts stated we would wish that the court would have required the department to first draft regulations before they ran off in all these different directions 170 hearings house 1975 p 13 as of sept 20 1975 delury testified we had issued 3718 certificates more than in prior years but less than expected with approximately 10000 or more contractors that should be subject to coverage under the act crs37 activities under this act to cover the entire country171 as one of the later witnesses explained most of our farm workers are spanishspeaking people172 as things then stood we do not have spanishspeaking compliance officer173 more specialized concerns with flcra older questions whether dormant or never having been formally raised assumed sharper focus since the regulations had not been released at that time there was good bit of speculation about almost all aspects of flcra internal definitions representative ford speaking at the 1975 hearings on flcra suggested that that the lack of definitions and uniform regulations seems to be the heart of complaints he urged that the target date for release of the regulations then by the end of november be moved up so that we can start solving these problems before everybody ends up in court174 robert chase deputy assistant secretary of labor assured ford that regulations have received priority attention but that it was impossible just then to provide an earlier date175 for ten years under the act it was assumed that everyone understood what was meant by crew leader or farm labor contractor or migrant worker after 1974 however definitions became more problematic some witnesses asserted that they had objections to the act176 and that flcra was appropriate and reasonable177 so long as it was not their clients who were affected in our wildest dreams we did not consider that the people which we represent stated industry spokesman r v thornton would be covered under flcra178 who is farm labor contractor representative mcfall stated that he had received numerous inquiries concerning dols efforts to register farm or ranch foreman as farm labor contractor under the 1974 compromise foreman might be flcraexempt if in his regular work he performs duties other than assisting his employer in acquiring migrant workers but how might one distinguish between primary and secondary duties clearly delury objected this language does not provide an exemption from the application of the law to all fulltime employees179 171 hearings house 1975 p 14 172 hearings house 1975 p 106 173 hearings house 1975 p 53 174 hearings house 1975 p 15 175 hearings house 1975 p 16 regulations were proposed

employee of grower whether fulltime or not who devotes all of his time or the majority of his time to farm labor continued crs38 the relationship of the contractor to the grower was critical and it would seem difficult to define does the contractor provide services employees to one employer or to several what services does he provide to the employees what records does the contractor keep guinn sinclair observed of california we have examples of where contractor has been successfully prosecuted his license has been revoked by the state and the next day he is still with the same crews working the same ranches only now he is an employee of the ranch clearly he is still farm labor contractor180 conversely if grower provides farm hands to series of farmers when does he cross the line from grower to contractor suddenly such questions become relevant and ultimately perhaps subject of litigation and who is migrant how long might migrant remain in one location before he or she ceased to be migratory some workers are engaged by firm or firms in an area for two three ten months out of the year can migrant also be seasonal they come back every year you see we have county housing they come there and they live in those houses until the crops are over they are really not migrant because they only come from texas to patterson california181 another witness stated to my way of thinking migrant worker is one who travels away from his regular place of residence great many of these migrant workers who move throughout the united states in agricultural labor live and make their homes in our immediate area he stated they come back to that area about this time of year and stay there generally until about may again182 representative ford asked about the responsibility for transportation while recruiting the only time we ever go out and recruit anybody we dont recruit them really we just go down to calexico we have 23 foremen this year in cantaloups and those 23 foremen will go out183 this would seem to recall the initial question implied by representative mcfall when is foreman regular employee and when is he really farm labor contractor conversely does it really matter so long as he or she is engaged in the work of farm labor contractor interpreting the word personally in 1974 the concept of personally was added to the list of exemptions while this language is clear with respect to sole proprietors delury stated interpretative problems do arise with respect to partnerships associations joint stock companies trusts and corporations delury explained how it might apply to an individual with the responsibility of sole 179 continued contractor activities is not within the exemption and such an employee should register under the law italics added 180 hearings house 1975 p 261 181 hearings house 1975 p 280 182 hearings house 1975 p 68 183 hearings house 1975 p 280 crs39 proprietor if he acts personally with respect only to farm labor contracting activities at the operation involved but he concluded such an interpretation may raise problems of proof to be resolved on casebycase basis184 ford responded that he was loath to suggest that his committee would ever write anything that is ambiguous stating what we are really trying to do is find the point at which we should ascribe responsibility for the employeremployee relationship again the farm labor contractor that we are trying to reach is the body broker185 reaching the body broker however proved difficult some in agriculture objected to dols interpretation of personally ie farmer who operates as an individual and performs all the activity without the assistance of any employee agent or contractor186 but firms have variety of arrangements with the grower small grower may produce crop to the point of harvest then through one of several arrangements have that crop harvested by shipper the shipper will harvest pack and sell the crop based on financial arrangements with the grower we also have large cooperatives which provide harvesting packing and sales facilities for its sic grower members it was asserted that in large company there could be between 10 and 30 small growers for whom some agricultural work is done by the companys employees obviously it was explained the owner does not personally engage in such activity but allows the duties to be delegated187 in other cases ownership itself becomes factor where crops are harvested in the field by client nongrower making use of migratory labor but with the crops still owned by separate entity the grower who is the responsible party if ownership changes hands while the crop is in the field does responsibility follow the crops there seemed suddenly host of issues that may not have been considered when flcra was largely unenforced but after the 1974 amendments became critical on an incidental basis full time or regular employee of farmer is exempt wrote dante nomellini stocktonbased attorney for the growers if he is engaged in farm labor contracting activity for his employer on more than an incidental basis the term incidental is not defined he declared but the plain meaning would seem to render him exempt if his labor contracting function was not his primary function or primary responsibility188 184 hearings house 1975 p 14 185 hearings house 1975 pp 1618 186 hearings house 1975 p 97 187 hearings house 1975 pp 258259 188 hearings house 1975 p 100 crs40 what was plain to nomellini was less so to dol delury with other departmental witnesses objected that the agency had received virtually guidance from congress unfortunately said bobbye spears associate solicitor and charged with preparation of the regulations the act does not think in terms of the primary duty nor does it tell us to look behind the subjective interest of the employer in hiring particular person189 arguably casebycase approach might have resolved the problem but in practice such discretion may have been illadvised for example farmers or processors operations manager his personnel director his foreman or all of them may find that they must for temporary period devote an unusual amount of their time to soliciting recruiting or hiring workers in the process for brief period the amount of time expended might substantially exceed the time taken by farm labor contractor for roughly similar tasks190 who for fee another aspect of flcra administration that caused concern was interpretation of who for fee perry ellsworth national council of agricultural employers argued that the term as used under the act had several potential meanings fee would seem to mean payment asked or given for specific service but dol would argue that if fulltime employee has any dealings with agricultural labor portion of the salary that employee receives is fee191 on this matter representative ford wrote to secretary dunlop i would assume that the words for fee would not be construed to include any part of the salary of fulltime or regular employee who as part of his job is required to transport workers between meeting place in the city and his employers farm192 as with many areas of labor policy an answer may have been complex for example the benita packing company one of the firms in contention goes into the field with its own employees harvests the crop brings it to the packing shed packs it for market and sells the commodity on behalf of the grower stated attorney donald dressler the grower pays fee which covers the labor expense benita packing is in control of the workers at all times and the grower has control or involvement with them at all italics added in this case to whom would flcra apply if indeed it would apply at all193 leon gordon counsel for the agricultural producers labor committee labor coop serving arizona and california also addressed the issue of fees the committee is nonprofit but operates series of workerrelated activities194 its 189 hearings house 1975 pp 1920 190 comments of perry ellsworth for management hearings house 1975 pp 8993 191 hearings house 1975 p 82 192 hearings house 1975 p 94 193 hearings house 1975 p 270 194 gordon testified hearings house 1975 p 285 they operate dining facilities and in some cases provide hot meals in the orchards these camps provide recreation facilities continued crs41 books are zeroed out at the end of the year and each grower defrays his exact proportionate share of the cost of the labor and overhead expenses of the association determined on volume basis however dol has adamantly taken the position that fee is involved even in the case of cooperative labor association italics added the result was litigation with gordon drawn into court to protect the growercoops195 insurance under flcra insurance was to have been roughly on par with common carriers used to transport passengers in interstate commerce several concerns were voiced here some focusing upon the character of the farm labor contractor 196 the farm labor contractor is small businessman he has just one little truck that he is trying to make living with if he owns two or three trucks it is just that much more one witness stated it is the recordkeeping the details he does not have bookkeeper in most instances he cannot read and write himself very well he is being required to keep all these records that he just does not have any way of doing in the first place many of them cannot afford the insurance requirements even if they can find company that will write the insurance finally he concluded we do not quite understand why we should be required to furnish all of these buses and all these high insurance requirements to transport people 5 or 6 miles many of our workers are not transported more than just 10 or 15 or 20 miles197 bobbye spears with the solicitors office addressed the same issue but with somewhat different twist she recalled recent case in which farmer said that i have to have peas picked tomorrow and neighbor farmer saying i will be glad to round up crew of people and transport them down to your farm and pick your peas tomorrow ms spears noted the helpful farmer took his truck which in this case was an open truck transported them down to the neighbors farm they picked the peas and on the way back there was wreck there were several children under the age of 12 i believe that three were killed198 employment of aliens quite obviously we anticipated that central problem in dealing with this law would be the problem of illegal aliens stated representative ford because it was 194 continued television rooms chapels and in some cases they provide counseling for the workers this housing and attendant facilities are provided on cost or below cost basis to the workers 195 hearings house 1975 pp 285287 196 see section 5a2 of the act the secretary had some measure of discretion in this matter 197 statement of scott toothaker texas citrus vegetable growers shippers hearings house 1975 pp 6769 italics added 198 hearings house 1975 p 20 see also section on adams fruit litigation below crs42 one of the purposes we had in mind in amended the law199 several factors were at issue the bureaucracy employeremployee relations and the local reaction dealing with the bureaucracy warren landis of the wagehour division affirmed that dol had worked very closely with immigration and naturalization but suggested the issue was quite thorny landis speculated what in fact constitutes knowing employment of illegal aliens and what are the bonafide efforts that contractor would make so that he would be absolved of knowing employment of illegal aliens italics added i wish we had full answer this morning but we do not this is another situation that we are addressing on casebycase basis landis stated that he had one case where we denied certificate because of history of employment of illegal aliens and we have some other perhaps similar cases that are pending john silver of the wagehour division from fresno noted that the border patrol indicates to us that they believe that 30 percent of the farm workers who are harvesting crops in california are illegal aliens so he stated you can see that our problems are great part of the problem may have been linguistic there are groups where very few of them speak english they cannot communicate observed joe fernandez with the wagehour division from raleigh north carolina and we have had difficulty locating crew leader200 ford turned to bobbye spears of the solicitors office do the contemplated regulations have any specific requirements to show that grower or farm labor contractor actually tried to know the workers status spears replied we have been working very closely with the ins lawyers and with the attorney generals staff to see what would be reasonable within constitutional restraints she added what could we require within the constraints of the constitution what sort of affirmative duty could we place on the grower spears stated we think we have reasonable set of requirements which we do intend to propose when the regulations come out but she added it is very tricky201 reaction from the industry the burden placed on the employer stated dante nomellini attorney for the growers to be able to identify an illegal alien is unfair and in most cases the labor contractor or the farmer or any employer is not in position to accomplish an adequate interrogation of the individual involved202 nomellini acknowledged that the statute says knowingly but that the act still placed an unfair burden upon the employer an illegal picked up and deported may end up back on the same farm without the employergrower being aware 199 hearings house 1975 p 52 200 hearings house 1975 pp 5254 201 hearings house 1975 p 54 this conversation took place some twenty years after the end of the bracero program 202 hearings house 1975 p 106 crs43 you have to recognize that the farmer himself is not just one individual working on the farm and he is not the one who goes out and supervises the worker and he is not the one generally who has the contact we have language differential here most of the farmers are not fluent in spanish nor are they capable or their agents of interrogating that man to find out if he is legal or illegal without violating that mans rights he suggested after analysis that it can be asked if he is lawful resident of the united states and for his name and social security number we dont have this capability to interrogate the border patrol very sophisticated group of people who have been trained even they have problems the burden shouldnt be placed on industry203 nomellinis solution was direct the state department ought to be asked to cooperate with congress in coming up with situation where the individual who is an illegal once apprehended is punished in significant way so that he wont come back across the border the problem he stated has to be attacked at its roots and that is right at the border if anything significant is going to be done to keep aliens out and i dont know whether we want to thats matter of policy italics added its matter for the congress and for those directly involved not the farmers and not the labor contractors and not the general employers in industry204 the local reaction scott toothaker management attorney from texas lives right up against the mexican border and that creates another dimension to the problem some spanishspeakers may be illegal but others may be local how is this truck driver picking up job applicants with nothing more than second third fourth or fifth grade education to pass on whether that guy is an illegal alien or not they all have some kind of card but i defy anyone in this hearing room to tell whether he is an illegal alien ford responded that regulations which have not yet been written provide ways through which to render an analysis the presumption of knowingly employing an alien would have to be overcome by proving actual knowledge and while it is less than perfect we do know that there are people who habitually rehire people205 guinn sinclair representative of the farm labor contractors voiced similar concerns suggesting that the department of state should be the one to determine 203 hearings house 1975 pp 106107 204 hearings house 1975 p 107 nomellini questioned p 98 the ability of the foreman and supervisors who are not sophisticated interrogators to screen for illegal immigration if it is your desire to keep illegal aliens out of the country then cooperation from the state department will be required and still penalties will have to be imposed upon the apprehended illegal alien himself he added the slap on the hand and free transportation to mexico is not an adequate

and you have 1 or 2 days before you get the water have you ever seen fruit that was falling on the ground ready to be picked moving on to policy implications if you need people and some come to the field wanting to work you are going to put them to work the crop is the important thing not who the man is or where he comes from besides the place to stop the illegal aliens isnt there in the fields it is at the port of entry do we have the right to ask people if they are citizens the department of labor doesnt know the answer ms arredondo turned to the members do you when we do ask people for papers they tell you i dont have to show you my papers how many of us have anything to prove we are us citizens i dont207 new regulations released on june 29 1976 final regulations were published of 61 substantive comments items of principal concern were the increased amounts of insurance coverage b the applicability of the amended act to include intrastate as well as interstate farm labor activities and c the proposed regulations relating to illegal aliens208 on insurance coverage dol concluded that the increased amounts were necessary to protect workers coverage of intrastate farm workers was of course part of the 1974 act and could not be changed without legislation209 concerning employment of aliens the farm labor contractor was to give evidence of an affirmative showing of bona fide inquiry of each prospective employees status as united states citizen or as person lawfully authorized to work in the united states the regulation provides series of acceptable routes birth

combining poultry harvesting and detasseling of corn custom combining harvesting and sheep shearing on march 4 1976 representative larry pressler rsd introduced legislation to exempt from flcra contractors of workers engaged in custom cutting or combine operations and contractors of workers engaged in the shearing of sheep211 roughly comparable legislation was introduced on march 9 with two more bills on march 11212 in nebraska the major part of our extensive wheat acreage is harvested by custom cutters stated representative virginia smith rne these operations do not involve migrant labor in the accepted sense of the definition she stated so all of the added precaution against abuses is not necessary smith suggested that these contractors and crew leaders should not be required to be registered or to be certified or to meet the other requirements for insurance transportation and housing seeking exemption she stated otherwise we have placed hardship on the agricultural equivalent of the small businessman and have subjected him to more of that overregulation which strangles and can eventually destroy213 members from other grain growing states also suggested change james abourezk dsd introduced new bill march 18 observing that the 1974 flcra amendments had inadvertently expanded the scope of the law to cover sheep shearers and custom combine crews senators lloyd bentsen dtx and abourezk had met with department officials on the issue senator nelson and representative ford had written to dol these informal efforts however were of avail214 senator robert dole rks explained the purposes of the exemption flcra was intended to end abuses against migrant workers and farmers by farm labor contractors while custom combining workers are migratory starting in texas and moving on to the far north they were really not migratory in the sense that farm laborers might be there was record of exploiting or abusing of such employees as for safety and health requirements custom operators are already meeting the standards necessary to protect their employees thus senator dole saw need for the additional safety and health requirements of flcra he objected to time consuming paperwork and to requirements for higher insurance flcra was intended for farmworkers from povertystricken environment who have little or 211 congressional record march 4 1976 p 5571

representative pressler introduced yet another version of his flcraexemption bill as did representative berkeley bedell dia216 bedell had written to the department on february 23 1976 and his request for exemption having been denied he called dol and spoke with herbert cohen of wagehour cohen acknowledged receiving communications from members involved in drafting the act he cohen then related that despite this testimony the department decided to proceed with the implementation of the new requirements because its lawyers felt that the legislative history of the 1974 amendments did not specifically call for the exemption of such crews217 bedell called the incident classic example of the executive branch using its rulemaking authority to usurp the legislative function of the congress and of attempting to legislate by fiat finally he called upon the congress to thwart executive excesses in the rulemaking area by enacting corrective legislation218 on march 23 as the senate considered the rural development act of 1972 senator dole proposed flcra exemption of custom combine harvesting and sheep shearing workers senators abourezk bentsen and nelson were supportive without dissent the amendment was adopted219 the following day representative tom foley democrat from washington state called up the rural development act with the dole amendment mr foley explained that the problem was technical that the issues were neither labor contractors nor migrant laborers but rather independent contractors who until now have not been subjected to the flcra220 the only other speaker was representative ford who announced that although the subject matter of the bill should have been directed to subcommittee of the committee on education and labor he would not object221 215

original act exempted crews employing less than 10 people from its registration requirements however in 1974 the statute was amended to include any group which recruits or transports more than one employee this numerical change technically brought small custom combiners and sheep shearers under the law despite the fact that there is specific reference to these groups in the legislative history

about the narrowminded and ridiculous interpretations of the overzealous bureaucrats at the department of labor who dont have anything better to do than harass our businessmen smith went on to discuss actions that endanger yet another of the fragile freedoms that still exist for individuals in this country226 she observed that thousands of farmers have come to washington during the past few weeks in search of help to raise farm prices to raise farm income she seemed to suggest farmers should be permitted to pay less to the several thousand high school students who are hired each year to detassel seed corn thin out test plots or rogue sorghum she stated in way can the salary from this job be considered as their primary means of support in many cases it is more of social event than job

be considered to be migrant workers for purposes of flcra228 shortly thereafter bill was introduced by leach that would have amended flcra to deal with the same issue229 hearings were held in legislative terms the issue seemed to disappear momentum however was building in september the perishable agricultural commodities act paca was under consideration senator richard clark dia proposed an amendment to flcra to correct an example of government out of control the amendment would exempt portion of the seed industry from flcra registration these are young people with about 280000 young persons who work seasonally ranging in age from 14 to 16 years old who work for an average of 10 days to 2 weeks each summer clark stated and who detassel seed corn eliminate rogue plants and perform other functions related to seed production the employees are from the local area residing within 30 to 40 mile radius and who return to their home each evening he suggested these people are clearly not migrants by any reasonable definition230 his constituents are very much up in arms about this he stated and i do not blame them231 it had only been through the past year it was stated that dol had

argued for the original intent of congress240 day haul workers raised broader questions representative william hefner d nc acknowledged that such workers had not been inadvertently included under the law still he urged the members to reexamine those intentions and to exempt workers living within 75mile radius of agricultural operations in north carolina he stated day haul workers are almost always local permanent residents of the area in which they work they do not necessarily go through labor contractor and when they do it is more matter of convenience rather than economic necessity he stated day haul workers are not migrant workers as the term is commonly understood and day haul operators who transport these workers are not crew leaders in the usual sense of this term241 italics added but if not migratory such workers may still have been subject to transportation provided by growers or contractors the gist of this problem seems to be in the insurance coverage required of anyone defined by the law as farm labor contractor whether he transports local day labor or true migrant labor hefner stated one suggests that day haul workers go unprotected he stated but they still have under state insurance laws requirements similar to all other workers in the state242 the issue was taken up by representative b f sisk dca in letter to dol elisburg replied that state coverage varied in accordance with the mandate of the particular state legislation such laws are workrelated and apply only where the passengers are clearly employees of the insured employer dependents of migrant workers are not covered elisburg continued in addition liability under state workers compensation plans would not extend to the times migrant workers are being transported from one employer to prospective employer243 these several issues were joined with respect to shared worker arrangements representative david stockman rmi proposed that flcra should not apply to farmers who shared the services of agricultural workers and who receive monetary consideration other than actual expenses the potential for abuse representative stockman stated is in my view almost nil244 elisburg responded that as an enforcement policy dol would prefer to put our resources elsewhere rather than 239 hearings house 1978 p 78 240 hearings house 1978 pp 13 4243 and 48 241 hearings house 1978 pp 2128 current

june 20 1977 p 19982 in the department of labors eyes the expectation that the laborers would return to his farm became valuable consideration to the farmer entering into casual agreement with his neighbor this play upon words turned the farmers he said into farm labor contractors crs51 come after small farmers who on local basis share workers245 the response did not satisfy stockman and representative william goodling rpa suggested he elisburg is saying if we had more resources we would get after them too but elisburg stated large or small if we found abuses of the work force we would go wherever they are246 some urged that legislation exempt nonprofit charitable organizations public or nonprofit private educational institutions and bona fide nonprofit agricultural cooperatives engaged in labor contracting for their own members elisburg suggested that such proposals were something of ruse and one that dol would oppose that they would substantially narrow the acts coverage and would deny its protection to large numbers of agricultural workers elisburg stated we have been told by those who support this exemption that such organizations are fixed and have assets which would be reachable in law suit by their employees i think that we all have to recognize generally agricultural workers do not have the financial resources to independently assert their rights against such organizations and we question why this economically disadvantaged group should be placed in this position further elisburg stated that employment by nonprofit organization has nothing to do with need to protect agricultural workers under flcra particularly if the nonprofit venture consists of profitmaking organizations247 concerns grow these individuals registered under flcra are not farmers they were agents who arranged to provide migrant labor to farmers representative stockman affirmed many of them have long criminal records they stole from the workers they stole from the farmers and they needlessly endangered the health and safety of migrant workers248 yet it was with these same perhaps unscrupulous middlemen that farmers dealt the contractors some alleged provided the services of lowwage and often low skilled workers some native americans some foreignborn and some ineligible to work in the united states they broke strikes some said and prevented domestic workers from organizing further critics suggested that they provided cover for their farmerbusiness partners dol some urged had consistently misinterpreted the rules governing such contractors though he believed that agricultural workers must be protected from abuse by unethical crew leaders consistent subtheme of flcra critics representative leon panetta dca protested that

substantial restructuring of flcra249 relations with the department of labor under date of october 24 1979 fiftytwo senators led by j bennett johnston dla wrote to secretary marshall expressing our increasing concern over dols management of flcra the johnston letter explained the purposes of the act as the signers perceived them and observed that farmers and certain other agricultural employers are being required to register requirement we believe goes beyond any reasonable interpretation of the law dols actions apparently based on its own extremely narrow interpretation of the act are completely contrary to congressional intent and impose an undue penalty and economic burden on those specifically exempted by congress these actions have resulted in misdirection of the departments limited resources at the expense of those the law was intended to protect250 marshalls response dated november 26 1979 offered few accommodations he agreed that enforcement of the act be targeted on repeat and serious violations which jeopardize labor standards marshall observed that the first ten years under the act have not ended abuse thus the 1974 amendments were enacted to extend coverage and improve enforcement the secretary acknowledged that farmer or other agriculturallyrelated person would be exempt if he or she personally recruited migrant labor for their own operation and that any fulltime or regular employees of any incorporated farm or agricultural business might also be exempt if the employee only performed farm labor contractortype activities on an incidental basis on both issues dol had been consistent we believe that flcra applies where there is crewleader hiring or transporting workers or where there are company employees substantially engaged in activities generally performed by crewleaders we also believe that it is critical to enforce the act in way which discourages evasion of its provisions to deter farm labor contractors from being placed on payrolls and appearing to assume the status of fulltime or regular employees this enforcement approach is consistent with both the letter and spirit of the act italics added the secretary conceded that the term incidental may not have been defined as specifically as possible he therefore stated that for the future such person would be one who does not spend more than 20 percent of his time in farm labor contracting activities and performs that activity solely for his employer these changes will 249 congressional record may 21 1979 p 11996 the panetta proposal was only one of number of

entirely pleased with marshalls letter on december 5 1979 senator johnston with russell long dla concurred with marshalls emphasis on traditional farm labor contractors and requested copy of instructions being prepared for enforcement officers but they disagreed on the impact of such changes first in order to know if an employee is engaged on more than an incidental basis he must be engaged less than 20 percent of some time period logically the time period should be his total manhours of employment the failure of your letter to specify time period leaves open the possibility that 20 percent of his time means 20 percent of any work week any work day or any pay period any one of these possible meanings would render the 20 percent standard ineffective as far as strengthening the exemption provided by congress second your letter is not specific about the meaning of farm labor contracting activities as we understand the departments interpretation of the act supervision is considered to be farm labor contracting activity since your letter does not clarify this the new definition of incidental again becomes less significant third your letter does not indicate what regulatory standing the new definition of incidental would have the departments intent should have been set forth in formal regulations subject to public comment similarly the interpretative regulations for the act itself are long overdue252 through the last year and half that marshall was in office such correspondence took on regular pattern as first one and then another member of congress became distressed with the provisions of flcra the boren amendment and the panetta bill 1980 during consideration of the child nutrition amendments of 1980 senator boren proposed an amendment to clarify the provisions of flcra all of us he commenced want to see an end to any abuse of migrant farm workers but at the same time he affirmed we very strongly want to assure that an additional regulatory burden is not placed upon the farmers the farm coops and others involving agriculture across the country253 senator boren was critical of dol administration of flcra it had moved he stated far from the intent of the congress and of those who spoke on the 1963 legislation the department has been subjecting farmers and other agricultural employers including their employees to civil and

gaylord nelson noted that the bill was essentially similar to s 2875 introduced with 39 cosponsors month earlier nelson urged that boren having made his point would be willing to withdraw his amendment and to wait for hearings that had already been scheduled by his nelsons committee as the senator knows this law is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the labor and human resources committee there was yet another option ie s 2789 introduced by senator javits senator nelson agreed that there have been serious problems since enactment of the 1974 amendments numerous lawsuits have been filed and both agricultural employers as well as farm workers have expressed dissatisfaction with dols administration of this law and justifiably so in my opinion senator nelson noted that he had personally written to the secretary expressing my concern but he also affirmed that the proper place for consideration of corrective legislation was the labor and human resources committee255 the boren amendment however was not withdrawn and on vote of 57 yeas to 37 nays the measure was passed256 the house was similarly divided on the issue representative panetta who had earlier introduced general reform of flcra was now joined by representatives foley of washington state chair of the agriculture committee and william goodling of the committee on education and labor with numerous

agricultural labor ford placed in the record letter from ray marshall in which he too expressed my deep concern and strong opposition to the boren amendment263 the boren amendment however was caught up in parliamentary procedures and migrated to series of proposals in report for 1980 the cq almanac noted an amendment restricting coverage of 1963 law aimed at preventing exploitation of migrant farm workers was added to continuing resolution hjres 637 but later dropped264 for the present flcra remained unchanged the boren bill and the panetta bill 1981 in the 97th congress critics of the farm labor contractor registration act returned to the fray on april 8 1981 senator boren introduced s 922 measure designed to provide for the proper administration and enforcement of flcra conceding that one problem has been the somewhat vague and ambiguous language that had resulted in gross misinterpretation borens proposal sought to clarify the meaning of the act265 258 congressional record

stressed my support for the purposes of the act stated that flcras vague language and convoluted format allows dol to subvert the intent of congress and to take advantage of these procedural defects in its unrelenting efforts to envelop farmers packers processors and their employees within the regulatory scheme of the act the result has been widespread harassment of agricultural interests with little discernable effect with respect to crew leaders farmers face enough problems in todays economy without this one266 on may 20 1981 representative panetta introduced hr 3636 similar in some respects to his bill from the 96th congress267 flcra remains he stated significant problem of unnecessary and burdensome regulation which has grown as more and more farmers and other fixedbase agricultural employers have found that they are required to comply with its terms268 in the interim between introduction of the boren bill and panetta bill however there had been discernible change the education and labor committee representative panetta announced is contemplating hearings on the issue this year and there is doubt in my mind that we can work out the problems that exist with the act panetta wrote into his bill several proposals which may have been viewed as the start of compromise first he proposed to eliminate the distinction between fulltime or regular and to make clear the distinction between bona fide employee and an independent contractor second he proposed to allow the secretary some discretion in causing cooperative to register depending upon the purposes of the cooperative arrangement third he proposed modification in the definition of dayhaul worker with the stated intention of securing their protection269 it is in this constructive spirit panetta affirmed that i look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee on education and labor and particularly with my good friend from california mr miller who is chairman of the subcommittee on labor standards270 but negotiations would be long and intense 266 congressional record april 8 1981 p 6943 267 in the 96th congress the panetta bill carried the names of 160 members see congressional record

superceded by the administrations bill introduced by request by representative miller crs57 the miller hearings and their aftermath 1982 from the spring of 1981 and into the fall of 1982 the several parties at interest met and reviewed proposals for revision of flcra from all sides there were serious concerns with the existing law that they felt needed to be addressed according to representative george miller negotiations he stated were long and at times frustrating271 finally on september 1 1982 secretary of labor raymond donovan sent to congress bill entitled the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act which was referred to the committee on education and labor272 the hearing on september 14 1982 miller called together for single hearing the subcommittee on labor standards the bill at issue was hr 7102 an administration proposal but with more generalized backing robert b collyer deputy under secretary of labor was the first witness reviewing the recent history of the administrations bill collyer affirmed this cooperative effort has now resulted in consensus bill endorsed by the afl cio the migrant legal action program and by major agricultural employer organizations such as the american farm bureau federation the national food processors association and the national council of agricultural employers while none of these groups believes the bill to be ideal from its individual standpoint there is important agreement that the bill materially improves the law273 the 1974 flcra amendments collyer explained had resulted in great deal of litigation274 the essence of the new bill was compromise representatives from industry and the aflcio endorsed the changes in policy included within the new bill275 representatives of farmworkers were more skeptical but acquiesced276 as the hearing closed representative miller thanked the witnesses 271 us congress house subcommittee on labor standards committee on education and labor hearings on the

if this law is perfect or not i think its an improvement and i gather from your testimony that you believe it is an improvement277 consideration and floor action the failure of current law to achieve its goal of fairness and equity for migrant workers the house report stated combined with employer objections as to their treatment under the act gave the negotiations momentum and made the attainment of legislative change obligatory278 flcra as amended had failed to reverse the historical pattern of abuse and exploitation of migrant and seasonal farm workers and as result argued for new approach279 the committee on education and labor reported the bill on september 28 1982280 on september 29 representative miller urged that the rules be suspended and hr 7102 be passed recounting the months of negotiations and compromise he noted the certainty that the legislation might bring281 john erlenborn ril co sponsor recalled that for over 18 months the interested parties including staff from the house and senate majority and minority have been engaged in negotiations to work out successor to flcra representative panetta affirmed that the bill eliminates undue redtape and harassment for farmers while at the same time provides real protection to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers representative goodling for his part cited the unwarranted and overzealous tactics of the wage and hour divisionbut at the same time he acknowledged that the long negotiations between all parties had made the new bill possible finally the debate closed the rules were suspended the bill was passed on voice vote282 in the senate the bill was held at the desk not referred to committee283 until on december 19 1982 senator howard baker rtn called up the measure for floor action senator orrin

law will result in substantially improved protection for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers he said many of whom are disadvantaged minorities conversely we will continue our efforts to both reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and at the same time protect essential employment standards in americas workplaces285 part iv new statute emerges 1983 ff with enactment of pl 97470 flcra disappeared in its place was new statute the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act mspa for more than twenty years mspa has been generally though not entirely free from controversy the structure and provisions of the new law mspa has remained largely unchanged since its enactment286 although its terms are spelled out in detail adapted to specific farmworker employment situations its structure is relatively simple the introduction states the purposes of the act ie to require that farm labor contractors register with the secretary of labor and to assure necessary protections for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers agricultural associations and agricultural employers it then proceeds to list of definitions used inter alia agricultural association agricultural employer agricultural employment day haul operation employ farm labor contracting activity farm labor contractor migrant agricultural worker person and seasonal agricultural worker287 the act includes

federal and state agencies in carrying out the program under mspa miscellaneous provisions this act is intended to supplement state law and compliance with this act shall not excuse any person from compliance with appropriate state law and regulation adams fruit co inc v barrett perhaps only consensus bill such as that creating mspa could have been enacted under the circumstances yet that would not end complaints both pro and migrant farmworkers observed representative mickey leland dtx in 1985 just two years after mspa was adopted are among the most vulnerable workers in our nation the conditions under which they live and work has resulted in an infant mortality rate that is two and onehalf times the national average294 during the late 1980s several members protested about the alleged tendency of some legal services offices to represent or i suggest misrepresent some of these migrant workers in bringing complaints against farmers295 and in 1993 representative miller argued that working and living conditions for migrant agricultural workers remain deplorable and in some cases have deteriorated and he introduced comprehensive revision of mspa296 the most serious complaint one that would result in amendment of mspa grew out of the adams fruit case297 ruling from the court in 1990 the us supreme court ruled in adams fruit co v barrett that migrant farmworkers employed by adams fruit company inc having suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident in an adams fruit van while traveling to work had two options available for redress they could file claim under the florida workmens compensation law and they could avail themselves under the private right of action provision of mspa298 at issue before the court was the question of exclusivity or dual coverage under the state and federal acts ie workers compensation and mspa the court 294 congressional record september 1985 p 22927 295 congressional record september 30 1986 pp 2739927401 march 6 1987 pp

1989 crs64 ruled that although congress may choose to establish state remedies as adequate alternatives to federal relief it cannot be assumed that private federal rights of action are conditioned on the unavailability of state remedies absent some indication to that effect299 in the view of the court such alternative remedy was apparent adams fruit argued that in the absence of any explicit congressional statement regarding the preemptive scope of mspa the court should defer to the departments position ie single remedy the court however rejected that view it found that gap is not created in statutory scheme merely because statute does not restate the truism that states may not preempt federal law300 in summary the court held our review of the language and structure of awpa mspa leads us to conclude that awpa does not establish workers compensation benefits as an exclusive remedy301 hearings on workmens compensation representative goodling branded the decision as bad for employers and bad for workers allowing the worker the ability to both recover workers compensation and sue for compensatory and punitive damages goodling asserted as one who worked many long and hard hours in 1981 and 1982 to achieve the msawpa mspa consensus i intend to preserve it by pressing for early action next year to overturn the adams fruit decision302 on september 15 1993 representative austin murphy dpa called together at fresno california hearing by the labor standards subcommittee two bills were on the table hr 1173 miller and hr 1999 by victor fazio dca the miller bill was comprehensive measure which among other provisions would have codified the adams fruit decision the fazio bill had for its sole purpose the overturning of that decision303 they had evolved though from different perspectives through many months of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at producing consensus legislation to resolve the difficulties and concerns voiced by farmworker advocates and growers304 299 494 us

hearings on the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act july 13 1987 the 1987 hearing was conducted in biglerville pa crs65 as the fresno hearings opened several members of congress spoke richard lehman dca and calvin dooley dca commenced with opposition to any new restrictions upon agricultural interests they were followed by howard berman d ca and by miller generally supportive of worker interests the several members emphasized the dichotomy existing over the prospective legislation they were followed by representatives of organized labor civil rights attorneys and spokespersons for industry305 on may 25 1995 with change in control in the house goodling became chair of the full committee on economic and educational opportunities cass ballenger rnc now chaired the subcommittee on workforce protections with jurisdiction over agricultural labor new hearings addressed the issues similarly the court ballenger stated had interpreted mspa to provide for private right of action for certain job related injuries even if the individual was covered by workers compensation at the time of the injury leaving employers exposed to potentially enormous liability for damages in spite of the fact that they have contributed into the workers compensation system306 conversely representative major owens dny suggested that instead of insuring work place protections this committee is preoccupied with eliminating all inconveniences for the rich and privileged at the expense of the working poor307 bruce wood senior counsel for the american insurance association argued that the courts opinion was not grounded on public policy and that the court had acted narrowly and mechanically308 the doctrine of exclusivity was emphasized by walter kates an industry representative mspa was consensus bill he declared with all parties in agreement that the doctrine of workers compensation exclusivity was part of the bill the failure to reverse the adams fruit decision kates stated could have adverse and unintentional consequences for both the farmer and the farmworker309 steve kenfield farm labor contractor from california suggested that adams fruit has complicated an already complex compliance situation it created frustration in that payment of premiums for workers compensation mandatory in california is virtually meaningless and it suggested that we could also face openended liability with others from industry kenfield called upon congress to reverse the adams fruit decision310 finally david moody former farmworker and the victim of an

committee on economic and educational opportunities and passed312 through the summer discussions were conducted informally on the legislation and in midoctober goodling was able to announce that substitute would be offered for hr 1715 with the same designation that would carry with it the endorsement of representatives ballenger owens and william clay dmo 313 the substitute version of hr 1715 provided that where state workers compensation law is applicable and coverage is provided the workers compensation benefits shall be the exclusive remedy for loss of such worker under this act in the case of bodily injury or death in effect adams fruit was overturned the bill went on to discuss the expansion of statutory damages the tolling of the statute of limitations under state workmens compensation laws disclosure of coverage and processes to the workers involved and other matters mr goodling explained that hr 1715 clarifies the relationship between workers compensation benefits and the private right of action available under mspa314 mr owens rose in support of the bill and expressed his appreciation to representatives goodling clay and ballenger and to others representatives miller berman and fazio the efforts of all three gentlemen have been instrumental in the development of the amendment before us which he regarded as compromise315 mr fazio argued that the bill is the result of 5 years of discussions but it is bill that needed to be enacted316 at this juncture the house suspended the rules and passed the compromise version of hr 1715317 the bill was promptly dispatched to the senate where under unanimous consent it was adopted318 on november 15 1995 the measure was signed into law pl 10449 by president william clinton 311 hearings house 1995 pp 2122 312

part v agricultural workers in the new century for the most part since the 1983 amendments with the emergence of the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act the statute has remained largely unchanged with the exception of the adams fruit legislation319 the history of flcra and now mspa has been long and tedious for almost ten years 1964 to 1974 legislation remained in place but was largely unenforced or perhaps unenforceable revised in 1974 there were serious attempts to enforce the statute but these seem to have required that many of the wrong people register ie fixed site farmers growers and variety of other agricultural interests and generally to comply with the acts restrictions in 1983 flcra was repealed and congress started over with new statute the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act the latter remains in place debate over flcra and to lesser extent mspa seems to have been exhausting it could well be that some may now be disinclined to revisit the statute and to raise new questions however the need for oversight would seem to remain priority where agricultural policy is concerned thus far in the 110th congress new legislation to amend mspa has been considered 319 see us congress house subcommittee on workforce protections committee on education and the workforce field hearing on issues relating to migrant and seasonal
