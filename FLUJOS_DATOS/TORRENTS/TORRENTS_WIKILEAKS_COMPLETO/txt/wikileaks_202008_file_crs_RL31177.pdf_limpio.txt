state and local governments 1 to impose new taxes on internet access or 2 to impose multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce it grandfathered existing taxes on internet access the original moratorium expired on october 21 2001 numerous bills to extend the moratorium were introduced in the first session of the 107th congress the congress approved hr 1552 pl 10775 enacted november 28 2001 which extended the prior moratorium by 2 years until november 1 2003 the bills under active consideration during 2001 addressed two major sets of issues the first centered on how long to extend the moratorium and whether to continue to grandfather existing taxes on internet access the second addressed the simplification of state and local sales and use tax systems and whether congress was willing to signal support for the states effort to have outofstate sellers collect taxes on interstate sales tax simplification is treated as prerequisite to congress granting states the authority to require tax collection by remote sellers the two issues were linked some supporters of granting the states sales and use tax collection authority wanted extension of the moratorium others wanted the extension to be long enough for the states to accomplish meaningful sales tax simplification but not so long that public perception of the internet as taxfree shopping zone could become entrenched they preferred shorter extension of the moratorium of 2 years or less they might have agreed to longer extension if sales tax collection provisions were included in the extension bill those skeptical of the ability of state and local governments to quickly agree upon and implement meaningfu l sales tax simplification favored longer extension of 4 or 5 years those who opposed addressing the issue of tax collection by remote sellers typically favored longer if not permanent extension of the moratorium the moratorium extension bill that was enacted hr 1552 pl 10775 did not address the sales and use tax simplification and collection issue however before voting to approve hr 1552 as received from the house the senate debated the enzidorgan amendment samdt 2155 which did address the issue in considerable detail the amendment was tabled by vote of 57 to 43 still both during the debate and after the votes in the senate several senators expressed their intention to pursue an agreement on the sales and use tax simplification and collection issues raised in the amendment during the added 2 years of the moratorium two other issues related to definitions in the internet tax freedom act were of particular concern to state and local revenue officials one was including otherwise taxable products and services in the definition of taxprotected internet access another was

moratorium imposed by the internet tax freedom act1 itfa in 1998 prohibited state and local governments from levying 1 new taxes on internet access and 2 any multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce the act grandfathered taxes on internet access that were in place prior to october 1 1998 thereby permitting existing access taxes to continue the initial moratorium expired on october 21 2001 the 107th congress approved hr 1552 pl 10775 enacted november 28 2001 extending the prior moratorium by 2 years until november 1 2003 and continuing to grandfather existing taxes on internet access numerous bills were introduced in the first session of the 107th congress to extend the moratorium several bills addressed other issues related to state and local taxation of the internet and interstate commerce2 the main questions with regard to extending the moratorium were how long to extend the moratorium several months 2 years 4 or 5 years or permanently whether to extend the moratorium on internet access taxes permanently but extend the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxes temporarily and whether to continue to grandfather existing taxes on internet access major issue raised in conjunction with extending the moratorium was whether congress would consider granting states the authority to require remote sellers to collect sales and use taxes on interstate sales and if so under what conditions before voting on hr 1552 the senate debated the enzidorgan amendment to hr 1552 samdt 2155 which addressed the sales and use tax collection issue in considerable detail the amendment was tabled by vote of 57 to 43 however both during the debate and after the votes in the senate several senators expressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs2 3congressional record

distinguishing issues by nonna nototheir intention to continue to pursue an agreement on the sales tax simplification and collection issues raised in the enzidorgan amendment3 under each subheading that follows is short description and procon analysis of the issue references are made to specific bills introduced during 2001 that took position on the particular issue4 many of the same issues remain to be addressed when the expiration of the internet tax moratorium approaches again in 2003 the discussion is organized in two parts the first focuses on the moratorium including definitions in the internet tax freedom act the second addresses issues related to collecting sales and use taxes on interstate sales moratorium issues the main issues with regard to extending the morator ium were how long to extend it and whether to continue to grandfather existing taxes on internet access however state and local revenue officials were also concerned about other issues related to definitions in the internet tax freedom act the definition of internet access may be interpreted as being broad enough to exempt products and services sold together with internet access that might otherwise be taxable if treated independently with respect to discriminatory taxes one issue is states having to treat internet sales like mailorder sales for sales and use tax collection purposes another issue is businesses using internet kiosks and dotcom subsidiaries to avoid sales tax collection and other tax obligations how long to extend the moratorium the first issue differentiating the internet tax bills introduced in 2001 during the first session of the 107th congress was how long to extend the prior 3year moratorium which expired on october 21 2001 the moratorium has two components the first prohibits state or local governments from imposing new taxes on internet access the second prohibits them from imposing any multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce among the bills introduced some would have extended both parts of the moratorium temporarily ranging from 8 months s 1504 up to 2 years hr 1552pl 10775 and s 1481 4 years hr 1410s 512 or 5 years s 246 and s 1525 four bills would have made the moratorium on internet access taxes permanent but extended the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxes temporarily by 4 s 1542 s 1567 and samdt 2155 or 5 years s 288 four other bills would have made both parts of the moratorium permanent hr 1675s 777 hr 2526 and s 589 the bill that was enacted hr 1552 pl 10775httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs3 5the link between the length of the moratorium extension and the sales tax collection issue is discussed further in the subsection below on connection to extending the moratorium in the section on collecting use taxes on interstate internet salesextended both parts of the moratorium by 2 years and few days until november 1 2003 extension some opposed any extension of the internet tax moratorium this group included those who fundamentally object to federal restrictions on state and local taxing authorit it also included those who felt that the original moratorium was largely anticipatory in the sense that not many states were levying or intending to levy the prohibited taxes and that there was not likely to be rush to impose such taxes if the moratorium ended opponents also included those who did not want the moratoriu m extended unless congress addressed the issue of sales and use taxation of interstate commerce at the same time they were concerned that unless congress strongly signaled its support for taxing internet commerce like bricks and mortar commerce in the near future businesses would aggressively pursue methods of business organization and internet technology designed to avoid state and local tax liability exacerbating an existing problem see the discussion of internet kiosks below temporary extension many of those concerned with eventually addressing the sales and use tax collection issue were willing to simply extend the prior moratorium temporarily but not for too many years they wanted any extension of the moratorium to be long enough for the states to accomplish meaningful sales tax simplification but not so long that the internet access and electronic commerce industries could grow large and powerful enough to stop any attempt to tax them or that public perception of the internet as taxfree shopping zone could become entrenched from this vantage point 4 or 5year extension of the moratorium seemed too long shorter extension of 2 years or less was preferable5 permanent extension supporters of permanently extending the moratorium included those specifically opposed to taxing any activity that occurs over the internet both internet access and electronic commerce as well as those generally opposed to any tax supporters of permanent extension of the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxes were typically not interested in addressing the taxation of interstate sales some of the bills would have permanently extended the moratorium on internet access taxes but temporarily extended the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce for 4 or 5 years this dichotomy reflected substantial differences in the views of these two parts of the moratorium discussed in more detail in the sections that

commission continuednew internet access taxes the internet tax freedom act placed moratorium on state and local governments ability to impose new taxes on internet access but grandfathered existing taxes on internet access that were in place prior to october 1 1998 definition of internet access the taxation of internet access refers to applying state and local taxes to the monthly charge that subscribers pay for access to the internet through internet service providers isps when applied the tax on internet access is most commonly retail general sales tax but may also take the form of other transactional taxes such as telecommunications gross receipts or business and occupation taxes see the discussion below of states with grandfathered taxes among those states that do levy sales tax on internet access the state sales tax rate ranges from 4 to 625 according to section 11045 of the internet tax freedom act the term internet access means service that enables users to access content information electronic mail or other services offered over the internet and may also include access to proprietary content information and other services as part of package of services offered to users such term does not include telecommunications services the breadth of this definition gives rise to the issue of including in the definition of internet access products and services that might otherwise be taxable discussed further in the subsection below on bundling of services in addition to basic access to the internet an isp subscription typically includes basic services offered over the internet such as access to electronic mail email and standard browser internet explorer or netscape navigator the subscription may also include access to some proprietary information services internet access subscriptions can differ substantially in the services they offer the limit on the number of access hours covered under the standard fee and their price as of fall 2001 monthly subscription charges ranged from free 5 or 10 for limited basic services to 18 to 24 for unlimited enhanced services such as those offered by america online aol microsoft network msn or earthlink and up to 30 to 50 for highspeed internet access also known as broadband6 arguments for extending moratorium on access taxes supporters of extending the moratorium on new internet access taxes and of removing the grandfathering protection for existing taxes argued that taxing internet access would raise the price of the service thereby discouraging the spread of the new technology and the growth of electronic commerce they also argued that access taxes would widen the digital divide between those who can afford access to the new technology and those who cannot7 some also argued that access taxes are in part doublehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs5 7continued on electronic commerce issues and policy options paper final draft submitted to the advisory commission from the report drafting

and repeal proposals by louis alan talley 10in hr 4105 the version of the internet tax freedom act passed by the house in the 105th congress on june 23 1998 the prohibition of multiple taxation

taxes paid sale for resale exemption or other mechanism for eliminating duplicate taxation continuedtaxation if isps are also paying taxes on the underlying backbone transmission telecommunications service used to provide internet access the effort to ban internet access taxes also can be viewed as part of the movement to simplify or eliminate state and local telecommunications taxes and to repeal the federal telephone excise tax the majority on the advisory commission on electronic commerce had proposed among other items permanent moratorium on internet access taxes simplifying state and local telecommunications taxes in addition to simplifying sales taxes and repealing the 3 federal telephone excise tax8 these proposals were included in various bills introduced in the 106th congress9 arguments against extending moratorium on access taxes others opposed extending the morator ium on new internet access taxes and removing the grandfathering protection for existing access taxes they especially opposed permanent extension of the ban they also opposed an extension of the ban with internet access defined as it currently is in the internet tax freedom act reported above under definition of internet access because of the bundling of services issue discussed in the next subsection states generally oppose federal efforts to restrict their taxing authority states also want to retain the flexibility to adapt their tax structure to the rapidly changing telecommunications landscape there is concern even within the communications industry that the tax burden on different modes of communication be comparable this objective suggests that as long as other modes such as telephone which is also used to fax and cable are subject to state and local taxes the internet should also be taxed so as not to grant the internet competitive pricing advantage opponents of the moratorium refuted the doubleta xation argument explained in the previous subsection on arguments for extending moratorium on access taxes by pointing out that internet service providers could be able to claim saleforresale exemption for the taxes they pay on the underlying telecommunications services10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs6 10continued that provision was not included in the version of the itfa enacted in october 1998 11hr 4105 the version of the internet tax freedom act passed by the house in the 105th congress on june 23 1998 would have protected bundled internet access services from taxation only if the service provider separately stated the portion of the billing that applied to the internet access services that provision was not included in the version of the itfa enacted in october 1998 12an alternative to trying to define taxprotected internet access more narrowly would be exempting from tax dollar amount sufficient to cover the cost of basic internet access service for example texas exempts up to 25 of monthly internet access bill charges in excess of such threshold could be subject to applicable taxes if the states chose to tax enhanced servicesbundling of services typically when taxable products or services are sold bundled together with nontaxable products or services for single price the entire package is taxable unless the price of the nontaxable portion is stated separately if internet access were defined more narrowly than it currently is the issue would be how to state the price of the basic internet access services in the taxprotected portion of the service package separately from the price of the enhanced services in the taxable portion11 instead the issue here is the breadth of the definition of internet access states were concerned that the existing definition in the internet tax freedom act might be interpreted as being broad enough to exempt from tax not only basic internet services such as the ability to connect to and surf the internet and use email but also range of other services and products sold together with internet access that might be taxable if purchased on their own some examples would be information services cable television books magazines games music and movies offered online increasingly basic connection to the internet is being sold together with variety of other products and services by the same vendor for single fee many of the additional products and services could arguably fit under the itfas definition of internet access if they did then state and local governments stand to lose substantial tax revenue on the sale of products and services that might otherwise be subject to state and local telecommunica tions sales or franchise taxes if they were treated independently consequently if the ban on internet access taxes was to continue some state and local governments were concerned that the definition of internet access be narrowed s 1542 s 1567 and samdt 2155 would have added to the itfa definition of internet access services that excluded the receipt of content or ancillary services12 s 1542 and s 1567 but not samdt 2155 also would have amended the definition of internet access to include wireless web access services while continuing to exclude telecommunications services generally the bill enacted hr 1552 pl 10775 simply extended the prior moratorium on new internet access taxes for 2 years until november 1 2003 it did not make any changes to the definitions contained in the original internet tax freedom acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs7 13for example the connecticut retail sales tax on internet access was

moratorium and elimination of the grandfathering protection for existing taxes on internet access in its cost analysis of hr 3709 the congressional budget office cbo determined that eliminating the grandfathering provision for existing internet access taxes would in itself be sufficient to subject the bill to the statutory procedural restrictions on unfunded intergovernmental mandates cbo estimated that the revenue loss to state and local governments from eliminating existing internet access taxes alone would exceed the statutory threshold established by the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 umra14 at some time during the 5year extension of the moratorium proposed in hr 3709 the threshold for restricted intergovernmental mandate was revenue loss of 55 million per year in 2000 and 56 million in 2001 the threshold is adjusted annually for inflation the rest of the moratorium on new internet access taxes and on any multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce could add to the cost of the mandate but because these prohibited taxes do not yet exist cbo could not make meaningful revenue loss estimate for them15 in may 2000 the federation of tax administrators estimated combined revenue loss of 75 million from 11 states for the fiscal year beginning july 1 2000 if the grandfathering clause were removed16 an estimate compiled in march 2001 by tax analysts from information provided by revenue officials from nine states was that repeal of the grandfather clause would cost state governments approximatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs9 17the revenue

collecting certain types of state and local taxes hr 1552 would impose an intergovernmental mandate as defined in the unfunded mandates reform act umra however because hr 1552 would allow states that are currently collecting sales tax on internet access to continue doing so it would not affect state and local revenues currently being collected and consequently continued90 million in revenue loss in the first year alone17 both of these estimates exceed the threshold amount subjecting an unfunded intergovernmental mandate to procedural restrictions 56 million in 2001 none of the proposals to eliminate the grandfathering protection for existing internet access taxes or to permanently ban new access taxes offered federal compensation to state and local governments for the revenue they would lose18 the presence of an unfunded intergovernmental mandate in excess of the threshold amount means that point of order may be raised when bill is considered on the house or senate floor19 in the case of hr 3709 on may 10 2000 point of order was raised but the house voted to consider the measure despite the presence of the unfunded mandate20 in october 2001 the congressional budget office prepared cost estimate for hr 1552 the internet tax nondiscrimination act the bill subsequently enacted as pl 10775 the bill provided for 2year extension of the original moratorium until november 1 2003 it continued the grandfathering protection for existing taxes on internet access that was provided under the original moratorium cbo determined that although the bill would impose an intergovernmental mandate the revenue losses to state and local governments would not exceed the threshold amount 56 million in 2001 because the grandfathering provision was extended21

taxes on electronic commerce in addition to the moratorium on new taxes on internet access the internet tax freedom act itfa imposed moratorium on any multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce this section of the report provides definition of the terms electronic commerce multiple tax and discriminatory tax it also explains some of the implications of the definition of discriminatory tax this includes the reason why state cannot require an internet seller to collect use taxes unless the seller has physical presence nexus in the taxing state it also includes basis for some companies claiming that they can sell through internet kiosks and comparable computer and corporate organizational arrangements and not be subject to sales and use tax collection requirements electronic commerce according to the internet tax freedom act the term electronic commerce means any transaction conducted over the internet or through internet access comprisin g the sale lease license offer or delivery of property goods services or information whether or not for consideration and includes the provision of internet access22 multiple taxes the ban on multiple taxes prohibits double taxation or overlapping taxes by two or more jurisdictions at the same level of government more precisely the ban on multiple taxes prohibits more than one state or more than one local jurisdiction at the same level of government ie more than one county orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs11 23the tax credit could take the form of resale exemption certificate 24for additional discussion see crs report rs20577 state sales taxation of internet transactions by john r luckey and crs report rl30667 internet tax legislation distinguishing issues by nonna noto section on role of congress under the commerce power 34 25every state with sales tax has corresponding use tax typically defined as tax upon the storage use or consumption of tangible personal property in the stateone city from imposing tax on the same transaction unless credit is offered for taxes paid to another jurisdiction to eliminate double taxation23 however the itfa does permit multiple sales and use taxes that are geographically vertical the definition of multiple tax makes an exception to permit both state and one or more of its subdivisions to impose their sales or use tax on the same electronic commerce transaction for example the state county and city within that county could all levy their sales tax on the same electronic commerce transaction another exception included in the itfas definition of multiple tax permits tax to be levied on persons engaged in electronic commerce eg personal income tax corporate income tax or business activity tax even if sales or use tax is levied on the transaction to date multiple taxation has not been cited as an active problem multiple taxation could become an issue in situation where the location of sale is ambiguous for example consider the case of purchase from seller in one state by person who lives in second state over an internet server in third state charged to credit card account in fourth state and delivered as gift to person in fifth state multiple taxation could occur if more than one of these states claimed the right to levy sales or use tax on the sale without the taxpayer being able to claim credit for tax paid to another state discr iminatory taxes the internet tax freedom act also prohibits discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce the act defines several types of discriminatory taxes discriminatory tax includes any state or local tax on electronic commerce that is not levied in the same way at the same rate or on the same person or entity as on transactions involving similar property goods services or information accomplished through other means in practice this means that transactions arranged over the internet are to be taxed like mail order or telephone sales thus the same nexus standards that apply to sales arranged by mailorder or telephone also apply to internet transactions under the current judicial interpretation of nexus as applied to mailorder sales state cannot require an outofstate seller to collect use tax from the customer unless the seller has physical presence in the taxing state24 the use tax is the companion tax to the sales tax applicable to interstate sales25 if the seller does nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs12 26for further discussion see the introduction to the section below on collecting sales and use taxes on interstate salescollect the use tax on

services by remote seller does not establish nexus circumstances that do not establish nexus include the sole ability to access site on remote sellers outofstate computer server the display of remote sellers information or content on the outofstate computer server of provider of internet access service or online services and the processing of orders through the outofstate computer server of provider of internet access service or online services in these examples outofstate refers to state other than the state wishing to tax the sales transaction internet kiosks some businesses have taken advantage of these nexus limits in the itfas definition of discriminatory tax to establish what are referred to as internet kiosks the businesses claim that orders placed through these computer kiosks are not subject to sales tax collection requirements briefly company already operating bricksandmortar retail business sets up separate business or corporate entity sometimes referred to as dotcom subsidiary the subsidiary is designed to receive sales orders over the internet and ship the product to the customer often across state lines the subsidiarys computer terminals are placed in the parent companys bricksandmortar stores in what is called an internet kiosk because of the abovementioned language in the itfa some sellers claim that tax on an order placed through an internet kiosk in one state to seller located in and shipping from another state is considered discriminatory tax prohibited by the moratorium critics of the current definition of discriminatory tax disagree with the claim that dotcom subsidiary does not have nexus currently defined as physical presence in the state where the kiosk is located the criticism of nexusfree status becomes even stronger in cases where customers are permitted to return to the bricksandmortar store products they ordered over the internet and received by mail or other delivery service state and local governments and main street retailers are concerned that if congress does not signal its support for taxing internet commerce like bricks and mortar commerce many types of businesses will aggressively pursue internet technology and business structures specifically designed to avoid state and local tax liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs13 27similar nexus rules physical presence in the local jurisdiction apply to requiring sellers to collect local sales and use taxes 28congressional record daily edition vol 147 nov 15 2001 floor debate s1190215 text of samdt 2155 s1196364 29the sales tax base has already been eroded by not taxing most services by exempting some continuedrelated issues collecting sales and use taxes on interstate sales under current law sellers with nexus defined as physical presence in state are already required to collect state tax on their sales arranged over the internet or by other means to customers in that state instate sellers are required to collect sales taxes outofstate sellers with physical presence in the state such as warehouse or retail store are required to collect use taxes27 if the outofstate seller does not collect the use tax it is the buyers obligation to pay the use tax to the buyers home state in practice however voluntary compliance by nonbusiness purchasers is low consequently states have long wanted to be able to require outofstate sellers without physical presence in the state referred to as remote sellers to collect the use tax from the customer and remit it to the customers home state this would apply to all interstate sales whether arranged over the internet or by telephone mail order in person or other means with or without the internet tax moratorium separate congressional action would be needed in order for states to obtain the authority to require outofstate sellers without nexus in the state to collect use taxes from customers at the time of the sale major controversy surrounding the bills to extend the internet tax moratorium was whether congress was willing to include any language that signaled its support for the states effort to have remote sellers collect use taxes on interstate sales some of the bills introduced in the 107th congress to extend the internet tax moratorium did include language addressing the use tax collection issue the moratorium extension bill that was enacted hr 1552 pl 10775 did not however before voting to approve hr 1552 as received from the house the senate debated the enzidorgan amendm ent samdt 2155 to hr 1552 which addressed the sales and use tax collection issue in considerable detail the amendment was tabled by vote of 57 to 43 still both during the debate and after the votes in the senate several senators expressed their intention to pursue an agreement on the sales tax simplification and collection issues raised in the enzidorgan amendment during the added 2 years of the moratorium28 underlying debate over the taxation of internet sales briefly the conflict underlying the debate over whether congress should support state and local taxation of interstate sales conducted over the internet or by other means is as follows many state and local governments are concerned about substantial further erosion of their sales tax base if growing fraction of the economy can operate tax free over the internet29 30 these can be thought of as the consumer states saleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs14 29continued major categories of tangible goods such as some food medicine and clothing and by the operation of taxfree interstate mail order

1992taxes on purchases made by their residents are major source of revenue supporting state and local government services this is more so for states with sales tax but income tax31 there is also digital divide concern that the sales tax will become even more regressive if higher income people have access to taxfree internet shopping while lower income people do not joining in support of taxation are bricksandmortar retailers who are required to collect sales tax from customers and feel it is unfair for them to face competition from internet merchants who are not required to collect the parallel use tax these main street retailers seek level playing field with respect to sales and use taxes32 on the opposite side of the issue businesses engaged in interstate commerce point out the administrative compliance burden they could face if they were subject to the disparate sales and use tax laws filing requirements and tax rates of 7500 now and potentially 30000 authorized state and local taxing jurisdictions joining them in opposition to taxation are those states and localities that expect to benefit more from the growth of internet businesses than they would from being able to collect use taxes on interstate internet sales these can be thought of as the technology producer states in addition states with sales tax have little reason to pursue taxation of internet sales33

remote sellers to collect sales and use taxes on interstate sales role of congress in its 1967 national bellas hess34 decision and again in its 1992 quill decision35 the us supreme court denied states the ability to require seller to collect use taxes on interstate mailorder sales unless the seller had physical presence in the taxing state the court concluded that the complexity of state and local sales tax systems imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce however in its 1992 quill decision the court indicated that congress has the power under the commerce clause of the us constitution to address the issue of grantinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs15 36for additional discussion see crs report rs20577 state sales taxation of internet transactions by john r luckey and crs report rl30667 inter net tax legislation distinguishing issues by nonna noto section on role of congress under the commerce powerstates the authority to require outofstate sellers to collect use taxes on interstate purchases by their residents the court invited the congress to act to date congress has not addressed this issue36 connection to extending the moratorium the bills to extend the internet tax moratorium took one of three basic approaches to the sales and use tax collection issue most extension bills did not address the tax collection issue at all some bills laid out conditions under which congress would or might grant the states authority to require collection offering middle ground some bills included sense of congress provision encouraging continued statebusiness efforts at sales tax simplification simplifying the administration of state and local sales and use taxes is considered prerequisite to asking congress to grant states the authority to require outofstate sellers to collect use taxes from customers on interstate sales this applies whether the sales are arranged in person over the internet by mail order telephone or other means the practical question linked to extending the moratorium is can the states develop and implement sales and use tax system that would not be an undue burden on interstate commerce and if so how long would that take to accomplish often the position taken on granting the states usetax collection authority affected the position taken on how long to extend the internet tax moratorium this link could be present even if the moratorium extension bill did not make explicit reference to the sales and use tax issue some supporters of tax collection on remote sales wanted the extension of the moratorium to be long enough for the states to accomplish meaningful sales tax simplification but not so long that the perception of the internet as taxfree shopping zone became taken for granted or that many sellers would develop dotcom subsidiaries to avoid collecting the sales tax they wanted to keep time pressure on the states to accomplish simplification and on congress to consider the collection issue they generally preferred shorter extension of the moratorium if the bill made mention of the tax collection issue that generally meant supporting an extension of 2 years as in the bill enacted hr 1552 pl 10775 or less those skeptical of the ability of state and local governments to quickly agree upon and implement meaningful sales tax simplification were willing to support longer extension of 4 or 5 years if language addressing tax collection was included in the bill opponents of taxing remote commerce favored longer 4 or 5year if not permanent extension of the moratorium with mention of the sales tax simplification and collection issue this group included opponents of granting stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs16 37the 33 states that were formal voting participants in the streamlined sales

by the streamlined sales tax project sstp the sstp is expected to serve as technical advisory group to the streamlined sales tax implementing states sstis which began to meet at the end of november 2001 the sstp is voluntary cooperative effort among state governments with input from local governments and the private sector as of december 2001 33 states were formal voting participants in the sstp with six other states participati ng as observers37 the sstp formally began its work in march 2000 the project has two main components one is to simplify and modernize the administration of state and local sales and use taxes the other is to identify the computer software and financial transmission system that could be used to collect use taxes on outofstate sales at reasonable cost38 the initial purpose of the streamlined sales tax project was to get the states to simplify their sales tax systems enough that remote outofstate sellers would be willing to collect use taxes on voluntary basis simplification of sales tax administration would benefit instate retailers as well the longerrun hope was that once compliance costs for sellers had been reduced to reasonable level imposing undue burden on interstate commerce congress might be willing to authorize states to require use tax collection by remote sellers without nexus or the supreme court might revise the quill decisions

drafted by the sstp other states approve d the version drafted by the ncsl some states made their own modifications to one of these model laws the states that enacted legislation authorizing participation became the members of the streamlined sales tax implementing states sstis the purpose of the sstis is to finalize an interstate agreement to simplify and modernize sales and use tax administration and then to recommend the agreement to the states for implementation any state that enacts legislation to authorize participation in an interstate agreement either the sstp or the ncsl version may still become voting member of the sstis42 delegates from the sstis met for the first time on november 28 and 29 2001 in salt lake city to elect officials and adopt operating rules the sstis is trying to complete uniform interstate sales tax agreement by the summer of 2002 this would leave time for the sstis to transmit the model agreement to state legislatures for their consideration during the 2003 legislative session before the moratorium extension ends on november 1 2003 during 2000 and 2001 the sstp made progress in reaching agreement on many detailed components involved in designing simplified sales and use tax system nevertheless considerable work still remains to be done by the sstp in specifying details of the multistate simplified sales tax agreement

govt print off 2001finally the simplified system needs to be put into practice by tax administrators and vendors in participating states the states currently have indication whether after all of their efforts to simplify their sales and use tax systems congress will grant them authority to require remote sellers to collect use taxes some would like congress to specify in law the criteria that the states need to meet in order for congress to grant them collection authority on the other side congress currently has assurance about the final outcome of the states sales tax simplification effort consequently even those sympathetic to the states request for collection authority may be reluctant to grant that authority in advance of seeing the actual streamlined sales tax system that emerges from the sstp and sstis efforts by the states bill provisions on granting states tax collection authority most of the bills to extend the internet tax moratorium did not address the sales and use tax collection issue at all provisions addressing sales tax collection issues were included in hr 1552 the bill passed by both the house and senate and enacted as pl 10775 the new law simply extended the prior moratorium by 2 years until november 1 2003 the full house did not address the sales tax collection issue43 the issue received more attention on the senate side in february and march of 2001 senator wyden and senator dorgan respectively each introduced moratorium extension bills that also addressed the issue of granting state the authority to require outofstate sellers to collect and remit use taxes to the buyers home state if that state met certain criteria for simplifying its sales and use tax s 288 wyden would have permanently extended the moratorium on internet access taxes removed the grandfathering protection for existing access taxes and extended the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxes by 5 years s 512 dorgan would have extended both parts of the moratorium and the grandfathering protection for 4 years s 288 and s 512 set somewhat different simplification criteria and substantially different procedures for congress to grant states sales tax collection authority in early october 2001 senators wyden and dorgan each introduced bill for shorter time extension that included only sense of congress provision encouraging state governments and interested business organizations to expedite efforts pursuing simplified tax system that would not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce s 1481 wyden referred to developing streamlined simplified plan for protecting state revenues affected by internet use it wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs19 have extended the moratorium by 2 years until october 21 2003 s 1504 dorgan referred more specifically to developing streamlined sales and use tax system that once approved by congress would allow sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes it would have extended the moratorium by eight months until june 30 2002 substantial efforts were made first in the senate commerce committee and later by senator mike enzi to reach compromise between s 288 and s 512 the first bills introduced by senators wyden and dorgan in midoctober 2001 senator enzi introduced s 1542 and then s 1567 he finally introduced samdt 2155 known as the enzidorgan amendment on the senate floor on november 15 2001 as an amendment in the nature of substitute to hr 1552 the amendment was tabled by vote of 57 to 43 before the senate passed hr 1552 as received from the house the enzidor gan amendment drew upon elements from both s 288 wyden and s 512 dorgan like s 288 samdt 2155 would have made the ban on internet access taxes permanent but like s 512 it would have extended the grandfathering protection for existing internet access taxes and extended the ban on multiple and discriminatory taxes by 4 years and some months until december 31 2005 not 5 years as under s 288 samdt 2155 included procedure for congressional approval based on s 288 but tax simplification criteria from s 512 s 512 dorgan proposed mechanism in the form of multistate compact through which congress would grant participating state the authority to require collection if the state conformed with certain simplification requirements this opportunity for congressional authorization and consent would expire if the compact was not formed before the end of the extended moratorium the compact would take effect automatically once signed by 20 states and sent to congress if congress did not take action to disapprove the compact within 120 days known as negative trigger in contrast s 288 wyden proposed an expedited fasttrack procedure for congressional consideration of joint resolution to give states the authority to require collection of use taxes once states had simplified their tax system this approach reflects the view that congress must retain the authority to review and actively approve any simplification compact before authorizing the states to require remote sellers to collect taxes positive trigger the compromise amendment samdt 2155 enzidorgan included more detailed provisions than s 288 wyden providing expedited procedure for congress to consider joint resolution to give states the authority to require collection of use taxes if the states adequately simplified their sales and use tax systems and adopted an interstate compact again positive trigger like s 512 samdt 2155 gave the states until the end of the extended moratorium to form the compact and required that 20 states sign the compact before it was transmitted to congress for approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31177crs20 44samdt 2155 enzidorg an added criteria 13 and 14 to the 12 sales and

criteria for streamlined sales and use tax system enumerated in s 512 dorgan44 notably while the criteria call for uniform definitions for goods or services they do not call for uniform tax base across the states individual states could still choose which particular goods and services would be included in or exempt from their sales and use tax base45 samdt 2155 also included s 512s sense of congress provision that state and local governments and business should jointly commission study of the cost to all sellers presumably both local and remote of collecting and remitting state and local sales and use taxes under current tax law and under the streamlined system outlined in the bill the purpose of the study is to help determine reasonable government compensation to sellers for

rate could be added to the state rate but there could be variation in the rate charged across local jurisdictions within state in contrast to s 288 samdt 2155 like s 512 provided that remote seller could have the annual option of collecting the actual applicable state and local use tax rate as local seller would as an alternative to collecting single uniform statewide use tax rate furthermore state that adopted the dramatically simplified tax system described in the interstate compact could require the remote seller to collect the actual state and local tax due if the state provided the seller relief from liability for relying on tax rate information provided by the state supporters argue that computer software is or will soon be available to make that feasible at reasonable administrative cost both samdt 2155 and s 512 provided that the uniform tax rate on remote sales in calendar year could be greater than the weighted average of the sales tax rates actually imposed by the state and its local jurisdictions during the prior fiscal year specifically during the 12month period ending on june 30 prior to the calendar year the test criterion was that the uniform average rate would not have yielded greater total assessment of taxes than the total taxes actually assessed during the base period if the uniform rate had actually been applied during the prior fiscal year on all sales subject to state and local sales and use taxes by that state and its local jurisdictions samdt 2155 added some new provisions of its own to address the concern about the bundling of taxable services with taxprotected internet access it defined internet access services to exclude the receipt of content or services other than internet access services to address the concerns about business activity tax nexus it contained sense of congress provision that legislation be enacted by the end of the 107th congress to determine the factors establishing business activity nexus the
