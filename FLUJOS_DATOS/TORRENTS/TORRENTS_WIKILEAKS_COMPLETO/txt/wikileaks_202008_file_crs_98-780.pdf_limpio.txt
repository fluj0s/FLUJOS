circumstances allows its members to debate issues for as long as they want further the senate has few ways either to limit the duration of debates or to bring filibusters extended talkathons to an end for instance senator may offer nondebatable motion to table or kill an amendment or he or she might ask unanimous consent to restrict debate on pending matters the senate has one formal rulerule xxiifor imposing limits on the further consideration of an issue called the cloture rule for closure of debate rule xxii became part of the senates rulebook in 1917 and has been amended several times since under its current formulation rule xxii requires cloture petition signed by 16 senators to be presented to the senate two days later and one hour after the senate convenes the presiding officer is required to order live quorum call often waived by unanimous consent and after its completion to put this question to the membership is it the sense of the senate that debate shall be brought to close if threefifths of the entire senate membership 60 of 100 votes in the affirmative cloture is invoked and the senate is subject to postcloture procedures that will eventually end the debate and bring the clotured question bill amendment or motion for example to vote to end debate on measure or motion to amend senate rules requires approval by twothirds of the senators present and voting if cloture is invoked under the terms of rule xxii then senate floor activity is thereafter subject to variety of conditions and constraints seve ral of the main postcloture features include g345g342g556g10g152g158g155g561g22g146g150g142g561g5g138g153g561 thirty hours of further consideration is permitted on the clotured question with time used for such things as rollcall votes or quorum calls charged against the 30hour cap as senate precedents state the time used for roll call votes quorum calls reading of amendments points of order and inquiries to and responses by the chair and the like is charged against the 30 hours therefore it is quite possible that the total debate by senators could be far less than 30 hours the 30hour period may be extended if threefifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn agree to the increase g17g151g142g556g10g152g158g155g561g152g143g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g18g142g155g561g21g142g151g138g157g152g155g561 under cloture each senator is entitled to an hour of debate on first come first served basis senators may yield all or portions of their one hour to floor manager or party leader but neither may be yielded more than two additional hours any senator may yield back to the chair some or all of his 1 hour for debate under cloture say the precedents but such yielding would not reduce the total time available for consideration of the clotured matter g18g155g142g556g8g146g149g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 only amendments that have been filed before the cloture vote may be considered once cloture is invoked firstdegree amendments must be filed by 100 pm on the day after the filing of the cloture petition seconddegree amendments may be filed until at least one hour prior to the start of the cloture vote as rule xxii explains except by unanimous consent amendment shall be proposed after the vote to bring the debate to close unless it had been submitted in writing to the journal clerk by 1 oclock l

amendment in the first degree and unless it had been so submitted at least one hour prior to the beginning of the cloture vote if an amendment in the second degree g20g152g149g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g142g156g146g141g146g151g144g561g17g143g143g146g140g142g155g561 under cloture the presiding officer has authority that he or she does not have during regular senate proceedings for example on his or her initiative the presiding officer may rule outof order dilatory motions or amendments including quorum calls the chair also has the authority to count to determine the presence of quorum during regular senate sessions the chair is obligated under senate rule vi if senator suggests the absence of quorum to forthwith direct the secretary to call the roll g16g152g561g16g152g151g144g142g155g150g138g151g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 the senate does not have general rule of germaneness for amendments however once cloture is invoked all amendments and debate are to be germane to the clotured proposal senate precedents state that the chair may take the initiative and rule amendments out of order as not being germane without point of order being made and when obviously nongermane the chair may rule the amendment out of order even before it has been read or stated by the clerk senate precedents add that under cloture one of the tests of germaneness is whether the amendment limits or restricts the provisions contained in the bill if it is clearly restrictive it would be held germane g18g152g146g151g157g156g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g561g138g151g141g561g3g153g153g142g138g149g156g561g16g152g157g561g6g142g139g138g157g138g139g149g142g561 rule xxii states that points of order includi ng questions of relevancy and appeals from the decision of the presiding officer shall be deci ded without debate senate precedents make plain that the chair occasionally has held appeals to be dilatory but precedents also underscore that the right to appeal is basic right of each senator and would be held dilatory only in the most extraordinary circumstances worth noting is that on one occasion in 1977 the chair denied senator the right to make point of order g22g145g142g561g23g151g143g146g151g146g156g145g142g141g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561 the invocation of cloture on measure or matter means as stated in rule xxii that it shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of senate precedents buttress this point by adding that the adoption of cloture motion on measure prohibits the consideration of any other business except that which is transacted by unanimous consent
