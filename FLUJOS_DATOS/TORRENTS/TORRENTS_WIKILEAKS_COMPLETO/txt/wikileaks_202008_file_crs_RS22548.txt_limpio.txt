provisions were in effect after its renewal under atpdea between 2001 and 2007 us imports from the region receiving atpa preferential duty treatment increased from 17 billion 17 of total us imports from atpa countries to 123 billion 58 of total us imports from atpa countries leading us atpa imports are crude petroleum oils refined copper other petroleum oils fresh roses and sweaters and other knitted or crocheted apparel atpa impact the trade effects of atpa on the us economy are minimal because the amount of us trade with the region is low the value of dutyfree us imports under atpa accounts for about 07 of total us imports or 01 of the us gross domestic product gdp 2006 us international trade commission usitc study on the atpa states 1 the additional products under atpdea included petroleum and petroleum products certain footwear tuna in flexible containers and certain watches and leather products atpdea also authorized the president to grant dutyfree treatment to us imports of certain apparel articles if the articles met domestic content rules crs4 that the overall effect of atpaeligible imports on the us economy was negligible in 20052 the study also states that certain apparel items provided the largest gain in us consumer surplus from lower prices possibly adversely affecting some domestic producers other us industries which may have experienced displacement by atpa imports include asparagus freshcut roses and other flowers effects on andean countries the overall effects of the atpa on the economies of the bolivia colombia ecuador and peru are difficult to measure precisely because of the challenges involved in isolating the effects of atpa from other variables that affect the economy national economic policies in the region and investor confidence may have larger effect on economic trends the programs effect also depends on the us market share of countrys exports the larger the share the more significant the effect may be ecuador and colombia have the highest market share of exports to the united states the impact of the atpa on coca production in andean countries is unclear the usitc study states that atpa combined with us economic assistance through alternative development programs3 may have contributed to the us counternarcotics httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22548 effort and had small indirect effect on illicit crop eradication and crop substitution in the atpa region the study also states that increased production of atpaeligible exports in 2005 helped support job growth in certain economic sectors including the flower and asparagus sectors and the textile and apparel industries farmers in the four andean countries also began exporting nontraditional crops such as artichokes beans broccoli grapes and other fruits and vegetables and their preparations4 the rapid rise in the value of imports from atpa countries in recent years was primarily due to an increase in the value of imports of petroleumrelated products which resulted from higher oil prices imports of mineral fuels and oils accounted for 67 of us imports under atpa in 2007 us imports of copper accounted for 8 of atpa imports while imports of knit articles of clothing and live plantscut flowers accounted for 7 and 5 of atpa imports respectively increases in certain us atpaeligible imports such as asparagus and cut flowers may have helped support job growth and expanded alternatives to workers who may have otherwise engaged in drugcrop production possible sectoral effects the usitc study identified the asparagus and cut flower industries as two us sectors that had estimated displacements of five percent or more due to the atpa us imports of all fresh or chilled asparagus increased significantly between 2001 and 2005 from 1169 million to 2139 million peru the leading exporter of asparagus in the world accounted for 51 of total us asparagus imports in 2005 us asparagus imports from peru increased from 473 million in 2001 to 1099 million in 2005 an increase of 132 although most asparagus imports from 2 united states international trade commission usitc the impact of the andean trade preference act twelfth

the andean region enter the us market when overall us production is low us producers have been affected by lower prices and many growers have gone out of business as result5 on the other hand us consumers have benefitted from greater availability of fresh asparagus throughout the year and from lower retail prices in 2005 the peruvian asparagus industry provides jobs for an estimated 60000 workers and is considered to be an important part of overall economic development in peru the peruvian asparagus and vegetables institute ipeh estimates that nearly 40 of the workers in the asparagus industry come from areas that formerly supplied workers to illegal coca cultivation6 asparagus imports have been eligible for dutyfree treatment since 1992 another sector in which us producers have been affected is freshcut flowers atpa countries supplied 96 of the total value of us imports of freshcut roses and 89 of us imports of chrysanthemums in 2005 almost all imports in these two categories enter the united states dutyfree under atpa the major supplier from the region is colombia followed by ecuador the united states is the principal export market for these products accounting for 81 of the total value of colombian exports and 60 of ecuadorian exports in 2005 colombias association of flower exporters estimates that the industry provides for 83300 direct jobs and 75000 indirect jobs and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22548 that it has the highest concentration of employees per hectare in colombias agriculture sector7 lowpriced imports of freshcut flowers may have been part of the reason for the decreasing number of commercial us cutflower growers since the atpdea was implemented investment in the textiles and apparel industries has increased in the andean region textiles and apparel production has been leading source of economic activity particularly in peru and colombia peru has been the leading andean textile and apparel supplier to the united states for the past several years the sector employs 150000 workers directly and 375000 indirectly in peru economic analysts in peru attribute the growth in perus textile and apparel exports directly to the trade preferences granted by atpdea stating that growth was due to increased demand and incremental investments that created new jobs8 in bolivia colombia and ecuador the textile and apparel sectors also are significant source of economic activity and employment industry representatives from the region have been concerned about losing atpdea preferences because of the importance of the united states as an export market policy implications supporters of atpa argue that the program should continue to reinforce the us commitment to the alternative development counternarcotics strategy while critics argue that unilateral trade programs are ineffective and that trade preferences should not be extended to countries that do not support us foreign and trade policies some 5 usitc p 312 6

colombian flowers make bouquet bucks see httpwwwbuyusagov 8 usitc report pp 331 and 332 crs6 industry representatives in the united states believe that the atpa has lowered prices of certain products forcing us producers to compete with lowercost andean imports in the andean countries atpa supporters state that the program has had positive impact in the region by increasing investor confidence creating thousands of jobs in alternative sectors and preventing organized crime and reducing the production of drugs they believe that maintaining confidence in the trade relationship with the united states is key to the longterm stability of the region major policy issues in the 110th congress have been related to the question of renewing the atpa program either on short or longterm basis or allowing the program to expire for some or all of the countries the congressional debate surrounding the length of atpa renewal for bolivia and ecuador is largely based on the status of us overall relations with both countries for colombia there is the question of the pending uscolombia free trade agreement fta implementing legislation for us colombia fta was introduced on april 8 2008 but it is unclear whether or how congress will consider implementing legislation for the agreement9 in the case of peru trade preferences will become permanent upon implementation of the usperu fta pl 110138 implementing legislation for the usperu free trade agreement was httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22548 enacted in december 2007 but the agreement has not yet been implemented10 some members of congress believe that there is reason to consider longterm extension of atpa for countries such as bolivia and ecuador that are not supportive of us trade and foreign policies others believe that if the trade preferences are not extended the united states and the andean countries risk losing some of the economic progress that has been achieved over the sixteenyear life of the program some members have argued that renewing atpa is pragmatic means to urge president morales of bolivia and president correa of ecuador to maintain openmarket and democratic policies11 under pl 110436 atpa trade preferences for bolivia would end after six months unless the president of the united states determines that bolivia has met program eligibility criteria the office of the united states trade representative published public notice in september 2008 proposing to suspend bolivias atpa benefits because of bolivian president evo morales recent actions on narcotics cooperation12 the treatment for ecuador is different than for bolivia because preferences would be automatically extended for ecuador unless the us president finds it in violation of the eligibility criteria and findings of those violations are considered very rare13 9 for more information see crs report rl34470 the uscolombia free trade agreement economic and political implications by m angeles villarreal 10 for more
