previous act had expired the current 6year authorization the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 and pl 105 206 was significantly different than its predecessors in several respects most notably it provided for dramatic increase in funding for federal surface transportation programs this was in large part the result of successful effort to link the revenue stream for the highway trust fund to significant increases in spending for th highway highway safety and transit programs tea21 provided 40 more funding than the previous 6year program authorization furthermore mechanis m created by tea21 revenue aligned budget authority raba has provided the federa l highway program with an additional 91 billion in funding over tea21s sixyear authorization period although difficulties with this mechanism in the last session of congress will make raba reauthorization issue in the coming debate from the publics perspective the surface transportation reauthorization is taking place against the backdrop of growing c oncern about congestion and sprawl in urbanized areas and increased concern about maintaining acce ss to the national system in rural areas the congressional bate that will take place as part of the highway and transit program reau thorization process in the 108th congress is shaping up primarily as debate bout money given the large increase in funding made available by tea21 there appears to be an expectation in some quarters that the reauthorization under discussion should also provide for large increase in funding the economy the return of the deficit and other policy concerns however make such large increase problematic the money question aside there appears to be very little interest in making major changes to the overall structure of th highway highway safety and transit programs rather the interest appears to be in tweaking these programs to allow spending for some additional activities and perhaps adding some new

fund this includes monies for highways highway safety and wide range of other activities transit refers to federal mass transportation programs which includes aid to bus and subway systems among others 2at the time of this writing the second emergency supplemental appropriation for fy2002 had eliminated the raba adjustment for fy2003 this situation may still be subject to change as part of the incomp lete fy2003 appropriations processhighway and transit program reauthorization the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 which expires at the end of fy2003 provided dramatic in crease in funding for federal surface transportation programs this was in large part the result of successful effort to link the revenue stream for the highway trus t fund to significant increases in spending for the highway highway safety and tran sit programs tea21 authorized funding at level of almost 2180 billion for the pe riod fy1998 through fy2003 of this total 177 billion was provided for broad ra nge of highway and highway safety programs and just under 410 billion wa s provided for transit programs1 the total tea21 authorization was about 40 more than the amount that had been authorized in the previous 6year program au thorization istea intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 pl 102240 of the total tea21 authorization 1980 billion was guaranteed by the fixed limitation on obligations to be described later that is these funds were not subject to reduction as part of the annual budgetappropria tions process further mechanism created by tea21 revenue aligned budget author ity raba has provided the federal highway program with an additional 91 billion over the authorization period2 from the publics perspective the surface transportation reauthorization is taking place against the backdrop of growing c oncern about congestion and sprawl in urbanized areas and increased concern bout maintaining access to the national transportation system in rural areas the congressional bate that will take place as part of the highway and transit prog ram reauthorization process in the 108th congress is shaping up primarily as debate about money given the large increase in funding made available by tea21 there appears to be an expectation in some quarters that the reauthorization under discussion shoul d also provide for large increase in funding at the time tea21 was passed c onfluence of circumstances had provided for considerable boost to highway trust fund revenues unfortunately for those seeking extensive new funding similar c onfluence of events appears likely during the next year as result much of the discussion in the coming months will turn on whether significant additional funds can be found fo r federal surface tran sportation programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs2 3this section provides brief overview of th organization of the federal highway program for greater detail see httpwwwfhwadotgovtea21indexhtmor whether funding for these programs w ill be limited to the modest growth forecast for the highway trust fund over the next 6 years if new funds can be found many of the programmatic and policy issues discussed in this report are likely to be considered in earnest at the same time additional new funding would likely lessen potential disputes about fund allocations be tween states and between rural suburban and urban interests without significant new funding sources competition for the existing pot of funds will almost surely ensu amongst the various state regional and programmatic stakeholders the money question aside there appears to be very little interest in making major changes to the overall structure of th highway highway safety and transit programs rather the interest appears to be in tweaking these programs to allow spending for some additional activities and perhaps adding some new stand alone programs or consolidating several traffic safety programs into single program among the issues likely to be considered are allowing states greater flexibility in how they use their transportation funds re tention of the existing highway trust fund funding framework established by tea21 including modification of the annual adjustment process provided for by raba financial assistance for physical infrastructure security streamlining of environmental evaluations required by the project approval process new categorical grant program for highway safety and an increased focus on reducing drunk dr iving and increasing seat belt use highway program structure3 the federalaid highway pr ogram is fundamentally state run program funds are provided annually to each state department of trans portation or equivalent to construct and maintain signated system of roads known as the federalaid highway system the modern federal aid highway program dates to the 1956 enactment of legislation that provided for the construction of the interstate highway system and created the highway trust fund to finance its construction the program has been reauthorized and expanded on numer ous occasions during the last four and half decades core apportioned programs most highway funding is reserved for five major programs which are usually referred to as the core programs they along with the minimum guarantee account for the vast majority of highway spe nding 86 of the fy2003 authorized amount these programs are the national highwa system program nhs the interstate maintenance program im the surface transportation program stp the bridge replacement and rehabilitation program and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq each of these programs provides funding for specific segments of the federalaid hi ghway system andor other statutorily enunciated activities eg congestion relief projects using cmaq funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs3 4this section provides brief overview of the distribution of tea21 funding amongst eligible transportation programs additional details about individual programs can be found at httpwwwdotgovtea21although it does not itself provide direct spending for highways the minimum guarantee program which will be discussed in greater detail in moment could also be thought of as core program because it provides additional funds for each of the five core programs the minium guarantee in fact is the largest highway program in the fy2003 authorization for example it provides fully 20 of all funding nhs and stp are the next two largest prog rams by far accounting for 165 and 193 of total funding respectively funds for th programs are apportioned to the states on an annual basis using formulas found in tea21 as result they are sometimes referred to as the pportioned programs in addition to the core programs there are couple of additional and much smaller apportioned pr ograms metropolitan planning and the recreational trails program tea21 also sets some formulas within the formulas this is most notably the case for stp for which 10 must be setaside for both transportation enhancements and safety and creates sepa rate substate distri bution formula for the remaining funds allocated discretionary programs all remaining highway programs are subject to allocations that are based on criteria established in highway authoriza tion and appropriation w andor subject to congressional earmarking alt hough all of the programs in this category are smaller than the core programs there are nonethe less some programs with significant funding the largest allocated program is for congressionally ma ndated high priority projects this program which has an fy2003 authorization of almost 178 billion is reserved for projects specifically design ated in tea21 other relatively good sized programs in the allocated category are the federal lands program the national corridor planning and development and c oordinated border infra structure program corbor the interstate maintenance discretionary program the bridge discretionary program and the trans portation and community and system pilot preservation program tcsp crs contacts john fischer and bob kirk tea21 funding levels4 tea21 created the largest surface transportation program in us history for the most part however it did not create ne w programs rather it continued most of the highway and transit programs that originated in its immediate predecessor legislation istea progra mmatically tea21 can be viewed as refinement and update of the istea process there are few new funding initiatives in the act such as the border infrastructure program but the vast majority of funding is reserved for continuing programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs4 the funding system for highways and tr ansit is complex nd will be discussed in greater detail later in this report termi nology is defined in appendix 1 table 1 shows the actual amounts authorized by tea21 at time of passage this was accomplished by providing for specific levels of funding in the act these limitations on obligations also known as the obliga tion limitation or ob limit were attributed to specific programs in the parlance of the act these are the so called spending guarantees additional funds outside of the guarantee were also authorized but these required specific action through the appropr iations process before they could be spent table 2 shows actual appropriati ons during the life of tea21 as can be seen the limitations on obligations have been spent andor exceeded by virtue of the addition of revenue aligned budget

minimum guarantee since the 1980s few issues have raised such heated debate as the persistent arguments over how closely federalaid high way program payments to the individual states should match the amount of federal highway taxes each state pays into the highway account of the highway trust fund the issue is commonly referred to as the donordonee issue the overall issue for congress is how to structure and maintain federalaid highway program that meets federal highway policy objectives and still provide for as equitable as possibl return to the states on each tax dollar the states highway users pay into the highway account of the trust fund donor donee issues have generally surfaced in th context of the broader debate over the periodic reauthorization of federal surf ace transportation programsas was the case for tea21 this legislative context is im portant because it means that any equity adjustment provisions must fit with the overall compromises that create reauthorization bill that can pass both houses of congress tea21 pl 105178 included number of equity provisions which emerged from the reauthorization deba historically significant characteristic of the debate has been the importance of regional interests typically this pitted growing southern midwestern and s outhwestern donor states ag ainst northeastern pacific coast and sparsely populated western donee states also in play were different philosophies of the appropriate role of th federal government visavis the states eg is the intent of the federal highwa program creation of national system of roads or revenue sharing pr ogram operated for the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs6 5 for information on state distribution see highway statistics annual for the appropriate year wwwfhwadotgovohimhs00fe221htmminimum guarantee5 tea21 included state minimum guarantee mg program with three major components 1 guaranteed base sharetea21 guarant ees each state percentage share of the total program defined as all the apportioned programs interstate maintenance program im national highway system program nhs surface transportation program stp highwa bridge replacement and rehabilitation program congestion mitigation and air quality program cmaq metropolitan planning recreational tra ils program appalachian development highway system program and minimum guarantee as we ll as high priority projects 2 905 guaranteed return on paymentstea21 guaranteed each state minimum share return of 905 of its payments to the trus t fund if states base share is less than 905 then the share is adjusted upward til the 905 share is reached the money to raise shares to 905 is provide d by squeezing down the percentages but not the dollar amounts of those states that are above the minimum 3 1 million mg minimumeach state is guaranteed that it will receive at least 1 million in mg funds in practice this 905 return is not absolu on yeartoyear basis there are several reasons for this first there are significant concerns about the internal revenue service data mostly extrapolated from state fuel tax data that are used to determine the annual state re venue contribution these data were not previously envisioned as basis for the formula distribution of fede ral funds some states have already indicated that they believe the data undercounts their contribution to the highway account second there are administra tive take downs for certain items such as fhwa operating costs that are part of the total limitation on obligations that will be unavailable during the state apportionmen t process finally the act requires the use of the most recent data in its annua l program formula distributions the most recent data normally lags two years behind the year for which the minimum guarantee calculation is being made also many of the variables used in the calculation have changed during the life of th act especially as result of the 2000 census as program distribution changed the role of the minimum allocation process has grown in relative importance formulas during the past two reauthorization cycles there has been considerable discussion about the structure of the form ulas associated with the core highway programs formulas clearly influence how federal highway dollars will be distributed to the states tea 21 made changes to some program formulas that at the time were perceived as bene fitting donor states for example the act provided new formula categories that were based on st ates percent share of annual payments to the trust fund for both the im and stp programs actual formula components however remain somewhat mysterious even to those familiar with the highway program by way of example nhs funds arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs7 distributed on the basis of four factors 25 based on lane miles on principal arterial routes excluding the interstate system 35 based on vehicle miles traveled on principal arterial routes excluding the in terstate system 30 based on diesel fuel used on highways and 10 based on total lane miles on principal arterial highways divided by the states total population in addition before the formula distribution for nhs is determined 05 of total combined nhs and im funds is reserved for each state as minimum apportionment as can be seen easily from the discussi on above the formulas in play during reauthorization are complicated the data in the formulas is publically available but in practice it is not practicable for congressional committees and agencies to run endless what if permutati ons of possible formula mode ls as result the fhwa is regarded as the sole arbiter of how chan ges to formulas affect distribution of funds and typically only its computer runs are viewed as accurate during reauthorization discussions although much focus has been placed on fo rmulas especially as part of the donordonee debate the rea lity is that formulas are ss critical as part of the funding distribution debate than they might appear there are couple of reasons for this first and foremost the formulas have to correspond to any minimum guarantee level found in the bill if the minimum funding guarantee for states is set at 905 for example as it is in tea21 this has the effect of reserving at least this amount for core programs second in or der for each state to reach the minimum guarantee level there must be separate pot of money available to fhwa to make up annual differences in how the form ulas are applied as result the reauthorization process more or less dictates that the minimum guarantee sets the amount of total funding available for pportionment by formula hence the minimum guarantee influences the formula factors andor the minimum guarantee program setaside not the other way around during the tea21 authorization debate what many observers had predicted would be major battle between donor nd donee states was resolved relatively amicably the taxpayer relief act of 1997 shifted revenues ge nerated by the 43 cent deficit reduction gas tax to the trust fund congress therefore was able to provide for large increases in highway fundi ng for all states the extra money made the donordonee debate less urgent to the donor states as the tea21 authorization entered its final year f y2003 however the donordonee state issue has resurfaced donordonee issues in the reauthorization debate donor state arguments the basic argument is relatively straightforward call for equity or fairness donor state dvocates generally contend that for too many years they have been subsidizing the repair and improveme nt of donee state infrastructure especially the older highway infrastructure in the northeast the southern donor states have b een fastgrowth areas relative to many of the donee states and argue that their needs are just as gr eat or greater secondary argument for some of these states is that they are generally more depende nt on roads and do not benefit from federal transit spending to the degree that some donee states in particular new york do fi nally some of the donor state advocates argue that withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs8 the completion of the interstate highwa system the rationale for the donordonee disparity in federal highway funding is so weakened th at the federalaid highway programs should be strea mlined or eliminated and the fhwa should be little more than conduit for block grants to the states donee state arguments donee state advocates generally argue that fairness should not be separa ted from needs donee stat argue that their position as donees is justifiable because of the age of their infrastructure especially in the northeast the high cost of improving alr eady heavily congested urban roads and the limited financial resources in large sparsely populated west ern states donee state advocates have also argued that when ll federal programs ar considered not just the federalaid highway prog ram northeastern states ar often donors while southern states are often donee states donee state supporters also argued that southern and midwestern states spend less of their stat and locally derived resources on highways than the donee states and chide the donor st ates for pleading for federal funds when they are not willing to up their own resources finally donee states argue that it is unreasonable to expect fhwa to become little more than tax collector for the states they argue that there are needs that are federal rather than state and that national highway network cannot be based on stat or regional boundaries reauthorization options raising the minimum guarantee some state departments of transportation and road building interests have suggested increasing the minimum state share from 905 to 95 to achieve this level authorizers would probably have to make the 95 return on payments to the trust fund their starting point and reexamine the federalaid highway programs with an eye toward adjusting or eliminating programs or progra m features to meet this goal some proponents argue that bringing the discretionary high way programs under the minimum guarantee umbrella would make achieving higher minimum guarantee percentage easier some of these programs howev er were designed to meet inherently national needs and might not be easily divided among all the states and still meet the programs goals changing the base shares perhaps the most straightforward option would be to adjust up the donor state base shares and adjust down the shares of the donee states however donee states will almost certainly resist any attempt to eliminate or significantly reduce either their base shares or fundi ng totals ironically assuming the money were av ailable donor states might actually get more money in absolute terms by leaving the base shares as they are and accept as they did in tea21 the benefits of larger minimum guarantee apportionments more money large increase in revenues to the trust fund would probably defuse the donordonee issue as happened in the last reauthorization by providing more money to all the states given th current economic and budget environment this would probably require si gnificant tax increases or redirection of existing tax revenues to the trust fund as the next segment of this report will discuss finding these funds will probably be

congressional research service transportation fuel taxe s and legislative issues crs report rs20281 by bernard gelb highway and transit finance highway trust fund origins the highway trust fund consists of two separate accounts hi ghway and transit which are sometimes mistakenly referred to as separate trus t funds in practice the highway account and the transit account are discussed as though they were separate entities with the highway trust fund be ing synonymous with the highway account the highway trust fund is the oldest and largest of the transportation trust funds the fund was created by separate revenue title in the federalaid highway act of 1956 1956 act pl 84627 the 1956 act provided funding for construction of the now virtually complete dwight d eise nhower system of inte rstate and defense highways in addition the 1956 act provided some funding for other federal highway programs over the last 40 plus years the highwa trust fund and the federal programs it supports have been changed numerous times6 in almost every instance congress has chosen to expand the scope of the federal highway program at various times over the same period congress has also chosen concomitantly to increase the revenue stream into the trust fund by raising federa l excise taxes on motor fuels the most recent change in the structure of the federal highway program occurred as part of tea21 which reauthorized the trust fund revenue system through fy2005 the transit account was created by the surface transportation assistance act of 1982 pl 97424 the transit account gave th transit industry consistent federal funding source for capital spending on new and rehabilitated infra structure and for other purposes such as operating assistance funding the highway trust fund is financed by sales taxes on tires trucks buses and trailers as well as truck usage taxes but approximately 90 of trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels7 the majority of the motor fuel revenue dedicated to the trust fund is derived fro m an 184 cents per gallon tax on gasoline of which 183 cents is dedicated directly to the highway trust fund the highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 1544 cents of the tax and the transit account receives the revenue generated by 286 cents of the tax the remaining 01 cents goes into the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs10 8for more information see us library of congress congressional research service highway finance rabas doubleedged sword crs report rs21164 by john w fischertrust fund policy changes made by tea21 tea21 changed the way the highway trust fund relates to the federal unified budget in two ways first by creating new budget categories and second by setting statutory limitations on obligations the act amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit the act furthe r amended the budget process by creating statutory level for the limitation on obliga tions in each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 in addition tea21 provided mechan ism raba to adjust these amounts in the highway account but not the transit account so as to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in highway generated revenues raba issu will be discussed in greater detail later in this report the net effect of the changes was to set predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit progra ms referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee these categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the use of funds assign ed to these categories for any other purpose these so called firewalls were viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of funding fo r highway and transit progra ms additional funds above the firewall level could be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriati ons process but for the most part this has not occurred trust fund structural issues maintaining the tea21 budget structure the current trust fund regime was created over the objections of many members of the budg et and appropriations committees in both the house and the sena although some members of these same committees have indicated support for the existing highwaytransit trust fund budget accounts there remain members unhappy with the restrictions that they believe tea21 places on what they view as the historical discretion of the appropriations process the transportation community believes that continuation of the link between revenues and spending created by tea21 is essential they view the system created as step forward in guaranteeing conti nued substantive federal role in the provision of surface transportation infrastructure from the perspective of supporters of th current trust fund budgetary system the system might need little tweaking especially as regards raba otherwise it is their hope that the structural issues that domin ated the tea21 debate will be absent during the upcoming reaut horization debate reforming revenue aligned budget authority raba8 as already has been noted tea21 provides link between the highway generate d revenues that flowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs11 9there is general acceptance of the idea that there are significant unmet surface transportation capital infrastructure needs there are however numerous questions about its measurement the fhwa and the federal transit administration fta needs studies of the last few years are viewed as much improved in this regard over the studies done decade ago questions still arise as to how needs are determined how the costs associated with these needs are derived and how state w ants are separated from actual state needs as result the issue of highway and trans it system conditions and needs is complex and beyond the scope of this paper additional information can be

understanding that highway funds would be reduced if there was reduction in trus t fund revenue this situa tion was viewed as unlikely however as revenue growth into the trus t fund has increased continuously during the life of the trust fund the first raba adjustment occurred in fy2000 between fy2000 and fy2002 raba provided almost 9 billion in add itional funding for designated highway programs the raba adjustment in the fy2003 budget however negative 43 billion surprised even those who expected small decline in raba as result of the recession that began in 2001 the 43 billi on negative raba would have resulted in an actual year over year decline of 86 billion in federa l highway assistance provided to the states in simple terms this yearoveryear drop in the program was more than congress was willing to allow as part of the fy 2002 second emergency supplemental bill pl 107206 the raba adjustment for fy2003 was eliminated this means that fhwa spending for fy2003 is now set at 277 billion which is still considerably below the 318 billion provided in fy2002 efforts to raise the amount to the fy2002 level continue pending congressiona l completion of consideration of fy2003 appropriations legislation the events of the last year have created interest in amending the raba mechanism during the reauthorization deba to reduce very large annual swings in raba adjustments there are also some who would like to see the possibility of negative raba adjustments eliminated entirely number of mechanisms that would smooth out raba are under discu ssion these involve primarily technical changes such as changing the data used in the raba calculation revenue raising proposals much of the debate about the need fo r new revenues focuses on the concept of unmet

advocating major structural changes in the federal highway and tr ansit programs are advocating an increase in funding comparable to that in tea21 which was 40 plus larger then its predecessor istea they do not however have r eady source of funds to accommodate this increase many but not all in the trans portation community are reluctant to seek fuel tax increases at this time they are concerned that the bush administration will be reluctant to support tax increases and they are concerned that the same sentiment exists in congress as result there are number of possible revenue raising ideas under discussion that are discussed below increasing the federal fuels tax the american road and transportation builders association artba is the one organization actively promoting an increase in the federal fuels tax10 its proposal two cents make s sense would raise the federal fuels tax two cents per year during the life of the next reauthorization according to artba raising the tax by 8 cents would raise an additional 17 billion for highways and transit this in artbas view would go long way to meeting the unmet needs of the system few other transportation organizations have come out in active support of artbas plan most other groups are cerned that the political climate might not be right for tax increase at this time at least one member nator voinovich has taken public position in favor of federal fuels tax increase redirecting portion of the gas ohol tax 25 cents to the trust fund and increasing trust fund r eceipts by an am ount equivalent to the existing gasohol exemption 53 cents as part of federal policy to promote the use of gasohol as substitute for gasoline gasohol has been exempt from portion of the federal fuel s tax usually 53 cents per gallon in addition 25 cents of the tax levied on gasohol based fuels s been deposited directly into the us treasurys general funds from the perspec tive of the transportation community these factors are depriving the trust fund of income that it deserves gasohol users after all use the highway system and in this view ar not paying their fair share for its upkeep and improvement according to some estimates transferri ng the 25 cents to the trust fund would net the fund 700 million per year crediting the trust fund with the equivalent of the 53 cent exemption would result in an additional 15 billion11 this 22 billion

increase the overall deficit will be greeted with certain amount of caution and potential opposition diverting the 25 cen ts is straightforward decision about the appropriate destination fo r these

to such move paying interest on highway account unexpended balances all us treasury managed trust funds with the ex ception of the highway trust fund receive interest payments on their une xpended balances one of the changes made as result of tea21 was to stop paying interest on th unexpended balance in the highway trust fund the rationale behind this decision wa s the creation of raba which is supposed to reduce growth in the unexpended bala nce by making funds more immediately available for highway projects for number of reasons that are beyond th scope of this report the unexpended balance in the highway trust fund has continued to grow beit at much slower rate than it did in the years prior to tea21 inte rest payments could be lucrative for the trust fund according to the

whole issue of paying interest on trust funds is controversial subject interest payments are essen tially intergovernmental fund tr ansfers the federal funds needed to pay interest do not represen t new revenues for the federal treasury proponents of paying interest on the highway trust fund belie ve it is only fair for the treasury to pay for the use of money derive d by special purpose revenues in the same way bank pays interest on savings accounts opponents of this practice however believe that such payments only raise the co st of government in general and that all federal revenues should be treated the same regardless of how they are collected indexing the fuels tax depending on the source of the estimate one cent increase in the fuel tax will add between 13 billion and 15 billion to the trust fund on an annual basis supporters of this idea believe that th trust fund should be indexed to the consumer price index c pi or some other measure of national economic growth to allow reve nues to the trust fund to keep pace with inflation over the last decade indexing would likely have added few cents to the fuel tax with ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs14 concomitant increase in

unlikely in the current economic and political climate aashto believes this program could leverage large tion of the predicted unmet need for federal highway nd transit construction funds the proposal is not entirely without fe deral component as it suggests that the budgetary costs of the program arising fro m the provision of tax credits be derived from source such as indexing of the fede ral

those already associated with existing innovative finance programs which are discussed in the next section of this report long term viability of the trust fund system many observers are concerned that the funding uncertainties cr eated by last years raba debate and increasing interest in identifying alternativ power sources in the auto industry eg fuel cells and hybrid power should alert congress and the transportation industry to the fact that its longstanding trust fund re venue sources should be reviewed this is especially true in terms of gasohol if none of the gasohol pr ovisions described above are adopted if as expected gasohol use increases the lower tax levels on this fuel will cause trust fund revenues to decline on relative basi s even if overall fuel use increases there is growing recognition of this problem but specific suggestions as to how the long term health of the trust fund could be ensured are few in number some observers now support provision in the r

piece of legislation introduced in the 107th congress calls for such commission14 new funding much of the lobbying in preparation fo r reauthorization is as shown above predicated on the belief that some signifi cant level of new fundi ng can be identified for the highway highway safety and trans it programs given the existing state of the economy and concerns about the costs asso ciated with the war on terrorism and possible war with iraq such conc lusion however is far from foregone if none of the revenue raising proposals discussed above are adopted income to the trust funds is still predicted to increase according to one estimate the additional income available for the trust fund during th 6year reauthorization could be between 10 billion and 176 billion this increase however is modest by comparison with the program growth experience during tea21 in addition this increase is subject to revision and is closely relate d to the fate of the national economy during the expected 6year reauthorization period15 this modest increase will not provide the funds that many highway program advocates view as ssential to improving highway and transit infrastructure this is especially true in the current environment with states facing their own budget crises the most significant potential problem resultant from new funding scenario is the likelihood of an enhanced donordon ee struggle that might very well spill over from the highway program into the transit program there also would likely be enhanced competition between programma tically focused interest groups eg highway safety interests could seek growth in safety related set asides within existing programs stp this competition for scarce resources could in the extreme divert attention from any of the many new programmatic initia tives under discussion and change the whole tenor of the reauthorization debate crs contact john fischer highway program issues flexibility flexibility as used in the context of

wwwfhwadotgovtea21factsheetstransferhtmtransit16 these conditions are also known as transferability provisions increased funding flexibility has been an important part of the last two highway reauthorizations tea21 and istea and has been seen as an essential element of the planning provisions included in each act there are statutory limits on how much funding in any given program can be transferred to another activity there are also additional rules preventing certain types of program transfers in some cases th limitations are the result of setasides or other features of pa rticular programs states and localities have usually sought the widest possible latitude for transferability the authors of highway and transit legislation however have believed that national purpose is served by requiring that each state spend at least portion its federal funding for progra ms which they view as havi ng national importance there is considerable support within the transportation community for an expansion of flexibility as part of the upco ming reauthorization this is justified on the basis of improved interm odal planning it also reflects many states growing familiarity with the process used to tran sfer funds between programs and their respective satisfaction with this option at the moment interest group seems to be opposing increased flexibility although there is considerable discussion as to how broadly any increase in transf erability should be applied high priority projects earmarking in the view of some observers the mo st controversial feat ure of tea21

earmarking here however is not isolated earmarking in transportation appropriations legislation has also grown dramatically in the last decade in fact certain programs such as corbor and tcsp that were established as competitive discretionary funding programs in tea21 are now entirely earmarked in appropriations legislation there are numerous philosophical argume nts both for and against earmarking at the congressional level in the surface transportation context the argument has always been between members meeting what they see as their representational requirements and meeting the

apwa both the cmaq and the programs have allowed communities to consider diversity of projects eligible for federal funding24 some supporters of the program such as apwa believe that the program

multimodal approaches to transportation environmental m itigation and increased decisionmaking at the local level many local governments have gained flexibility in the use of federal funds and through their particip ation in and other flexible programs now have better understanding of the way the federal transportation progra m operates furthermore support for mu ltimodalism and transportation alternatives appears to be especially high among those local governments that have ac tively pursued projects some program advocates would like to see the federal government provide direct funding to localities to pursue enhancements without having to rely on states for discretionary grants for example the national league of cities nlc takes the position that funding for this program should be distributed direc tly to cities which it believes will reduce local government dependence on discretionary grant programs at the state level26 direct funding would potentially increase the burden on the us dot instead of providing program grants to states to administer the us dot would be put in the position of administering thousands of grants in commun ities across the country one issue recently highlighted in report prepared for fhwa is the lowerthan expected obligation rate for funds the report found that some states with higher obligation rates also had higher project completion rates and sm aller apportionments in general the report suggested that stat with smaller apportionments appeared to be better equipped to implement the smalle r scale projects and that such projects had greater significance in smaller states27 it also identified some of the problems that lead to lower obligation rates includi ng inexperience of project sponsors right ofway issues and environmental compliance the study which contained suggestions for improving overall obligation rates primarily focused on administrative measures that could be implemented by fw and state dots one recommendation however called for removing the program from the 90 obligation limitation placed on stp funds the report suggested that this would increase states abilities to obligate and complete projects28 concern raised by some transportation professionals is that if state wants to spend more than the maximum 90 of stp funds allowed by law they would have to reduce the amount of spending allowed under other parts of the stp program such as the or the cmaq programs it was suggested that some states may be c hoosing to allocate funds in this manner29 another reason cited for the relatively slow obligation rate is that funds for programs are typically not obligated until pr oject sponsors complete the planning and engineering portions of projects and are read to begin construction the delay causedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs21 30 ibidby planning and engineering can amount to onetotwo year lag from project selection to obligation of funds30 crs contact glennon harrison congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program tea21 authorized total of 81 billion in guaranteed funds for the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq from fy1998 to fy2003 while the cmaq program represents relatively modest percentage of total highway funding it potentially has greater signifi cance from an environmental perspective since it is the largest source of federal funding for air quality projects however questions have been raised about the prog rams effectiveness and whether to modify various elements will be likely topic of discussion in the reauthorization debate the primary purpose of the cmaq program is to fund projects that reduce traffic congestion and the resulting emissions from motor vehicles through funding these types of projects the program is designed to help mitigate the air quality impacts of highway travel and thereby assist states in complying with the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for carbon monoxide ozone and particulate matter the clean air act requires the environmental protection agency epa to develop safe standards for these pollutants and states with areas that do not meet the standards must develop plans to attain and maintain them the cmaq program is based on the fundamental concept that lowering the num ber of miles traveled by motor vehicles and reducing congestion to make vehicles operate mo re efficiently can reduce emissions and help states improve overall air quality under current law states with areas that are in nonattainment with the naaqs and those that must maintain them recei ve cmaq funds according to formula based on the severity of air pollution in those areas and the population residing in them states that do not have any nonattainment or maintenance areas receive 05 of the total annual cmaq apportionmen t and have the flexibility to use this amount for transportation projects that are eligible under cmaq or the surface transportation program cmaq projects generally fall into one of the following categories 1 mass transit 2 traffic flow improvements 3 rideshare programs 4 traffic demand management programs 5 bicycle and pede strian projects 6 public education 7 vehicle inspection and mainte nance programs or 8 alte rnative fuel conversions historically more funding has been obligat ed for mass transit projects than for other activities in response to concerns about the eff ectiveness of the cmaq program congress included provision in tea21 that required the national academy of sciences nas to study whether the emission reductions from cmaq projects have been large enough to help states comply with th naaqs the nas released report on its findings in the spring of 2002 the study concluded that the ai r quality benefits of individual cmaq projects are relatively sm all and less costeffective than other pollution control measures however when assessed collectively the nas concluded that overall air quality benefits were likely great enough to help states achieve and maintain the naaqs in areas that are on th margin of compliance consequentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs22 the nas recommended that the program be continued and suggested various modifications to improve its effectiveness the findings of the nas will likely generate numerous issues in the reauthorization debate since the impact of the program on air quality was difficult to quantify there may be discussion of whether to shift the focus to reducing traffic congestion in general rather than linking eligibility to the potential for reducing emissions there also may be related discussions of wh ether the statutory formula should be amended to provide higher am ount of minimum funding to states that do not have any nonattainment or maintenance areas but that would still benefit from reduction in traffic congestion on the other hand issues related to the statutory formula also may arise in support of increasing funding for air quality projects for example the current formula does not include factor to account for areas that are in nonattainment with the current particulate matter standard and for areas that would be classified under the new ozone standard whether to include factor for these areas to allow potentially affected states to receive greater funding may be an issue crs contact david

the environmental review process fo r highway construction projects however some environmental organiza tions have argued that t horough reviews are necessary to assess compliance with environmental

process the department of tran sportation has taken numerous administrative actions in response to this requirement but has not issued final regulations to put streamlining into practice on national scale while the clinton administration did submit strea mlining regulatory proposal in may 2000 it was widely criticized on numerous grounds by congress the states highway interest groups and environmental orga nizations the principal cr iticisms were that it did not fully address the requirement s of tea21 and that it woul d have added new elements to the planning and development process that may have resulted in further project delays due to the these concerns the bu sh administration withdrew the proposal in september 2002 and indicated that new proposal would not be issued until tea21 is reauthorized in the interim presiden t bush has issued an executive order which directs federal agencies to expedite environmental reviews for highpriority transportation projects and has established specific goals to reduce the time frames for review31 several oversight hearings were held during the 107th congress to examine the streamlining issue some members expr essed their disappointment that the department of transportation s actions have mostly been administrative in nature and that five years after the enactment of the law streamlining regulations have yet to be finalized in the conference report on tea 21 hrept 105550 congress stated its expectation that the secretary of trans portation would implement the streamlining requirements through the regulatory

would save about 1 billion gao02 603 p 24november 2001 however the individual ag reements making up this average ranged from 19 to 8037 this reduction in the average federal share for recent new starts projects may be due in part to ftas own fforts to stretch available funding by using the amount of federal share requested as consideration in prioritizing candidate projects critics of the proposal to formally cap th federal share at lower level point to the success of ftas efforts as evidence that blanket lower cap is unnecessary they argue blanket lower cap would penalize projects already partly through the new starts process whose plans are premised on receiving higher federal share and that the change could disproportionately hurt poorer communities which might not have the fiscal resources to provide higher local match they also note that state and local officials have testified that lowering the federal share may encourage transportation planners to take advantage of flexible funding and m ove funding away from transit projects toward highway projects where the federal match is still 80 supporters of lowering the cap on the fede ral share argue that the change would simply formalize the current trend of fede ral costsharing in new starts projects they also argue that requiring higher local match would promote more rigorous review of projects merits at the local level perhaps weeding out some marginal projects they note that the level of cal match provided in new starts projects seems to have little relation to the fiscal ability of the community rather the variance in level of local match provided seems rela ted primarily to communitys willingness to ask for higher federal match and therefore penalizes communities which provide higher local match and they also note that even though fta has produced low average federal share recently blanket cap would still free up significant amount of money38 increased funding for transit as part of any increase in the federal fuels tax the primary funding source for trans it is the previously mentioned mass transit account of the highway trust fund the account currently receives 286 of the 184 federal excise tax 155 of the tax which brings in about 46 billion annually transit interests be lieve that they should share in any new revenue increases for the overall surface transportation

large gap between the amount of fundi ng available for transit and the nations transit needs the transit industry therefor supports all efforts to provide additional funds during the reauthorization period maintaining the guaranteed obligation limit one of the innovations of the tea21 authorizing legislation described earlier was the creation of guaranteed obligation limits for transportation progra ms funded from the highway trust fund proponents of transit support this guar anteed obligation limit noting that it has provided steady increase in transit funding during the current authorization period also it has enabled recipients to predict th eir future funding levels assisting their longterm capital planning and making po ssible innovations in project financing funding for small transit intensive cities the formula for apportioning transit formula funds to small citiesur banized areas with populations less than 200000is different from that used for larger areas the formula for small cities uses only population and population density as factor s while that for larger areas includes factors reflecting the amount of service that the city provides some argue that as result small cities that provide higherthanaverage level of transit service do not receive level of f unding that recognizes their transit efforts as result of these concerns section 3033 of the tea21 directed dot to study the issue the dot study concluded that sufficient issues existed to consider changes in the urbanized area formula program form ulas in the next reauthorization39 rural transit

under 50000 advocates of increased funding for small ur ban and rural areas assert that transit is needed by people who cannot afford cars or who cannot drive and that rural areas have few transportation opti ons and limited resources to f und transit they say transit ridership in those areas would increase if transit were more available critics note that transit is most efficient where there are large concentrations of people and it is also most needed in those areas because the c ongestion created by large numbers of people commuting to work overwhelms the road networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31665crs31 40urbanized area figure from census bureau ridership figures from american public transportation association public transportation fact book tables 26 28advocates of increased funding for ru ral transit have proposed that the distribution ratio for transit formula funds be changed to that used for the job access and reverse commute program thus providing more mone to small urban areas and especially to rural areas critics of this pr oposal assert that the majority of transit funding should go where the majority of tran sit ridership is which is in large urban areas there were 405 urbanized areas in 2000 of which only 33 had populations over 1 million these 33 largest urbanized areas alone accounted for 82 of all transit trips in 200040 bus transit issues the other large transit program is the capital grants program which received 28 billion in fy2002 the capital grants program is divided into three components fixedguid eway modernization new starts and bus bus facilities the funding for these three programs is divided 404020 thus about 80 of the funding goes to fixedgu ideway systems mostly heavy and light rail though bus rapid transit also qualifies as fixedguideway system some argue that greater percentage of the capital grants program funds should go to buses because buses carry the majority of all transit riders and most communities have little or fixedguideway service and so are not eligible for the 80 of funds distributed to fixedguideway systems opponents of this policy change argue that while buses carry the majority of riders the capital costs of bus service are relatively low because bus systems do not have to pay for their own infrastructure they note that fixedguideway transit systems are more efficient than buses by some measures alt hough only 13 cities have heavy rail transit systems those systems alone account for about onethird of all transit trips and for almost half of all transit passenger miles traveled but fixed guideway systems are expensive to build and maintain since the capital needs of fixedguideway systems are great while the capital needs of bus systems are relatively small proponents of the status quo argue th at most of the capital grants program funds should go to fixedguideway systems rather than to bus systems crs contact randy peterman intermodal

of idling trucks reducing air quality and increasing energy consumption in many cases poor intermodal connectors also have serious negative impact on traffic in the communities in which they are located as trade volumes have increased at rapid rates and congestion is increasing on the nations highway system the issue of intermodal connections may be microcosm of broader issues regarding the federal g overnments role in the nations intermodal transportation system among the issues being discussed are do existing institutional arrangements encourage crossmodal approach for transportation planning are existing funding programs too limited to include multimodal projects do we plan and operate the system as system and not as individual modes or elements freight stakeholders have made several proposals to seek what they view as adequate funding for intermodal freight connectors they include dedicating portion of nhs funds for intermodal conn ector projects specifying that access to

doublestack trains fi rst came into use in the early 1980s the intermodal traffic absorbed the railroads excess capacity today however due in large part to deregulation s upply and demand are in closer balance if the railroads are to absorb the additional traffic forecaste d they will need to make and are making substantial investments in track and terminal capacity if policymakers choose to consider add itional federal resour ces for rail capital improvements among the approaches that have been proposed are the creation of rail trust fund or the expansion of ex isting federal programs to include more eligibility for rail rela ted projects trust fund by pr oviding more predictable and steady source of funding facilitates the pl anning and construc tion of long term projects however rail trust fund c ould further fragment and compartmentalize federal funding along modal lines funding and managing tran sportation on modal basis could make it more difficult to target resources where capacity may be needed most such as the connections among mode s second approach permitting the use of highway trust fund dollars for rail proj ects might increase the flexibility of local transportation planners in solving their tran sportation needs gr eater participation by the freight railroads in the local planning process may also augment state and local resources with private sector capital however more liberal dispersion of highway trust fund dollars to nonhighway users coul d diffuse political support for the program in addition expanding the eligibility of existing highway trust fund financed programs such as cmaq or corbor to in clude rail does not ensure that state dots and local mpos will shift more resources to rail related projects there are also some potential disincentives in law that may cause railroads not seek greater role in intermodal projects pursued by localities concern with federal assistance for ra il freight projects is that unlike other modes such as highways waterways and airways freight railways are privately owned44 another important difference with other modes is that railroads do not generally share their infrastructure with co mpetitors many ques tion if public funding should be used to support projects in privat ownership and under private control possible drawback of public financial assistance is that it could in extreme cases lead to overinvestment in rail capacity if public funds were availabl for construction of new project the project may have to pass lower hurdle in terms of evaluating risk and return than if the project were fina nced by railroad on standalone basis industry observers caution that the physical life of freight facility can outlive its economic life another concern with govern ment

authority the latter form of budget authority contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trust fund financed programs such as the fede ralaid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual trans portation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combinin g changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amends au thorized funds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legisl ation appropriations are re quired to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations tea21 greatly limited the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the act enumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 in the statute45 highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are pr esented perhaps months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represente d in the trust fund as obligated funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balan ces trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds suffi cient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts ve substantial short and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much great er extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have
