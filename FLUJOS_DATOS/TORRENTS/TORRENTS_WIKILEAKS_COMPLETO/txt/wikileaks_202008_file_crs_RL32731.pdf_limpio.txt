several individual targets per flight ie multiple targets per so rtie the navy testified in february 2005 that the number of targets per day that carrier ai r wing can attack has increased from about 200 in 1997 to about 700 today and will increase to more than 1000 by 2010 see statement of admiral vernon clark usn chief of na val operations before the senate armed services committee february 10 2005 page 18 figure 6if the carrier force were reduced in to 11 ships in 2007 as the navy proposes then the navy projects that it will fall further to 10 ships in 2013 when the enterprise retires and not get back to 11 ships until 2015 when cvn78 enters service even if an 11carrier force would be operationally acceptable 10carrier force would not be to avoid dropping to 10carrier force during this period the navy needs to maintain 12carrier force through at least 2013 the navy further projects that the size of the carrier force will increase from 11 ships to 12 ships in 2019 when cvn79 enters service and be maintained at 12 ships through at least 2036 this suggests strongly that navy actually prefers carrier force of 12 ships not 11 since the end of the cold war carri ers have been kept very busy and have proven their value in numer ous operations in an era of uncertain us access to overseas air bases the value of carriers as sovereign us bases that can operate in international waters free from political constraints is particularly significant28 the increasing number of targets that can be attacked each day by carrier air wing29 is making carriers even more cost effective as us military platforms which argues in favor of retaining them in the us force structure not retiring them supporters of reducing the carrier for ce to 11 or fewer carriers starting in fy2006 could argue the following due to changes over time in factors such as carrier missions the technologies that are available to carriers and their air wings for performing missions and policies fo r basing and deploying carriers historical figures for carrier force size are not precise guide to whether future carrier force size would be adequate for performing its required missions the increasing number of targets that can be attacked each day by carrier air wing will make it possi ble to conduct future contingencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32731crs11 30 for more on the fleet res ponse plan see crs

were required in the past reducing the number of carriers needed for warfighting purposes the navys recently implemented fleet response plan frp has increased the navys ability to rge carriers to respond to overseas contingencies which likewise reduces the number of carriers needed for warfighting purposes30 the navys ability to base tactical aircraft at sea will be augmented in future years by the navys planned lharclass amphibious assault ships which can be viewed as mediumsized aircraft carriers the first lhar is to be procured in fy2007 keeping the carrier force at 12 ships rather than reducing it to 11 would add to navy funding re quirements and thereby require offsetting reductions to other dod programs such as navy air force or army procurement programs or other elements of dod force structure those offsetting reductions could pose greater operational risks than reducing the carrier force to 11 ships the navy can manage the projected reduction to 10carrier force in 2013 and 2014 by scheduling ma intenance and taking other actions so as to ma ximize the opera tional availability of the 10 carriers it will have during this period at hearings on the proposed fy2006 fense budget dod and navy officials argued that an 11carrier force is accepta ble in light of the increasing capabilities of carrier air wings the increased deployab ility of navy carriers under the frp the aviation capabilities of the navys planned lhar ships and operational risks of cutting other dod programs to pay for k eeping the carrier force at 12 ships31 the navy testified that with 12carrier for ce the navy under the frp could surge six carriers within 30 days and another two carriers within 60 days after that capability referred to as 62 with an 11carrier force the navy testified that would change to either 61 or 52 th navys fy2007 budget states that an 11 carrier force can support 6132 carrier to be retired if carrier was to be retired in the near term so as to reduce the carrier force to 11 ships second potential issue for the 109th congress was whether that carrier should be the kennedy or another ship potential alternatives to the kennedy included the kitty hawk the enterprise and the vinsonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32731crs12 33 as nuclearpowered ships the enterprise and vinson can make highspeed transits over long distances to respond to urgent crises wit hout need for stopping or slowing down to refuel along the way they do not need to be refueled upon arriving at the area of operations ensuring that they can commenc combat operations immediately upon arrival and since they do not need large fuel tanks to store fossil fuel for their own propulsion plant they can devote more of their internal volume to the storage of aircraft fuel and ammunition which permits them to sustain co mbat operations for longer periods of time before they need to be resupplied the cap ability advantages of nuclear power are what have justified the higher procurement and life cycle costs of nuclearpowered carriers in addition since the enterprise 90000 tons fu ll load displacement and vinson 91500 tons are somewhat larger than the kennedy 81500 tons the enterprise and vinson might be more able to remain stable in the water and thus capable of conducting air operations in certain rough seassupporters of retiring the kennedy rather than the kitty hawk enterprise or vinson could argue the following the kennedy did not receive full service life extension program slep overhaul at about age 30 so keeping it in service in coming years could become increasingly difficult and expensive the kitty hawk in contrast received fu ll slep overhaul at about age 30 giving it firmer engineering f oundation for being operated to about age 45 as mentioned in the background section the navy in february 2006 an nounced that it had restricted the kennedy from conducting flight operations with fi xedwing aircraft due to newly discovered corrosion problems with the ships arresting gear mounts the navy also stated that two of the ships four aircraft catapults are operating under waivers that are sche duled to expire in june and that four of its eight boilers are operating under waivers that are scheduled to expire in sept ember and cannot be renewed retiring the kitty hawk and shifting the kennedy to japan to replace the kitty hawk there would mean at least for some time that all the atlantic fleet carriers would be based in single area the norfolknewport news va ar ea which might not be prudent in light of the potential ability of terrorists to make catastrophic onetime attack on us home port somewhere shifting nuclear powered carrier to japan to repl ace the kitty hawk there would take time and money given the need to qualify yokosuka as nuclear carrier home port the conventionally powered kennedy is less capable than the nuclearpowered enterprise and vinson33 the navy invested more than 2 billion for the enterprise rcoh retiring the enterprise in the near term rather than in 2014 would not realize full return on this investment retiring the vinson and not pe rforming the rcoh now scheduled for the ship would significantly reduce the work load at northrophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32731crs13 grummans newport news ngnn sh ipyard the yard that would perform the work which would in crease the cost of other work being done at the yard including construction of new carriers and construction of new attack submar ines due to reduced spreading of fixed costs and other factors at ngnn increases in costs for other work being done at ngnn would offset perhaps significantly the savings associated with avoiding the vinson rcoh and the vinsons annual personnel opera tion and maintenance costs supporters of retiring the kitty hawk terprise or vinson rather than the kennedy could argue the following the kitty hawk is generally more capable than the kennedy and is about 6½ years older than the kennedy since the kitty hawk is currently scheduled to be retired in 2008 about four years from now retiring it in the near term would not represent much of change from current lifecycle plans for the ship the kennedy in contrast had been scheduled to remain in service until 2018 14 years from now so retiring it in fy2006 would involve significant change from current lifecycle plans for the ship the kennedys current maintenance issues including those relating to its arresting gear mounts catapults and boilers can be addressed in an overhaul the kennedy could be shifted to yokosuka to replace the kitty hawk there the first carrier homeported at yokosuka the midway cv41 did not receive full slep overhaul but careful maintenance on the ship during its stay at yokosuka permitted it to remain in operation to age 46 in the meantime mayport fl could be qualified as quickly as feasible as nuclearcarrier home port nuclearpowered carrier could then be transferred there so as to once again divide navys atlantic fleet carriers between two ports rather than concentrating them at single home port since the kitty hawk is currently scheduled to be re tired in 2008 retiring the kitty hawk in the near term might only accelerate plan that the navy may already have for taking these actions compared to the tworeactor propulsion plants on the navys nimitzclass carriers the eight reactor propulsion plant on the enterprise can be more difficult and expensive to maintain although the enterprise was give n an rcoh with the intention of keeping it in service until 2014 retiring it in the near term would give the navy an allnimitzclass nuclearcarrier fleet streamlining nuclearcarrier logistics and re ducing nuclearcarrier support costs retiring the vinson in the near term would avoid 227billion cost in fy2006 and fy2007 to complete funding for the vinsons rcoh it would also eliminate the annual personnel operation and maintenance costs for the vinson wh ich might be comparable to or even

the river from 42 to 45 feet and could possibly dredge that part of the channel to 50 feet for the carriers use the study said the navys part of the channel dredging would be 25 million according to

armed services committ ee in its report hrept 109452 of may 5 2006 on hr 5122 stated the committee is concerned by the chief of naval operations plan to retire the uss john f kennedy according to the navys long range shipbuilding plan if the navy retires the kennedy then the aircraft carrier force will drop to 11 between now and 2012 and then drop to 10 in 2013 and 2014 with the commissioning of cvn78 in 2015 the aircraft carrier force increases to 11 and then back to 12 in 2019 and beyond the committee believes it is the objective of the chief of naval operations to maintain force of 12 aircraft carri ers since the long range shipbuilding plan shows total of 12 aircraft carriers between 2019 and the far range of the plan in 2036 it is apparent to the committee that the decision to allow the force structure to fall to 10 in the near futu re is fiscally rather than operationally driven the committee believes that the navy should continue to maintain less than 12 operational aircraft carriers in order to meet potential global commitments the committee believes that reduction below 12 aircraft carriers puts the nation in position of unacceptable risk page 67 the report also stated the committee notes that the department of defenses legislative proposal for fiscal year 2007 included section th at would effectively allow retirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32731crs20 of the conventionallypowered aircraft carrier uss john f kennedy thereby reducing the carrier force structure from 12 to 11 ships the committee believes that the navys decision to reduce the number of carriers was not based on mission requireme nts analysis rather the decision was based on fiscal constraints section 126 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 public law 109163 amended section 5062 of title 10 united states code to set minimum carri er force structure of not less than 12 operational aircraft carriers the comm ittee believes the aircraft carrier force structure should be maintained at 12 ships in order to meet worldwide commitments however the committee would like to explore options for maintaining the uss john f kennedy in an operational stat us either within or outside the us navy to include the possibility of transf erring operational control to the north atlantic treaty organization nato therefore the committee directs the secretary of defense to submit report to the congressional defense committees by march 1 2007 that examines options for maintaining the uss john f kennedy in an operational status both within and outside the us navy in examining the nato option the secretary shall coordinate an assessment with the nato secretary general the report shall include the cost and manning required statutory restricti ons that would preclude tr ansfer of the uss john f kennedy to organizations or entities out side the us navy and classified annex on how the navy would meet gl obal operational requirements with an aircraft carrier force structure of less than 12 ships pages 369370 the report also included additional view s on the issue from representative jeff miller page 502 senate section 1011 of the senate versi on of the bill s 2766 would repeal the requirement for the navy to include not less than 12 carriers that was enacted in pl 109163 the senate armed services committee in its report srept 109254 of may 9 2006 on s 2766 stated the 2006 quadrennial defense review qdr report determined that naval force including 11 aircraft carriers meets the combat capability requirements of the national military strategy in testimony before the committee on armed services in march 2006 the chief of naval operations cno emphasized that the decision by the qdr followed rigorous evaluation of future force structure requirements by the navy and that 11 aircraft carriers are sufficient to ensure the navys ability to provide coverage in any foreseeable contingency with persistent combat power the committee is further aware that advances in ship systems aircraft and precision weapons coupled with fundamental changes to fleet main tenance and deployment practices implemented by the navy have provided todays aircraft carrier and associated air wings substantially greater strike capability and greater force availability than possessed by the fleet during previ ous quadrennial defense reviews the navy has reported on revisions to its method and frequency of deployments for vessels under the new concept referred to as the fleet response plan the navy has reduced fo rward presence requirements in order to increase surge capability in response to national security demands under this approach with 12 aircraft carriers in th fleet the navy proposed to have sixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32731crs21 carrier strike groups available for cris is response within 30 days and two more carrier strike groups available in 90 days referred to as 6 plus 2 at force structure of 11 aircraft carriers this beco mes 6 plus 1 or 5 plus 2 which the navy determined supports the national military strategy with acceptable risk in certain cases the success of the fleet response plan relies on the timeliness of the decision to surgedeploy the naval forces and with smaller force levels and reduced forward presence the fleet response plan approach may increase risk if we do not have the vel of insight into the threat necessary for timely action further the navys longterm plan for aircraft carrier force structure declines to 10 carriers in 2013 when the uss enterprise is scheduled to retire that carrier would be re placed by cvn21 in 2015 which has yet to start construction the navy believes that they can manage this gap through number of added measures but if there are any delays in delivering cvn21 this gap will increase the committee maintains its concern expressed in the senate report accompanying s 1042 srept 10969 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 regarding the dec lining size of the naval force and the reduction to the number of aircraft carriers the committee agrees however with the navys determination that it is not feasible to maintain 12 operational aircraft carriers by restoring the uss j ohn f kennedy cv67 to deployable fully missioncapable platform the comm ittee believes that it is vital to the national security of the united states that fleet of at least 11 aircraft carriers be maintained to support the national military strategy and has taken extraordinary action to support the cnos force struct ure plan by authorizing increased procurement for shipbuilding and specific to aircraft carriers by authorizing additional advance procurement and incremental funding for the construction of the first 3 cvn21 class aircraft carriers further recognizing the increased n eed for timeliness of surge operations that todays smaller force structure places on the fleet response plan the committee reaffirms the judgment that the chief of naval operations admiral clark provided in testimony before the committee on armed services in february 2005 that the atlantic fleet s hould continue to be dispersed in two homeports pages 379380 the report also included additional views on the issue from senator bill nelson pages 528529 conference report the conference report hr ept 109702 of september 29 2006 on hr 5122 was signed into law as pl
