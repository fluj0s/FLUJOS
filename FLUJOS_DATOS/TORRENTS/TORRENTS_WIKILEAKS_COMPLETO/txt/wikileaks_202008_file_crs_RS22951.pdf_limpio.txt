akihiro ota widely expected to stay on lower house elections in early november in late september or early october the new prime minister is expected to dissolve the chamber and schedule an early general election for early november in order to renew the ruling partys mandate by law the lower house election does not need to be held until september 2009 various polls indicate that th race is likely to be competitive both the ldp and the dpjs approval ratings ge nerally are in the 2030 range most observers predict that the ldpled coalition is unlikely to maintain its twothirds majority in the lower house which would deprive the ldp of its ability to override vetoes by the dpjled upper house and potentially usher in new era for japanese politics economic issues predominate the economy is expected to be the major policy issue of the anticipated general electi on specifically debate is expected to focus on four interrelated ite ms whether and how to revive japans sputtering economy how to support japans social security system as it copes with the strain of rapidly ageing society whether and when to raise the consum ption tax rate from its current level of 5 and how aggressively to pursue structural economic reforms such as those championed by former prime minister junichiro koiz umi who served from 20012006 hanging over all these questions is japan s high level of government debt the countrys debttogdp ratio is the highest among the worlds industrialized countries the ldps candidates thus far five candidates have announced their intention to run for the ldps presidency

reputation as revisionist on historical issues which could lead to tensions with china and south korea if he becomes prime minister in the past aso has praised some aspects of japans colonization of

dpj is expected to use the same strategy of emphasizing economic and social issues that propelled it to victory in the july 2007 elections for the upper house of japans diet ozawa has unveiled highly populist policy blueprint that in cludes items such as providing income support to farmers and fishermen abolishing cer tain provisional taxes and re forming the national pension and healthcare systems he would offs et the over 18 trillion yen over 160 billion in revenue shortfalls by eliminating or trimming what he has called wasteful government programs that are funded through various special accounts ozawa also has outlined measures to reduce bureaucrats influence over politicians and has called for japanese troops to participate in peacekeeping operations3 though ozawa is not popular in opinion polls he is respected in his party for his campaign prowesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22951crs4 4 new komeito to reelect ota nihon keizai shimbun september 8 2008possible outcomes of the current impasse analysts point to number of possible outcomes from the ongoing political turbulence one possibility is continued paralysis particularly if the ldp wins the lower house elections but loses its 23 majority dpj victory while signifying the emergence of true twoparty system in japan could usher in period of fundamental adjustment to policies that have remained static for decades under the ldp two other scenarios are grand coalition and political realignment in which members of either party defect to the other and form new majority befo re the elections however most analysts are reluctant to speculate specifically on how these scenarios might unfold factors behind japans political paralysis number of factors impeded fukudas ability to govern and will challenge whomever the ldp chooses as his successor parliamentary gridlock in july 2007 the dpj won majority in nationwide elections for the upper house of the diet as result for the first time in japanese history japans two pa rliamentary chambers are controlle d by different parties shortly after the dpjs victory thenprime minister shinzo abe resigned leading the ldp to select fukuda as premier concerned by ozawas threats to veto major legislation fukuda attempted to form g rand coalition with the dpj after the talks broke down the dpj adopted an aggressive policy of usin g its control of the upper house to block or delay several of the fukuda gove rnments legislative initiatives the ldps increased dependence on coalition partners for more than decade the ldp generally has not been able to secure independent majorities in both diet chambers forcing it to rely upon coaliti ons with smaller parties since 1999 the ldp has formed governing coalition with the new komeito party pacifistleaning party with strong ties to the buddhist soka gakkai religious group komeitos clout in the coalition has increased over time for at least two reasons first the ldp is reliant upon komeito to obtain the 23 majority in the lower house to override the dpjled vetoes in the upper house second ldp ca ndidates in many electoral districts have become reliant upon support fro m soka gakkai followers4 although traditionally the ldp has dominated the coalition during the summer of 2008 new komeito became more assertive for instance by resisting fukudas push to renew the authorization to provide fuel to coalition forces in afghanistan see later section for details the ldps weakened decisionmaking structure former prime minister junichiro koizumi significantly weakened the ldps old opaque system in which the leaders of the partys internal factions made major budgetary policy and personnel decisions including deciding who would serve as prime minis ter this system although widely criticized as lacking transparency helped the ldp to overcome significant internal divisions over policy while he was breaking the factionbased system koizumi used his personal popularity and aggressi veness to enforce party discipline however his successors abe and fukuda ofte n were unable to duplicate this feat as result decisionmaking became increas ingly difficult on contentious matters such as the battleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22951crs5 5 brad glosserman déjà vu all ov er again pacnet 43 september 2 2008 6 for more on usjapan relations see crs report rl33436 japanus relations issues for congress coordinated by emma chanlettaverybetween the ldps economic reformers and t hose favoring return to the status quo of channeling government funds toward key interest groups5 the dpjs discipline the dpj was formed in 1998 as merger of four smaller parties and was late r joined by fifth grouping the amalgamated nature of the dpj has led to considerable internal contradictions primarily between the partys hawkishconservative and passivistliberal wings in particular the issues of deploying japanese troops abroad and revising th warrenouncing article 9 of the japanese constitution have generated considerable internal debate in the dpj as result for much of its history the dpj has reputation of not being able to formulate coherent alternative policies to the ldp additionally battles between various party leaders have weakened the party since winning the upper house however the party has appeared much more unified at least on the strategy of using its veto power to try to force the ldp to hold early elections this discipline is remarkable considering that privately and publicly many dpj members chafe at ozawas topdown leadership style if the dpj does worse than expected in the next election it is lik ely that he will be forced to step down implications for the united states6 in general us interests are likely to be negatively affected by political gridlock in tokyo in the first term of the bush admin istration japan was lauded as the pivot of the us strategic presence in asia and re liable partner in the global war on terrorism continued ineffective leadership however suggests that japan will avoid taking political risks to support us global efforts stalle d or protracted decisionmaking may further frustrate us managers working on range of economic diplomatic and military coordination with japan although most analys ts view the usjapan security alliance as mutually beneficial and fundamentally sound an erosion of trust between washington and tokyo could constrain both capitals fro m weathering occasional controversies security policy reform efforts regardless of which pa rty or candidate takes power tokyo is likely to focus most attention on domestic issues in the near future little progress is expected on suite of reforms th at had been pursued by abe and encouraged by us officials to enhance japans ability to contribute to international security these proposals include revision of article 9 of japans cons tituti on reinterpretation of the constitution to allow collective selfdefense and law that would allow the self defense forces to deploy without passage of special legislation given the emphasis on reforming the pension and health care systems the new leadership is unlikely to put its energy and resources into passage of contr oversial foreign policy legislation afghanistan the political gridlock in tokyo does not bode well for the continuation of japanese s upport of the usled operation

and new komeitos apparent reluctance to back the extension point to at least an interruption of the refueling in summer 2008 the japanese government ex plored and then appeared to rule out sending team of japanese ground troops to participate in humanitarian activities in afghanistan deployment is likely to be controversial for the p acifistleaning japanese public and is particularly opposed by the new komeito party although the dpj opposes the refueling operations it does so on the gr ounds that the operations fall under the us led oef and is not authorized by the united nations dpj leader ozawa in the past has voiced support for japanese pa rticipation in pr ovincial reconstruction team prt in afghanistan because it is specifically authorized by the united nations some analysts have speculated that japan may be waiting to see how much emphasis the new us president puts on afghanistan before taking the political risk of sending ground troops overall alliance initiatives political shifts in japan since 2006 appear to have slowed some of the increased cooperation in the usjapan alliance implementation of series of bilateral agreem ents intended to upgrade the alliance known as the 22 agreements depends on tokyo providing the necessary resources and political capital because the transformation and realignmen t initiatives involve elements that are unpopular in the localities affect ed successful imple mentation hinges on leadership from the central government the centerpiece of the realignment scheme involves the relocation of controversial ma rine corps air station in fu tenma to lesscongested part of okinawa the agreem ent faces significant public opposition and environmental concerns if implementati on falters the planned move of 8000 marines from okinawa to guam may also disrupt the pentagons overall plans for realigning us forces in asia7 regional relations japans relations with its neighbors while mixed appear to be the least likely area of concern to be affected by the current political turmoil leaders in the various political parties do not have explicitly distinct agendas for dealing with the koreas and china after period of tension under koizumi politicians in both tokyo and beijing appear to have recognized the n ecessity of maintainin g friendly relations in the interest of regional stability and continued robust trade most analysts think that even aso who is known as nationalist politician is likely to follow abe and fukudas lead and avoid provoking china after some pos itive trends japansouth korean ties have faltered again due to delicate sovereignty issues and accordin g to many analysts lack of highlevel attention to seoul in tokyo north koreajapan relations may have been affected by fukudas resignation s oon after fukudas
