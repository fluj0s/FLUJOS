and fiftystate survey of caps on punitive damages and noneconomic damages introduction advocates of medical malpractice liability reform argue that current state tort law provides costly and inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care liability and compensating injured patients increasing liability insurance premiums they argue are forcing doctors to curtail their medical practices and to engage in excessive defensive medicine as consequence high liability insurance premiums diminish consumers access to health care and raise health care costs physicians and their insurers claim that frivolous malpractice lawsuits and unreasonably large jury awards are responsible for the problem they typically support tort reform legislation that would limit the amount juries may awar d to plaintiffs in malpractice cases opponents of medical malpractice reform have argued that there is very minimal relationship between health care co sts and malpractice litigation and that as the harvard medical practice study reported in 1990 about one in eight negligently injured patients file malpractice claim the studys authors concluded that the problem is not too many cla ims but if anything too few claims1 lawyers and consumer groups argue that the insuran ce industry is to blame for the rapid rise in malpractice insurance premiums th groups contend that bad investment choices in addition to the underwriting cycl have led to dwindling profits for insurers who then try to recoup their sses through overpriced insurance products lawyers and consumer groups generally s upport efforts to reform the insurance industry in order to rein in premiums this report does not consider the debate outlined in the prior two paragraphs and does not examine the effects of medical malpractice litigation or medical malpractice liability reform on the health care system or on the cost of liability insurance premiums in other words it doe s not consider whether tort reform would

and nonec onomic damages the tort of medical malpractice medical malpractice is tort which is civil as distinct from criminal wrong other than breach of contract th at causes injury for which the victim may sue to recover damages actions in tort derive from the common law which means that the rules that govern them were devel oped by the courts of the fifty states and statute is necessary in order to bring tort action statut however can change the courtmade rules that govern tort ac tions and many states have enacted tort reform statutes including medical malpractice reform statutes congress also has the power under the commerce clause of the u s constitution art i 8 cl 3 to regulate medical malpractice litigation medical malpractice liability arises when health care professional engages in negligence or commits an intentional tort negligence has been defined as conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm2 in most instances it arises from failure to exercise due care but defendant may have carefully c onsidered the possible consequences of his conduct and still be found to have imposed an unreasonable risk on others negligence is conduct and not state of mind3 the following is traditional description of the standard of care to which doctors are held to avoid liability for medical malpractice this legal duty requires that the physician undertaking the care of patient possess and exercise that reasonable and ordinary degree of learning skill and care commonly possessed and exercised by reputable physicians practicing in the same locality4 today however the growing majority of jurisdictions employ some variation of the national standard of care5 the skill diligence knowledge means and methods required are not those ordinarily or generally or customar ily exercised or applied but those that are reasonably exercised or applied negligence cannot be excused on

sugge sts using statistical norms to determine whether pain and suffering awards are excessive american bar association journal sept 1997 at 22ground that others practice the same kind of negligence medicine is not an exact science and the proper practice cannot be gauged by fixed rule6 medical malpractice liability as noted may arise from an intentional tort as well as from negligence one commentator explained an important part of medical malprac tice law in some jurisdictions failure of the patient to give consent falls into the category of intentional torts the reasoning is that because the doctor di d not fully explain the risks that might arise from the contact the doctors c ontact with the patient was done without permission in traditional liability law such contact is battery which is an intentional tort7 caps on noneconomic damages economic damages refer to monetary losses that result from an injury such as medical expenses lost wages and reha bilitation costs n oneconomic damages consist primarily of damages for pain and sufferi ng though punitive damages discussed in the next section of this re port are not economic damages they are typically viewed and capped or not capped separate ly from noneconomic damages determining the amount of non economic damages is traditionally subject to broad discretion on the part of juries which must equate tw variables money and suffering that are essentially inco mmensurable judges however have the authority to reduce damage awards that they find excessive8 pro advocates of caps on damages for pain and suffering argue that lack of caps guarantees inconsistency and unpredic tability in the tort system and forces insurers to counter this uncertainty by charging higher premiums disagreement over the amount of pain and suffering dama ges is major obstacle to outofcourt settlement thus increasing litigation and coercing insurers to overpay on settlements of smaller claims further complicating the problem is tendency of juries to inflate pain and suffering awards to cover some or all of the plaintiffs attorneys fees caps on noneconomic damages punish the worst afflicted because the more pain and suffering that plaintiff has endured the more cap deprives him of damages to which he would otherwise have been entitled by forever freezing compensation at todays levels caps discriminate against

the median award for pain and sufferi ng in malpractice cases reportedly was 300000 and inflation has also taken toll11 instead of embracing arbitrary limits that are unfair if not inhumane and usel ess as device for controlling insurance premiums we must continue to rely on our timetested jury system for determining whats right12 in any event jury awards for noneconomic damages are not totally arbitrary as they are often based on mu ltiples of the award for economic damages caps on punitive damages in 1851 the supreme court wrote it is wellestablished principle of the common law that in actions for torts jury may inflict what are called exemplary punitive or vindictive damages upon defendant having in view the enormity of his offense rather than the measure of compensation to the plaintiff we are aware that the propriety of this doctrine has been questioned by some writers13 when may punitive damages be awarded treatise states something more than the mere commission of tort is always required for punitive damages there must be circumstances of aggravation or outrage such as spite or malice or fraudulent or evil motive on the part of the defendant or such conscious and deliberate disregar d of the interests of others that the conduct may be called wilful or wanton there is general agreement that because it lacks this element mere negligence is not enough even though it is so extreme as to be characterized as gross term of illdefined content which occasionally in few jurisdictions has b een stretched to include the element of conscious indifference to consequences and so to justify punitive damages14 among the restrictions that have been proposed with regard to punitive damages besides that they be capped are 1 that the circumstances in which they may be awarded be narrowed 2 that plain tiffs be required to prove by clear andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31692crs5 15 in bmw of north american inc v gore 517 us 559 618 1996 the supreme court listed state

from liability for compensatory damages15 and 4 that punitive damages be paid in part to the government or to fund that serves public purpose instead of to the plaintiff16 pro critics charge that punitive damage awards in medical malpractice cases are often unfair arbitrary and unpredicta ble and result in overkill one publication argues that reform is needed because there s been an outpouring of the most outrageous punitive damage awards in medical malpractice17 even though punitive damage awards occur in small percentage of cases they can have devastating impact on indi vidual defendants and can impose big costs on the economy as whole 18 the american bar foundation found that punitive damage awards are not routine and are not typically given in amounts that boggle the mind19 punitive damages have been called necessary tool in the effective control of socially undesirable conduct punitive damages must be allowed to fill the gaps the criminal law leaves open20 finally plaintiffs often do not recover the amounts that juries award this is because trial judg often reduce punitive damages awards that they find excessive and recent supreme court decision makes it easier for appellate courts to reduce punitive damages21 it is also because many plaintiffs settle for less than jurys verdict to eliminate delays and the uncertainty of appeal sometimes even before jury rules plaintiff has signed an agreement that limits how much money actually changes hands22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31692crs6 23 report of the tort policy working group on the causes extent and policy implications of the current crisis in insu rance availability and affordability feb 1986 at 64limiting joint and several liability joint and several liability is the commonlaw rule that if more than one defendant is found liable for plaintiffs injuries then each defendant may be held 100 percent liable with jo int and several liability the plaintiff may not recover more than once but he may recover all his damages from fewer than all liable defendants with any defendant who pays more than its share of the damages entitled to seek contribution fro m other liable defendants some states have eliminated joint nd several liability ma king each defendant liable only for its share of responsibility for the plaintiffs injury other states have adopted compromise positions eliminating joint and several liability only for noneconomic damages presumably with the view that it is more important for the plaintiff to recover all hi s economic damages than all his noneconomic damages or eliminating joint and veral liability only fo r defendants responsible for less than specified percentage eg 50 percent of the plaintiffs harm presumably with the view that it is especially unfair for such defendants to be held liable for up to 100 percent of the damages pro advocates of abolishing or limiting joint and several liability argue that it frequently operates in highly inequitable manner sometimes making defendants with only small or even minimis percentage of fault liable for 100 of plaintiffs damage accordingly jo int and several liability in the absence of concerted action has led to the inclusion of many deep pocket defendants such as governments larger corporations and insured entities whose involvement is only tangential and who probably woul d not be joined except for the existence of joint and several liability23 advocates of joint and several liability cite the reason that the common law adopted it it is preferable for wrong doer to pay more than its share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full compensation to which he is entitled abolishing the collateral source rule the collateral source rule is the commonlaw rule that allows an injured party to recover damages from the defendant even if he is also entitled to receive them from third party collateral source such as health insurance company an employer or the government to abolish th collateral source rule would be to allow or require courts to redu ce damages by amounts plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive from collateral sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31692crs7 24 the medical care recovery act 42 usc 2651a provides in any case in which the united states is authorized or required by law to furnish or pay for hospital medical surgical or dental care and treat ment to person who is injured or suffers disease under circumstances creating tort liability upon some third person the united states shall have right to recover from said third person or that persons insurer the reasonable value of the care and treatment and shall as to this right be subrogated to any right or claim that the injured or diseased person has against such third person to the extent of the reasonable value of the care and treatment 25 michael f flynn private medical insurance and the collateral source rule good bet 22 university of toledo law review 39 49 1990often collateral source such as health insurer or the government has right of subrogation against the tortfeasor the person responsible for the injury24 this means that the collateral source takes over the injured partys right to sue the tortfeasor for up to the amount the collateral source owes or has paid the injured party though the collateral source rule ma enable the plaintiff to recover from both his insurer and the defendant the plaintiff if there is subrogati on must reimburse his insurer the amount it paid him if the colla teral source rule were eliminated then the defendant would not have to pay the portion of damage s covered by collateral source and the collateral source would appa rently not be able through subrogation to recover the amount it paid the plaintiff in the medical malpractice context therefore eliminating the collateral source rule would benefit liability insurers at the expense of health insurers some jurisdictions however have abolished the colla teral source rule only in cases in which there is right of subroga tion in such jurisdictions where there is right of subrogation the collateral s ource would be unaffected by elimination of the collateral source rule ie the health insurer would still not recover its money and the defendant would benefit by not having to pay the plaintiff25 some proposals to abolish th collateral source rule ve taken into account that the plaintiff may have paid insurance premiums for his collateral source benefit such proposals instead of allowing dama ge award to be reduced by the full amount of collateral source benefit allow it to be reduced by the full amount of collateral source benefit minus the amount the plai ntiff paid to secure that benefit some proposals would allow the defendant to introduce evidence of collateral source payments but do not specify whethe r the jury must reduce economic damages awards by the amount of such payments eliminating the collatera l source rule could also indirectly reduce nonec onomic damages awards b ecause juries often set such awards as multiple of ec onomic damages if the collateral source rule were abolished then could the plaintiff disc lose to the jury only his outofpocket expenses or could he disc lose his total economic damages before collateral source payments are deducted if the former then the plaintiff might receive lesser award of noneconomic damages pro advocates of abolishing the collateral source rule object to the fact that it permits the plaintiff to obtain double r ecovery for certain components of his damages award unless the collateral source is subrogated to th plaintiffs claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31692crs8 26 report of the tort policy working group supra note 23 27 barry j nace and

states with contingentfee limitations in medical malpractice cases national conference of state legislatures state medical liability laws table 2002 29 schwartz supra note 7 at 30against the defendants26 abolishing the collateral source rule will reduce damage awards without denying plaintiffs full recovery of their damages advocates of the collateral source rule cite the reason that the common law adopted it it is preferable for the vic tim than for the wrongdoer to profit from the victims prudence as in buying health insurance or good fortune in having some other collateral source available one commentator has also noted that when the collateral source is the government and th benefit it provides ar future services such as physical therapy there is guarantee that it will provide such services for as long as they are needed as g overnment programs can be cut back27 limiting lawyers contingent fees contingent fee is one in which lawyer instead of charging an hourly fee for his services agrees in exchange for repres enting plaintiff in tort suit to accept percentage of the recovery if the plainti ff wins or settles but to receive nothing if the plaintiff loses payment is thus tingent upon there being recovery plaintiffs agree to this arrangement in order to fford representation without having to pay anything outofpocket and lawyers agree to it because the percentage they receive usually from 33 to 40 percent generally amount s to more than an hourly fee would twentyfive states reportedly regulate contingent fees in medical malpractice cases in one or more of the following ways 1 establishment of sliding scale for the attorney fees 2 establishment of maximum percentage of the award that may be paid for attorney fees and 3 provisi on for court review of the reasonableness of the attorney fees28 legislation to limit contingency fees might consider specifying whether plaintiffs attorneys would be allowed to add costs including expertwitness fees travel and photocopying on top of the cap or must costs be recouped from the lawyers recovery in medical malpractice cases where costs can skyrocket the difference is significant29 pro advocates of limiting contingent fees argue that such fees cause juries to inflate verdicts result in windfalls for lawyers and prompt lawyers to file frivoloushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31692crs9 30 the manhattan institute rethinking contingency fees 1994 at 28 29 31 see studies cited in associati on of trial lawyers of american keys to the courthouse quick facts on the contingent fee system 1994 at 4 5 32 id at 6suits in the hope of settling they also argue that where there is dispute as to liability but only as to damages there is contingency and therefore justification for contingent fees one study proposed that if defendant makes prompt settlement offer then couns fees be limited to hourly rate charges and capped at 10 of the first 100000 of the offer and 5 of any greater amounts when plaintiffs reject defendant s early offers contingenc fees may only be charged against net recoveries in excess of such offers30 opponents of limiting contingent fees ar gue that such fees enable injured persons faced with medical bills and lost wages to finance lawsuits that they otherwise could not afford especially if their injury has disabled them from working they argue that lawyers are unlikely to file frivolous lawsuits if they stand to recover nothing if they lose and that studies have shown that contingent fees do not encourage frivolous lawsuits31 finally they note an hourly fee arrangement such as defendants lawyers use can courage delay inefficiency and unnecessary action whereas contin gent fee is an added inducement for lawyer to be efficient and expeditious32 creating federal statute of limitations the statute of limitations the period within which lawsuit must be filed for medical malpractice suits under state law is typically two or three years starting on the date of injury sometimes however the symptoms of an injury do not appear immediately or even for years after malpractice occurs many states therefore have adopted discovery rule under which the statute of limitations starts to run only when the plaintiff disc overs or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discove red his injury or some times his injury and its cause plaintiffs would favor allowing statute of limitations to run only upon discovery of an injury and its cause because it may take additional time after symptoms become manifest to discover that an injury was caused by medical malpractice periodic payment of damages traditionally damages are paid in lump sum even if they are for future medical care or future lost wages in recent years however attorneys for

us the periodic payment process34 proposals concerning the periodic paymen t of damages have been applied to future damages as well as to all damages35 an issue that may arise in connection with awards of future damages is whether such awards should be converted to present value not to require such conversion c ould be very major change significantly reducing awards if it is intended to allo w defendant to pay for example 1 million award over 10year period at 100000 year on the other hand if it requires the jury award to be converted in to present value terms an annuity with present value of 1 million the reform doesnt mean that much as practical matter the defendant would be pa ying the same amount as before36 the defendant that is would have to spend 1 million for an annuity that as it earned interest over the years of its distribution would yield the plaintiff more than 1 million had the defendant paid the plaintiff lump sum of 1 million then the plaintiff could have purchased that same annuity the uniform periodic payment of judgme nts act addresses other issues that congress might consider if it addresses the matter of periodic payment of future damages these include accounting for infla tion and for the effect of the plaintiffs death on unpaid amounts section 5a of the uniform act provides that in trial evidence of future changes in the purchasing power of the dollar is admissible on the issue of future damages section 13 provides that liability to claimant for periodic payments not yet due for medical expenses terminates upon the claimants death damages for other economic losses however except in actions for wrongful death must be paid to the plaintiffs estate the housepassed 108th congress legislation provided that the court may be guided by the uniform periodic payment of judgments act promulgated by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws37 pro both defendants and plaintiffs are often benefited by such arrangements the defendant need not immediately pay out large sum of money since the cost of the annuity or other method of paymen t is less than c onventional lumpsum settlement and the plaintiff is prevented from dissipating recovery and is provided secure taxfree income for long period of time without having to assume the costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31692crs11 38 annotation supra note 33 at 96 39

damages and noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases an empty box in the chart indicates that the state apparently imposes cap in medical malpractice suits either because the state constituti on prohibits caps or because the state legislature has chosen not to enact cap we quote in italics some but not necessarily all state constitutional provisions that prohibit caps the caps listed in the chart as well as the entry punitive damages prohibited do not necessarily apply to tort actions ot her than for medical malpractice though in many cases they do the term economic damages refers to past and futu re monetary expenses of an injured party such as medical bills rehabilitation expenses and lost wages noneconomic damages refe rs primarily to damages for pain and suffering economic and noneconomic damages are both compensatory damages ie they are intended to compensate the injured party punitive damages also called exemplary damages by contrast are awarded not to compensate plaintiffs but to punish nd deter particularly egregious conduct on the part of defendants generally meaning reckless disreg ard for the safety of others and more than negligence or even gross negligence punitive damages are noneconomic by nature but state statutes that impose caps on punitive damages usually treat them separately from compensatory noneconomic damages the dollar amount in
