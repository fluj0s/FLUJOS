republic of china examines its effects on the chinese economy surveys us fdi in china and includes discu ssion of policy implications for the united states china by far is the largest recipient of fdi among emerging economies with an inflow of 527 billion in 2002 and 424196 foreignaffiliated firms operating in china representing paidin foreign inve stment of 4480 billion these firms account for about half of chinas exports and im ports nearly 1500 us companies from 41 states have direct investment s of 10 to 34 billion in china for the us congress foreign direct i nvestment in china entails both oversight and regulatory issues some questions with respect to this investment are 1 the extent to which fdi is contributing to chinas economic growth and technology development 2 the extent to which us fdi in china is contributing to the us trade deficit 3 whether fdi inflows into china come at the expense of flows into other countries 4 how fdi is affecting security concerns and 5 whether fdi affects the export of sensitive technology to china foreign direct investment has cont ributed about 13 to chinas economic growth and most of chinas modern technol ogy particularly in electronics has been imported with respect to trade there is little doubt that the large surplus in chinas trade has been generated largely by the rge in its exports of foreign brandname manufactures often made in foreignaffiliate d factories as much as 80 to 90 of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firm s there in terms of the us trade deficit with china american companies there do export some of their output back to the american market but most is sold in china china has been attracting some fdi flows that otherwis could have gone to other developing countries in essence chinas gain may be their loss in terms of security the 20 to 34 billion in us fdi in china combined with 68 billion from taiwan and some 300 billi on from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creating gr oups with strong interest in stability both within china and between china and the united states taiwa n and other potential adversaries foreign direct investment in china affects security primarily through three avenues its contribution to ec onomic power economic interests and technology transfers the more china grows the more funds it is able to provide to its military and attain bigpower status in the world with respect to economic interests foreign companies in china can serve both as hostages for beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue th eir interests in main taining stability with both beijing and their home governments w ith respect to sensitive technologies in the us case it does not appear that prohibited us technologies have been transferred through foreign affiliated companies althoug h the technologies in the electronics and aviation industries that ve been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses such transfers are controlled by export control regimes the highly publicized cases of satellite tec hnology being allegedly illegally transferred to china involved direct transfers from u s corporations to chinese

countries in essence these economies view chinas gain as their loss such concerns have been raised in singapore indonesia mala ysia taiwan south korea and japan7 there is doubt that china has attracted risi ng share of world capital in 2002 china received over 85 of net direct investment in the asiapacific region8 and has accounted for 20 of total fdi in developing economies some i nvestment in china could have been diverted from domestic investment in japan taiwan and south korea much of this investment how ever probably would have gone overseas anyway because of competitive pressures and rising labor co sts and limited market expansion at home countri such as malaysia and indonesia however may have lost somewhat in the bidding war to attract foreign investment the aftermath of the asian financial crisis and domestic political instability in indonesia however also have played strong role in terms of security the 10 to 34 billion in us fdi in china combined with

controlled by export control regimes the highly publicized cases of satellite technology being allegedly ille gally transferred to china involved direct transfers from us corporations to chinese companies10 background china as any other developing country has needed foreign technology for its economic development for the first two postrevolution decades china remained suspicious of foreign capita l and hoped that by importing foreign capital goods and using reverse engineering it could meet its technological needs such policy had limited success even after the opening of ch ina following president nixons visit to beijing in 1972 and the gradual of normalization re lations with the united states and other nations between 1972 and 1978 chin imported equipment and number of new plants from the industrialized west but found only limited success in developing indigenous technology through the reve rse engineering route under deng xiaopings economic reforms attitudes toward foreign capital began to change during the first stage 197983 foreign i nvestment was restricted to four special economic zones shenzhen zhuhai and shantou in guangdong province and xiamen in fujian province in spite of the incentives provided the inflow of fdi remained low an average of only 360 million annually over the fiveyear period during the second stage 198491 hainan is land and fourteen co astal cities in ten provinces were opened to foreign capital11 in 1990 the government eliminated time restrictions on the establishment of joint ventures provided some assurances against nationalization and allowed foreign partners to become chairs of joint ve nture boards in 1991 china granted more preferential tax treatment for wholly fo reignowned businesse s and contractual ventures and also for foreign companies th at invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state such as energy communications andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31749crs4 12 for

special circumstances chinas entr into the world trade organization in december 2001 also stimulated fdi flows into the country financial incentives also are used by the central and regional governments to attract foreign investment these includ reductions in or exemption from central and local taxes and lowering of impor t duties on foreignmade equipment and construction materials12 in its designated priority areas the government also gives preferential treatment to foreign investors currently such areas include agriculture resource development infrastructure nd exportoriented and high technology industries13 on the negative side widespread corruption and bureaucratic hurdles continue to deter foreign investment but the government is trying to remedy the situation by imposing harsh punishment s on corrupt officials who are caught general aspects of chinas market also have added to the ttraction for foreign investment with its 128 billion people nd rapidly rising incomes and purchasing power china presents huge potential ma rket per capita incomes around shanghai and in guangdong province already have r eached an timated us5000 china also possesses comparatively welldeveloped social infrastructure including compulsory nineyear education system that has helped provide supply of reasonably literate workers with some t echnical competence labor is abundant wages low strikes uncommon and discipline problems are rare the eastern and coastal regions of china moreover incl ude sufficient transport and communications facilities for foreign investor s to export goods or distribute them within china in its 2002 fdi confidence index survey of top corporate decisionmakers at kearney business consulting firm found that confidence in china is booming for the first time since the survey bega n in 2002 china surpassed the united states to become the destination most likely to attract investment more than any other country investors held more positive outlook toward china with 46 more optimistic about the chinese market then than in the previous year they are also expected to commit more firsttime investme nts to china than to any other country14 the surge in fdi into china coincided with similar trends worldwide the second half of 1990s saw an unprecedented in crease in the world outflow of foreign capital more than sixfold increase from an annual average of 225 billion during 199095 to 1492 billion in 2000 according to the world investment report wir there were three forces at work all related to globalization first many governments

process was further accelerated by the privatization of governmentowned ente rprises in both deve loped and developing countries second increasing costs of production and vari ous tec hnolog ical developments induced enterprises to spread their operations and risks internationally concurrently the cost of transportation and communications fell thereby enabling firms to locate their production processes in different parts of the world and to supply products parts and accessories from long distances finally increasing competition forced enterprises to enter new markets at an early stage and to transfer some production there to nationalize the product and to reduce production costs these forces also were at work for fdi in china as shown in figure 2 after averag ing around 2 billion per year during198488 fdi flows into china rose dramatically in the 1990s to 469 billion in 2001 and further to 527 billion in 2002 according to chinese statistics in 2001 fdi inflows to china accounted for 6 of th world total and 22 of inflows into developing economies see appendix these fdi flows have been increasing in recent years despite globa l recessionary conditions that caused total world fdi flows to drop nearly by half in 2001 chinese statistics on fdi however diffe r considerably from those of other nations for example as discussed later in this report the us department of commerce shows american direct investment in china at less than third of the level that beijing reports sources of fdi inflow into china most fdi into china comes from either greater china or from the three

join t equity ventures cooperativ joint ventures and wholly foreignowned enterprises in joint ve ntures capital was provided by two or more parties who managed the enterprise and shared in the risk according to their contributions to the capital in the coope rative joint ventures much of the capital was provided by the foreign pa rtner while land building and workable assets were provided by the domestic side the natu re and degree of pa rticipation and the sharing of risk were established in the contract on the stipulated date of termination of the contract all the assets became the property of the chinese side in wholly owned ventures the foreign firm put up all the capital in the 1980s 42 of all fdi into chin was invested in cooperative joint ventures and 39 in joint quity ventures hence 80 of all fdi inflows came into joint ventures of one or the other ty pe investments into wholly foreignowned enterprises accounted for only 10 of the fdi inflows another 10 entered in other

first half of the 1990s reaching around half of total inflows in 1991 after which they decline d initially slowly but by 2002 were only 28 typically in joint enterprises the chinese partner was able to contribute expertise on land and labor acquisitions and political connections necessary to navigate the chinese bureaucratic system as the enterprise developed however such skills became less and less important relative to management and operational skills provided by the foreign partner currently more and more foreign companies are opting to establish whollyowned enterprises over which they have complete control on the other hand ch inese authorities with their growing experience in dealing with foreign enterprises have become more confident in allowing them to operate without nativ partner in add ition the authorities in beijing first keen to enter the world trade organization wto and then required by wto rules have been changing their regulatory regime to make it more consistent with their wto commitments the share of wholly owned enterprises in fdi rose to 60 by 2002 and is likely to continue to rise fdi utilization by sector by far the largest share of fdi inflows into china almost twothirds has been invested in manufacturing foreign investment has moved into china not only to take advantage of the rapidly growing domestic market for consumer goods but also to take advantage of the resour ces in china to manufacture and assemble products particularly parts and accessori to be exported to world markets japanese south korean and taiwanese corporations for example which were facing rising costs for labor and producti on in their home markets and elsewhere in asia have relocated some of their production to china the sectoral mix of fdi moreover is

china ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation chinas attracting foreign investment policychinese can trace their ancestry to the coastal areas one study indicates that three quarters or more of the total fdi in china had come from overseas chinese17 in guangdong province for example proximity to hong kong played large role in attracting fdi economic reform in china virtually coincided with substantial rise in wage levels rents and overhead costs in hong kong this motivated hong kong industries to relo cate to the neighboring guangdong province with its plentiful supply of labor land and electricity also historically the two areas have had close relationships when china was more closed hong kong was guangdongs window to the world and provided technology capital and management skills for companies there many of the chinese in hong kong came from guangdong province both populations speak cantonese rather than beijings mandarin in preparation for hong k ongs reversion to china in 1997 moreover the policy of beijing was to open its terr itory bordering hong kong to foreign investment and trade in order to redu ce the economic gap between guangdong and hong kong and stem pre ssures to emigrate there18 the same is true of fujian province many in taiwan came from that province speak the same chinese dialect and share business methods and culture the boom in economic development and m odernization in the eastern coastal regions of china however has generated huge disparities in income standards of living and opportunities between the eastern regions and those in the middle and west for beijing this is potentially expl osive situation partly because more ethnic minorities eg muslims in the xinjiang uighur autonomous region and tibetans live in the noncoastal regions and because th promise of higherpaying jobs in the east is luring migrants by the millions from other parts of china the stateowned enterprises in the noncoastal regions and th rustbelt northeast moreover often are losing in the competitive battle with more efficient plants along the middle and southern coast this is cau sing considerable labor unrest in partial response to the regional di sparities beijings policy on attracting foreign investment now emphasizes the gging middle and western chinese regions these currently are given priority in sel ecting industries from

of foreign direct investment on chinas domestic economy fdi including reinvested earnings of affiliates has come to play an important role in the chinese economy the problem in determining the pr ecise role of fdi in recent chinese economic development howev er is that it has been part of the general opening of the economy to the world and more marketbased economic system in terms of quantifiable indicator s foreign affiliates now account for nearly quarter of industrial value added nearly fifth of the tax revenue nd almost half of all exports from china32 fdi inflows account for 10 to 15 of chinas total gross fixed capital formation several econometri c studies have atte mpted to estimate how much fdi has contributed to chinese ec onomic growth since fdi still accounts for relatively small percentage of total investment in fixed capital it naturally will have small quantifiable effect on gross domestic product recent study concluded that about 13 of the changes in chinas output can be traced to changes in fdi levels the same study found that fdi had larger effect on chinas exports finding that would be expected given the large role of foreign affiliated firms in exports33 foreign affiliates are by far the largest source of chinas exports of high technology products in 2000 93 of all ex ports of electronic circuits came from foreign affiliated companies in

and development world investment report 2002 annex table vi5 pp 162 from macroeconomic perspective fdi plays dual role in easing the foreign exchange constraint faced by most developing nations this constraint is the lack of foreign exchange to pay for imports and repay past borrowing that places bounds on the rate of economic growth and has been at the heart of financial crises that have occurred in latin american asian and afri can nations nation generates foreign exchange by exporting more than it imports and by attracting capital for direct and portfolio investment in 2001 chin added 43 billion to its foreign exchange reserves total of 286 billion at the nd of 2002 this 43 billion was generated primarily by 174 billion current account surplus including 34 b illion merchandise trade surplus and 374 billion net direct i nvestment inflow inflows minus outflows of 97 billion that offset 194 billion deficit in portfolio investment36 fdi contributed both to chinas rplus in investment inflows and to its surplus in trade without fdi china would probably have f aced severe shortage of foreign exchange and likely would have had to curtail its rapid growth this

deflation to the world economy currently hong kong japan singapore and to lesser extent the united states and europe have been grappling with the ffects on deflation on their economies the theory is that chinas lowpriced exports of products also manufactured in other nations is driving down prices and causing weakness in consum ption and depressing profits37 the low prices for chinas exports can be maintained primarily because chinas currency is pegged to the dollar and this peg can be sustained because of chinas surplus in trade inflows of fdi and the governments accumulation of foreign exchange some analysts have cast doubts on the ability of china to export deflation but on microeconomic basis the undercutting of prices by imports from china is being observed in many countries in

chinese firms that have coproduction agreements with foreign fi rms also produce military aircraft air traffic control or global positioning systems developed for the civilian aviation sector also may assist in upgrading military capabilities however as the commerce department report points out chinas abilities and reputation in terms of military aircraft manufacturing and reverse engin eering

that even where technological capability is being transferred most of the eu companies interviewed felt that it would take more than three years and in some cases more than ten years before china

on certain issues such as opposing economic sanctions one likely place that hostilities might occur involving china is along the taiwan strait investment relations between the prc and taiwan therefore are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining stability on both sides taiwanese businesses have invested an officially recognized 688 billion in the mainland since 1990 primarily in the coastal provinces of fujian and guangzhou and in shanghai private estimates place the figure at as high as 100 billion49 most of this investment was routed through hong kong or tax havens both to avoid political complications and to secure incentives and protection accorded foreign investors the taiwanese government estimates th at more than 400000 taiwanese business related persons and their

politician the strategy of china has been to facilitate this investment and to allow taiwanese companies to earn higher profits than comparable investments from other nations taiwans ruling democratic

mainland is growing at 7 to 8 taiwans growth rate has dropped in half to about 3 chinas development on the other nd appears to be giving beijing more confidence and less incentive to use the taiwan
