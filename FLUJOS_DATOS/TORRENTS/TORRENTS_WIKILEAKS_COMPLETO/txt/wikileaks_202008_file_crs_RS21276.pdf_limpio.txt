president bush has indicated that he will sign the repor ted bill into law this report examines the conference re port provisions governing the homestead exemption and dischargeability of liability for violation of laws relating to the provision of lawful goods and services the homestead exemption the senate version of hr 333 added federal cap to state homest ead exemptions of 125000 the house version imposed cap ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21276crs2 100000 only on debtor who transfers his or her domicile and residence within two years of the bankruptcy filing presumably to take advantage of another states more generous homestead exemption in additi on the house version imposed lengthened residency requirements to qualify for stat homestead exemption and reduced the value of the exemption if the value was attri butable to property that the debtor disposed of within seven years of filing in bankruptcy with the intent to hinder delay or defraud creditors the conference report abandons the senate s federal cap on homestead exemptions and continues to permit stat optout it more closely tracks the house version but provides in order to claim state exemptions the debtor must be domiciliary in given state for 730 days rather than the current 180 days if debtors domicile has not been located within single state for 730 days approx 2 years then the domiciliary state may be where the debtors domicile was located for 6 months preceding the twoyear period if the debtor has not resided in any state long enoug h to establish residency under the provision the debtor may elect fe deral exemptions 307 this provision is identical to current provisions in the house and senate bills the conferences compromise between federal homestead cap and 7 year lookback for fraudulent conversions of assets appears in 308 the conference version has 10 year l ookback for fraudulent conversions of nonexempt property into an exempt homestead if it can be shown that the debtor disposed of property th at would be nonexempt within10 years of filing with the intent to hinder delay or defraud creditor the exempt homestead will be reduced to the extent that value is attributable to the fraudulent conversion debtor electing state homestead exemption may not exempt any interest acquired within 1215 days of filing which exceeds in the aggregate 125000 unless the value in excess of that amount occurs from transfer of residences within the same state exempts family farmers from the limit 322 the conference adds new provision to 322 which caps homestead exemptions at 125000 if the debtor has been convicted of felony which demonstrates that the bankruptcy filing was an abuse of the code or if the debtor owes 1 debt for violations of securities law 2 debt for fraud deceit or manipulation in fiduciary capacity or in connection with the purchase or sale of specified securities 3 debt for any civil remedy under 18 usc 1964 or 4 debt for any criminal act intentional tort or willful or reckless misconduct that caused serious injury within the preceding five years the cap does not apply to any amount reasonably necessary for the s upport of the debtor and his or her

amendment to pe nding bankruptcy reform legislation1 senate amendment 2763 entitled nondischargeability of debts incurred through the commission of violence at clinics known as the schumer amendment

ruction of property of health care facility or actual or alleged violati on of court order or injunction that protects access to reproductive health facilities floor debate at the adoption of this amendment makes clear that its proponents sought to ensure that civil liability arising from disruption of and violence against abortion service providers or consumers could not be discharged in

rsion of the legislation hr 2415 106th cong 2d sess 2000 which omitted the schumer amendment president clinton pocket vetoed the bill citing the absence of the nondischargeability provisions for liability for abortion clinic violence as being among his reasons for doing so6 the schumer amendment in the 107th congress the senate bankruptcy reform bill introduced in the 107th congress did not include the schumer amendment7 during the course of twoday mark up by the senate judiciary committeecongressdaily reported sen charles schumer dny offered an amendment designed to prevent groups that disrupt or damage abortion clinics from paying court judgments against them by declaring bankruptcy committee chairman orrin hatch rutah proposed more general amendment that would apply to vi olence against all buildings not limited to reproductive health fac ilities but action was taken as aides labored to devise compromise language drawn fro m the two competing proposals8 at the conclusion the senate judiciary committee reported clean bill which included revised version of the schumer amendment9 again as reported by congressdaily one amendment worked out between sen hatch and sen charles schumer dny would prevent perpetrators of violence ag ainst abortion clinics or against anyone performing legal services from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying courtordered fines or judgments it was adopted by voice vote schumers initial amendment was narrower aimed mainly at reproductive hea lth clinics the compromise version does not mention abortion clinics10 the compromise language reported out of the senate judiciary committee was ultimately included in the senate passed version of hr 333 107th cong 1st sess 328 2001 as noted above the provision longer made reference to commission of violence at clinics the language was broadened and restyled as nondischargeability of debts incurred through violations of ws relating to the provision of lawful goods and services although the language cites the face act 18 usc 247 248 it addresses activities directed at providers and consumers of lawful goods and serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21276crs5 specifically it would amend 11 usc 523 by adding new subsection 19 that would provide in relevant part th at debt is nondischargeable 19 that results from any judgment order consent order or decree entered in any federal or state court or contained in any settlement agreement entered into by the debtor including any courtordered damages fine penalty citation or attorney fee or cost owed by the debtor arising from an action alleging the violation of an federal state or local statutory law including but not limited to violations of sections 247 and 248 of title 18 that results from the debtors i harassment of intimidation of interfe rence with obstruction of injury to threat to or violence against any person i because that person provides or has provided lawful goods or services ii because that person is or has been obtaining lawful goods or services or iii to deter that pers on any other person or class of persons from obtaining or providing lawf ul goods or services or ii damage or destruction of property of facility providing lawful goods or services or b violation of court order or injunction that protects access to facility that provides lawful goods or services or th provision of lawful goods or services the amendment also added the proviso that nothing in paragraph 19 shall be construed to affect any expr essive conduct including peacef ul picketing or other peaceful demonstration protected from legal pr ohibition by the first amendment of the constitution of the united states the conference report the version of hr 333 passed by the house did not have comparable provision the schumer amendment in the sena bill provided the basis for housesenate compromise yet reaching consensus over compromise on this issue promised to be deal breaker extensive negotiations took place under the leadership of sen schumer and rep hyde it was repor ted in the press that the conference had reached agreement on the enti re bill but for the schumer amendment rep hyde and sen schumer pparently agreed that anti abortion protesters should not be able to file for bankruptcy to escape fines and civil penalties for acts or threats of violence but they disagreed on the extent to which protesters who file for bankruptcy should be compelled to pay judgment s for nonviolent acts of protest nevertheless compromise was reach ed and the bill was reported out of conference as in the senate bill reference in the conference report is made to laws relating to the provision of lawf ul goods and services th approach is threepronged it makes nondischargeable liability that results from any judgment order consent order or decree entered in any federal or state court or contained in any settlement agreement entered into by the debtor including any c ourtordered damages fi ne penalty or attorney fee or cost owed by the btor that arises from intentional actions of the debtor that i by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction intentionally inju re intimidate or interfere with or attempt to injure intimidate or inte rfere with any person because that person is or has been or in order to intimidate such person or any other person from obtaining or providing wful goods or services or anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21276crs6 person lawfully exercising the first amendment right of religious freedom at place of religious worship intentional damage or struction of property or an attempt to do so because facility provides lawful g oods or services or is place of religious worship and intentional knowing or repeated vi olation of court protective order or injunction as in the senate version it expressl excludes from coverage any expressive conduct including peaceful picketing peaceful prayer or other peaceful demonstration protected from legal prohibition by the first amendment to the constitution of the united states the major distinction between the conferen ce report and the sena provision is the requirement in the conferences 330 that the debtors actions be intentional with respect to personal injury and property da mage it omits reference to the face act specifically and refers instead to violations of title 18 it omits the senate reference to liability from judgments ba sed upon allegations of harassment intimidation interference etc and it omits referen ce to harassment as ground for imposing liability for nondischargeable debt subsequent to the filing of the conf erence report rene wed opposition to the schumer amendment has arisen the concerns expressed ar those which have followed the provision throughout the 107th congress namely its sc ope and the extent to which the language encompasses nonviolent protest in addition several unions have weighed in against the measure saying it would have chilling effect on labor civil rights and environmental demonstrators
