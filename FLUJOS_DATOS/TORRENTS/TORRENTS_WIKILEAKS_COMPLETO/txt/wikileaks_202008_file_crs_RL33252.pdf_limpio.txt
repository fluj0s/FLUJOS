important not just for germany but also for europe and global economic health experts believe that angela merkel as chancellor wants to speed domestic social and economic reforms it is not clear whether she will have broader domestic support to do so especially among the spd base many observers expect more continuity than change in german foreign policy under the grand coalition government on

results the election gave party the necessary majority with its preferred coalition partner although the christian demo cratic unionchristian social union cducsu got the most votes by slim margin it had an unexpectedly weak showing compared to preelection polls and in light of the general disgruntlement with the previous government analysts attributed the weak showing to the fact that voters were deeply skeptical of whether cducsu government could accomplish more than its predecessor and were also worried about some of the cdu reform ideas according to official results th cducsu received 352 percent of the vote barely beating out the social democrats spd with 343 percent of the vote this left neither party in position to form government with just its most likely coalition partner the free

coalition agreement on the outlines of the government program specific policies and priorities of the new government were considered likely to evolve as conditions demanded some experts believe that the coalition will be fragile short lived and unable to do much w ith each side trying to block the other some critics are skeptical about angela merkel s strength as leader in view of her relative inexperience and perceived inability to inspire people other observers believe that she is being seriously underestimate d and may prove t ough and effective in fact her image has already improved significantly since she assumed office as the voters have seen her in action11 both parties appear to have vested interest in making the government work to overcome the seeming repudiation of each by the voters furthermore the difficult choices that need to be made to curb spending and reinvigorate the economy may require the support of super majority which the grand coalition represents with its combined strength and the weakness and fragmented nature of the new opposition th government shoul d have little trouble putting its policies into effect if the cducs u and spd can agree but that is major question the new government represents significant change in the german political power structure woman is leading germany for the first time in history also for the first time political leaders from the former east germany will wield unprecedented influence holding the chan cellorship and number of other key positions some commentators emphasize that the election results confirm the end of decades of postworld war two german consensus that in the past gave german politics great deal of predictability and st ability in the run up to the 2005 elections the spd was seen as having moved sharpl to the left since the election the compromises needed to forge grand coalition also forced the cducsu to move somewhat to the left others see the movement by voters away from the two largest parties as sign of polarization12 most important to some experts the new cast of leaders represents generational change from the group that came into its own during the 1960s many of whom on the left of th spectrum were from the radical protest movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s to generation that came of age after the fall of the berlin wall in 198913 some expect that angela merkel and other politicians of her generation w ill be more open and flexible in their outlook than their predecessors some see irony in the like lihood that germanys efforts at renewal may now be spearheaded by those raised in the east the cdu and spd do agree on some important issues one is the need for reform of the unwieldy german federal system where states rights and

for clearer delineation of federa l and state responsibilities they advocate placing such things as environmental protecti on and some police powers exclusively under the central government the two parties have already worked together in the bundesrat in an attempt to make it easier for the various po lice and security agencies to cooperate in combating terrorism14 currently some 60 percent of legislation falls under th jurisdiction of both the bundestag and the bundesrat once planne d changes to the federal system are implemented it is believed that the majority of legislation will require approval only by the bundestag rather than by both chambers15 the bundestag is the lowerchamber elected nationally and having the principal legislative role the bundesrat is made up of re presentatives appointed by the fifteen state laender governments and is the body in which the interests of the states are represented because most recent state elections were won by the cdu the christian democrats form decisive majority in the bundesrat state elections are not concurrent with federal elections so only the bundestag changed as result of the september 2005 election economic and social policy some commentators interpreted the 2005 ection results as popular rejection of reform others disputed that view arguing that th election was not referendum on reform that the voters understood the n eed for reform and that most parties campaigned on reform platforms in f act recent german marshall fund survey supports the view that most germans reco gnize the need and are eager for genuine reform of the social and economic sy stem among major european countries german citizens are least averse to reform according to the poll16 the most difficult and crucial areas on wh ich

stability and growth pact experts believe that angela merkel as chancellor remains committed to tax social welfare and labor market refo rms even though the coalition government agreement does not spell out those reforms she has publicly advocated cutting the income tax rates at the top and at the bottom and compensating for the shortfall by raising the valueadded tax as has been agreed by the coalition partners and eliminating number of special tax breaks in order to create jobs and reduce unemployment she will seek to bring down labor costs among other things by shifting part of health care costs from employers to workers she got coalition agreement to gradually raise the retiremen t age from 65 to 67 such steps have the support of business leaders who have long called for similar changes17 it is not clear whether they will have broader support pecially among the spd base even many in the cducsu are wary of sweeping labor reforms there is an urgent need to reduce unemployment from its average level of over 11 percent spd officials who head the labor and finance ministries are likely to receive strong pressure from the spds core labor constituency to try to preserve labor rights and benefits forecasts by several economic institutes predicted little immediate improvement in german economic performance in 200618 eastern germany continues to lag far behind the west and has much higher unemployment rate still many economists have become more optimistic concerning the prospects for german ec onomic reform and recovery many predict that the german economy will rebound regardless of what the government does due both to restru cturing that has already been completed and to the expected rebound in the world ec onomy these economists argue that the reforms that chancellor schroe der instituted are more far reaching than he is given credit for and that the economic benefits from these reforms will soon be felt they also point out that within the corporate and private sectors major reforms have already been instituted that will have positive impact in 2003 the schroeder government risking the support of its co re labor constituency introduced what were widely seen as necessary and long overdue reforms designed to overhaul the pension system loosen labor laws re duce unemployment benefits and cut back expenditures on the health care system and tax

implementation of further radical tax and labor market re forms and containment of health care costs they worry that the government and public might lose the sense of urgency about reform among the most acute pressures for reform especially of the social welfare and pension system are the serious demographic challenges that germany faces with its ageing population recent organiza tion for economic cooperation and development oecd study warned that th ageing of the population could lead to lower economic growth strains on public finances and shortages of skilled labor21 the new government will be challenged by number of related social issues inorder to take care of its ageing popula tion germany needs to expand its younger work force substantially which at this point may be possible only by bringing in foreign labor germany society however remains resistant to substantial immigration thus germanys attitude to accepting and inte grating immigrants including substantial muslim minority remains pressing issue for the merkel government the previous german government adopted new immigration and citizenship laws which for the first time established process by which foreigners in germany could gain permanent residency and eventual citizenship however germany has yet to assimilate immigrants into german society especially the countrys expanding muslim minority the 33 million muslims mostly turks now make up about 35 percent of the german population with birth rate three times higher than for ethnic germ ans the muslim population is expected to roughly double by 2015 22 many of these muslims view germ an society as unwilling to fully accept them unemployment and poverty are mu ch higher in the german muslim community than in other segments of so ciety especially among the youth german concern is growing over the radicalization of some young muslims and the potential emergence in their midst of an increasin gly hostile and aliena ted population possibly susceptible to terrorist recruitment many germans see the muslim community as refusing to accept german norms and values and as wanting to stay apart from the majority population23 foreign policy many observers expect more continuity than change in german foreign policy under the grand coalition government on most issues the cducsu and the spd are not far apart in addition foreign policy is not likely to be the highest priority on the new governments agenda as it seeks to deal with pressing domestic problems however angela merkel is already seen as bringing some changes in

merkel is seeking to restore the balance she has stated repeatedly that progress in eu integration should not come at the expense of the transatlantic partne rship and other members of the cducsu have
