scientology courses has been very useful to in becoming better doctor and happier more effective person in my exper ience scientology is utterly practical and noncoercive is contrast to this the fbi has been heavily attacking the of scientoloffi recenty they have raided 2 churches armed jwith chain saws and sledge hammers kept one of the national church leaders in jail for 8 months asd rumor has it that the attorney hgeneral is about to start indicting more national church officials for what t i2 im very concerned bemuse dwit is my church and has helped and i hate to see it attacked and 2 it seems to tfeait there are constitutional rights being violated left and right ie freedom of religion freedom of thepress newspaper files were raided etc it worries that in us in 1978 government officials can so cavalierly raid church doing physical damage totally out of proportion to wat was necessary that churches have met such great resistance from government agencies when they tried to use the freedom of information act to correct misinformation about scientology which exists throughout government data banks h it seems to that the fbi mast be working off of distorted information could you check this out and write togr2 ft attorney general and express concern or to subcommittee investi hgating fbi abuses is there anything you can think of you could do jto help us get this

affidavit of special agent russell cicerp of the fbi in new york he was given the following information by agent joseph varairjof the angeles office of the fbi _ 1 three members of the church of

mr held csic and one week in the case of ima package of documentation and evidence of the falsity of these statements is attached to this letter while such information might be laughable in other circumstances these reports create fugitives where none in fact exist and subject the named individuals to being treated as person enclosure ii 7w 0 ipage two who are or will flee in the face of lawful process of tit courts law enforcement officer fbi or other wise who believes the person he seeks is fleeing is more apt to take violent andor intrusive action to carry opt his orders thus by the fabrication of the referenced false reports agent varley and any others who contributed to them and their distribution have maliciously placed the lives safety families and property of undersigned at risk the only explanation for this action other than mali cious intent is an extreme of incompetence approaching keystone cop proportions that four agents spent nine full days waiting outside the residences of eeldt and mele to serve subpoenas on them when they were in fact passing to anckrom their fcomes without any awareness of tfels surveillance givers rise to visions of agents parked n the wrong street visiting the local tavern or siqg fup qp their sleep that fbi agents could assume that lake1 willrson and weigand all married the later two with children took up residence at scien tology facilities when at amature bill collector could have found ost otherwise is simply unbelievable the above wakes it obvious thatthere may be delays should the fbi attempt to locate any of us in the

r on entering one of them introduced himself to the receptionist s suss and asked to sec paula tyler on personal matter when i asked them the purpose of their visit theyinsisted that it was personal matter and they could only speak to paula after i repeated the same question three times bob asked if x was irving paiewonsky and when i answered negatively he said he would speak to irving when x refused to allow that to occur with nod from hob russ pulled out his badge and said that they were fox agents and had subpoena for paula tyler when i stated that x could not 4how subpoena to be served on church premises i was tojd that x was obstructing justice and the implication ws clear that f might be in quite bit of trouble muss then left to call ocnise cote their superior and returned to say that bvnise wanted to take action against rue unless i allowed the sub poena to be served this statement was contradicted few minutes later when ituss told bob that denise had been in court and he had not been able to reach her although x have training in legal matters x believe it is illegal to enfcer church premises or any private property under false pretenses and clearly the reectancc of russ and hob to state that they were from the pdx seen odd and deceitful and the lies that were told as above seem stupid in the extreme group ch their it is totally beyoihd myderstanding how two that we

of scientology international the hcther church of the scientology religion recently ms gail armstrong of one of our churches of jscientology supplied fbi field offices with booklets concerning ithe scientology religion and the religions founder l ron jhubfcard in good faith effort to ensure that the fbi possesses timely socurate and complete information concerning scientology this is of great importance to the church as the fbi has routinely disseminated inaccurate and derogatory information concerning that scientology religion in response to generic inquiries from domestic and foreign authorities i as writing to you on behalf of the church because i was exureaeiy dismayed by the refusal cf the bureaus freedciu of information privacy section cfei 3 kevin oien to even consider placing these booklets in the files of the1 church and mr huboard according to kr obrien as the privacy act i does not apply to grpups the fi has authority to take ipuch action for the ctjurch this sitiori is eiurd if the information contained in an oryaniztions fbi file xe clearly unreliable and inaccurate the fbi would be powerless to correct the inaccuracies in the file surely the bureaus legitimate law enforcement interests cannot be served by the maintenance and dissemination of unreliable and inaccurate information to ether agencies s 111 i 11 t mr obrienr position indicates that the bureaus informationgathering activities concerning groups is undefined unchecked and unregulated by any standards and procedures this is disturbing the central conclusion of congressional

rhe committees fundamental evflcsuae attached mji hollywood bollevard suite woo angeles ca j tfuhose 2u96oj5flo fax 21 honorable wiv december 18 page 2s sessions conclusion is that intelligence activities have undermined the constitutional rights of citizens and that they have done so primarily because checks and balances designed by the framers of the constitution to ensure accountability have not been applied1 mr obriens position also directly conflicts with attorney general guidelines and fbi policies concerning the first amendment rights of groups indeed mr director you emphasized the first amendment rights of organizations such as the church in your testimony before the senate select committee on intelligence in hearings concerning the fbi investigation of the committee in solidarity with the people of salvador cispgs at that time you stated to congress that you initiated changes in fbi procedures and policies to ensure that fbi activities do not infringe on the first amendment including instituting first amendment training courses and ensuring that the information collected on organizations is reliable courts have als6 long recognised that the constitutional rights of groups are infringed by inaccurate or unreliable information designed to stigmatize members who associate with the groups the records maintained by the bureau concerning the church represent an unwarranted departure from these policies the bureau has accumulated repository of uniformly untrue unverified and irrelevant information rife with innuendo and rumor which when disseminated to foreign or domestic agencies with the imprimatur of the fbi fosters false impression of tne church this inevitably impairs and impedes the churchs religious mission and leads to adverse action against members of the religion based solely on their beliefs and affiliation although inclusion of these booklets in the fbi files on the church does not remotely suffice to remedy the situation at least it will allow foia requester or other recipient to receive some accurate and uptodate information on the religion the church should be entitled to the same neutral and unbiased treatment afforded other bona fide religions the church has supplied similar information to the fbi in the past without the type of objection raised by mr obrien mr obriens position raises significant policy question that requires your personal intervention and leadership mr director the fbi should not refuse to ensure that its records on groups are reliable and accurate if the fbi has the power to create collect and disseminate information on groups then surely it has the power to correct such information as well courts have ordered expungement or correction of such information by the fbi when constitutional rights are infringedhonorable december 18 page 3bps sessions you have acknowledged the paramount importance of first amendment rights and the need to ensure that the bureau adheres to these rights in your testimony to congress these rights must not be ignored whenever an organization can demonstrate that information perpetuated in its files is unreliable and reflects an improper ideological bias as you stated in december 12 1988 airtel regarding the church religious commentary outside the scope of fbi investigative responsibilities should not be the subject of investigation or reporting there can be question that the fbi has the power to place this information in the churchs files as you have acknowledged mr director the fbi is not powerless to adhere to the supreme law of the land the

because your letter principally concerns the maintenance and dissemination of information by the federal bureau of investigation fbi as well as the fact that there is pending litigation involving the fbi and hurch of scientology it has been referred to my office for response initially i would iie to advise you that as your letter raised numerous concerns involving fbi operations and policy thorough examination requiring significant amount of time and effort fey agency personnel was required such review by the fbi necessitated delay in responding until now i am sure you appreciate the fbis desire to be as responsiveto your inquiry as possible you can be assured that the concerns addressed in your letter were thoroughly evaluated prior to this response as correctly stated in your letter the fbi is tasked by federal law and regulation to investigate violations of federal law in carrying out this responsibility the fbi has broad mandate yet is also governed in certain areas by specific law and regulations in he area of record collection maintenance and dissemination which seems to be significant concern of je church of scientology the fbi is required by statute and regulations to document agency operations policy activities and transactions and to maintain records acquired or created in the course of conducting agency operationsbusiness mr baker attni mr

correspondence which can often ncompass complaint of criminal activity substantiated or unsubstantiated by facts borne out or not borne out by subsequent investigation unsolicited correspondence received by the fbi often contains the personal opinion impressions or interpretations of the facts by the writer nevertheless the haracter or origin of such correspondence does not relieve the fbi of its statutory obligation to maintain such documentation or conduct the appropriate investigation moreover the fbi as federal agency which performs as its principal function the enforcement of federal law is authorized and has elected to exempt itself from the statutory obligation to maintain in its investigative records system only such information about an individual as is relevant nd necessary to accomplish its mandated functions and to collect information i the greatest extent possible directly froft the subject individual himself the privacy act pa ttle 5 united states code usc section

its founder lafayette ronald hubbard in the central records system at fbi headquarters has determined that these documents have been compiled and maintained for legitimate criminal investigative andor administrative purposes this determination has been the subject of civil litigation and federalcourts have affirmed the fbis position we believe that the dissemination of such information in response to official requests bylaw enforcement agencies and in accordance with the disclosure requirements of the freedom of information act foia title 5 usc section 52 has been in accordance with all applicable laws and department of justice poj regulations the foia requires the fbi to discloste record informa tion not specifically exempt from disclosure pursuant to certain statutory exceptions because of mr hubbards prominent position within the organization the loss of privacy under the foia following his death and the lack of privacy rights accorded to organizations much of the information concerning mr hubbard and the church of scientology is subject to public disclosure the records released pursuant to the foia as well as the summaries produced in response to official inquiries which would also be subject to foia requests record the fbis interactions with mr hubbard his organizations inquiries and complaints by individuals as well as the investigations of certain persons suspected or accused of criminal activities when the fbi releases record information subject to the pa such disseminations are made in accordance with allreverend heber jentzsch applicable statutory requirements also when disseminations of information are made to other agencies or foreign governments the fbi advises the authorized recipient in writing that the information conveyed does

government or the fbi n the content of investigative record information when disclosed to the public through the foiaf or to other federal agencies or agencies of foreign governments for law enforcement purposes in response to your proposal that the fbi correct or expunge its records concerning the church of scientology i must point out that the foia contains provisions for the amendment

correction of records sucis corrective action however is only available to 4n individual as defined by the pa and the organization you represent isnot an individual as defined under the pa there are provisions in the pa that prevent the maintenance of information concerning an organization additionally you shouldbe aware that the disposal of agency records is also governed by specific laws and

regulations and plans for the disposal of all agency records the fbi akes every effort to collect and maintain records in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations such laws and regulations strike balance between the rights of individuals and the investigatory responsibilities of federal law enforcement agencies as you have correctly recounted in your letter members of the church of scientology have been the subjects of federal criminal investigation and prosecution consequently information pertaining to certain members of the church as well as the church of scientology itself

noted that in response to foxa requests concerning the church of scientology the fbi discloses in addition to other responsive records compilation of materials provided by the church concerning its activities the fbi considers this course of action reasonable and in conformance with the foia it is hoped that this response satisfies your inquiry in view pf the fbis stated operational and legal positions in this atter particularly as regards the issue of expunction we do not believe that fleeting between agency and church representatives to discuss the latter would be useful sincerely yours

with out knowing the full arvedon story and hou the fbi assisted arvedon in his socalled kidnapmurder scheme my testimony nd defense quest ions concerning f3i coistctpro involvement would cause the

forget about the kidnapmurder scheme and only charge arvedon with interstate transportation of stolen cheques arvedon was never charged with the kidnap conspiracy because it would have expose4 the

and giving information to the worlds most notorious terrorist nations in this our bicentennial year the united states is prime tar get for terrorist attacks there have been threats received and bombings are growing frighteningly large in number while the fbi is ging to extremesto fight this expcted onslaught of terrorist activity in an effort to bring this to more l5cal front we are sending this report to local police departments to inform yott of the grave dangers of supplying id formation to interpol the information revealed by our investigation has sparknd five congressional investigations massachusetts is currently drafting legislation to protect police in that state from having to give information to interpol in addition rep edward beard of rhode island has proposed legislation that would severly limit interpols _ powfi so you see this daa is pertinent and it would be consid ered risky to not look into it carefully we have provided yojj with this report as part

nazi war criminals not suprising when you know its president from 196837 paul dickopf was an ss officer 337259 unti1 he t fled gerasby when he apparently sensed the tide of victory turning there is clause in interpols constitution stating hit is strictly forbidden for the organization to undertake any intervention or activities of political military religious or racial character this is the clause they use to justify their refusal to help apprehend nhz war criminals and to explain their refusal to fight terrorism other crimes dont seem to ml into this nren although obviously being political racial military or religious interpol has extensive files on jews and catholics and they helped czeehosltvnkin apprehend political refugees in 1950 in 1969 members of bermudas parliament
