spending less on official mail costs during nonelection years than during electionyears figure 3 however analysis of monthly data on offi cial mail costs indicates that due to the structure of the fis cal year calendar comparisons of election year and nonelection year mailing data tend to overstate the effect of preelection increases in mail costs because it also captures the effect of large spike in mail costs from december of the previous calendar year the analysis demonstrates that be tween fy2000 and fy2007 higher official mail costs in evennumbered fiscal years occurred for two reasons general increase in monthly mail costs prior to the preel ection prohibited period and significant spike in costs during december of oddnumbere d years both increases were largely the result of an increase in the number of house members sending mass mailings during those months during the past 20 years franking refo rm efforts reduced franking expenditures in both evennumbered and oddnumbered years table 2 evennumbered year franking expenditures have been re duced by almost 70 from 1134 million in fy1988 to 343 million in f2006 while oddnum bered year franking expenditures have been

privilege which allows memb ers of congress to send official mail via the us postal service at gove rnment expense has its roots in 17th century great britain the british house of commons instituted it in 16601 in the united states the practice dates from 1775 when the first c ontinental congress passed legislation giving its members mailing privileges so as to communicate with their constituents2 congress continues to use the franking privilege to help members communicate with their constituents the communicati ons may include letters in response to constituent requests for information newsle tters regarding legislation and member votes press releases about official member activities copies of the congressional record and government reports and noti ces about upcoming town meetings organized by members the franking privilege is regulated by federal law house and senate rules regulations of the committee on house administration and the senate rules and administration committee and regulations of the senate select committee on ethics and the house commission on congressional mailing standards the franking privilege may only be used for matters of public concern or public service3 it may not be used to solicit votes or contribu tions to send mail regarding campaigns or political parties or to mail autobiographical or holiday greeting materials although few would argue with the inte nt behind the frank to help members better communicate with their constituents the privilege in recent years has been subjected to increased public criticism and extensive scrutiny by the media proponents of fra nking argue that without the privilege most members could not afford to send important information to their constituents in effect curtailing the delivery of ideas reports assistance and services opponents concerned with incumbent perquisites mail costs and the overall cost of congre ss have called for additional changes to the franking privile ge including an outright ban on franking for members and prohibition on us of the frank in election years significant reforms have been adopted as consequence of this debate although the cost of official congressiona l mail has fluctuated widely over the past 30 years franking reform efforts have produced almost 70 reduction in evenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34188crs2 4 official mail costs

fy2006 and fy2007 official mail costs fy2005 to fy2007 despite common public perception franking is not free congress pays the us postal service for franked mail through nnual appropriations for the legislative branch each chamber makes an allotment to members from these appropriations in the senate the allocation process is administered by the committee on rules and administration in the house by the committee on house administration official mail costs overall congressional mail costs include official mail sent by members both regular and mass mail committees and chamber officers4 during

prohibited period for the 2006 general election figure 1 demonstrates that the higher mail costs in fy2006 result from two separate events general increase in monthly mail costs prior to the preelection prohibited period and significant sp ike in costs during december of 2005 both of these increases are largely due to increased mass mailings by members of the house during those periods house member mass mailings made during the first quarter of fy2006 octoberdecembe r cost 88 million dollars compared to an average of 32 million over the four quarters of fy2007 and 30 million over the four quarters of fy2005 house member mass mailings made during the second 51 million and third 68 million quarter s of fy2006 also were significantly higher than the fy2007 or fy2007 quarterly average critics of the franking privilege have of ten cited increased electionyear mail costs as evidence of political use of the frank prior to elections9 although mail costs do rise in the months prior to the preelection prohibited period figure 1 shows that the structure of the fiscal calendar is also important in creating large disparities between election year and non election year mail costs since the fiscal years run from octobe r 1 to september 30 both the december spike in mail costs and the preelection rise in mail costs occur in the same fiscal year despite taking place in different calendar years and different sessions of congress table 1 compares mail costs in 2006 and 2007 measured by fiscal and calendar year table 1 official mail costs by fiscal year and calendar

plotted on the same scale as figure 4 demonstrates the relatively low costs of senate official mail in comparison to house official mail costs these lower costs are attributable to proportionally fe
