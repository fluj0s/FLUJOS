in online music delivery introduction at the height of its popular ity napster captured the publics fancy for many especially young pe ople and college students napster became synonymous with online music it popular ized music delivery over the internet it demonstrated the ease and convenience with which consumers could select songs from vast music repertories and it made what had been the unrealized notion of completely customized personal music cds reality in copyright infringement litigation of widespread interest the federal courts ruled that napster violated the copyright interests of the music industr and performing artists whose songs were being freely exchanged1 but the widespread popularity of napste r made its mark as result the avowed goal of those within and without th music industry is to see the development of convenient meaningful and lawful access to services on the internet2 early in the 107th congress both the house and th senate held hearings on the legal and technical obstacles to streamlined and expanded online music delivery on april 3 2001 the senate judiciary co mmittee held hearing entitled online entertainment coming soon to digital device near you3

statutory requirements are satisfied compulsory license is available at statutory rates many copyright owners and the us copyright office however are generally against expanding compulsory licensing

of the basic components of copyright rights relative to online music transmission for example parties disagree over the new statutory language of digital audio transmi ssion and how traditional

developments in the us copyright offices interpretation of compulsory licensing provisions under 17 usc 112 114 and 115 background the complexities of music licensing while almost all people acknowledge an intellectual propert ownership interest in those who contribute their creative talents to the worl d of music few outside the music industry appreciate the legal complexity of copyri ght ownership intere sts and responsibilities the copyright act confers discrete exclus ive rights on different types of expressive media the owner of musical composition whi ch is the underlying song on sound recording has the exclusive right to do or to authorize reproduction of the copyrighted work preparation of derivative works based on the copyrighted work distribution of copies to the public by sale rental lease or lending performance of the work publicly and display of the work publicly8 the owners of rights in sound recordings have an exclusive right to control reproduction and distribution of th eir recordings but they do not have the same public performance right as composers in the case of sound recordings the public performance right is qualified and limited it covers performance of the work publicly by means of digital audio transmission9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31029crs4 10al kohn bob kohn kohn on music licensing 11 3rd ed 2002 see also kohn primer on the law of

music publisher in this case warnerchappell music inc11 in order to record version of ive got you under my skin permission must be obtained from warnerchappell many performers have recorded di fferent

station need not pay royalties to reprise records assume however that the radio station wishes to reproduce and distribute copies of frank sinatras recording of ive got you under my skin for promotional purposes the composermusic publisher has the right to control the reproduction and distribution of the underlying compos ition the song and the sound recording copyright holder has the right to contro l reproduction and distribution of the sound recording hence permission would be needed from both rights holders obtaining permission to use song is separate undertaking from permission to use sound recording12 in addition to what can be complicated matter of identifying rights holders one seeking permission to use copyrighte d music may negotiate wide variety of different types of licensing agreements again the license will reflect which of the rights holders exclusive rights are imp licated depending upon the nature of the intended use13 in most instances the

interactive services may be related some guidelines for determining what rvice is are established by the statute the ability of an individual to request that pa rticular sound recording be performed for the public at large for example or for members of subscription service does not render it an interactive one if the song is not performed within one hour of the requestnecessary the user ie the licensee simply complies with the statutory conditions to use the work and pays the statutory rate or royalty for the benefit of the rights holder with respect to online music delivery however the relative newness of both the technology and the law itself suggests the absence of an interpretative consensus among affected parties including the courts about the pr ecise copyright law principles that will govern online music transmission statutory licenses for public pe rformance of digital audio transmissions under 17 usc 114 112 and 115 statutory licensing for performa nce rights for digital audio transmissions 17 usc 114 when congress adopted the dpra in 1995 it created new but limited public performance right for digital audio transmissions rather than add broad comprehensive new performance right similar to that enjoyed by composers congress created many exemptions to the performance right of sound recording owners among the exemptions to sound recording owners exclusive right under 1066 pursuant to 114d1 are nonsubscription broadcast transmission ie traditional ove rtheair radio and television broadcasts and qualified retransmission and internal transmissions by business on or around its premises including on hold music transmissions via telephone to caller waiting for response14 these services are exempt from the performance right and do not need to obtain license to pay royalties for digital transmissions congress also provided for statutory licen sing for some but not all digital transmissions15 the nature of the digital public performance right requires the licensing parties to distinguish between subscription and interactive digital transmissions subscription services involve controlled transmissions that are limited to paid recipients while an interactive service enables member of the public to request particular sound recording16 the legislative history of the dpra expresses congre ssional concern that interactive services had the greatest potential to impact traditional record saleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31029crs6 17srept 104128 at 16 182 nimmer on copyright 822a1 1917 usc 114j6 defines an elig ible nonsubscription transmission as noninteractive nonsubscription digital audio transmission not exempt under subsection d1 that is made as part of service that provides audio programming consisting in whole or in part of performances of sound recordings including retransmissions of broadcast transmissions if the primary purpose of the service is to provide to the public such audio or other entertainment programming and the primary purpose of the service is not to sell advertise or promote particular products or services other than sound recordings live concerts or other musicrelated events 2017 usc 114d2bi 2117 usc 114d3therefore copyright owners have the ex clusive right to control the performance of their work on interactive media through negotiated contracts17 thus subscription transmissions may qualify for compulsory licensing but interactive subscription services must be voluntarily licensed18 statutory license for webcasting eligible nonsubscription and subscription transmissions webcasters whose activities are not exempt under 114d and are likewise nonsubscripti on and noninteractive may qualify for statutory ie compulsory license they are referred to as eligible nonsubscription transmissions19 unless subscription service is exempt from the public performance right it too may qualify for statutory license if detailed requirements are complied with among the requirements for subscription rvices statutory license is adherence to the sound recording performance complement20 the sound recording performance complement is complex protocol adapted from traditional radio broadcast practice which limits the number of selections subscription service can play from any one phonorecord by the same feat ured artist the goal of the protocol is to prevent preannounced play schedule that facilitates copyin g of albums or the work of individual performers in their entirety limitation on exclusive licenses for interactive services although the dpra requires negotiated licensing for interactive services it does limit the duration of an exclusive license for the performance of sound recording to prevent copyright owners of the recordings fro m becoming monopolistic gatekeepers and limiting opportunities for public performances21 statutory licensing for ephemeral recordings of digital audio transmissions 17 usc 112 ephemeral recordings are reproductions of work

compulsory or mechanical licenses for reproduction and distribution rights under 17 usc 115 the mechanical license in copyright law was enacted in 1909 in response to us supreme court decision which held that mechanical devices such as piano rolls were not copies of musical compositions hence to reproduce s ong on piano roll or on phonograph record would not result in an infringement of the composers copyright23 acting to overturn the courts decision to reverse its impact on owners of copyright interests in musical compositions and to thwart potential music monopoly by large manufacturer of piano rolls congress creat ed the compulsory license provision that is currently embodied in 17 usc 115 the license protects th composers right to control reproductions of the work but per mits the recording of song by third party on mechanical media like piano roll or record hence the term mechanical license24 in its present form it essentially allows reproduction of music that may be heard with the aid of mechanical device25 the mechanical license is validly obtained only after song has been initia lly distributed publicly under the authority of the copyright owner the license is authorized when the licensees primary purpose is to distribute the work publicly for private use the 115 mechanical license compensates the rights holder in the musical composition for reproduction and distribution rights it does not authorize the duplication of sound recording26 permission to duplicate sound recording must be obtained from whomever owns the copyrigh t the recording artist or

at 37license to compensate composers for an anticipated offset in revenues from record sales as songs become more frequently transmitted digitally among other things 115 is intended to confirm and clarify the right of musical work and sound recording copyri ght owners to be protected against infringement when phonorecords embodying their works are delivered to consumers by means of transmissions ra ther than by means of phonorecord retail sales the intention in extending the chanical compulsory license to digital phonorecord deliveries is to maintain and reaffirm the mechanical rights of songwriters and music publishers as new technologies permit phonorecords to be delivered by wire or over the airwav rather than by the traditional making and distribution of records cassettes and cds the intention is not to substitute for or duplicate performance rights in mu sical works but rather to maintain mechanical royalty income and performan ce rights income for writers and music publishers28 hence mechanical license is available to compensate the rights holder in the musical work when the licensee makes or distributes phonorecord of new version of the work to compensate the musical composition rights holder when the licensee has obtained permission from sound recording holde r to duplicate the sound recording and to compensate the righ ts holder in the musi cal work for dpd transmission of the work to summarize there are many copyrigh t requirements for both permission and licensing which must be observed before music can legally be transmitted over the internet these include permission from the rights holder in the musical composition to duplicate distribute andor perform the song publicly permission from the rights holder in the sound recording to duplicate and distribute it andor to perform it public ly via digital audio transmission in most cases and contexts parties will negotiate licensing agreements however statutory and compulsory licenses are available in limited circumstances third party may obtain compulsory license to compensate composers music publishers when the licensee mechanically reproduces song or transmits it

pursuant to 104 of the dmca congress directed the copyright office and the department of commerce to evaluate the effects of the dmca on the development of electroni c commerce and the relationship between existing and emergent technologies in connection with two provisions of the copyright act 109 and 117 section 109 of the act addresses the first sale doctrine which in essence allows the

are beyond the scope of this report one of its recommenda tions relates directly to webcasting the report considers the unsettled copyright status of incidental or buffe r copies necessitated by digital streaming also discussed are digital performances that are incidental to digital music downloads technically discrete reproduc tions or public performances takes place in connection w ith streaming or music download the question is whether these activities should be authorized within single grant of permission to the licensee to stream or download or should each incidental transaction be separately licensed and compensable the report analyzes the issue and recommends that congress enact legislation amending the copyright act to preclude any liability with respect to temporary buffer copies that are incidental to licensed digital transmission of public performance of sound recording and any underlying musical work30 likewise it concludes that liability should result under us law fro m technical perfo rmance that takes place in the course of music download31 the copyright office acknowledges the cl ose analogous relationship between temporary buffer copies nd ephemeral copies addre ssed in 17 usc 112 as with temporary buffer copies ephemeral recordings are made for the sole purpose of carrying out tran smission if they are used strictly in
