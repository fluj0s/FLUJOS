republic the countries of the southern african customs union and ean countries and 34 countries of the western hemisphere to create free trade area of the americas bilaterally it is currently negotiating ftas w ith thailand panama and the united arab emirates the administration signed an fta with bahrain in 2004 and with oman in 2005 and it is contemplating starting negotiations with number of other countries possible new negotiating partners include egypt malaysia india and south korea3 the bush administration argues that these negotiations promote host of us domestic and foreign interests both economic and political at home it views trade liberalization as providing substantial gains to american consumers and companies cuts in us trade barriers can help american families to pay less for consumer goods and us companies to lower their operating costs as result of access to cheaper imported components increased competition in dom estic markets also promotes innovation increases in labor productivity and longter m growth better access to foreign markets facilitates increases in us exports thereby increasing employment in sectors that may pay higher than average wages us investors can also benefit through rule changes and obligations that assure more dependable treatment by the host country trade liberalizing agreements particularly ftas also promote the us trade agenda and foreign interests in number of ways some ftas establish precedents or models that serve as catalysts for wider trade agreements many ftas reward and support market reforms being undertaken by the negotiating pa rtner and still others help to strengthen us ties with various countries and regions of the world for example by forging stronger economic ties with c ountries in the middle east ch as morocco jordan and bahrain the us hopes to strengthen its stra tegic position visavis all countries in the region by promoting economic prosperity and opportunity at the same time trade liberalizing ag reements may carry economic and political costs increased foreign competition can lead to plant closings and job losses concentrated in certain regions and industrie s critics note that it may contribute to increased anxiety and wage pressures as well as rising income inequality some of these concerns were central to the divisive debate in c ongress this year over cafta an agreement that became proxy in part for more generalized concerns about americas standing in an increasin gly globalized world economy while cafta was approved by narrow margins in both houses it is not clear how the outcome will affect the administrations future free trade agreement program cafta debate the cafta was the most controversial free trade agreement vote taken by congress since the north american free trade agreement nafta implementing legislation was passed in 19934 the senate passed the cafta imp lementing legislation on june 30 2005 by vote of 54 to 45 and house passe d the

any modern fta agreement the votes particularly in the house were high ly partisan over 92 of house democrats voted against the agreement while over 88 of house republicans voted in favor in both the senate and hous debates many proponents stressed combination of economic and political arguments those in favor argued that while imports from the cafta countries enter the us virtually dut free the agreement will level the playing field for us commercial interests by liminating 80 of the tariffs cafta countries impose on us exports as result they maintained the us goes from oneway free trade toward more reciprocal trading rela tionship that will increase us exports and jobs others emphasized that the agreement would contribute to bolstering more market oriented and democratic gove rnments in the region longstanding us foreign policy interests5 many lawmakers who opposed the agreemen t cited provisions dealing with the treatment of labor and sensitive industries sugar and tex tiles in addition the agreement clearly triggered more generalized anxieties concerning globalizations impact on the american economy and labor force future congressional considera tion of similar trade accords are likely to raise similar controversie s and challenges thereby prompting the administration to address these issues as part of its trade liberalizing agenda6 labor issues labor issues in the agreemen t were controvers ial and may have been major reason the vote divided largely along party lines disagreement revolved around whether the cafta countries had ws that complied with the us or international labor organization ilo similar list of five internationally recognized worker rights eg the right to organize uni ons and bargain collectively such standards have not been required by cafta by trade promotion authority legislation outlining requirements for trade agreements or by any other bilateral trade agreement however they have been required for decades by us trade preference laws which typically prohibit preferential treatment to countri which are not affording their workers internationally recognized worker rights ther efore these ftas continue to be seen by may democrats as step backward from longstanding us trade policy many republicans argue that the agreemen t encourages these countries to improve their laws and enforcement as well moreove r they argued that the administrations commitment to earmark 40 million in appr opriations for capacity building and enforcement over fouryear period would go long way in strengthening these provisions7 further exacerbating partisan tensions was long history over this issue some democrats expressed clear annoyance that thei r support for stronger labor provisions was characterized by bush administration trade officials as being economic isolationismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22339crs4 8 house ways and means committee hearing president bushs trade agenda march 11 2004 serial 10843 pp 3342 9 inside us

side for the compromises they had made over the years in accommodating democratic concerns partisan tensions we re further exacerbated by different views on whether the process in producing the agreem ent and the implemen ting legislation was inclusive and consistent with consulta tion requirements provided under the trade promotion authority statute8 following the cafta vote us trade representative rob portman has worked to narrow the gap on the divisive labor issue in both the bahrain and andean ftas house democrats reportedly have been pleased by the administrations efforts to obtain higher labor commitments and enforcement standards in the bahrain agreement9 but other reports suggest that the administration and house democrats remain far apart on how to handle the labor provisions in the andean fta10 thus it remains unclear whether the fta labor provisions will become less divisive and partisan issue protected industries second contentious issue involved liberalization of us restrictions in two industrie s textiles and appa rel and sugar that still benefit from protective barriers the agreement as signed by the bush administration provided some small additional opening of these two still protected markets these changes in turn were opposed vigorously by segments of bot h industries and by both republicans and democrats that had important c onstituent interests to defend to gain support for the agreement the bush administration made some commitments that on balance will reduce the commercial benefits of the agreement to cafta countries as originally negotiated some analysts believe that this action may send very negative signal to future ne gotiating partners about us willingness to negotiate reciprocal trade concessions an underlying problem for the administration may be that the partisan divide in congress over trade issues partic ularly labor standards provides defenders of protected industries with greater power than in previous eras as one scholar opined partisan divide renders the basic support margin narrow making trade policy hostage to any protectionist inte rests that hold the deci sive marginal votes11 this partisan divide could become ma jor hurdle for completing agreements that require the reduction and eventual removal of us barriers to imports in cases where liberalization of protected us industries is necessary to get other countries to reduce their own barriers to us exports the bush administration may have two options first it can work to bridge the partisan divide that arguably provides these industries with heightened leverage second it can alter the way it promotes the benefits of trade liberalization traditionally tr ade liberalization has been pur sued by focusing attentionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22339crs5 12 lindsey brink new track for us trade policy cato institute trade policy analysis 4 september 1998 13 program on international policy attitudesknowledge

discussion of the gains that reduction of us trade barriers can provide to us companies and consumers but by highlighting more the twoway gains from trade both exports and imports some an alysts believe that greater political support can be built for the kinds of actions that are necessary to sustain trade liberalization policy12 globalization anxieties the cafta debate in congress also served as proxy for public concerns and anxi eties about the effects of trade and globalization on the american economy record us trade ficits the rise of china as world manufacturing power and india s growing attractiveness as source for outsourcing of white collar jobs all raised questions about the effects of trade agreements on us workers some democrats in part may have opposed cafta because they believe that working class americans suffer most from ttempts to accelerate economic integration their opposition may have been buttressed by public opinion polls showing that more that 50 of us households may oppose these trade initiatives if they are not given the tools and training to compete with workers from all around the world13 to ease the anxieties of the american public on globalization and trade agreements that accelerate economic integration some policymakers are calling for more robust programs that will help american workers obt ain the skills that are necessary to compete in the global economy while the longsta nding trade adjustment assistance program provides retraining and inco support for workers displaced by import competition some argue that more comprehensive pr ogram that would cover not only workers displaced by trade competition but also by technological change and foreign outsourcing is needed to deal with broad distributional costs of globalization nd the rise of economic insecurity among american workers propone nts argue that such plan could include meaningful retraining wage and hea lth insurance and job search aid14 two obstacles are often cited to moving in this direction cost and ideology one estimate of comprehensive program that extends trade adjustment to all workers provides general twoyear wage insuran ce program and adds on business tax incentives comes to 20 billion year while this cost could be considered modest compared to an estimated 1 trillion in be nefits the us economy gains from globalization international openness every year it also coul d be considered very costly in the context of an economy experiencing record budget deficits pr ompting calls for reductions in government spending in addition the fact that some policymakers take dim view of the ability of these kinds of programs to achieve the intended results combined with some sense that growing market economy is the best anti dote to adjustment provide another hurdle15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22339crs6 16 crs report rl32540 the proposed uspanama free trade agreement by jf hornbeck crs report rl32314 usthailand free trade

bush administration is now actively negotiating large number of trade liberalizing agreements the broadest and most ambitious initiative being negotiated is the doha round of multilateral negotiations negotiations are also taking place with panama thailand three andean countries col ombia peru and ecuador and the united emirates16 assuming that the divisions over bor issues industry protection and globalization anxieties that were imbedded in the cafta debate persist these potential agreements could encounter differential obstacles an ambitious doha agreement is the admin istrations highest priority with 148 countries involved in the negotiation this tr ade negotiation provides the largest potential benefits for us firms farmers and consumers some analysts maintain that large gains or benefits accruing to broad spectrum of american stakeholders are necessary to help mobilize political support to eliminate or redu ce remaining us restrictions on politically sensitive industries and products this is based on belie f that an ambitious agreement would require large concessions from trading partners that open s ubstantially new market access opportunities for us companies and that these potential gains would be too tempting for us industry not to support strongly while labor issues are not part of th doha negotiations any big commercial agreement would likely trigger globalization anxieties among some segments of the body politic whether an ambitious agreement that provides large economic benefits to the us economy might provide some impetus and support for devising comprehensive adjustment program remains problematic in the past implementing legislation for multilateral agreements has included the creation or expansion of adjustment programs the ftas being negotiated with thailand pana ma and the andean countries might encounter some or all the obstacles rais ed in the cafta bate thailands labor conditions and exports of import sensitive pr oducts such as sugar and rice could prove contentious given that thailand is larg er trading partner than the five cafta countries combined globalizati on anxieties could also play role in this agreement as well in the case of panama and the andean countries their labor laws and exports of sugar could raise concerns among some memb ers of congress but given that they are both very small trading partners globalization anxieties are less likely to play key role to date caftarelated controversies appear to be playing small role in the ftas concluded with countries of the middle ea st jordan morocco bahrain and oman these four agreements have received broad bipartisan support not only because they are viewed favorably for advancing us security interests but also because the countries in commercial terms provi little competitive threat to us producers and workers
