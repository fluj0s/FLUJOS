for change and their impact on states summary now that the reallocation of representa tives among the states based on the 2000 census has been completed some members of the statistical community are urging congress to consider changing the current house apportionment formula however other formulas also raise questions seats in the house of representatives are allocated by formula known as the hill or equal proporti ons method if congress decided to change it there are at least five alternatives to consider four of these are based on rounding fractions one on ranking fractions the current apportionment sy stem codified in 2 usc 2a is one of the rounding methods the hamiltonvinton method is based on ranking fractions first the population of 50 states is divided by 435 the house size in order to find the national ideal size district next this number is divided into each states population each state is then awarded the whole number in its quotient but at least one if fewer than 435 seats have been assigned by this process the fractional remainders of the 50 states are rankordered from largest to smallest and seats are assigned in this manner until 435 are allocated the rounding methods including the hill method currently in use allocate seats among the states differently but operationally the methods only differ by where rounding occurs in seat assignments three of these methods adams webster and jefferson have fixed rounding points two others dean and hill use varying rounding points that rise as the num ber of seats assigned to state grows larger the methods can be defined in the same way after substituting the appropriate rounding principl in parentheses the rounding point for adams is up for all fractions for dean at the harmonic mean for hill at the geometric mean for webster at the arithmetic mean 5 and for jefferson down for all fractions substitute these phrases in the general definition below for the rounding methods find number so that when it is divided into each states population and resulting quotients are rounded substitute appropriate phrase the total number of seats will sum to 435 in all cases where state would be entitled to less than one seat it receives one anyway because of the constitutional requirement unlike the hamiltonvinton method whic h uses the national ideal size district for divisor the rounding methods use sliding divisor if the national ideal size district results in 435seat house after rounding according to the rule of method alteration in its size is necessary if too many seats are allocated the divisor is made larger it slides up if too few seats are apportioned the divisor becomes smaller it slides down fundamental to choosing an apportionment method is determination of fairness each of the competing

tives among the states based on the 2000 census has been completed some members of the statistical community are urging congress to consider changing the current house apportionment formula however other formulas also raise questions2 in 1991 the reapportionment of the h ouse of representatives was nearly overturned because the current equa l proportions formula for the house apportionment was held to be unconstitutional by threej udge federal district court the court concluded that by complacently relying for over fifty years on an apportionment method which does not even consider absolute populati on variances between districts congress has ignored the goal of equal representation for equal numbers of people the court finds that unjustified and av oidable population differences between districts exist under the present apportionmen t and declares section 2a of title 2 united states code unconstitutional and void3 the threejudge panels decision came almost on the 50th anniversary of the current formulas enactment4 the government appealed the panels decision to the supreme court where montana argued that the equal proportions formula violated the constitution because it does not achieve the greatest possible equality in number of individuals per representative this reasoning did not pr evail because as justice stevens wrote in his opinion for unanimous court absolute and relative differences in district sizeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs2 5 department of commerce v montana 503 us 442 1992 6 franklin v massachusetts 505 us 788 1992 the administrative procedures act

achieve precise mathematical equality within each state the constraints imposed by article i 2 itself make that go illusory for the nation as whole he concluded that cong ress had ample power to enact the statutory procedure in 1941 and to apply the method of equa l proportions after the 1990 census5 the year 1991 was banner year for court challenges on the apportionment front at the same time the montana case was being argued another case was being litigated by massachusetts the bay state st seat to washington because of the inclusion of 978819 federal employees stat ioned overseas in the state populations used to determine reapportionment the court ruled that ma ssachusetts could not challenge the presidents decision to include the overseas federal employees in the apportionment counts in part because the pres ident is not subject to the terms of the administrative procedures act6 in 2001 the census bureaus decision to again include the overseas federal employees in the population used to rea pportion the house produced new challenge to the apportionment population utah argu ed that it lost congressional seat to north carolina because of the bureaus decision to include overseas federal employees in the apportionment count but not other citizens living abroad utah said that mormon missionaries were absent from the state because they were on assignment status similar to federal employees stationed overseas thus the state argued the census bureau should have included the missionaries in utahs apportionment count the stat further argued that unlik other us citizens living overseas missionaries could be accurately reallocated to their home states because the mormon church has excellent administrative records utahs complaint was dismissed by threejudge federal court on april 17 20017 the supreme court appears to have settle d the issue about congresss discretion to choose method to apportion the house and has granted broa d discretion to the president in determining who should be in cluded in the population used to allocate seats although modern congresses have ra rely considered the issue of the formulahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs3 8 representative fithian hr 1990 and senato r lugar s 695 introduced bills in the 97th congress to adopt the hamiltonvinton method of apportionment to be effective for the 1980 and subsequent censuses hearings were held in the house but further action was taken 9 article i section 3 defines both the maximu m and minimum size of the house the actual house size is set by law there can be fewer than one representative per state and more than one for every 30000 persons thus the house after 2001 could have been as small as 50 and as large as 9361 representatives 30000 divided into the total us apportionment populationused in the calculations this report scribes apportionment options from which congress could choose and the crite ria that each method satisfies8 background one of the fundamental issues befo re the framers at the constitutional convention in 1787 was how power was to be allocated in congress between the smaller and larger states the soluti on ultimately adopted became known as the great or connecticut compromise it solved the controversy between large and small states by creating bicameral congress with states equally represented in the senate and seats allocated by population in the house the constitution provided the first apportionment 65 representatives were allocated to the states based on the framers estimates of how seats might be apportioned after census house apportionments thereafter were to be based on article 1 section 2 as modified by clause 2 of the fourteenth amendment amendment xiv section 2 representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers article 1 section 2 the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state sha ll have at least one representative the constitutional mandate that representatives would be apportioned according to population did not describe how congress was to distribute fractional entitlements to representatives clearly there would be fractions because districts could not cross state lines and the states populations were unlikely to be evenly divisible from its beginning in 1789 congress was faced with deciding how to apportion the house of representatives the controversy continued until 1941 with the enactment of the hill equal propor tions method during congressional debates on apportionment the major i ssues were how populous congressional district ought to be later recast as how large the house ought to be and how fractional entitlements to representatives should be treated the matter of the permanent house size has r eceived little attention since it was last increased to 435 after the 1910 census9 the montana legal challenge added new perspective to the picture determining whic h method comes closest to meeting the goal of one person one votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs4 10 crs report 931060 gov congressional redistri cting federal law controls state process by royce crocker pp 5354 11 m l balinski and h p young fair representation 2nd ed washington brookings institution press 2001 p 31the one person one vote concept was blished through series of supreme court decisions beginning in the 1960s the court ruled in 1962 that state legislative districts must be approxima tely equal in population baker v carr 369 us 186 this ruling was extended to the us house of representatives in 1964 wessberry v sanders 376 us 1 thus far the concept has only been applied within states states must be able to justify any deviations from absolute numerical equality for their congressional districts in order to comply with 1983 supreme court decision karcher v daggett 462 us 725 the population distribution am ong states in the 2000 census combined with house size of 435 and the requirement that districts not cross st ate lines means that there is wide disparity in district sizes from 495304 wyoming to 905316 montana after the 2000 census this interstate population disparity among districts in 2001 contrasts with the intrastate variation experienced in the redistrictings following the 1990 census neteen of the 43 states that had two or more districts in 1992 drew districts w ith population difference between their districts of ten persons or fewer and only six states varied by more than 1000 persons10 given fixedsize house and an incr easing population there will inevitably be population deviations in district sizes among states what should be the goal of an apportionment method although daniel webster was proponent of particular formula the major fractions method he succinctly defined the apportionment problem during debate on an apportionment bill in 1832 webster said that the constitution therefore must be unde rstood not as enjoining an absolute relative equality because that would be demanding an impossibility but as requiring of congress to make the apportionment of representatives among the several states according to their respective numbers as near as may be that which cannot be done perfectly must be done in manner as near perfection as can be 11 which apportionment method is the ma nner as near perfection as can be although there are potentially thousands of different ways in which the house can be apportioned six methods ar most often mentioned as possibilities these are the methods of hamiltonvinton largest fr actional remainders adams smallest divisors dean harmoni c mean hill equal proportions webster major fractions and jeffers on largest divisorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs5 12 fair

of the fifty states found by the censusapportionment methods defined hamiltonvinton ranki ng fractional remainders why is there controversy why not apportion the house the intuitive way by dividing each state s population by the national ideal size district 645632 in 2001 and give each state its quota rounding up at fractional remainde rs of 5 and above and down for remainders less than 5 the problem with this proposal is that the house size would fluctuate around 435 seats in some decades the house might include 435 seats in others it might be either under or over the legal limit in 2001 this method would result in 433seat house 438 in 1991 one solution to this problem of too few or too many seats would be to divide each states population by the national ideal size district but instead of rounding at the 5 point allot each state initially the whole number of seats in its quota except that states entitled to less than one seat w ould receive one regard less next rank the fractional remainders of the quotas in order from largest to smallest finally assign seats in rank order until 435 are allocated see table 1 if this system had been used in 2001 california would have one less representative and utah would have one more this apportionment formula which is associated with alexander hamilton was used in congresss first effort to enact an apportionment of the house the bill was vetoed by president washington his first exercise of this power12 this procedure which might be described as the largest fractional remainders method was used by congress from 1851 to 190113 but it was never strictly followed because changes were made in the apportionments that were not consistent with the method14 it has generally been known as the vinton thod for representative samuel vinton ohio its chief proponent after the 1850 cens us assuming fixed house size the hamiltonvinton method can be described as follows hamiltonvinton divide the apportionment population15 by the size of the house to obtain the ideal congressional district size to be used as divisor divide each states population by the ideal size di strict to obtain its quota award each state the whole number obtained in th quotas if state receives less than one representative it automatic ally receives one because of the constitutional requirement if the number of representatives assigned using the whole numbers is less than th house total rank the fractionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs6 16 fair representation p 38 17 ibid p 39remainders of the states quotas and award seats in rank order from highest to lowest until the house size is reached the hamiltonvinton method has simplicity in its favor but its downfall was the alabama paradox although the phenomenon had b een observed previously the paradox became an issue after the 1880 cen when c w seaton chief clerk of the census office wrote the congress on october 25 1881 stating while making these calculations i met with the socalled alabama paradox where alabama was allotted 8 representatives out of total of 299 receiving but 7 when the total became 30016 alabamas loss of its eighth seat when the house size was increased resulted from the vagaries of fractional remainde rs with 299 seats alabamas quota was 7646 seats it was allocated eight seats based on this quota but it was on the dividing point when house size of 300 was used alabamas quota increased to 7671 but illinois and texas now had larger fractional remainders than alabama accordingly each received an additional seat in the allotment of fractional remainders but since the hous had increased in size by only one seat alabama lost the seat it had received in the allotment by fractional remainders for 299 seats17 this property of the hamiltonvinton method becam big enough issue that the formula was changed in 1911 one could argue that th alabama paradox should not be an important consideration in apportionments since the house size was fixed in size at 435 but the hamiltonvinton method is subject to ot her anomalies miltonvinton is also subject to the population paradox and the new states paradox the population paradox occurs when stat that grows at greater percentage rate than another has to give up seat to the slower growing state the new states paradox works in much the same way at the next apportionment after new state enters the union any increase in house si ze caused by the additional seats for the new state may result in seat shifts among states that otherwise would not have happened finding formula that avoided the paradoxes was goal when congress adopted rounding rather than ranking method when the apportionment law was changed in 1911 table 1 illustrates how hamiltonvint on apportionment would be done by ranking the fractional remainders of th states quotas in order from largest to smallest in 2001 north carolina and utahs fractional remainde rs of less than 05 would have been rounded up by the hamilt onvinton method in order for the house to have totaled 435 representativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs7 table 1 apportioning the house in 2001 by simple rounding and ranked fractional remainders

hamiltonvinton system even tho ugh their fractional remainders are less than 5 rounding methods the kinds of calculations required by the hamiltonvinton method are paralleled in their ssentials in all the alternative methods th at are most frequently discussed but fractional rema inders are rounded instead of ranked first the total apportionment population the population of the 50 states as found by the census is divided by 435 or the size of the hous this calculation yields the national ideal district size second the ideal dist rict size is used as common divisor for the population of each state yieldi ng what are called the states quotas of representatives because the quotas still contain fractional re mainders each method then obtains its final apportionment by r ounding its allotments either up or down to the nearest whole number according to certain rules the operational difference between the methods lies in how each defines the rounding point for the fractional remainders in the allotments that is the point at which the fractions rounded down are separa ted from those rounded up each of the rounding methods defines its rounding point in terms of some ma thematical quantity above this specified figure all fractiona l remainders are au tomatically rounded up those below are rounded down for given common divisor therefor each rounding method yields set number of seats if using national ideal district size as the common divisor results in 435 seats being allocated further adjus tment of the divisor is necessary but if too many or too few seats are appor tioned the common divisor must be varied until value is found that yields the desire d number of seats these methods will as result generate alloca tions before rounding that differ from the states quotas if too many seats are apportioned rger divisor is tried the divisor slides up if too few smaller divisor it slides down the divisor finally used is that which apportions of number of seats equal to the desired size of the house18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs9 18 continued consistent framework to understand them all 19 for detailed explanation of how apportionm ents are done

twentyone seats this illustration is adapted from balinski m l and h p young fair representation 2nd ed washington brookings institution press 2001 pp 6365 the rounding methods that are mentione d most often although there could be many more are the methods of webs ter major fracti ons hill equal proportions the current method dean harmonic mean adams smallest divisors and jefferson greatest diviso rs under any of these methods the census bureau would construct priority list of claims to representation in the house19 the key difference among these met hods is in the rule by which the rounding point is set that is the rule that determines what fractional remainders result in state being rounded up rather than down in the adams webster and jefferson thods the rounding points used are the same for state of any size in the dean and hill methods on the other hand the rounding point varies with the number of seat s assigned to the state it rises as the the states population increases with thes two methods in other words smaller less populous states will have their appor tionments rounded up to yield an extra seat for smaller fractional remainders than will larger states this property provideshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs10 20 peyton young states that the hill method systematically favors the small states by 34 percent he determined this figure by firs t eliminating from the calculations the very small states whose quotas equaled less than one half representative he then computed the relative bias for the methods described in this report for all the censuses based on the per capita representation in the large states as group and in the small states as group the percentage difference between th two is the methods relative bias toward small states in that year to estimate their longrun behavior i compute the average bias of each method up to that point in time see brookings institution policy brief 88 dividing the house why congress should reinstat the old reapportionment formula p 4the intuitive basis for challenging the dean and hill methods as favoring small states at the expense of the rge more populous states20 these differences among the roundi ng methods are illustrated in figure 1 the flags in figure 1 indicate the points that states fractional remainder must exceed for it to receive second seat and to receive 21st seat figure 1 visually illustrates that the only rounding points which change their relative positions are those for dean and hill using the rounding points for second seat as the example the adams method awards second seat for any frac tional remainder above one dean awards the second seat for any fractional rema inder above 133 similarly hill gives second seat for every fraction exceedin g 141 webster 15 and jefferson does not give second seat until its integer value of states quotient equals or exceeds two webster rounding at the midpoint 5 the easiest rounding method to describe is the webster major fractions method which allocates seats by rounding up to the next seat when state has remainder of 5 and above in other words it rounds fractions to the lower or next higher whole number at the arithmetic mean which is the midpoint between numbers for example between 1 and 2 the arithmetic mean is 15 between 2 and 3 the arithmetic mean is 25 etc the webster method which was used in 1840 1910 and 1930 can be defined in the following manner for 435seat house webster find number so that when it is divided into each states population and resulting quotients are rounded at th arithmetic mean the total number of seats will sum to 435 in all cases where state would be entitled to less than one seat it r eceives one anyway because of the constitutional entitlement hill rounding at th geometric mean the only operational difference between webster and hill apportionmen t equal proportions the method in use since 1941 is where the rounding occurs rather than rounding at the arithmetic mean between the next lower and the next higher whole number hill rounds at the geometric mean the geometric mean is the square root of the multiplication of two numbers the hill rounding point between 1 and 2 for example is 141 the square root of 2 rather than 15 the rounding point between 10 and 11 is the square root of 110 or 10487 the hill method can be defined in the

anyway because of the constitutional entitlement dean rounding at the harmonic mean the dean method advocated by montana rounds at different point the harmonic mean between consecutive numbers the harmonic mean is obtained by multiplying the product of two numbers by 2 and then dividing that product by the sum of the two numbers21 the dean rounding point between 1 and 2 for exampl is 133 rather

jefferson all fractions rounded down the jefferson method largest divisors rounds down any frac tional remainder in order to receive 2 seats for example state would need 2 in its quotient but it would

evaluating apportionment methods all the apportionment methods described above arguab ly have properties that recommend them each is the best formula to satisfy certain mathematical measures of fairness and the proponents of some of them argue that their favorite meets other goals as well the major issue raised in the montana case22 was which formula best approximates the one pers on one vote principle the apportionment concerns raised in the massachusetts case23 not only raised one person one vote issues but also suggested that the hill method disc riminates against the larger states it is not immediately apparent which of the methods described above is the fairest or most equitable in the sense of meeting the one person one vote standard as already noted apporti onment formula can equalize districts precisely given the constraints of 1 fixed size house 2 minimum seat allocation of one and 3 the requirement that districts not cross state lines the practical question to be answered therefore is not how inequality can be eliminated but how it can be minimized this questi on too however has clearly definitive answer for there is single established criterion by which to determine the equality or fairness of thod of apportionment in report to the congress in 1929 the national academy of sciences nas defined series of possibl criteria for comparing how well various apportionment formulas achieve equity among states24 this report predates the supreme courts enunciation of the one person one vote principle by more than 30 years but if the congress decided to reevaluate its 1941 choi ce to adopt the hill method it could use one of the nas criteria of equity as m easure of how well an apportionment formula fulfills that principle although the following are somewhat simplified restatements of the nas criteria they succinctly present the question before the congress if it chose to take up this matter which of these measures best approximates th one person one vote concept the method that minimizes the di fference between the largest average district size in the country and the smallest this criterion leads to the dean method the method that minimizes

states that resulted in the establishment of bicameral congress alternative kinds of tests as the discussion of the nas report showed the nas tested each of its criteria for evaluating apportionment methods by its effect on pairs of states the descriptions of the nas test s above stated them in term s of the highest and lowest states for each measure but in fact comp arisons between all pairs of states were used these pairwise tests however are not the only means by which different methods of apportionment can be tested against various criteria of fairness for example it is indisputable that as the state of montana contended in 1992 the dean method minimizes absolute differen ces in state averag district populations in the pairwise test one of the federa l governments counter arguments however was that the dean method does not minimize such differences when all states are considered simultaneously th federal government proposed variance as means of testing apportionment formulas ag ainst various criteria of fairness the variance of set of numbers is the sum of the squares of the deviations of the individual values from the mean or average27 this measure is useful way of summarizing the degree to which individual values in list vary from the average mean of all the values in the list high variances indicate that the values vary greatly low variances mean the values are similar if all values in the lists are identical the variance is zero according to this test in other words the smaller the variance the more equitabl the method of apportionment if the variance for dean apportionmen t is compared to that of hill apportionment in 1990 using the difference be tween district sizes as the criterion the apportionment variance under hills met hod is smaller than that under deans see table 4 in fact using average district size as the criterion and variance as the test the variance under the hill method is th smallest of any of the apportionment methods

the criteria of fair ness used in pairwise tests in the 1929 nas report as with those pair wise tests different apporti onment methods are evaluated as most equitable depending on which meas ure the variance is calculated for for example if the criterion used for co mparison is the individual share of representative the hamiltonvinton met hod proves most effective in minimizing inequality as measured by variance with webster the best of the rounding methods the federal government in the massachusetts case also presented another argument to challenge the basis for both the montana and massachusetts claims that the hill method is unconstitutiona l it contended that percent difference calculations are more fair than absolute differen ces because absolute differences are not influenced by whether they are positive or negative in direction28 tests other than pairwise comparisons and variance can also be applied for example table 4 reports data fo r each method using the sum of the absolute values rather than the squares of the differences between national averages and state figures29 using this test for state differences from the national ideal both for district sizes and for shares of repr esentative the hamiltonvinton method againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs21 30 for example virginias quota of re presentatives based on 2000 census was 10976 based on this quota each virginia representative would be entitled to 10976 votes each in the house their votes would weigh more than alaskas single representative whose vote would count 0972 ba sed on alaskas quota 31 fair representation p 79produces the smallest nationa l totals of the rounding methods again the webster method minimizes both these differences fairness and quota these examples in which different met hods best satisfy differing tests of variety of criteria for evaluation serve to illu strate further the point made earlier that single method of apportionment need be unambiguously the most equitable by all measures each apportionment method discu ssed in this report has rational basis and for each there is at least one test according to which it is the most equitable the question of how the concept of fairness can best be defined in the context of evaluating an apportionment formula remains open another approach to this question begins from the observation that if representation were to be apportioned among the states truly according to population the fractional remainders would be treated as fractions rather than rounded each state would be assigned its exact quota of seats derive d by dividing the national ideal size district into the states apportionment population there would be fractional representatives just fractional votes based on the states quotas quota representation the congress could weight each representatives vote to account for how much his or her constituents were ither over or under represented in the house in this way the states exact quotas would be represented but each representatives vote would count differently this might be an easier solution than trying to apportion seats so they crossed state lines but it would however raise other problems relating to potential inequalities of influence among individual representatives30 if this quota representation defines absolute fairness then the concept of the quota rather than some statistical test can be used as the basis of simple concept for judging the relative fairness of appor tionment methods method should never make seat allocation that differs from states exact quota by more than one seat31 unfortunately this concept is complicated in its application by the constitutional requirement that each state must get one seat regardless of population size hence some modification of the quota concept is needed to account for this requirement one solution is the concept of fair share which accounts for entitlements to less than one seat by eliminating them from the calculation of quota after all if the constitution awards seat for fraction of less than one then by definition that is the states fair share of seats to illustrate consider hypothetical count ry with four states having populations 580 268 102 and 50 thousand and house of 10 seats to apportion then thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs22 32 balinski m l and h p young evaluation of apportionment

populations the jefferson method awards 55 seats to california and 33 seats to texas when these states quotas state population divided by 1435 of the apportionment population are 5245 and 3231 respectivelyquotas are 580 268 102 and 50 but if each state is entitle d to at least one whole seat then the fair share of the smallest state is 1 exactly this leaves 9 seats to be divided among the rest their quotas of 9 seats are 549 254 and 97 now the last of these is entitled to 1 seat so its fair share is 1 exactly leaving 8 seats for the rest their quot as of 8 are 547 and 253 since these are both greater than 1 they represent the ex act fractional representation that these two states are entitled to ie they are the fair shares 32 having accounted for the definitional problem of the constitutional minimum of one seat the revised measure is not th exact quota but the states fair shares which method meets the goal of not deviatin g by more than one seat from states fair share rounding method meets this test under all circumstances of the methods described in this report onl the hamiltonvinton thod always stays within one seat of states fair share some rounding methods are better than others in this respect both the adams and jefferson methods nearly always produce examples of states that get more than one seat above or below their fair shares through experimentation we learn that the dean method tends to violate this concept approximately one percent of the time while webster and hill violate it much less than one percent of the time33 implementing the great compromise the framers of the constitution as noted earlier created bicameral congress in which representation for the states wa s equal in the sena and apportioned by population in the house in the house the principal means of apportionment is by population but each state is entitled to one representative regardless of its population level given our understanding that the gr eat compromise was struck in part in order to balance the interests of the smaller states with those of the larger ones how well do the various methods of apportionment contribute to this end if it is posited that the combination of factors favoring the influence of small states encompassed in the great compromise equal representation in the senate and one seat minimum in the house undul advantages the small states then compensatory influence could be provided to the large states in an apportionment formula this approach would suggest the adoption of the jefferson method because it significantly favors large states34 if it is posited that the influence of the small states is overshadowed by the larger ones perhaps because the dynamics of the electoral college focus the attention of presidential candidates on larger states or the increasing number of one representative states from five to ven since 1910 there are several methodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31074crs23 35 there is disagreement on this point as it pertains to the hill method declaration of lawrence r ernst but the evidence that the hill method is slightly biased toward small states is more persuasive than the criticism see balinski and young evaluation of apportionment methods noted above 36 evaluation of apportionment methods p 1012that could reduce the perceived inbalan ce the adams method favors small states in the extreme dean much less so and hill to small degree35 if it is posited that an apportionment met hod should be neutral in its application to the states two methods may meet th is requirement both the webster and hamiltonvinton methods are consider ed to have these properties36 conclusion if congress decides to revisit the ma tter of the apportionment formula this report illustrates that there could be many competing criteria from which it can choose as basis for decision among the co mpeting mathematical tests are the pair wise measures proposed by the national cademy of sciences in 1929 the federal government proposed the statistical test of variance as an appropriate means of computing total for all the districts in the country in the 1992 litigation on this matter the plaintiffs in massachusetts argued that variance can be computed for different criteria than those proposed by the federal government with different variance measures leadin g to different methods the contention that one method or another best implements the great compromise is open to much discussion all of the competing points suggest that congress would be faced with difficult choices if it decided to take this issue up prior to the 2010 census which of the mathema tical tests discussed in this report best approximates the constitutiona l requirement that repres entatives be apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers is arguably matter of judgment not some indis putable mathematical test
