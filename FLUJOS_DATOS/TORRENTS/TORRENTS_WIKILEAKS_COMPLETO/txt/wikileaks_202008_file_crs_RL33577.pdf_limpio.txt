status trends and forecasts for us international trade the purpose of this report is to provide current data and brief explanations for the various types of trade flows particularly us exports along with short discussion of particular trends and points of contention related to trade policy the united states is now running huge deficits in its trade with other nations between 2006 and 2007 the us merchandise trade deficit declined slightly from 838 billion to 819 billion on balanceofpayments bop basis and from 817 billion to 790 billion on census basis 2007 surplus in services trade of 119 billion resulted in deficit of 700 billion on goods and services for the yeardown 53 billion or 70 from the 753 billion deficit in 2006 while us exports are highly competitive in world markets these sales abroad are overshadowed by the huge demand by americans for imported products in 2007 us exports of goods and services totaled 1646 billion while us imports reached 2346 billion since 1976 the united states has incurred continual merchandise trade deficits with annual amounts fluctuating around an upward trend the current slowdown in the us economy pl us the declining value of the dollar have worked to reduce the deficit trade deficits are concern for congress because they may generate trade friction and pressures for the government to do more to open foreign markets to shield us producers from foreign competition or to assist us industries to become more competitive as the deficit increases the risk also rises of precipitous drop in the value of the dollar and disruption in financial markets compared to federal reserve index of currencies weighted by importance to us trade the dollar has lost third of its value since 2002 in 2007 the dollar again fell against major currencies overall us trade deficits reflect excess spending shortage of savings in the domestic economy and reliance on capital imports to finance that shortfall capital inflows serve to offset the outflow of dollars used to pay for imports movements in the exchange rate help to balance trade the rising trade deficit when not matche d by capital inflows places downward pressure on the value of the dollar which in turn helps to shrink the deficit by making us exports cheaper and imports more expensive central banks in countries such as china however have intervened in foreign exchange markets to keep the value of their currencies from rising too fast the broadest measure of us international economic transactions is the balance on current account in addition to merchandise trade it includes trade in services and unilateral transfers in 2007 the deficit on current account fell to revised 7386 billion from revised 8115 billion in 2006 in trade in advanced technology products the us balance improved from deficit of 44 billion in 2005 to deficit of 38 billion in 2006 but deteriorated to 53 billion in 2007 in trade in motor vehicles and parts the 121 billion us deficit in 2007 was mainly with japan mexico germany and south korea in crude oil major sources of the 237 billion in imports were canada saudi arabia venezuela nigeria and mexico this report will be updated

united states has incurred continual merchandise trade deficits with annual amounts fluctuating around an upward trend for the congress the trade deficit and other aspects of international trade enter into public policy considerations through many portals at the macroeconomic level trade deficits are concern because they affect us economic growth interest rates labor and the debt load of the economy as the trade deficit rises relative to the total economy the risk increases that the dollar will weaken raise prices disrupt financial markets and reduce the economic well being of the population on the strategic level trade ties often lead to deepening of bilateral relations with other nations that can develop into formal free trade agreements or political and security arrangements trade also can be used as tool to accomplish strategic objectivesparticularly through providing preferential trading arrangements or by imposing trade sanctions on the microeconomic side imports of specific products can generate trade friction and pressures from constituent interests for the government to shield us producers from foreign competition provide adjustment assistance open foreign markets or assist us industries to become more competitive this report provides an overview of the current status trends and forecasts for us import and export flows as well as certain balances the purpose of this report is to provide current data and brief explanations for the various types of trade fl ows along with brief discussion of trends that may require attention or point to the need for

international transaction level the savings shortfall is manifest when the united states imports capital to pay for its excess of imports trade deficit whether this foreign borrowing is beneficial for the us economy depends on how the imports of capital are used if they are used to finance investments that generate future return at sufficiently high rate they raise future output and productivity then they may increase the well being of current and future generations however if the imports are used only for current consumption the net effect of the borrowing will be to shift the burden of repayment to future generations without corresponding benefit to them

indicate underlying problems with the competitiveness of particular industries or what some refer to as the competitiveness of nation the reason is that overall trade flows are determined within the framework of institutional barriers to trade and the activities of individual industries primarily by macroeconomic factors such as rates of growt h savings and investment behavior including government budget deficitssurpluses international capital flows and exchange rates 5 increases in trade deficits may diminish economic growth since net exports exports minus imports are component of gross domestic product in the late 1980s and early 1990s export growth was an important element in overall us economic growth in 2006 merchandise exports accounted for about 77 of gdp compared with 59 in 1990 recently however rising trade deficits have reduced total domestic demand in the economy but the weakness in the trade sector has been offset by strong consumer business and government demand many economists fear that the rising us trade and current account 6 deficits could lead to large drop in the value of the us dollar the current account deficit while decreasing from 62 of gdp in 2006 to 51 of gdp in 2007 continues to place downward pressure on the dollar weakened dollar boosts exports by making them cheaper narrowing the us trade deficit compared to federal reserve index of major

2008 the renminbi was trading at 69 per dollar recent development in foreign country holdings of dollars and other reserve currencies is that some are turning toward creating sovereign we alth funds swfs these are funds owned by governments that are invested in stocks bonds property and other financial instruments denominated in dollars euros or other hard currency for china japan south korea russia and the oilexporting nations of the persian gulf the source of capital for these funds is coming from governmental holdings of foreign exchange for china and japan for example foreign exchange reserves have traditionally been invested by their respective central banks primarily in low yielding but lowrisk government bonds ie us treasury securities the purpose of sovereign wealth funds is to diversify investments and to earn higher rate of return for example in september 2007 china created sovereign weal th fundthe china investment corporation cicwith initial capital of 200 billion one of the largest swfs cic already has bought 10 3 billion share nonvoting of the initial public offering of the blackstone group us private equity group morgan stanley research estimates that such sovereign wealth funds could hold up to 12 trillion by 2015 11 depending on how these funds are managed and what leverage they acquire they could affect us interest rates foreign purchases of us treasury securities tend to reduce us interest rates corporate activities if funds buy significant voting shares of companies and foreign access to technology and raw materials the us trade deficit provides some of the foreign exchange that goes to finance these sovereign wealth funds 12 how long can the united states keep running trade deficits us deficits in trade can continue for as long as foreign investors are willing to buy and hold us assets particularly government securities and other financial assets 13 their willingness depends on complicated array of factors including the perception of the united states as safe haven for capital relative rates of return on investments interest rates on us financial assets actions by foreign central banks and the savings and investment

coverage and timing and excludes military transactions the data are finally reported in terms of national income and product accounts nipa the nipa data also can be further adjusted to include correcting for inflation to gauge movement in trade volumes as distinct from trade values conceptually this procedure is analogous to adjusting macroeconomic data from nominal to real values the census bureau also reports imports on cif cost insurance and freight basis which includes the value of insurance international shipping and other charges incurred in bringing merchandise to us ports of entry the customs or fasfree alongside ship data do not include these supplementary costs us import data are reported on customs basis with insurance and freight charges counted in us services

the united states can run trade deficits without the same downward pressure on the value of the dollar as other nations historically the current account deficit fell from then recordhigh 1607 billion in 1987 to 790 billion in 1990 and switched to 37 billion surplus in 1991 primarily because of payments to fund the gulf war by japan and other nations however since slight decline in 1995 the current account deficit has been increasing significantly except for slight dip in 2001 because of the us recession and similar situation in 2007

balance consists of deficits or surpluses with each trading partner many economists view the overall figure as more significant than bilateral trade balances since rising deficits with some nations are often offset by declining deficits or growing surpluses with others nonetheless abnormally large or rapidly increasing trade deficits with particular countries are often viewed as indicators that underlying problems may exist with market access the competitiveness of particular industries currency misalignment or macroeconomic adjustment figure 8 and table 5 show us trade balances with

canada and germany trade with the oil exporting countries particularly nigeria venezuela and saudi arabia also is in deficit us trade surpluses occur in trade with the netherlands hong kong australia and the united arab emirates the us trade deficit with china has soared over the past decade from 32 billion in 1995 to 100 billion in 2000 and 256 billion in 2007 the negative net balance in trade with china has grown to account for nearly 30 of the total us trade deficit16 the us trade deficit with china exceeded that with japan for the first in the year 2000 and now is more than three times as large china claims that its trade is less imbalanced than us data indicate chinese trade data differ from those of the united states primarily because of the treatment of hong kong as an entrepot since hong kong is separate customs area from mainland china beijing counts hong kong as the destination for its exports sent there even though the goods may be transshipped to other markets for example china would count laptop computer that is assembled in shanghai but shipped through hong kong before being exported to the united states as sale to hong kong by contrast the united states and many of chinas other trading partners count chinese exports that are transshipped through hong kong as products from china not hong kong including 16 for details and policy discussion seecrs report

amounts in securities equities and in factories in the united states the united states ran deficit of 412 billion in investment income with that co untry in 2007 this more than offset the surplus of 15 billion in trade in services with japan as result the current account deficit with japan of 1103 billion in 2007 exceeded the bilateral merchandise trade deficit of 851 billion likewise with china the us deficit on investment income of 361 billion far overshadowed the us surplus of 54 billion in services in 2007 different situation existed with the european union and canada the united states earned 396 billion surplus in investment income with the eu in 2007 greater than 2006 investment income surplus of 126 billion in 2007 the us surplus in services with the eu came to 367 billion these two flows offset merc handise deficit of 1139 billion to produce us current account deficit of 424 billion lower than the 2006 current account deficit of 869 billion from canada the united states received 169 billion in investment income plus surplus in services trade of 181 billion hence the current account deficit with canada at 373 billion was lower than the 706 billion merchandise trade deficit the rising deficit with many countries in investment income reflects the accumulating debt relative to the world of the united states inflows of capital to compensate for the us trade deficit and low us savings rate help to maintain the value of the dollar but interest paid and other income that accrues to that capital is often repatriated to the home countries that means more capital must be invested in the united states or the united states must export more to compensate for the outflows of investment income in 2007 the overall us balance on investment income registered surplus of 817 billion higher than the 2006 balance on investment income of 572 billion imbalances in investment income with certain countries have been growing and could become problem in the future

the united states long ran surplus in these products but that surplus dropped sharply in 2000 and turned into deficit in 2002 the us trade balance in high technology products was last in surplus in 2001 in 2002 to 2005 the us ran trade deficit in high technology products which grew roughly ten billion dollars per year from 166 billion to 436 billion in 2006 this deficit dropped to 381 billion but in 2007 resumed its former path of growing ten billion dollars per year to 526 billion this 2007 deficit represents about 40 increase over 2006 this does not necessarily imply the united states is losing the high technology race since many of the high technology imports are from us companies particularly electronics manufacturers who assemble the products overseas however this growing deficit

has used its experience with currency and exchange rate crises to say that caution should be exercised when nations current account deficit reaches level of 5 of gross domestic product at this level nations have difficulty borrowing to finance imports and the nations exchange rate may come under severe downward pressure the united states is special case since the dollar is secondary medium of exchange one can use dollars in many foreign countries without exchanging them for local currency and dollars are used extensively as an official reserve currency by national banks still the imf has been warning that the size of the us current account deficit could cause large depreciation of the dollar and disrupt financial markets

929 billion 47 of total in 2007 while imports from china rose from 152 billion 33 of total in 1990 to 3214 billion 164 of total in 200720 clearly the share of us imports from hong kong taiwan and south korea has been falling while the share of imports from china is rising the value of us imports from both however continues to rise while the value of those from china is rising faster the large us trade deficit with china moreover is not just transfer of the deficit from other asian nations to china the us trade deficit with hong kong taiwan and south korea has gone from 179 billion 175 of the total us deficit in 1990 to 118 billion 15 of the total in 2007 us trade with hong kong actuall went from deficit in 1992 to surplus in 1993 and has remained in surplus through 2007 the us trade deficit with china meanwhile went from 104 billion 102 of the total us trade deficit in 1990 to 2562 billion 322 of the total in 2007 what actually is happening is quite complex while the us trade
