architecture and egovernment issues for information technology management summary congressional policymakers are concerne d about potential inefficiencies and inefficacies in the operation of the federal government particularly as it relates to decisions regarding information technology it investments these concerns have increased as federal it spending has grown to approximately 70 billion annually one approach being implemented to redu ce duplicative spending and improve cross agency collaboration is the use of enterprise architecture ea planning across the federal government an ea serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the information and technol ogy needed to carry out these functions as an information technology management and planning tool ea planning represents businessdriven approach to information technology management that emphasizes interoperability and information sharing the federal enterprise architecture fea was started in 2002 by the office of management and budget omb and continues to be veloped today the fea is composed of five reference models performance business service data and technical each of the reference models represents specific aspects of the fea and provides common language for departments and agencies to use in developing shared technology solutions to focus efforts on specific areas that may yield savings omb has identified several lines of business lob wh ich represent noncore business functions common to many departments and agencies some of the current lobs include financial management gran ts management case ma nagement human resources management federal health architectur and information systems security within each of the lob initiatives the longer term goal is to shift the locus of activity for these noncore business functions fro m being replicated by each individual department and agency to consolidated shared service centers or centers of excellence as they are also referred to wh ich serve as common service providers for the other departments and agen cies departments and agencies are selected to serve as centers of excellence through competitive process managed by omb
