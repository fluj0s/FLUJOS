from the front 20012006 sean m maloney war studies program royal military college of canada abstract analytical focus on military operations in iraq continue to overshadow analysis of the war in afghanistan as it enters its sixth year it is now possible to discern several clearlydelineated periods of coalition counter insurgency and stabilization operations what is the nature of the war and howhas it evolved has there been success so far in afghanistan war in afghanistan is very strange general kulikov with analytical attention directed towards iraq and now the new american construct of the long war it is easy to forget that there is another major counterinsurgency war in progress involving western forces and that it is not the sole preserve of the us coalition operationsin afghanistan evolve dramatically from year to year and there areseveral overlapping problems involving insurgent political andcriminal violence in afghanistan 1simplistic analysis conducted by those seeking to jam the insurgency in afghanistan into maoistprocrustean bed and its response have only confused the issue for thenoncognoscenti 2the situation is compounded by the fact that there were and remain two major international military coalitions operating in afghanistan both work wi th afghan security forces and both in action against insurgent forces at the same time signiﬁcantlythe us also contributes forces to both organizations the ﬁrst operation enduring freedom or oef is americanled and is part of larger regional effort while the international security assistanceforce isaf started

referred to isafas peacekeeping mission which conversely implied that oef was awarﬁghting organization 3the reality of the situation is that both organizations conduct stabilization counterinsurgency and counter terrorism functions in many cases working together they have to theinsurgency in afghanistan adapts from year to year and this in turnprompts constant adaptation on the part of the international communityand their afghan government partners this study will lay out achronological and conceptual framework for understanding the war inafghanistan from 2001 to 2006 coalition military operations inafghanistan are complex they evolve annually and operate at many levels any commentator seeking to provide authoritative observations on the war in afghanistan must be aware of these factors this war doesnot ﬁt neatly into the categorizations usually assigned by analysts orcommentators the war in afghanistan can be broken down into distinct periods first there was the removal of the taliban regime and the hunt for alqaeda by oef this period lasted from september 2001 well into 2002from 2002 to 2004 international efforts were designed to stabilize afghanistan to prevent repeat of the 199396 civil war while at the same time staving off insurgent attempts to interfere with that processthe insurgent forces reorganized and reconceptualized their campaignand by 2005 refocused their efforts on southern afghanistan in 2006the insurgents severely challenged afghan government control of thesouthern provinces with much more sophisticated and organizedcampaign this conceptualization is not meant to suggest that insurgentviolence was absent from 2002 to 2005 indeed there was steady border campaign lowlevel unrest in the south and east and growing urban terrorist campaign throughout that period 200102 proxy war and the qaeda hunt the situation in afghanistan prior to intervention in 2001 consisted of civil war between various combinations of afghan religious ethnic andtribal groups combined with signiﬁcant external support to the different factions the taliban movement created and supported by pakistan controlled most of the country dominated by pashtuns the talibanenjoyed signiﬁcant support from pakistani military and intelligence awide variety of jihadists and exsoviet bloc mercenaries when theal qaeda organization was expelled from the sudan in 1996 itrelocated to afghanistan and developed network of sophisticatedterrorist and guerilla training camps biological and chemical weapons28 sm maloneydownloaded by open university library at 1718 18

and even static on many fronts where the terrain precluded maneuver there were prototypical american proxy efforts against the qaeda organization in the years prior to the intervention in afghanistan after the911 attacks an incoherent antial qaeda policy under the clintonadministration resulted in the deployment and later removal of smallcia liaison group codenamed jawbreaker into afghanistan during 2000to meet with the northern alliance which was at the time coordinated byfamed antisoviet guerilla ahmed shah massoud contingency planning was conducted to insert american special operations forces to kill osama bin laden but these plans were superseded by plan to use predatorunmanned aerial vehicles to act as spotters for submarinelaunched cruisemissiles variety of other covert operations designed to hunt and killosama bin laden were conducted without success using the northernalliance as proxy force or cover for us covert activities 5 after 911 the gloves came off the cias northern alliance liaison team reinitiated contact with the northern alliance to facilitate the introduction of american special operations forces to work with conventional forces in order to collapse the taliban regime at the sametime the intelligence relationship between the nalt and their afghancounterparts was used to gather information on the qaedaorganization in afghanistan and track its leadership with the objectiveof killing them using armed predator uavs and traditional airpower 6 american special operations forces teams working with cia facilitation and intelligence teams deployed across northern afghani stan in direct support of northern alliance forces these teams had access to signiﬁcant air resources which were then employed to supportnorthern alliance tactical and operational moves on the northern frontnorthern alliance forces used combination of bribery psyops andﬁghting to convince the taliban and qaeda forces to surrender ﬁghtamong themselves or otherwise

special operations forces established contact with antitaliban tribal elements coalesced them provided material support and initiated campaign designed to put pressure on the regime from the south in many cases this was classicus special forces task at the same time american and later allied tieri special operations forces 8conducted hunt for qaeda highvalue leadership targets in the south using the newlyliberated areas as baseand using the new tribal allies as intelligence assets this squeeze play produced dramatic results the taliban regime collapsed much earlier than anticipated9at this point american cia and special operations forces on the ground were trying to establish an eastern alliance in order to block retreating regime and qaedaforces generally enemy forces ﬂed south from the northern front tokabul then east to pakistan or south to number of mountainous areasenemy forces in the west and northwest headed to kandahar in thesouth with the intention of reaching pakistan

traditional tribal and ethnic areas of domination prompted the belated deployment of american canadian and later british light infantry to assist in the reduction of enemy defended areas in 2002more and more coalition special operations forces mostly from natocountries arrived to contribute to these operations after series of lightinfantrysof operations in the southern and eastern provincesconducted throughout 2002 taliban and qaeda formations andunits ceased to operate at level above platoonsized groups qaedalost all of its infrastructure in afghanistan qaeda afﬁliates like the umi also lost their safe haven and ability to interfere seriously with uzbekistan and its neighbors military operations in afghanistan duringthis period essentially forced qaeda to evolve its

regime was removed concerned planners long before the collapse but therewere easy answers there appear to have been two overlappingschools of thought in american circles the ﬁrst was to have handsoff approach whereby proamerican proxies would dominate thecountry and ensure that qaeda did not come back in in this schemaafghanistan would be left to its own devices with limited american support since the white house was suspicious of taking on nation building role 12the other school of thought envisaged an american handover to the united nations who would then handle reconstructionand political development with oef acting as shield this plan wasrather vague the however refused to become involved with suchan exercise unless there was nonus led military security force toprotect it at the same time the victorious afghan proxies weresuspicious of the the organization that abandoned them in the early 1990s compromise was reached in november 2001 the bonn agreement allowed for limited nonun nonus force that would beused to stabilize the capital kabul initially led by the uk theinternational security assistance force isaf started to deploy inspring 2002 13 for the most part however isaf was neutered it was small 1500 bayonets and 3000 support troops while the antitaliban factionsboasted at least 26000 troops equipped with the full range of conventional weapons isafs purpose was symbolic and acted as tool to get reconstruction buy in from the and nongovernmentalorganizations it was not peacekeeping force it was not neutral itprotected the emergent afghan interim administration and did what itcould to provide an international nonus presence in kabul 14 enemy forces reverted to relatively disorganized guerilla resistance in the southern provinces around this time by 2003 taliban groupswere incapable of operating at even the platoon level at the same time there were still signiﬁcant coalition operations tracking qaeda and taliban highvalue leadership targets an additional problem layhowever in consolidating the areas that had been cleared of talibanpresence the joint regional team jrt concept emerged from theserequirements in oef planning circles initially conceived as smallintelligence collection and aid liaison cells attached to friendly afghangovernors the idea evolved into the provincial reconstruction teamprt concept the prts had more

units to deal with the civilian population in areas where forces are maneuvering called civil affairs by the americans and civilmilitary cooperation by canada andnato they are not intended to be aid agencies or to provide venue forlongterm development in the balkans however there had beencoordination problems between ca and cimic and aid from nongovernmental organizations and governmental development agencies atwhat point did the handoff take place the nongovernment aidorganizations who generally view themselves as neutral did not want to work with the prts in afghanistan and saw them as military tools consequently ca and cimic took on more and more responsibility forthe development tasks which are vital in any counterinsurgency effort the prts however were there to support afghan governance efforts and to support oef information requirements relating to the civil andsecurity situation throughout afghanistan in the south prts were partand parcel of military efforts to root out what remained of the talibanin the north which was comparatively secure because of the ethnic makeup of the provinces this function had lower priority at least outside of konduz 16 it is important to note that the afghan government was embryonic in 2003 there was bureaucracy capable of running the country therewere central government organizations like ministry of the interiorchancellor of the exchequer and so on the governors were the antitaliban leaders who had armies that held allegiance to them not to acentral government they were temporarily legitimized by the afghan interim administration and with good reason oef was dependent on them for ongoing operations against the taliban and qaeda in thatthese commanders provided guides linguists protection forces forbases and vital logistics support 17 the degree of control exercised by coalition and afghan forces throughout the country was extremely localized for example oefexerted control of its bases in kandahar province while its afghanmilitia force allies had semblance of governance in kandahar city where power came from the barrel of gun and rough justice there was little or government presence in the region the concept ofcounterinsurgency operations in the south during 2003 involved thedeployment of special operations forces to network of forwardoperating bases civil affairs units deployed into uncontrolled areas toassess the situation in between those bases these two webs were used tocue two types of forces tier i special operations forces in the event32 sm maloneydownloaded by open

ied were used ona limited basis in both kabul and kandahar throughout 2003a spectacularly lethal suicide attack against german convoy in kabulin 2003 indicated that qaeda its allies and their afﬁliates were adoptingnew tactics even before the americans entered and occupied iraq where we would see even more dramatic evolution of these techniques 20 200304 preventing civil war there was increasing unease in european circles over leadership of isaf after these suicide attacks and it was difﬁcult to get european nation toaccept leadership of the force for variety of national interest reasonscanada agreed command of isaf but only if it were transformed into nato force by mid2003 isaf was natoized and canada took command in 2004 canadian commanders reassessed the stabilizationand reconstruction situation during this time and came to severalconclusions first not enough was being done to assist the afghaninterim administration in capacity building so it could actually governthe country second there was coherent national plan forreconstruction the and the europeans had failed to accomplisheven semblance of these critical tasks during their tenure the americans were busy elsewhere now in iraq third if something was not done to create national security structures the heavilyarmed antitaliban factions might ﬁght among themselves in bid for politicaldomination progress was particularly slow in building up police forcesand multiethnic afghan national army 21 the ﬁrst two problems were initially addressed by assigning small isaf team to help the afghan government plan and budget with an eyetowards increasing governance capacity the third problem became focus of isaf efforts for this period working with canada japan the us and the isaf formulated plan to demobilize and disarmregional military forces and then canton their heavy weapons for use bythe emergent ana at ﬁrst in kabul but with plans to move thisprogram throughout the country the ana training function washanded off to oef control since there had been centralized body tocoordinate numerous national efforts isaf forces in kabul becameconceptualizing the war in afghanistan 33downloaded by open

command the follow on staff drawn from the eurocorps hq led by french lieutenant generaljeanlouis py discarded the vital advisory and planning function some of these staff ofﬁcers believed that isaf should restrict itself to narrowly deﬁned security sector reform activities isaf conﬁned itself toadministering the local disarmament and cantonment plans protectingitself from urban terrorism and other minor operations within theenvirons of kabul the coordination of afghan national army planningwas in some disarray this shortsighted approach signiﬁcantly delayedcapacitybuilding efforts and is in retrospect major setback increased us involvement in iraq during 2004 drove plan to have nato isaf progressively take control of international efforts in certain parts of afghanistan in this schema nato isaf would take over anumber of prts in northern afghanistan if that worked out then stageii expansion would see nato take over prts in western afghanistanthe mission would remain the same assess and assist in governancecapacity building defanging the amf and assist with the introductionof afghan national army units and police into these areas germanythe uk the netherlands and new zealand were the main players in what became known as regional command north the fact that there was little or insurgent activity in this region made it fairly safe testbed the exception was konduz where the germans took casualties fromterrorists embedded in the pashtun population there 23 in the pashtundominated provinces along the pakistani border however qaeda and hig particularly and then increasingly thetaliban further south mounted border campaign military forceusually in the form of small raiding operations and rocket attacks was mostly directed at oef bases in border provinces but the campaign also involved increasingly sophisticated political tactics designed to subvertthe establishment of legitimate governance in these provinces 24 more and more enemy activity usually of political nature at ﬁrst was directed at interior provinces like oruzgan to give the campaigndepth presumably in order to lay the groundwork for future operationsthe enemy political campaign coincided with the runups to the 2004elections whereby the afghan interim administration would transition into fullyelected government widespread intimidation was employed in an attempt to coerce the populations in these provincesand increasingly in kabul combination of isaf and oef counterterrorism operations in kabul and massive isaf and oef securitypresence thwarted enemy efforts seriously to interfere with the unledand then certiﬁed election afghanistan now had legitimate electedgovernment supported by the vast majority of the afghan population 2534 sm maloneydownloaded by open university library at 1718 18 july 2008 another extremely important series of operations in the election run up related to the disarmament demobilization and cantonmentprograms afghan militia force leaders who wanted to be part of thepolitical process had to relinquish control of their armed forcesbeforehand or be declared antigovernment and therefore non participants in essence these men were forced to choose between being players in the political power game within the new system orremaining outside the system and then being dealt with using coerciveforce none of the major antitaliban commanders took up armsagainst the government the combination of the election and the cooption of the commanders represented major victory for stabilizationin afghanistan and signiﬁcant defeat for the taliban and itssupporters who did not even attempt to participate in the elections in nonviolent fashion 26 the main security problem however remained the afghan national army was slow to build up and police professionalizationand expansion was in an even worse state which dictated thecontinued presence of oef and isaf the policing pillar of theinternational effort held by germany was hampered by restrictionsplaced by the german government on how far the police trainerscould mentor their students german mentors were not permitted to accompany police outside of kabul the lack of bosniastyle international police task force structure meant that regional policetraining in the provinces was uneven or even nonexistent in theorythere should have been iptflike police units in the provinces workingwith the provincial reconstruction teams to build police capacity rightfrom the beginning and then there was the judiciary the capacitybuilding pillar held by the italians the nonexistent police could not turn over criminals to nonexistent judicial system in some provinces sharia law continued to dominate the proceedings while some afghan judges training in italychose to stay in italy as refugees and not return 27 another drawback was the hesitancy of nato countries to accept responsibility for future prt expansion which in turn should have beenthe basis for police and judiciary capacity building in most casesnato countries bickered over who would command safe prts thatis ones not directly affected by the taliban insurgency in the south and east in this game of musical chairs canada hesitated and was last to play there were safe prts left consequently canada committed tothe kandahar prt in the oef operating area the only nonus countryto commit to the reconstruction effort alongside the americans

that predominated in 2003 at some pointin 2004 there had been loss of momentum in the americanled effortsome have attributed this to the deployment of the 25th infantrydivision headquarters divisional

single big base and theprts to numerous ﬁrebases and forward operating bases in the borderprovinces special operations forces changed focus they moved to theinterior provinces and worked with the new afghan national armyunits to counter the increased taliban inﬂuence that emerged during the 2004 election campaign tier i special operations forces units remained oncall but since most highvalue targets were in pakistan direct actionmissions were more and more directed at mediumvalue targets insideafghanistan 29 qaeda and hig raiding operations on the border became more sophisticated in terms of equipment and organization which led somecoalition observers to believe that this was all training for somethinglarger in the future for the most part however enemy forces were incapable of operating in any organization larger than ten men anything larger was targeted and destroyed by airpower 30 although suicide bomb attacks directed against isaf and oef forces were not new in afghanistan enemy forces initiated suicide bombingcampaign in kandahar province during 2005 this campaign attracted asigniﬁcant amount of media attention as it was designed to do thepurpose of the campaign was to get the international audience tocompare the international effort in afghanistan to the apparently failing american effort in iraq and then exploit this to get western populations to pressure their governments to cease and desist in afghanistan theproximity of the suicide campaign in kandahar to the july 2005 londonbombings which in turn drew inspiration from the madrid attacks wasnot coincidental as we will recall the madrid attacks inﬂuenced spainswithdrawal from military operations in iraq this lesson was not lost onthe opposing forces in afghanistan and pakistan the deadlock on the capacitybuilding front was broken ﬁnally in late 2005 when the afghan government accepted the afghan national development strategy ands as the central basis for reconstructionand security efforts the ands was an afghan government document36 sm maloneydownloaded by open university library at 1718 18 july 2008 that was produced with an afghan staff mentored by canadian military group called strategic advisory teamafghanistan the andswas patterned on the multiyear road map used to coordinate natosfor and the international community efforts in bosnia 31there were however signiﬁcant alterations to deal with the unique aspects of the situation in afghanistan initiated in 200304 by the canadian isaf leadership and then derailed by the eurocorps staff the ands gave theinternational community strategy after four years of uncoordinatedefforts the ands had buyin from isaf oef 32and the most importantly the ands had buyin from the international monetary fund and the world bank organizations reluctant to invest inafghanistan unless there was clear plan only then could the necessarymonies ﬂow to fuel the reconstruction effort it is in this way that tactical considerations in the war in afghanistan have strategic implications stability and plan equals money and noreconstruction the level of stability established by isaf and oef overthe preceeding years was high enough at this point to secure theresources needed for the ﬁrst phases of reconstruction 33 it remains possible that the autumn 2005 suicide campaign was also designed to deter the imf and world bank from investing in thereconstruction effort with obvious beneﬁts to the taliban if that is the case the commitment of substantial forces to the south in preparation for the oef to isaf transition in 2006 had some effect at mufﬂing thisattempt for the most part there was comparatively little insurgent activity in afghanistan outside of the border provinces in the south and east and inkabul media attention directed at the suicide campaign in the southhowever made it appear to the outside world as though afghanistan hadcollapsed into complete anarchy this in turn had deterrent effect on nato countries asked to contribute to isaf in its expansion into southern afghanistan or regional command south oef could nothand over to isaf if there were isaf forces to hand over to canadawhich had already accepted prt lead in kandahar province committedto lead multinational brigade under oef and then transition theregion to isaf command the uk agreed to turn over its safe prt

in afghanistan 37downloaded by open university library at 1718 18 july 2008 the pattern of enemy activity in the south throughout 2006 indicates further evolution in methodology and objectives as we will recall oefdid not exert control over rc south it had selective control incertain areas and was pushing prt and special operations patrols intouncontrolled areas to assess them some provinces like nimroz had remained terra incognita since 2001 for example enemy forces had been using pakistan as base area in every sense logistics moneyweapons recruitment and training pakistani forces had sporadicallycooperated with oef in 200102 and again in 2004 but in the main thepakistani effort was focused on waziristan from where it is believed alqaeda and hig operate balochistan which has been in the throes ofinsurgency for decades is problematic for the pakistani governmentthe taliban organization is based in quetta and has qaeda and hig advisors attached to it 35 the suicide campaign in kandahar was undertaken for international effect but it also reﬂected the talibans impotence in rc southwhenever the taliban deployed ﬁghters in groups of larger than tenthey were usually interdicted and pounded with airpower throughout2005 however individuals and small groups inﬁltrated afghanistanalong several remote trade routes to create facilitation cells this magiccarpet was laid from pakistan to afghan districts on the border to certain areas inside kandahar helmand and oruzgan provinces weapons traveled separately from the personnel these mostly came inthrough the spinboldak highway concealed in trucks 36 number of districts were selected by the taliban to act as fortiﬁed areas using terrain which would slow down coalitionforces weapons and personnel were to converge and marry up inthese areas in preparation for future operations the fortiﬁed areas ineffect sat astride each of the four highways leading out of kandahar city with the obvious objectives of being able to cut off the city and launch attacks into it oef operations however detected the buildup in some areas and conducted series of operations to disrupt enemy forces before theycould coalesce particularly in kandahar and oruzgan provinces inmost cases the enemy dispersed when confronted but throughout 2006they kept coming back into these fortiﬁed areas and challenging oefforces and now isaf forces for control of them with operations that were nearly conventional in nature oef and isaf responded with conventional operations using mechanized infantry and artillery 37 this in turn prompted western commentators simplistically tocompare operations in afghanistan with us operations in vietnam38 and criticize the supposed lack of resources deployed for reconstructionand aid39a dramatic suicide attack that assassinated canadian ambassadoriallevel diplomat working with the prt in kandahar38 sm maloneydownloaded by open university library at 1718 18 july 2008 signiﬁcantly interfered with aid and reconstruction operations earlier in 2006 but to suggest that all activity stopped and only conventionalwarfare was underway was gross exaggeration leading to furtherconfusion in western media circles and electorates enemy forces have not refrained from conducting suicide attacks in and around kandahar city nor have they abandoned political warfare in the rural areas of rc south which involves targeting schoolsteachers doctors and clinics practically every enemy action has arelationship to both the situation on the ground and the internationalmedia and political arena enemy forces are adept at informationoperations and the willingness of western media to assist in this effortneeds further exploration the battle for the south is as psychological as it is material it is for the uncommitted portions of the population in rc south as the past has demonstrated in afghanist an this uncommitted component will side with those who are perceived to be winning the ﬁght this isa reﬂection of pashtun culture backing off on military operations andrefocusing on aid and development will not succeed the twocomponents must work together this is good point to discuss the narcotics issue as it cuts across all phases of the war in afghanistan but has particular relevance to the southern campaign the schizophrenic approach to counternarcotics by the international community in afghanistan has had negative effects onthe afghan governments ability to stabilize the south and hadparticularly negative effects on the counterinsurgency campaignpropelled by the uk who accepted the counternarcotics pillarleadership and supported by the us state department but notdepartment of defense or the cia advocates insisted that isaf andoef be involved in supporting paramilitary operations against opium producers in afghanistan both military organizations resisted involve ment but state departmentfunded afghan forces supported by isafforces operating under national command conducted counternarcoticsoperations anyway 40 narcotics producers particularly those in helmand province are wellorganized and armed they also have the support of the populationwho proﬁt from opium harvesting it was surprise that they foughtback in some cases they have formed alliances with enemy forces the taliban then uses the state department and ukled counternarcotics effort as recruitment tool insisting to the population that this outsideinterference will destroy their livelihoods which it does this state ofaffairs led to severe problems in 2006 british forces deploying intohelmand province encountered ﬁerce resistance which prompted asigniﬁcant diversion of canadian and american military forces fromzabol and kandahar provinces to rescue the situation indeed theconceptualizing the war in afghanistan 39downloaded by open university library at 1718 18 july 2008 taliban seized two districts in the south of the province and declared liberated zone which was eventually crushed by canadian and americanoef forces but not before some western media outlets declared that thewar in afghanistan was being lost 41 the spillover effects of this reportage have deterred most nato countries from sending additional combat forces to isaf in afghanistan leaving the abcd countries who are alreadystretched thin globally and now the poles who recently joinedisaf to counter the taliban in the south the enemy is succeeding onthe international psychological plane while coalition forces aresucceeding in the tactical and local military aid and reconstructionfronts napoleons dictum that the moral is to the physical as three isto one applies here afghanistan has to be understood as an qaeda front in the larger war against the crusaderzionists not just as local or regional problem defeat or even the perception ofdefeat of western forces in afghanistan will present qaeda with apropaganda coup of massive proportions and it will be used in themovements drive for more jihadists and adherents throughout themuslim world on positive note international recognition that pakistans lack of control of balochistan fuels the insurgency in southern afghanistan is ﬁnally part of the public debate concealed out of concern for ongoing pakistani cooperation in hunting down qaeda cells and the remnantsof aq khans atomic walmart incremental steps have now beentaken which at least indicate willingness on the part of presidentmusharraf to disrupt the ﬂow of resources into afghanistan we willsee nato members can legitimately question the international effort ifit seeks to limit its scrutiny to afghanistan and not the region especiallywhen their soldiers are getting killed the public debate over how the campaign in the south should be approached reached its peak in the summer of 2006 some initiallyapplauded the handover from oef to isaf asserting that theamericanled oef operations was too militarily oriented and believedthat isaf would bring softer approach to the situation with greateremphasis in developmental aid 42the reality is as both oef and isaf commanders knew that the only things that were really going to changewere ﬂags at the headquarters and certain rules of engagement to shift away from combat operations at the point where the taliban were deploying larger units companysized equipped with heavy weaponsand using more guerillaoriented tactics and less reliance on suicideterrorism would have been grave error this misunderstanding that exists in the public debate regarding the correct balance between development and military force should beaddressed more forcibly by those who study counterinsurgency indeed40 sm maloneydownloaded by open university library at 1718 18 july 2008 the simplistic analogies between afghanistan and iraq afghanistan and vietnam afghanistan and colombia continue to populate any nonspecialist discourse this plays into the hands of the enemysinformation operations campaign the inﬂuence of vietnam on particular generation of media commentators and editors leads us to the problems of bodycount the concurrent debate over american casualties in iraq was also reﬂected inbritish and canadian media outlets who reported absolutely everysingle casualty inﬂicted by the taliban on coalition forces 43but could not ﬁnd comparative means of reporting aid and constructiondevelopments short of amounts of money spent or an equivalentmethodology to report enemy dead quantitative methodologies aresimpler to understand for the noncognoscenti we lost x they lost they lost more so we are winning the difﬁculties of applying this paradigm in afghanistan are obvious fragmentation of enemypersonnel by modern weapons makes body count difﬁcult 44therefore it is easier for the media to count coalition casualties moreover successin the southern campaign should be measured by what the enemy doesnotcontrol the population and the districts if he does not control the population he cannot succeed in controlling southern afghanistan thetaliban does have semblance of parallel government but is it not extensive yet it should be targeted before it can evolve and grow all the taliban can do at this point is generate carnage and in most cases this amounts to more dead civilians than coalition soldiers theterrorist paradigms of the 1970s do not apply in this area eitherin theory the deaths of civilians should be tool used by the insurgentsto undermine the trust between the state and the people to demonstratethe limits of state power to protect the population and enhance thepower of the insurgents in afghanistan the level of violence between 1979 and 1996 far exceeded the levels employed now in effect the population is used to it they already know the limits of stateprotection the audience therefore consists of the wests populationswith the political theatre of afghanistan coming second indeed almostall suicide attacks in the south from 2003 to 2006 have been againstcoalition forces and not against mass groupings of civilians comparethis to iraq the prospects the reality is that political violence does not permeate afghanistan it permeates parts of afghanistan so far enemy forces do not control signiﬁcant territory in the country as whole they do not have theallegiance of the majority of afghans the allegiance of some afghanshangs in the balance enemy forces have challenged the

expanded inﬂuence throughout afghanistan probablynot the taliban are of pashtun ethnicity or about 38 per cent of thepopulation it is unlikely that the taliban as mass movement couldgain the allegiance of tajiks hazaras and uzbeks the taliban and its qaeda and hig supporters could however take control of signiﬁcant portions of southern afghanistan if left unchecked theultimate result of such situation would be the creation of apashtunistan statelet which qaeda and afﬁliates could use as securebase area once again it would destroy and discredit western efforts toback legitimate progressive afghan government it would nullify thepositive psychological beneﬁts gained in the wake of 911 when theinitial intervention was the ﬁrst clearcut victory over the qaeda movement in short failure in the southern campaign in afghanistan at this point would be disastrous in the long war notes 1 the author has traveled to afghanistan annually since early 2003 to observe coalition military operations and international capacitybuilding efforts this article draws on this body ofpersonal experience numerous incamera interviews and myriad brieﬁngs received over thisfouryear period in addition to the growing secondary source literature 2 speciﬁcally the canadian debate included criticism of the deployment of armored vehicles implying that if nato was ﬁghting nearconventional war then the insurgency hadprogressed from terrorism to guerilla warfare to nearconventional warfare and therefore nato and the government of afghanistan were losing see minutes of the house of commons

indigenous forces while tier iii tend to be light infantry raiding units that operate at the battalion level in practice there is some overlap in the missions and in many cases tier i unitmay be
