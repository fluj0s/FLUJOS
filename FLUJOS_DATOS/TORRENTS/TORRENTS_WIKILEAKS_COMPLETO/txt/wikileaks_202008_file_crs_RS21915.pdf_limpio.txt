markle foundation task force recommendations guidelines must be set by the president regarding personal information collection analysis and availability which among other considerations will enable

allow such information to be effectively used analyzed and disseminated while also ensuring that information about people in the united states is used in responsible fashion that respects responsible

sharing of private sector data among agencies which would help the government to ensure that information is used in ways that are consistent with core national values including privacy other civil liberties and the functioning of an accountable democratic political system rules governing access to and use of pr ivate sector data should be based primarily on two dominant considerations the value of the information to the government and the sensitivity of the information from the perspective of individual priv acy and other civil liberties it is strongly preferred that private sector data be kept in the private sector whenever possible rather than having the government retain it in areas where the government has compelling need to retain private sector information solution might be to create trusted data banks within the government with strict limitations on who has access to the underlying data and for what specific purpose another way to help limit the government retention of private sector data to that which is essential to the mission would be to require formal written justifications for the creation and retention of data sets that contain personally iden tifiable information the recommended guidelines must so address the question of how to assure compliance with the required policies and procedures and foster accountability and some agency the department of homeland security is recommended must have overall superv isory responsibility to oversee the application of the guidelines oversight of government use of priv ate sector information should ensure the accuracy of the data that is brought into the information network because accuracy is vital not only to protect the privacy and civil liberties of individuals who can be harmed by the use of inaccurate data but also to assure that information has real value to the counterterrorism effort15 key gilmore commission recommendation the president should establish an i ndependent bipartis an
