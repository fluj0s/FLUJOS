bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential supplemental benefits documentation board of directors retreat fy06 walmart stores inc bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 1 reviewing and revising walmarts benefits strategy memorandum to the board of directors from susan chambers the purpose of this memorandum is to update you on our efforts to review and revise walmarts benefits strategy in response t concerns about cost trends and growing public scrutiny i with the support of mckinsey company recently led 15person team drawn from across th company in 1 evaluating walmarts approach to benefits and 2 developing strategy to address any shortcomings we evaluated walmarts current benefits offering t hrough three lenses cost trends associate satisfaction and public reputati on and are now recommending revisions to our benefits strategy bui lt around nine limitedrisk initiatives and five bold steps while we contin ue to refine our thinking i wanted to take this opportunity to share with you t he breadth of our considerations to highlight the direction we are h eaded and to solicit feedback that will guide our final recommendations this memorandum summarizes our work and is divided into three sections section 1 provides detailed analysis of the three most sig nificant benefitsrelated challenges we face circle4 growth in benefits costs is unacceptable 15 percen t per year and driven by fundamental and persistent root causes g aging workforce increasing average tenure unabated b enefits costs could consume an incremental 12 percent of our tota l profits in 2011 equal to 30 billion to 35 billion in market capit alization circle4 while associates are satisfied overall with their b enefits they are opposed to most traditional costcontrol levers g higher deductibles for health insurance satisfaction so varies significantly by benefit and by segment of associates most trou bling the least healthy least productive associates are more satis fied with their benefits than other segments and are interested in longer careers with walmart bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 2 circle4 walmarts healthcare benefit is one of the most pr essing reputation issues we face because wellfunded wellorganized critics as well as state government officials are carefully scrutiniz ing walmarts offering moreover our offering is vulnerable to at least some of their criticisms especially with regard to the affordabi lity of coverage and associates reliance on medicaid section 2 discusses in detail the nine limitedrisk initiati ves and five bold steps we are recommending given conflicts inheren t in the challenges we face any set of solutions will require carefull balancing and sometimes making tradeoffs between cost associat satisfaction and public reputation circle4 limitedrisk initiatives we are recommending that walmart realign eligibility requirements for health insuran ce decrease cross subsidization of spouses give associates more information about how to use healthcare and health insurance lower c ompanypaid life insurance coverage levels capture savings from cur rent initiatives to improve labor productivity add combination of be st practice care management programs further develop highperforman ce provider networks offer associates bundles of other benefit s eg paid time off from which to choose and continue to explore adding health clinics in stores these initiatives will reduce c osts and will slightly improve associate satisfaction circle4 bold steps the nine limitedrisk initiatives will not fully address all the benefitsrelated challenges we face to fully address these challenges we recommend that walmart take five bo ld steps that will require more explicit tradeoffs between cost asso ciate satisfaction and public reputation the first two recommended s teps primarily address cost trends the third addresses attracting healthier workforce and the last two steps address improving our public reputation move all associates to progressively designed sumerdriven health plans to help control cost trends while allo wing associates to build up savings in health savings accounts restructure the retirement program ie profit sh aring and 401k program to reduce costs and help associates better save for retirement bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 3 redesign benefits and other aspects of the associat experience such as job design to attract healthier more pr oductive workforce make some select strategic investments in our healt hcare offering eg lower maximum outofpocket expenses so it can better withstand external scrutiny improve communication of walmarts benefits offeri ng so we get more credit for what we provide and over the long term work to shape state and national outcomes on healthcare section 3 summarizes the combined impact of the limitedrisk initiatives and the bold steps the team believes this new str ategy will bring powerful advantages to walmart including circle4 maintaining benefits spend at or below todays leve l as percentage of sales circle4 offering more attractive benefits package for hea lthy associates circle4 better positioning us to fight walmarts critics we presented this material to the executive benefit s steering committee tom hyde lawrence jackson and tom schoewe in late ju ly they received the recommendations enthusiastically and asked that we share them widely within walmart something we have begun to do they also asked that the team continue to test and refine the strategy especiall with associates and external stakeholders our aspiration is to complete this w ork by late september receive executive committee approval on the overall strateg by early october and hold special session with you in november for further discussion bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 4 1 major benefitsrelated challenges we analyzed the benefitsrelated challenges facing walmart through three lenses cost trends associate satisfaction and p ublic reputation cost trends from 2002 to 2005 our benefits costs grew signific antly faster than sales rising from 15 percent of sales to 19 percent benefits spend grew from 28 billion to 42 billion during this period at rate of 15 pe rcent per year striving to hold benefits costs as percent of sales constant is cr itical for walmarts longterm economic success few benefits made up the bulk of this increase healthcare 15 billion grew by 19 percent paid time off 14 billion grew by 14 percent and the profit sharing and 401k program 740 million grew by 1 3 percent over the period the domestic associate base grew at 5 percent and d omestic sales grew at 11 percent increased utilization of medical services which gr ew by 10 percent per year was the primary driver of the rapid growth in our healt hcare costs exhibit 1 almost half of this utilization growth was due to three wa lmartspecific workforce factors distinct from national trends our workforce is aging faster 050 years per calen dar year than the national average 012 years per calendar year our workers are getting sicker than the national po pulation particularly with obesityrelated diseases for example the pr evalence of coronary artery disease in walmarts population grew by 6 p ercent compared to national average of 1 percent and the prevalence f diabetes in our population grew by 10 percent compared to nationa l average of 3 percent that said our workforce is sicker at present in absolute terms than the national population segment of our workforce consumes healthcare inef ficiently in pattern similar to medicaid population our population tends to over bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 5 utilize emergency room and hospital services and derutilize prescriptions and doctor visits this pattern is m ost evident among our lowincome associates and one hypothesis is that t his behavior may result from prior experience with medicaid programs compounding these problems are several national tre nds such as the increased use of technological innovations which are driving increased utilization of medical services across the us healthcare system the cost of walmarts profitsharing and 401k pr ogram and paid time off grew faster than overall associate growth due largely t increasing associate tenure over the past 4 years the average associate tenure has increased by 02 months per calendar year as result more associa tes qualify for participation in benefits programs like the profit sharing and 401k plan and for more paid time off an even more important factor is wages which increase in lockstep with tenure and directly drive the cost of many benefits eg 401k is percentage of wages given the impact of tenure on wages and be nefits the cost of an associate with 7 years of tenure is almost 55 perce nt more than the cost of an associate with 1 year of tenure yet there is di fference in his or her productivity exhibit 2 moreover because we pay an associate more in salary and benefits as his or her tenure increases we are pricing that associate out of the labor market increasing the likelihood that he or she will stay with walmart we have also not effectively leveraged our benefits spend per associate which should be thought of as fixed cost for employing that associate we have allowed our fulltime associates to average only 34 hours of work per week increasing the hours worked per associate would ena ble walmart to lower our labor cost per hour by spreading benefits costs ove r more hours we also have one of the highest percentages of fulltime associa tes in the retail industry even though fulltime associates are more expensive per labor hour in terms of both benefits and wages associate satisfaction associates are satisfied with their overall benefit s package but they have expressed significant opposition to most traditiona l costcontrol levers for instance associates strongly oppose higher deducti bles or limits to their choice of providers satisfaction varies significantly h owever by benefit and by segment of associate creating an opportunity to re balance the benefits portfolio to improve satisfaction while reducing costs in p articular the least healthy least bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 6 productive associates are more satisfied with their benefits than other segments and are interested in longer careers with walmart overall associates are satisfied with their benefi ts relative to peers at other retailers in survey of retail workers associat ranked walmarts benefits above the industry average in availability ability to qualify quality and execution eg claims processing the cost of healthcare coverage was the only factor on which we scored poorly associate satisfaction and view of importance vary significantly by specific benefit exhibit 3 for example associates rank health insurance as the most important benefit walmart offers but they also sa it is the one with which they are least satisfied the stock purchase plan the profit sharing and 401k program and life insurance are all ranked highsat isfaction lowimportance suggesting an opportunity to rebalance walmarts i nvestment in these benefits into other more important benefits paid time off and the discount card are the only high satisfaction highimportance benefits associate satisfaction with benefits also varies si gnificantly by segment of associates the team analyzed the associate popula tion on wide variety of factors eg attitude health behavior tenure the most fruitful of which was annual healthcare spend the socalled low utiliz ers are the most attractive associate segment because they cost walmart less i n terms of healthcare expenses and are more productive in their jobs p roductivity findings were based on analysis of individual cashier items per h our data moreover this segment also showed healthier behaviors specifical ly less prevalence of obesity unfortunately the low utilizers were also least satisfied with our benefits and were planning shorter careers with walmart this segment favors different type of benefits package than do the high utilizer s and different than what we offer today health insurance more closely modeled on consumerdriven health plans lower premiums higher deductibles and hea lth savings accounts they also prefer certain nonmedical benefits such as h elp in saving to purchase home and help in paying for more education neither of which do we offer in robust way today it is worth noting however that overall benefits only play small role in attracting associates to walmart and in keeping associates sa tisfied while at walmart our benefits offering played key role in attracti ng just 3 percent of our associates moreover satisfaction with benefits d oes not correlate with satisfaction with walmart variety of factors especially associates interactions with management are more important bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 7 public reputation healthcare is one of the most pressing reputation i ssues facing walmart survey work done last summer shows that peoples pe rception of our wages and benefits is key driver of walmarts overall repu tation several groups are now mounting attacks against walmart focused on our he althcare offering these increasingly wellorganized and wellfunded critics especially the labor unions and related groups such as walmart watch have s elected healthcare as their main avenue of attack moreover federal and state governments are increasingly concerned about healthcare costs and many view walmart as part of the problem view due in part to the work of walmarts critics medicaid costs are major priority on most governors agend as already quarter of states are spending more than 25 percent of their b udgets on medicaid and observers across the political spectrum assert that the current system with spiraling costs large population of uninsured nd an increasing number of medical bankruptcies is unsustainable although t here is little consensus on what should take its place in this environment we can expect efforts like those in maryland which is trying to mandate that compan ies spend certain percentage of revenue on healthcare and new hampsh ire which requires health services to track where medicaid enrollees re employed to accelerate proposals such as these if successful will bring added costs to walmart moreover these battles with critics and government s are contributing to the decline of walmarts overall reputation our healthcare offering is also vulnerable to attac k we have not effectively communicated the generosity of our healthcare benef its to the general public instead we have thus far allowed our critics to fr ame the debate for instance only 22 percent of americans find it very believabl that walmart provides health insurance to 900000 people walmarts critics ca n also easily exploit some aspects of our benefits offering to make their case in other words our critics are correct in some of their observations specificall our coverage is expensive for lowincome families and walmart has significant percentage of associates and their children on public assistance consider the following on average associates spend 8 percent of their inc ome on healthcare premiums plus deductibles plus outofpocket expen ses for themselves and their families nearly twice the national avera ge the number varies significantly by plan type rising to 13 percent fo r those on the associate and spouse plan in 2004 38 percent of enrolled ssociates spent more than 16 percent of the average walmart income on healthcare bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 8 critics contend that the costliness of walmarts h ealthcare coverage causes it to enroll fewer associates in its health insurance plan than do most national employers 48 percent versus 68 perce nt exhibit 4 we also have significant number of associates and their children who receive health insurance through publicassistance programs five percent of our associates are on medicaid compared to an average for national employers of 4 percent twentyseven perc ent of associates children are on such programs compared to nation average of 22 percent exhibit 5 in total 46 percent of assoc iates children are either on medicaid or are uninsured on both of these issues affordability and public assistance it is important to note that our offering and performance are on par w ith other retailers walmarts critics however hold it to large company stan dard not retailer standard despite the difference in industry economics criti cs believe we should behave more like gm or microsoft than target or ars while critics have not yet harnessed all of these facts they are successf ully exploiting those they do have suggesting that when discovered the others will also become effective ammunition bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 9 2 proposed revisions to benefits strategy against the backdrop of these challenges the team is recommending that wal mart implement the nine limitedrisk initiatives an d five bold steps discussed in detail in this section limitedrisk initiatives these nine initiatives require little or tradeo ff between cost associate satisfaction and public reputation exhibit 6 pro vides an overview of these initiatives 1 realign eligibility requirements for health insu rance so that associates fulltime and parttime and their chil dren could qualify after for example defined number of hours this move would simplify external communications make walmart even more co mpetitive in the parttime labor market and help align costs with t he economics of the business in that the benefit is based on hours wor ked on average for example 1000 hour requirement would translate in to 6 months for full time associates same as today and 1 year for part time associates versus 2 years today 2 decrease crosssubsidization of spouses through higher premiums or other charges spouses are by far the most expe nsive plan members to cover and walmart pays more per spouse than pe r associate this change would allow us to put more dollars towards ssociates and their children 3 give associates more information about how to us healthcare and health insurance many associates are making inefficient decisions about what healthcare services to use eg relyin g too much on emergency rooms we need to give associates more i nformation on the cost and quality of specific health services bette r educate them on how best to utilize healthcare and develop education fforts specifically for those associates who have previously been uninsured or on public assistance bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 10 4 lower companypaid life insurance coverage level s to maximum payout of 12000 life insurance although smal l cost is the fastest growing benefits cost it is also highsatisfact ion lowimportance benefit which suggests an opportunity to trim the offering without substantial impact on associate satisfaction the companypaid policy currently covers one times an associates annual sa lary which is slightly more generous than most retailers 5 capture savings from current initiatives to impr ove labor productivity these initiatives include reducing the number of bor hours per store increasing the percentage of part time associates in stores and increasing the number of hours per asso ciate these changes represent major costsavings opportunity with relatively little impact on existing associates the most significan t challenge here is that the shift to more parttime associates will wer walmarts healthcare enrollment even with the more generous parttime offering outlined above which could have an impact on publ ic reputation 6 add combination of best practice caremanageme nt programs including utilization management case management disease management and errors and omissions programs the programs primarily improve quality of care but we believe t hey may also produce modest cost savings by improving care coordination and compliance for extremely sick associates who drive disproportio nate share of the cost 7 further develop highperformance provider eg doctors hospitals networks so as to direct associates to the most efficient nd effective healthcare providers the quality of car and cost of care vary significantly among doctors we should be on the c utting edge of efforts to identify the best doctors by for instance work ing with payors to find new ways to identify them we should then create p rovider networks made up only of those doctors and provide associate s with incentives for using them 8 offer associates bundles of other benefits eg paid time off education discount card from which to choose our benefits package today is one size fits all even though d ifferent segments of associates value specific benefits differently fo r instance one segment would happily give up some paid time off in exchang for more generous discount card while we believe every ass ociate on wal mart plan should have core healthcare and retirem ent offering we bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 11 could more effectively spend our remaining benefits dollars by allowing associates to choose from among several packages of benefits 9 continue to explore adding health clinics in sto res walmart is starting an effort to put clinics in stores stra tegy currently framed as realestate opportunity over the long term and w ith several important modifications eg innovations to create lowerco st visits these clinics could become an important part of our healthcare st rategy especially as substitute for emergency room visits taken together these nine initiatives should reduce walmarts projected healthcare costs from projected 23 percent of sa in 2011 to projected 20 percent of sales largely due to the impact of init iative 5 on productivity the initiatives should also slightly improve associate satisfaction they will not likely have any significant impact positive or negative on public reputation bold steps the following five bold steps will be more difficul t to execute than the limitedrisk initiatives but their impact will be much greater exhibit 7 provides an overview of these steps move all associates to progressively designed sumerdriven health plans to help control cost trends while all owing associates to build up health savings accounts while relatively new in the united states consumer driven health plans have been proven to control medical cost trends more eff ectively than traditional plans in both domestic eg logan aluminum and interna tional eg singapore settings in the place of traditional plans with d eductibles associates get health savings account hsa or pretax bank accou nt for health expenses that is similar to 401k an hsa can be funded from three sources annual seed money from walmart an annual contribution from th associate and matching contribution from walmart the associate uses the hsa to cover his or her first dollar medical expenses every year when an associ ate has used up his or her hsa there may be bridge the associate must cov er which would be the difference between the amount in the hsa and the po int at which coinsurance takes over typically level equivalent to tradi tional high deductible plan bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 12 consumerdriven health plans are more effective at controlling costs than traditional plans because enrollees have greater re sponsibility for their healthcare spending hsa funds belong to the associate so he or she has stake in using the money wisely if the associate leaves walmart the hsa funds go with him or her if hsa contains money at the end of the ye ar those funds roll over for use in the following year the bridge which an ass ociate with high healthcare expenses may face would also serve as further bra ke on spending consumer driven health plans are particularly attractive to the healthy productive associate segment because this segment now gets something for enrolling in health insurance and staying healthy they can save money in their hsa the key to achieving these advantages is to have th vast majority of associates participate in hsa plans or other plans that incent behavior modification and cost control otherwise only the healthiest enroll and there is very little cost reduction because healthy people spend so little on healthcar during this years enrollment cycle we are offering few consumerdr iven health plans alongside many other options these existing offerings can rve as an effective starting point for the transition such plans would have several advantages for associ ates more than 80 percent of associates would be better off financial ly under the proposed consumerdriven health plans than under traditional plans associates can also accumulate wealth in their hsas typical associa who is generally healthy would have 600 to 2100 in savings after 3 years associates can use this wealth both for significant health events and retir ement associates can also use their hsas to cover wide variety of health expens including vision dental preventive care and other spending not covered by the plan to make this change palatable externally the plan design must be progressive meaning it cannot involve any cost shifting in tr ansitioning to consumerdriven health plans many companies have chosen to push mo re costs onto employees move that has given these plans bad reputation among progressives the plans proposed by the team do not involve any cost shifting moreover growing number of companies are implementing such p lans providing walmart with more political cover many retailers eg s taples toys r us are offering consumerdriven health plans as one option among ma ny and the ever progressive whole foods recently moved all of its mployees to such plan to much media fanfare the primary reason for making this transition would be to reduce future benefits costs and those savings would be significant 40 0 million to 700 million in fy2011 all from reduced trend this change does however come with several bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 13 challenges overall consumerdriven health plans re less popular with associates than traditional plans albeit not drama tically so and are more difficult to communicate strong opposition is isolated to pproximately 10 percent of associates walmart will also face reputation cha llenges in implementing this change given that progressives view such plans as republican answer walmart will have to be sophisticated and forceful in communicating this change internally and externally restructure the retirement program ie the profi t sharing and 401k program to reduce costs and help associates better save for retirement we should reduce our overall investment in the prof it sharing and 401k program from approximately 4 percent of wages to approximat ely 3 percent of wages doing so would bring the program more in line with retail offerings and would save walmart substantial sum of money hewitt r anks our retirement program as the best in its nonunion hourly retail benchmar k set given the scrutiny that walmart receives on healthcare and that retirement is lowimportance benefit for associates the retirement program seems to be the wrong place for overinvestment we should also redesign the specifics of our retire ment program in particular we should convert the 401k program from nostr ingsattached flat contribution to matching program in which associa tes receive funds from wal mart based on the contribution they make to their 4 01k such program would help associates better prepare for retirement f ully participating career associate would be able to replace 30 to 40 percent of his or her income at retirement compared to 15 percent today resulting in some 80 to 90 percent of income replaced at retirement when social security is included overall this proposal would save walmart signifi cant amount of money 350 million to 400 million in fy2011 with respect to associate satisfaction associates reacted positively to matching retirem ent program although they slightly preferred the current program although c ritics will contend that the new program is less generous than the current one reti rement has not been major issue in the external environment bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 14 redesign benefits and other aspects of the associat experience such as job design to attract healthier more pr oductive workforce given the significant savings from even small imp rovement in the health of our associate base walmart should seek to attract h ealthier workforce the first recommendation in this section moving all associat to consumerdriven health plans will help achieve this goal because these pl ans are more attractive to healthier associates the team is also considering additional initiatives to support this objective including design all jobs to include some physical activity eg all cashiers do some cart gathering offer savings via the discount card on healthy food s eg fruits and vegetables offer benefits that appeal to healthy associates g an education offering targeted at students healthier workforce will lead to lower health ins urance costs lower absenteeism through fewer sick days and higher pro ductivity it will be far easier to attract and retain healthier workforce than it will be to change behavior in an existing one these moves would also dissuade unhe althy people from coming to work at walmart even modest shift in walma rts ability to attract and retain healthier workforce could result in signif icant savings 220 million to 670 million in fy2011 the key tasks in implement ing this fourth bold step once the team has developed more complete list of actions are to create clear set of metrics to measure success to run pil ots in several stores to understand each ideas effectiveness and then roll out the most successful ones make series of strategic investments in our healt hcare offering so it can better withstand external scrutiny the team is investigating several ideas to identify if there are targeted investments or plan modifications we could make tha t would yield significant reputational benefit the following are couple f ideas being explored to address concerns about affordability maintain c ommitment to offer an insurance plan that covers associates for 1day or 14 per pay period and allows them to cover their children for another 1day to further address concerns about affordability wer an associates maximum exposure to medical financial risk premium s plus deductibles bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 15 plus copayments to more manageable level poten tially 15 percent of the average income for fulltime associate to address concerns about access help associates g ain access to the private insurance market after 30 days of employmen t and potentially provide them with limited funding for doing so whil they wait to become eligible for walmarts plan these changes would give us powerful set of messa ges to use in combating critics for instance walmart offers associate s access to health insurance after theyve worked with us for just 30 days t hese kinds of changes would also make walmarts coverage more affordable and ccessible directly addressing critics and associates most persistent arguments while this fourth bold step should create goodwill both internally and externally it will be expensive in fy2011 the cost of these th ree proposals would be between 300 million and 350 million considering the steep cost as well as the potential unintended implications on underlying plan design the team is rigorously testing these ideas with the public and policymakers to determine whether these investments would effectively move t he needle on walmarts public reputation improve communication of our benefits offering so w get more credit for what we provide and over the long term work to shape the outcomes of state and national healthcare refor m efforts we need to be more proactive in the public arena three efforts are needed here address the medicaid issue headon by reframing the debate eg this is everyones problem not just walmarts and by offering some type of counterproposal or compromise this first effort i s critical because walmart is under serious attack from state governm ents with regard to the number of associates on publicly funded health insurance these attacks show signs of abating in fact they em to be accelerating and elected officials are proposing increasingly costly solutions clarify and improve messages about our healthcare ffering building on the proposed changes outlined above and engage in sustained communication campaign this kind of communication will help us reframe public perception of our healthcare offerin g the only way for us bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 16 to start winning the debate with our critics it w ill also help us build the credibility needed to weigh in more broadly on us healthcare issues become more engaged in the national healthcare deba to position walmart as leader in healthcare in general and n access eg individual mandates and affordability eg bring ing it to healthcare in particular establishing walmart as leader on t his critical issue will help deflate our critics it will also put us in position to help shape the outcome of the public debate about the healthcare c risis in way that is at least somewhat advantageous to our interests bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 17 3 impact of the proposed changes taken together the limitedrisk initiatives and the bold steps create powerful set of advantages for walmart significant advantages the new strategy will enable us to deal with all th ree of the benefitsrelated challenges we face cost control benefits costs are modeled to be at or below 19 percent of sales ie level as of fy 2005 in 2011 the limitedrisk initiatives result in reduction in projected 2011 benefits co sts of about 16 percent and the bold steps yield another reduction of about 9 percent associate satisfaction associates will have more generous healthcare benefit with an hsa to cover firstdolla r expenses greater protection against medical risk and the ability to accumulate wealth in their hsas retirement benefit that helps them pr epare more effectively for retirement and more choice especially with re gard to selecting other benefits eg paid time off moreover we will be more effective at attracting and retaining the healthy productive wo rkforce walmart wants public reputation by providing associates more affordable health coverage and responding to concerns about walmart s medicaids chip enrollment we will have addressed our critics most potent arguments we will also have steppedup our effort s to communicate the strengths of walmarts benefits offering and c ounter critics claims finally we will have positioned walmart to have seat at the table in the public debate about healthcare reform bod retreat fyo6 benefits strategy confidential 18 risks the risks associated with these changes are worth c arefully noting addressing them will require among other things attention to implementation planning communication and execution cost risk if costs saving initiatives are not properly seque nced with those that require investments costs could increas before they decrease associate satisfaction risk some of the proposed revisions to the benefits strategy eg the move to consumerdrive n health plans the changes in the retirement program have the potenti to upset associates especially more tenured associates public reputation risk healthcare enrollment will fall several percentage points due primarily to shift to more parttime associates which could draw additional attacks from walmarts critics also despite the proposed efforts the medicaid problem will not be solved significant number of associates and their childr will still qualify for medicaid because many of these programs will offe r more generous health insurance than walmart provides many assoc iates will still choose to enroll in medicaid leaving the door open for continued attacks the team believes that the advantages of the propos ed strategy outweigh these risks i appreciate your taking
