shsbc 84 routine 3d continued lecture given on 15 november 1961 well as you can see i walk in here your case is in my hands thats joke but not quite so much of one as you might think all right i suppose you are still in gentlemanly and ladylike frame of mind about 3d and you are wrestling with it little later youll be rassling with it little less ladylike perhaps the truths of the case is that there are some possible randomities in routine 3d which could get you into various upsets but what is this now this is the 15th of november 1961 special briefing course saint hill and we have under discussion routine 3d now we still have some people around who want to know why are we finding an opposition terminal and all that sort of thing well what broke down the whole thing was that majority of people were not going clear on routine 3 now why werent they so i got small pick and shovel and began to go into skulls and then i got one of these widowmaker pavement breakers and started going in little bit deep and then got an oil well rig and really started going down two or three miles and i finally found out that the length of time of clearing clearing would eventually happen but the length of time of clearing is in direct ratio to the dramatization of the modifier i found new piece here the modifier now on people who clear fast it accidentally runs out fast and on people who are clearing very very slowly at lord knows how many hours it was running out very slowly now what is this modifier it is the threat the pc makes if he cannot obtain his goal covert character this thetan huh he says well he said im going to build buildings isnt that sweet thats nice isnt it thats real nice you know thats good thats good thats socially acceptable everythings fine and he says to build buildings and everybody says cheers hes going to be great engineer you know great construction man and so on and his tutors pat him on the head and everything goes along swimmingly and everything is marvelous and you try to clear the fellow on this goal to be great engineer well whats your what this question should be asked why do we have to clear him on being great engineer this is obviously the sole virtue this character has yeah lets ask that burning question why do we have to clear him on to be great engineer huh aha aha we twist the moustache at its long waxed ends and look down his throat and what do we find well ive said well it must be problem because its hanging up on the track to be suspended on the track this goal must then be suspended against something which is otherdetermined to it ah all right i didnt look very far but the first thing i found was this modifier and thats the pcs is to be great engineer and if they dont applaud sufficiently ven i put up buildings to have them fall down and crush them into da street now for some weeks i went around doing background music study on this thing and i was quite interested to find in all the works of man every one of them has got booby trap built into it you tell homo sap to mow lawn and its all fine but theres just something there you see its not being critical its the fact the lawn is too short or its too long or it isnt mowed around the fringes or they stop the mower in the middle of the lawn and fill it with gas can and spill some we say well its just carelessness you know so you say to the fellow well now the next time you mow the lawn why pull the lawn mower off to the side onto path and there fill it with the gas can you see and then you spill all you want to see and you come back next time and the wheels of the mower have been spinning in some fashion to cut large ruts across the best place but he did do this other you see but there are these ruts in the lawn now well ive had lot of experience with homo sap and of course ive had to live with myself too thats taken some doing believe it isnt everybody could have done that but here we had this marvelous thing going on whereby if you dont quite watch it why theres going to be something built there so the fifteenth step up the tower is not welded what are these things and what are these things and i asked myself that for number of weeks i went around and observed all these things and so forth i dont get up in some ivory tower because theyre drafty these ivory towers its much better to be out amongst the warmth of humanity if youre studying it and its new thought you know in the whole field of philosophy is go and look at what youre studying brandnew thought actually newer than you think so i couldnt find anything man was doing that he wasnt building little problem into and the worse he was off the more problems he was building into what he was making or what he was doing and this seemed to to be very interesting well now this wasnt to be very honest with you bluntly and directly solved by the modifier it wasnt just one two these two studies one study resulted of mans errors resulted in the other studies it just happens i had been studying this for some weeks which probably catalyzed my observation of these other things what i found out was that pcs went downhill as they were clearing and then went uphill and sometimes they went downhill for long time and then went uphill but they always went downhill before they went uphill isnt that interesting well it violates the rules of early auditing you give somebody some auditing and he gets better see he doesnt get worse and then gets better so we must have must be bug in here someplace what is this that has gotten around and we find out on further observation that there was reservation on the goal in other words whatever the person set out to do he had little bit of reservation kicking around lets just put it that way thats the mildest most acceptable form of it but its worse than that you ask this person now you want to be great engineer all right very good now what would be your answer to constant failure at this goal what would you add to the goal if you continued to fail in it and so forth and the fellow will dream up some various odds and ends and all of sudden youll get some that register on the meter well its very interesting but its almost unreachable almost unreachable you tried for week i could reach these things but i reached them as dianetic auditor get the meter repeater technique take the various words take the whole list take all the bouncers denyers call backs and so forth out of the entire list that they had already given you very interesting this is quite technique fortunately i dont think you have to learn it but its quite technique you ask them to list all of the things he would use to modify his goal if he continued to fail he keeps giving you phrases and phrases and phrases and phrases you finally got pages of phrases now then you just go through those and one or two of you had red marks on the list i gave you red checkmarks on the list and told you run these by repeater technique on the person see because theyre in there someplace he gave you someplace the modifier but every time he gave you one of these bouncers or denyers or something like that if it was even close to the modifier he bounced out of the vicinity of the goal and the goal read sporadically just that he bounced on the track he moved in relationship to the thing and you had to repeat him back into it and if you were to directly find modifier you would have to master these old dianetic techniques of getting actually the flash answer to the question and you get the bouncers and make down lists of these things get the list off the pc bounce these things back in finally sort the thing out and it actually was already taking you hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to do this why well youre doing it uphill and if you did it badly you would invalidate the pcs goal and then of course the whole thing would go up in smoke all right so i sought better method of doing this and ran into the rest of the picket fence there it was you see the goal and the modifier are the pcs half of the idea whats the other half of the idea and who had it now we had to have to have two halves to make problem and the goal plus modifier is only one half now that must be confronted by something of equal magnitude from an otherdeterminism to be complete whole otherwise it wouldnt hang on the track youve got to have two forces in balance one against the other before you get something moving in time in the mind thats one of the basic rules of it as you learn problems you see more and more problems youll find out that his problem is to have happy home its not goal now its just problem problem to have happy home and why cant he have happy home well there must be some other idea confronting it now the pc may give you that idea himself and it may be apparently resident with the pc but as we chase it back to try to find out where this problem is he had somebody who was determined not to have happy home lets be as elementary as possible on this thing this fellow had an idea that he ought to have happy home not goal to have one just had the idea he ought to have one and he had this opposed idea of somebody shouldnt have one shouldnt have one we should have dogs breakfast on dogs breakfast street theres two ideas isnt it all right now that is an anatomy of problem see youve got one idea and the other fellows got another idea and the two ideas combined run headon into each other in balance and if they do that theyll then drift through time now there must have been confusion before that when you get the confusion out from underneath this you will find then that theres something else occurs that one or the other of these ideas unbalances and this thing sort of misses each other if you can get the idea of two sticks pushed against each other theyll stay pushed against each other until you get below them and tap them with your thumbnail or something like that and one stick will miss and then these two things wont lock up anymore and you dont have this same structure anymore well it takes these two sticks one punched against the other to get problem riding through time that is why the problem rides through time its two ideas its an unresolvable situation of two ideas now problem has this additional thing the person says i want to be successful wife and at the same time has the other idea i want to go to lots of nightclubs and parties with other men and youll find this in pcs all the time and theyll come up with it and thats what makes problems so weird they come up with this idea well its unsolvable you see its unsolvable my problem is unsolvable you see and you get to drumming it up and you finally find out that it gets stated on this basis that they want to be wife and do that sort of thing and why cant george you see accept as successful wife and all that sort of thing you know and then you get to searching for it they say well they also ought to be going out to nightclubs all the time with other men and this is in the same pc you see and theyve accepted one of these as their idea and then they accepted the other one as their idea but originally these were two ideas counteropposed if you start plumbing up this problem on problems intensive youll find out that there was somebody else around if you wanted to go this far insisting they go to nightclubs with other men while they were trying to be successful wife then these two ideas lock up and they own both of them simultaneously and you get quote unresolvable problem one of those ideas was the pcs and then one of them was later valence the situation then is you get lockup in time and it appears to be what how you miss it you see it appears to be simply the individual himself with two ideas see isnt that what it looks like hes got two ideas now if you separate these two ideas apart youll find one of these ideas belongs to the pc and the other idea belonged to somebody else but actually how did the pc own this first idea its usually through valence mechanism and the valence mechanism is simple mechanism he adopts the valence and the valence has the idea now the valence confronts another being and that being has different idea and then the pc gets this valence locked on the first valence and theyre actually in apparent double valence situation its like concentric walnut shells one right after the other youve got walnut and then youve got shell outside the walnut now if you can think of the thing of having shell outside the walnut shell and then shell outside that walnut shell and then shell outside that you ever peel an onion well that is actually the way pcs bank or beingness looks that is the way it looks and thats why you cry when you when you now frankly if we were to take this apart in an ordinary and routine fashion it would be sort of like this your ordinary take apart would simply to be to peel the onion skin by skin and boy if you havent got gas mask you cant do it but it does take long long time and it is very tough on the pc and he gets gains and he gets loses and lets say he had valence as woman and that the outer skin to the valence of the woman was the valence of man and you process off the valence of man and now your pcs acting like woman you peel off the next valence the pcs acting like child you peel off the next valence the pcs acting like dog what is this all about dont you see well there are literally literally well its some unimaginable figure its some astronomictype mathematics would it take to get the figure of how many valences are accumulated by the pc in actuality and its probably something on the order of oh i dont know binary digits of some kind or another its way way way up there they accumulate as many as half hundred in one lifetime and times being tougher in some areas than the others you say well the pc lives lets be very conservative lets say he lived two lifetimes century and half hundred for each lifetime is hundred and thats one per year and thats for calm ordinary existence you see and now we go back two hundred trillion years and wed have two hundred trillion valences of course thats crude way of arriving at it but that gives you some idea of the magnitude im just trying to tell you its big magnitude you ever run into anybody that just after they talked to you they had your mannerisms well theyve just accumulated another valence now it isnt every time they have talked to somebody because they talk to you once from there on out they dont just have your valence they get new valence from you everytime they talk to you now have you sneaked up on what the order of magnitude is see well its big all right now what were doing is absolutely magical its fantastic and your appreciation of its fantasticity will rise when you realize that we are removing whole onions whole onions its whats holding the onion together thats what were after were not interested in peeling this thing endlessly crying over the dishpan see as tip to housewives you peel onions underwater you cry less you fill bowl full of water and peel them underwater but your hands dont smell any better anyhow but i know of such ready solution if it was just forever situation forever valences what would you finally wind up with you see youd wind up with forever auditing so lighter techniques tend to do forever job now we were accidentally taking this thing apart when we get the engram necessary to resolve the case we would probably pluck one of these valences when we were being successful the engram ran easily and we didnt go back earlier than it or anything and we didnt have to do anything funny about it weve accidentally arrived in it its quite interesting that lot of people who have been running dianetics go down the track on these new routines and they find the holes in the track that theyve already erased by dianetic procedures theyve contacted that old engram before or they hardly even noticed that its been contacted it makes their case much easier to run because theyve already had it desensitized you get out here some member of the public and youll get back to the age of fifteen see well person whos had lot of auditing of course goes back earlier much faster youd be surprised how explosive this can be now routine 3d isnt designed for your case it is not designed for your case your case does not require this much you could undoubtedly with running the tiller on the thing one way or the other go clear on routine 3 with this modifier gimmick we would have gotten the modifier out you did it most of you are after modifiers in that one week you got the modifiers and you got those things brought out well that was just speeding it up little bit but you could have gone clear eventually on earlier routines but this isnt true of the general public the reason why youre having difficulty auditing the general public is this is so beefed up its so highly charged this is case that has never had any charge taken off of any kind whatsoever they dont even know that they remember and have an engram connected with their puppys death at the age of five see they dont realize thats got big secondary you see these cases are highly charged up cases well now lets get back to what we were talking about about these modifiers without relieving any more than just the casual runofthemill problems of his life that you would run into and relieve with problems intensive thats quite vital that will keep the fellow insession without doing any more than that youre actually going to launch this fellow onto the whole track and now youre going to pick up modifier and youre going to pick up the various parts you need you see just like the modifier out of thin air and youre going to have hell of time thats all youre going to hold him insession by strapping him down in the chair and you cant do that to the general public and we had to have another method so i could see that it wouldnt be too difficult for us to go ahead and teach this method and find it on scientologists but i could foresee that there was great would be great difficulty in your trying to find this thing on casual public people who hadnt been audited very much why the modifier will be in there with sledgehammers youre not going to get near it the more charged up the case is the less secondaries theyve had off the less this and the less that well the harder such thing is to reach now i anticipated as far as i could into the difficult case all right but at the same time i did say that you were having difficulty and there was particular reason for you to master relatively difficult sporadic artistic technique like blowing phrases out of bank that is quite technique you know and trying to hold somebody still while you do it is quite arduous and too arduous for it to be used much on the public i saw from time to time one of these things being blown in old dianetic processing i remember this airline pilot who came in sent by american airlines i think it was to the 42 aberdeen road elizabeth new jersey and the airline company wanted to know what was this dianetics sent this guy over and we tried to find out something about him and actually one of the students at that time with the idea of phrases and the key phrase on which the fellows life was pinned we already had that idea you see blowing it just like that with repeater technique and without meter pretty good huh student took him upstairs and he found the guys line phrase everything else what was the trouble with the guy he had failed every time he had had job out in civil life you know soon as he got in aviation why he was more or less all right and thats because of continuous phrase his mother used to feed him all the time and it could only have been effective if it had been the modifier he had part of modifier and thats what we took off the case he was earthly good so he could be an airline pilot but he couldnt run garage and this absolutely made the fellow feel marvelous they just repeatertechniqued the thing into view and out of existence and that was it that was it that changed his whole life another one child dying of leukemia and we shot phrase out of the bank make your blood turn to water whats leukemia the blood turns to water shooting phrases out of case can produce considerable change in the case but its not uniform it is not something that you sit down with any confidence and do because you may do it today and you may do it in two weeks and in two weeks why you may have the case so steamed up that you can get nowhere near anything you know you get the idea i mean its rough go you pays your money and you takes your chance its that kind of thing well we dont want anything to do with that type of technique if we can possibly manage it lets get something which is ascertainable and which runs smoothly so the answer to getting the modifier was to take the pressure off the other side of the problem now some of you right this minute have been sitting there while assessing as pc and have all of sudden felt sort of weight lift off of you particularly on an opposition terminal or an opposition goal and suddenly the auditor reads two three four in row or something like this and you all of sudden you feel light you feel strangely different somehow something odd has happened to you and actually they havent even found anything you know theyre just assessing the list and all of sudden why you feel something passing off somewhere or another have any of you felt that all right as an auditor in auditing somebody you dont pay too much attention to tone arm during an assessment but you might have noticed sudden craboom of tone arm on pc during reading well now that is simply the person is losing some weight what you watch there is few billion valences going theyre just piling right on off the top of the modifier you know they go pfffft youre actually not really running anything out on the reverse side what youre doing is just taking tension off the pcs side you see the opposition goal the opposition terminal the opposition terminal comes first of course and this opposition terminal oh is that what ive been fighting see and this recognition oh yes is that what hes been fighting you see this recognition of this and its ideas is and he doesnt even have to come close to that one just that hes in the vicinity of it starts doing things see similarly with the terminal i mean just that hes in the vicinity of what hes been opposing he feels like somebodys been playing at swords blindfolded in dark cellar with an ethiopian for an opponent you know then here he is all of sudden some of this stuff starts coming to view and it lightens up the reverse side over here lightens up you see his idea therefore doesnt have to be so tightly fixed in because its not opposed by so much charge you got the idea now lets get back to this stick theres five footpounds of energy pushing from right to left and five footpounds of energy pushing footpounds pushing from left to right at the impact point you get continuous balance because its five footpounds and five footpounds see there it hangs now youve got to have at least five footpounds or something like that of energy to disturb this thing you could probably disturb it with some other footpoundage from some other quarter but itll be some order of magnitude of five footpounds in other words youve got to come over here and youve got to push with an additional poundage or over here and push with an additional poundage well thats all right because youre still its not going to unbalance its just going to kind of wobble as you put it in on both sides if you can get the idea got it and if you push it down this way well it might take just fraction of an ounce to deflect it down slightly thats why you see perhaps that compares to your prior confusion you find prior confusion to problem and nothing much came off but the problem disappears its quite mysterious maybe it even follows the laws of mechanics who knows but anyhow here are these two five footpound forces now your auditing would have to be five footpounds something in the order of five footpounds in other words to move this thing to left or right or do something about it you got the order of magnitude here its very hard to put this into mechanical terms im just trying to give you some kind of an idea all right supposing we had some method you see not of increasing the force from the left to the right or the force from the right to the left see not of increasing this supposing we had the idea of simply out of thin air deleting some of the five footpounds and lets have five footpounds pushing in from left to right and lets reduce this right to left force to three footpounds well somethings going to start going see now weve got an unbalanced situation do you see how you could do that now you can unbalance this hung in time rather easily by the deletion of force all other systems even though they were millionth of an ounce would be the addition of force you would add force well if youre auditing added force or had to add force lets look at this order of magnitude the balance in this fellows mind might measure well on an emeter but its original force might have been space ship colliding with planet i mean of that magnitude which is eight billion footpounds versus eight billion footpounds at the point of impact now that means your auditing would have to be of the order of magnitude of eight billion footpounds and do you feel that energetic now if you can take the impact apart it will simply be on the basis of reducing it down to five billion footpounds on one side of it see now oh well lets reduce it down now to three billion footpounds on one side only oh well now lets reduce it down to hundred footpounds on one side only something is going to blow up someplace isnt it you still couldnt possibly have trapped eight billion footpounds versus one hundred footpounds see what would happen everything would just go boom boom zoom lot of energy would be released in various directions but you have not then had to get in there and push harder against this thing one way or the other to unsettle it i can give you mechanical as i just have understanding of the thing it comes close to that type of thing its study in forces its really study in forces because thetans ideas add up to energy which adds up to force you ever been in glare fight and did you ever have the idea that you might possibly push over that wall if you looked at it too hard have you ever had this idea or that you might pull it in on you or something like this have you ever had the idea that you might move something with an idea well youre pretty careful not to because it can lead to lot of difficulty you think but in the mind the idea consists of the force see you dont have eight billion footpounds still residual in the mind it isnt actually that much force but its an idea equivalent to eight billion footpounds its the idea of eight billion footpounds and there still is some energy and there still is some force and there still is some thrust in the mind and the pc feels this shift he knows whats going to happen he knows whats going to happen everything is going to blow up huh did you ever suddenly accidentally move mass on pc pc almost goes that way did you ever do it did you ever have pc feel he was suddenly splitting in half and part of him flying off into space one of these goofball things it doesnt happen very often but an auditor gives an auditing command particularly with pc who is not prepared for it the pcs taken unawares hes little bit surprised its bad auditing if youve done it recognize it for what it was there was smooth approach to it its just after youve had an arc break it was just after you changed the process too rapidly it was just after something and you got this pc suddenly felt something go and boy did he object to it and after that hes just holding on just like this you know ahaaahaaahaa you know just scared stiff something was going to slip now you know and sometimes they feel the bank go billionth of an inch you know and they say uhuh thats it ive had it you know these guys that only one tech one technique will work on them but next time you audit them you have to have another technique did you run into that case its quite ordinary the black five case is very often this way boy if you were auditing him well on tuesday and you were just getting along fine on this get the idea of sort of process or whatever it was and you just didnt have enough hours in tuesday to make the session totally consecutive to it being flattened on wednesday he comes into session and he is not about to get any results from that process and further results are going to come from that process every process works once this is not an unusual case its usually the black five you dont notice it because the processes youre running are repetitive in spite of what hes trying to do he cant stop them but if he had his way he would because he gets little change and the change itself makes him nervous so hes got the brakes on that process now youve got to run another process and youve got to run that and that will only run as long as he doesnt put the brakes on so very light processes run on cases of that type give you this aspect if you have to have process session next session youve got to have new process next session youve got to have new process next session youve got to youve run into them i see people from central orgs nodding yes theyve seen lot of these guys it drives d of p crazy theyre just running wonderfully on tuesday we were getting the idea of winning you know get the idea of winning fine get the idea of losing fine those were wonderful theres nothing wrong with this it was just gorgeous but wednesday he comes back in absolutely nothing happens on the same exact process and on tuesday it wasnt flat well this case is so much in balance its the high tone arm case the case is so much in balance that if he feels anything start to shift his idea of the amount of mass that is going to shift and the things that are going to happen are so catastrophic you see that he just goes oo oo oo hohoho oh now what makes him do that thats because its his ideas versus the other determined ideas of his life ah well the idea hes directly opposing is the first idea that you will find and you find that idea with his goal youll find that idea and youll find the first idea hes opposing you find the goal and then you can find the goal opposition terminal the opposition terminal to his goal and then you can find the opposition idea to his goal and all of sudden that stands there all revealed you got what this is you know who or what it was and what its ideas were you know that now all right you had just gotten rid of all but the last hundred pounds of force on the opposition side and it cant stay stable anymore actually itll never be stable again that particular problem it cant be hung up in time that way ever again because youve taken the thing out on the thing he would pay the least attention to going away he doesnt care what you do to the other side hes agin them hed kill them man most of these opposition terminals you run into the pc sits there and he isnt saying very much about it but if you got him to chattering about what should really happen or what he might possibly have done at one time or another to such people hes liable to demonstrate slight amount of misemotion have you noticed that you know in other words he doesnt like that terminal over there so what you do to the terminal is all right with him now what you do to him isnt all right with him if hes in terrific games condition as your people off the street your raw meat cases would be in terrific games conditions you know theyre splintered down to about onesixteenth of an inverted dynamic see and the rest of it is totally them and somewhere down the line you know give panhandler sixpence sometime and if you had him on the meter at that moment of what he thought of you the amount of gratitude which he actually displayed and so forth youd be quite shocked hes down to that is against all of them haha uhhh so if you want to put him in jail hes going to object or if youre going to take anything away from him hes going to object or if youre actually going to do anything with him hes going to object if you just asked him to move over to the side of the sidewalk for moment hes going to object thats all there is to it ahhhhh but wouldnt he take great deal of joy as just as he is standing there arguing with the cop why you came along and distracted the attention of the cop and gave the cop bad time you can just see that panhandler you know sort of dust himself off and haaaa haaaa serves him right you know in fact you could do almost anything to the cop and the panhandler would applaud you now the police might not but the panhandler will do you see so pc will sit there and let you gun down his worst enemy with the greatest of pleasure and be very pleased with you as an auditor and i dont know if youve noticed how pleased the pc is when youre finding opposition goals and terminals theyre sometimes very sour but its at the terminal not at the auditor so much they feel upset but thats their areas of least blame of the auditor you start finding opposition terminals you wont get many arc breaks from pc you can do anything you want to to that goal and terminal over there hahahahahhh of course to this panhandler the total goal the total goal for every terminal would be to do in see itd be some version of that see to do in you know heres people painting buildings and they dont even look at him you know theyd never even seen him he could stand in front of them and they hardly notice him and theyre busy slopping paint on the building and so forth but he knows what their goal is to do him in you see the pc is backed up against the wall hes not panhandler but hes backed up against the wall as far as the rest of this particular area or session is concerned you could go over list here and you could go over an opposition goal or an opposition terminal list now heres an opposition list policeman father meter teacher tutor governess got the idea you could go over this opposition list and you could say to this pc now would it make any difference to you if i shot policeman thatd be pretty good you know and you go down the rest of the way and this is what you would get you see theyd applaud on this its perfectly fine with them and of course their ideas are braced into this structure of hostility now you actually arent tricking the pc the pc actually can recognize exactly what youre doing and its perfectly all right because what youre doing is unbalancing the resistance toward his own goal and survival line as he sees them and youre unbalancing the resistance so hes winning see what is battle but the person who is winning is winning you see and the object of the battle is to win of course you get pc and not to win as part of his goal he might be little bit upset with you if you set him in the direction of winning but the odd part of it is the technology even overcomes that thats just another piece of the parts all right so as the individual goes along as the individual goes along through routine 3d you have your best opportunity of finding what the pc has by finding out the things about the opposition now you can always lighten up the opposition without any resistance from the pc thats dead easy and also you can always find the pc thinks the opposition pressure is taken off you get the rationale and youll find out itll work just exactly on that one two three four from now on providing you dont go squareheaded on and start doing your assessments upside down by turning the pages randomly at the last book of job or something you see itll go on just just just happening easily because what you do is take the weight off the pc at the point where he couldnt care less what you do to that particular zone all right now ill show you reverse way to do this this is not the way to do this this is exactly reverse wrong way to do this we assess person very carefully to find out exactly what theyre fondest of in life and we make list of of whom was you fond mack because we couldnt call it auditing so we wouldnt follow model session to do this sort of thing all right and he says my grandmother my youngest daughter my old dog and my car you assess this very very carefully and we find out that youngest daughter wins on the assessment now you say now were going to erase all the memories connected with your youngest daughter well do you think youd stick to this pc in the session very long if you did this all right the pc sees his goal is good thing and he sees his game as good thing this is whats idiotic about it all that its been getting him into trouble now for the last hundred trillenia is totally overlooked by him so this would be the wrong way to clear somebody on routine 3 type process lets get the goal lets get the goal all right now lets erase it look isnt that what hes objecting to isnt that what he sits there in an assessment and objects to that youre invalidating him youre invalidating his goals that youre doing this that youre doing that well the rudiments wouldnt go out if you werent so when i say faster clearing there are many other reasons here but this one should not be overlooked haha you get this goal and then you get his terminal and then you run it on the prehav scale to erase it oh yeah dont you think youre going to have little trouble in session and you do you do you get so many hours deep into clearing and all of sudden the pc kind of decides he doesnt want to be clear and he doesnt want to do this and he doesnt want to do that and of course the enemy is still on his front doorstep and he knows hes feeling better but he just doesnt want to go on with this well now what was this brake why did he put on the brakes thats because you were attacking an ally to the exclusion of the enemy now he wouldnt mind you getting rid of the ally providing the enemy was cared for you see the rationale bunch of farmers are standing out there with pitchforks and scythes and blunderbusses and theyre stretched across the road and bunch of regular cavalry come up and say whats the matter boys and these fellows say well its the skirmish line on that other army and its been getting real close to our homes and there have been bunch of looters and things around here and we just mean to shoot every one of those characters that we can and the troopers always make this mistake they say well disperse and lay down your arms and go home this is how you get revolutions started bunch of guys are protecting their homes in some fashion you tell them to lay down their arms and so forth you say well well take care of it in some indifferent fashion you know and well lay down your arms and so forth thats not the way to do it at all if you want them actually to go home the best thing to do is go out and find looter and hang him and then they lay down their arms and go home got the idea they do that with the greatest of ease then theres nothing to that you see that as procedure they know youre going to do something active and they know whats wrong with them they know exactly whats wrong with them its the enemy well isnt that what they think its the enemy thats whats wrong with them they know whats wrong with them of course this isnt whats wrong with them at all its their own knuckleheaded insistence on having goal that they then hang modifier to that they then apply in some peculiar and particular direction and find themselves good enemy and then keep it mocked up thats actually what happened wasnt it but that isnt the way the pc looks at it and i think that there isnt pc in this room at this moment that cant look at this analytically and individually would be resistive toward the whole idea that couldnt possibly be it because look what theyve done to well of course you know nobody digs himself out of the hole unless you run off what hes done to them but pc wont look at this as long as theres an army standing out there that is going to fill him full of bullet holes the second he takes his finger off his number so hes going to stay fully armed with all of his tricks hes going to remain very dangerous person hes going to remain as fully dangerous as he possibly can because the whole enemy is there in full panoply now by assessment you have actually seen person go little bit clearer here some of you on the opposition terminal and opposition goal you know they went zzuhuhuh off you know little lighter because i see in your reports report after report i dont know youre not picking this up from each other because its just the natural description of the phenomena that report after report ive read the pc felt lighter at the end of session youve probably written it yourself on an auditing report pc felt lighter at the end of session pc felt less heavy pc felt as if he was winning well he was thats the first and foremost reason why he felt that way but the mechanical reason he felt that way is in toward him facing in toward him were these eight billion footpounds of thrust and youve reduced them down to only billion see and with just the assessment and he sees then because you reduced them to billion that they might reduce further than that and he now doesnt have to stand there fully armed braced and barebreasted against life you see of course you take away ive said barebreasted but hes fully armed and shielded against life and he doesnt really want you to come along and take away his shield and he doesnt want you to take away the rest of his equipment because he knows what its facing he knows its dangerous not to have those things and of course that is the only reason he interrupts clearing the fellow is standing there hes got lamppost in his right hand hes got his pockets filled full of tomato gravy he has his left ear torn in three pieces and hes got lumbago and you say to him well now lets straighten up here you dont have to have your ear torn in three pieces and you might at least empty your pockets out very messy you know he doesnt pay bit of attention to you he knows thats what he needs he knows that these are the exact items necessary to defend himself in life he knows those are the items those are the only things that make him dangerous why does he want to be dangerous the enemy of course and you see youre stupid you never realized this but youre stupid you dont know theyre there he doesnt either but yeah that is the way the mind hangs together and thats why youre taking it apart this exact way with routine 3d you say opposition terminal well thats good and solid and he can put his attention on it in hurry and the reason you get the terminal before the goal is of course he can put his attention on something solid and then you can materialize the goal out of that solid and thats easier to do than put his attention from an idea his own goal onto an idea see thats little bit harder to do so the easy way to do it is to find the opposition terminal then he knows who or what hes fighting oh thats great now lets find out what their idea really is from the pcs viewpoint of course it actually isnt that persons idea at all the person lived with bessie bell for eighteen years man and boy and you start running him and you find bessie bell is the enemy and wife of the enemy or something like this or woman is the enemy and you shake this all down and youd be amazed but so would bessie bell to find out that her total goal in life this would not agree if you were processing bessie bell you couldnt use this goal but her total goal from this fellows viewpoint and so forth her total goal actually is to make great deal of noise while setting the table and doing dishes and thats her total goal in life you dont realize that she doesnt realize that nobody knows that but the pc now you just try and run bessie bell if you had her as pc on to make noise with dishes you know it wont assess now from her viewpoint your pcs goal which is to be great building builder or something like that well from her viewpoint why his is to track mud all over the floors and to eat biscuits in bed and thats his total goal well dont try to run it on him because it wont assess well these are just the offbeats of existence theres lecture about this already it is the first congress i ever gave personally in london the first lecture its your ideas of the other fellow thats the basis of aberration is the aberrated idea of what the other fellow is up to and its as simple as that but this routine 3d plucks off the footpoundage of the opposition and therefore the pc can reach little further the pc is little freer to look so then the pc is willing to look up and find out what he might do if he failed oh hes gotten unfixation now to do this so youve unfixed him to point where you can find his modifier which is perhaps to run away and commit suicide in case i ever run into scientologist you know hes had it on the whole track for hundred thousand years but anyway hes got modifier and hell give up his modifier and then you can find it and now only now can you find the pcs goal and terminal and be absolutely certain that you get it right on the bat because its got to be the terminal for the goal plus modifier and the reasons you used to get such tremendous terminals lists you know those things ive seen them run to thousand and more terminals and so on its just because you go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on because of course you werent asking for terminal plus modifier and you were finding by accident the terminal plus modifier that is it would finally fall out but lord at the end of how much processing how much assessment it was very difficult now we go on to the other thing pcs goal terminal and we get the prehav level for this particular thing and now we actually in 3d and to be very honest with you at this stage of its development we are in the zone at this point of test this other up to step 5 is solid as the rock of gibraltar but im still as i told you before experimenting with the commands on this sort of thing i want to see exactly where this thing whizzes in beings and youre not up to running any commands yet and you wont be for another couple of days so ive got little chance there to do the side research to make it faster when you get to it we could run just what we have been running and win on it ive already had that checked and itll be perfectly all right i just want to see if we cant really get whizzer really get whizzer going on this one now i already have found out that this process alone running the ordinary terminal and so forth will run levels out so fast that you can longer run the twenty minute rule thats quite interesting your twenty minute rule of running is still under inspection by it is apparently out and well go back to the joburg rules of running which were the original rules and we actually are looking them up i will issue bulletin on them but they were running to stuck you run it to stick you actually let the thing stick there it is its stuck and then assess again because youre not going to run it for days i can trust you not to do that and the reason we left it still wobbling was so as not to make an error but youll find that in running this even on the old way we used to run routine 3 terminals that it sticks quite promptly and goes downscale quite promptly and you might even find yourself doing two levels session thats right and you run it to stuck and when youre absolutely sure that it is stuck and its not going to move i dont know what the time limit was thats the only thing that is out and we have to look it up but its id say it offhand itd probably be about oh if its stuck for about five six ten minutes or something of that sort i think id come off of it but id stick it id stick the tone arm not the needle id stick the tone arm and let it go into there chunk and id make sure it was sticking there because the routine behavior on this sort of thing is kind of pattern for the pc and you can tell when its going to stick and you can tell when its stuck and its skill which youll pick up rather rapidly and after youve seen it two or three times youll say well thats that theres nothing much to it all right well im trying to speed up even that but the data i can give you on that right now is that you run it to stuck youll still be all right because you can still reassess in the first place youve taken enormous weight off the case well how have you taken the weight off the case well youve paid some attention to the opposition havent you and you paid some opposition ideas some attention and we got lot of things asised here that were still tough on the case before all of sudden as we run these these get easier and easier and vanish and get all floppy and theyre out the bulk of time of 3d is probably devoted to assessment not to running thats probably the less time on running on it i dont know we cant say that broadly yet but thats just my preinformation on the thing as i look at it yea i see it certainly does evaporate in hurry ive already seen two levels flattened in one and onehalf hours of auditing thats fairly fast isnt it and you run them to stuck and they all seem to run on the same old joburg pattern that they were running on originally which is the tone arm goes up and sticks runs all right for moment little while and then it goes up and sticks and then it sticks and then youve got to reassess anyway looking at this little bit further there are ways of course to use these other parts and thats all im working with on the commands right here at this moment having little spare time im just looking to see if there isnt some way we can weave these parts in in perfectly optimum pattern that will get faster run on them see ive already got them woven in but lets get it faster than that and that ought to be whizzer so were in the throes of running one which we have solved and improving it before you get to the running of it pretty good now when we have this being run on half discharged and dismissed goals my pity my sympathy is with you youve already run these goals halfway down they are not reacting right nothing is reacting right this is all being fairly rapid at this time youre going to save time in the long run but nothing is reacting exactly right goals are going in and goals are going out and sporadically this way and over the tin cup that way and so forth and youll get to the end of your assessment on many eases and you wont have any goal and you wont have any modifier and you wont have any opposition terminal you wont have nothing youll just have handful of air well the only thing that makes it random is youre assessing against halfrun goals now theres not enough time for you to have flattened that and then run them so im just throwing that problem into your lap and you might as well get used to having trouble with assessment you just might as well get used to living with it because what is the trouble the main trouble with assessment is the rudiments go out and the rudiments go in and so forth but about halfway through clearing which is not too many hours deep in case now youre going to run into this trouble anyhow youll think that after you get the persons terminal and goal all patched up and theyre squared away and so forth and you finally got it all discharged and all you get onto the second one now youre on solid ground well youre on uniform ground quicksand and that is just simply on this basis that you find the persons goal and the goal goes crash and goes half dial rock slam and oh marvelous and youll find the opposition terminal and half dial rock slam oh marvelous and youll find the opposition goal and its quarter dial rock slam and you go back and check the goal and thats half dial and then you go back and check this and you say well ill go on and finish this anyway and an eighth of dial rock slam is the opposition goal well you go back and find the modifier now and youll find half dial rock slam marvelous half dial rock slam and oh thats good well we thought the whole thing was disappearing you know and its easy now that weve got the half dial rock slam and so forth all right now lets get the goal plus modifier and lets find the pcs terminal and weve put the goal plus the modifier together and weve got an eighth of dial rock slam well this is not so good well lets go back and check it against the goal and the other parts and we find out theyre all eighth of dial oh well lets go on and do the goals terminal assessment anyway and we go ahead and we do goals terminal assessment and were just about halfway through the list and everything is going fine and things are nulling and things are nulling and things are nulling and we jus looks looks marvelous and we go on down to the bottom of the list and go back through the list again we go back through the list again and then we just go list and you say well the rudiments are out so you go back and put the rudiments in but theyre in and you go back and look at the list and then you go back and check the goal and then you check the modifier and its gone theres nothing theres nothing place nowhere youve lost it all its evaporated you get your rudiments in you check everything you check everything across the boards and you make all possible crosschecks across the board but that goals terminal you never even got to the prehav scale so you say well better luck next time we go back and we find one and by george we find nice beefy goal there its quarter of dial rock slam and everything is going along fine and we assess it right on down everything is working out perfectly right up to the moment we find the opposition terminal that whole list goes null the whole list we go back and we say weve got to check the goal its not there but it is there but its not it isnt there it is i the huh hmm now the reason i am telling you this is because you could make the most serious mistake of your career to drop it at that point because the opposition goal is in the modifier is in the goal plus terminal is in and they will all do quarter of dial rock slam the instant you find them and longer so we get something you will have to learn how to do in 3d youll have to assess on everything going out and this is marvelous time for you to learn how right now because these things that youre running are practically run out or half run out and theyre washing so right at the beginning we get the opportunity of learning the hard way because the hard the end of this thing can get very rough on you now you only want an equal needle reaction to each part of 3d see to the goal the opposition terminal the opposition goal and the modifier goals plus terminal and the goalplusmodifier terminal you only want equal actions across those and the prehav scale at any given moment and if while you were assessing the action is getting less youll find its also getting less on the other parts now for instance youll find that if the goal if you we can find the modifier but it keeps going in and out im talking about an advanced run now this is all data on advance runs this person has already been entered into clearing and so on and the things going in and out it reads every third time you say it do you know the goal will now read every third time you say it see the goal was checked out perfectly at first now it reads every third time you say it every part you have will read every third time you say it you get the idea see thats how faintly this can be read theyre all going to act the same and youre going to get fooled on that because youre going to get so doggone nailed down to the opposition goal for instance and you finally going to find one youve got the whole list run down and theres only one and its acting and its reacting and its acting and its reacting and its acting and its reacting you say well weve got to do something else its acting and its react now check that goal man lets go back and check the goal is it acting and reacting and not acting and acting and not acting and acting and not acting too like that other one is because that would tend to prove it out theres another crosscheck you see is what you found now acting like the goal acts because the goal action can change every time you find one of these parts the goal can act little bit less the point of reference let put it this way against which youre verifying is itself deintensifying so of course that goal is the point of reference and as it deintensifies so do all other reactions tend to deintensify but where the goal is in strong and the thing you have just got down to and selected as the final part of your list is going in and going out and going in and going out and you test the goal you say to build great buildings and it goes pow and you say to build great buildings pow to build great buildings pow and you say this opposition goal see to eat up timbers see you say to eat up timbers it goes wiggle to eat up timbers none to eat up timbers half dial drop to eat up timbers none and you say to build great buildings pow to build great buildings pow you got the idea huh build great buildings is still in and still constant and still of the same magnitude well youve just got the wrong item thats all simple as that youve just got the wrong item or the rudiments are completely crazy on the subject of this particular item where theres been an invalidation of this item or theres something wrong with this item and this list that you are doing not with anything else you havent bled it down to the point where youve got every single possible goal that the pc would have for that you just havent got complete list youve done poor job technically thats all see now differentiate between doing poor job technically in other words not doing this one two three of get the rudiments in bleed the meter down sensitivity 16 set your meter back to dial drop and then assess you see get your rudiments in check you know that kind of thing that will hold and it will hold straight through well youve done something there wrong the rudiments arent in or you havent gotten the whole list or somethings off see if the person didnt invalidate on the list the rudiments would be out and so forth and theres something technically wrong now youve got to differentiate between technical error and fading goal and dont you ever dare cross the two because you see itd be very pleasant to be able to say every time you made technical error that there was now something wrong with the assessment see thatd let everybody out from under except the pc i dont say any of youll do this but i do point it out i do point it out quite strongly that that is the way it is youre assessing against vanishing standard the standard is vanishing in other words this pinpoint on which youre referring everything youre measuring room and youve driven nail in the middle of the room and youve got tape and you take this tape and you measure the distance to every corner of the room and to the ceiling and the floor and the lightbulbs and the fireplace and so forth and youve got all these distances and theyre all relative to that pin in the middle of the room and being relative to that pin everything is fine as long as nobody moves the pin yeah its okay i mean you can always know where to put this room back together again as long as youve got that pin all right and you come back and you look at it now whole room depends on this pin see all your measurements and you come back and you look at it and you find out its half its size makes you little bit nervous doesnt it well actually its fine the case is going clear but you come back again you take look at this pin its quarter of the size and you come back and take look at it again and its appearing and then disappearing and appearing and then disappearing rrrrrrr and then you come back and take look at it and its just kind of little mark that occasionally is there but usually isnt and thats what youve got as reference point to measure the rest of the room by all right now this would be very difficult if only the pin moved actually because the pin is standard everything moves with the pin the distances go in and out just as the pin goes in and out you see so if that nail gets half the size then for instance your goal modifier when its finally checked although the first time you hit it you get bang out of it itll settle down suddenly and the pins gone half its size the goal modifier is now half the size that it would have been got the idea everything goes down in exact proportions which is lucky for you its just lucky that it does that see its all part of the same charge and as it discharges the whole charge reads the same and these are all parts of the same charge so of course as the pin goes down all the other things go down too and when it finally blows up it only blows up if youve got all parts of it now this sets up considerable technical problem for you and you think i may be stressing this little bit hard but youll encounter this problem often enough the problem on assessment is how do you continue the list its this idiotic problem youve got goals assessment see now thats fine you can make goals assessment entirely independent of everything else and wind up with goal see because thats the center pin from which youre measuring everything by why that goals assessment thats just dandy you can get goal and there it is and everybodys happy with this as goal all right fine now we do an opposition assessment haha thats fine good we can do an opposition assessment and its all right and we finally get there and we get the opposition terminal and thats fine and we put the opposition terminal down all right but notice something here that in order to get an opposition goal you must have had the opposition terminal oh you need the part in 2 in order to do 3 hoho and look look here you need the parts in 2 and 3 in order to do 4 and find the modifier and look youve got to have the parts of 1 and 4 in order to do number 5 and if you havent got those parts you cant do the next step can you now listen to carefully wake up and listen to carefully now because you never dare leave 3d incomplete on any assessment now remember that never leave 3d incomplete from parts 1 to 5 you may never get to 6 and thats all right but never let it be incomplete from 1 to 5 never always complete that assessment well how are you going to complete an assessment this is your main problem here how are you going to complete an assessment that disappears at item 3 everything folded up at item 3 you didnt even get the opposition goal you got close to the opposition goal and then suddenly even the rudiments were in and everything else the opposition goals the opposition assessment and the goal itself apparently blew it just went like chain of firecrackers brrrrrp bang well now you say oh well thats good thing now we dont have to do 4 and 5 well listen to carefully if you dont do 4 and 5 youre going to leave this pc with hidden aberration that nobody from here on is ever going to suspect and people will be saying you know clears act peculiarly yeah well this one is acting peculiarly hes still got 4 and 5 stuck and vanished and totally out of sight and thats because somebody didnt complete the whole 1 2 3 4 5 now how can you complete the whole 1 2 3 4 5 if 3 went because youve got to have 3 in order to get 4 you must have had 2 and 3 in order to get 4 right youve got to have these theyre going to stack up one way or the other well how you gonna get them well listen to this one carefully you just take the last item you had active and get the next one you were doing goals assessment and you do the last item active or the one on the list you can get to kick now and then which would of course eventually become the last item thats active because itd kick now and then before it disappeared see so therefore every time you read one of these things reading them three at time uniformly is now good weapon in your hands because if it wasnt null youre going to make mark you see and youre going down the line you see then you can tell how many times youve been over the list and therefore how many times that thing reacted even though the whole list suddenly blew up on you and wasnt there anymore and you couldnt find anything else on the list and you just find your hand full of air well you do have hahahahahaha you do have one item which reacted five times oh well thats very nice thats very fine we have an item that reacted five times now the only time when you ever turn an emeter up to sensitivity 16 to do an assessment you rapidly read them one time each this time carefully preserving them to keep them from going out read them in soft tone of voice go down the list one time each and note the greatest reaction and do your assessment at sensitivity 16 as long as you can and then if it all blows up and goes out the window you still have got an awfully good idea exactly what the item was well that was it it was firing there for moment now its gone use that and go to the next item and do you know that you can get whole assessment done on the next item even though the former item is gone because the next item will stay in long enough to do an assessment and now youll have to catch the next point on the fly you know as it goes overhead in order to get the next item up the line got the idea thats the only real cleverness that routine 3d takes of course it takes clever auditor to audit anyhow but this is tricky this is tricky its sort of catching the brass ring on the merrygoround youll find that that list however will stay alive until you get close to the actual one before it blows and things blow before it now the beauty of it is this as you get down toward the end anything nearly approaching accuracy will probably blow it anyway so as person goes toward clear the death is our penalty accuracy if we dont hit it right on the head its much less its much less liability try to get it try to get it accurately toward the end of an assessment and you get something now listen to get something to carry on to the next section hehheh please and roll it on down you know its this well now look ive said something and then you had cognition what was it you had cognition on i mean what did i say that you had cognition on and the pc thinks it over well its soandso and soandso haha good write that item down and carry it on to the next list got the idea i mean you could catch these things matter how faint they got but it can require some cleverness on your part now you could waste an enormous amount of time on half threequarters ninetenths rubbed out item and list and section and so forth driving yourself and the pc completely around the bend by just not taking what you do have left and of course by driving him around the bend youll arc break it or something of that sort so that it all does go out of existence and then its very difficult to get in and youve just complicated the whole thing so develop this little habit would you please in doing routine 3d as you pass on from down from the goal make peculiar mark somewhere on the list as the likely you dont tell the pc what it is just mark it down as the likely one if you get in the habit of doing this marking down the likely one before you prove it as you go later on the case and the case is clearing more rapidly you will have something left before it vanishes on you suddenly and you wont get caught adrift on the open sea on pocket handkerchief the likely one that isnt of course what youre going to force on the pc and if your assessment continues and you really do get the one and you notice how far out you are you will eventually develop facility for getting just about what it was you know right about there and of course as you go on down the list further the way its likely one is the person is giving you the listing and that sort of thing and hes given you the whole listing on down toward the end of the listing and you start to assess the thing youll develop some sort of thing as which one of these items sticks in your mind oh he says well to shoot turnips thats really stuck there thought about that for moment or two i did yes i thought about that for moment or two little tick opposite now go on and assess see and we find out that it was probably shoot turnips now you will learn to catch these things on the fly before they vanish in front of your face otherwise your main trouble in clearing is not going to be auditing itll suddenly become nightmare to you cases usually audit much more easily as they become clear you see than they did before theyre usually horrible to audit right at the opening gun you see and thats not true of routine 3d the case gets more and more horrible the further it goes you get into guesstimates of the situation and the accuracy with which you must perform guesstimate of the situation will be quite contest as far as youre concerned but always do all parts of routine 3d never miss always do them all go back over and sort of select it all out if everything has vanished your rudiments are in and theres nothing else you can do about it go over the last list that you did have somehow or another reconstruct the picture somehow or another get what it would have been and put it down on the next list in order to carry on because youll find that list is still alive now you can do complete assessment and be perfectly happy but remember on that one its going to happen faster than it happened on the one before youre going to get quicker blowout so on that one well its best idea to get likely the most likely as you go down the list which one stuck in your mind of all these which ones do you think would be the most probable of this sort of thing and as were reading it the first time and we suddenly notice as were reading down the first line boy it was an awful jolt there on we noticed that the goal jolt occurred for just an instant on number 16 now we read on down the list that list is never going to be live again we go back there it is now we got that one we carry that over to the next one then all of sudden the whole thing blows like string of firecrackers thats your biggest problem you see how to do it now of course you realize that i will scalp you i will scalp you if i find you suggesting that as the one to the pc thats just preventive action now im very glad with the work you are doing on this i want to compliment you actually on the work you are doing on this its pretty fine and it gives great heart in the matter your assessment is picking up its getting more accurate and so on youll be perfectly safe auditor on this when your assessments are always 100 percent accurate and youre totally cocky about the whole thing so thats the frame of mind i want you to assume now in actuality your accuracy will increase to the degree that your own case makes progress too you see so weve got that one also so were working on very fine front here theres nothing much wrong with that i do feel for you however some of you who have had goal and it flicks and you have parts to put down on anything youre trying desperately to proceed and so forth well i would frankly much rather have you suffer at saint hill than in bulawayo or keokuk there is reason to go on and dignify the name of bulawayo any longer it means the place where we all got killed i dont know if any of those from bulawayo know this but thats what it means and its because there was an old friend of the fellow down there named it anyhow we dont want everybody being killed down in bulawayo because somebody cant assess on 3d the progress youre making on this do you like the progress youre making on this audience yes do you see where youre going on this audience yes does it look like an easier trail to walk through than the woods you were in before audience yes all right as soon as you get the hang of it as soon as you see the put together of the thing and as soon as your own confidence in your ability to assess and keep rudiments in improves all of sudden itll look just like that itll look like nothing to you and youll say clearing smearing easy theres nothing to it bang bang so thats what i want you to work on positiveness of assessment speed of assessment selfconfidence in the assessments that you do and the accuracy of the final result and then you will find that the whole parts will string together and youll feel good about it in the meantime ill get you some hot commands whipped up on this one okay audience yes thank you
