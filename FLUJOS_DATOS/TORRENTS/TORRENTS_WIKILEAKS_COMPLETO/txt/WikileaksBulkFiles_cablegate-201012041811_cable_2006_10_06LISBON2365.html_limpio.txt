dvc with dos dod and embassy lisbon classified by pol chief troy fitrell reasons 14 bd 1 snf summary portugals foreign minister offered to resign if opposition forces can demonstrate any complicity on the part of the government regarding alleged illegal cia rendition flights through portuguese territory while government investigation has refuted these allegations the saga continues due to continued opposition party and european parliament pressure this pressure complicates the us request to repatriate guantanamo detainees via portugal end summary 2 u ongoing pressure from portugals left bloc and from the european parliament led to testy exchange in portugals parliament on october 18 in which foreign minister luis amado offered to resign if the opposition could prove government of portugal gop complicity with the usg regarding alleged illegal cia flights violating portuguese sovereignty 3 u amados most recent testimony reflected that of his predecessor diogo freitas do amaral in december 2005 ref and his own earlier testimony on september 5 this year noting the gop had completed an investigation that discovered information to support allegations that cia flights violated portugals territory or airspace to transport terrorism suspects amado told the parliamentary committee that none of the explanations or data collected constitutes credible indication that the law may have been broken on portuguese soil he went on to tell reporters that joint investigation by four government departments also involving the countrys intelligence agencies immigration service and flight control authorities conducted review of plane movements but found firm evidence amado admitted that the alleged cia flights might have come through portugal but added that portugal has nothing to be ashamed of according to the minister there is evidence that the cia committed illegal acts in portuguese territory and even stated that he has had nothing but total transparency and cooperation from american authorities 4 u freitas do amaral had offered the government investigation as way to address the allegations the results however have not silenced the gops critics especially in the left bloc or the european parliament portugals parliament has established an ad hoc committee to continue hearings on the subject and delegation from the european parliament is scheduled to visit portugal in december to interview amado who has declined to visit brussels to meet with euro deputies effect on repatriation request 5 snf amados testimony reflects the continued political and media pressure on the gop regarding this subject and makes the gops efforts to assist in repatriation of guantanamo detainees all the more difficult it is critical that washington readers recognize the gops need to ensure that it is on solid legal ground regarding our request on detainees 6 snf portuguese law as interpreted by the gop which could change requires written assurance by the final destination country that detainees will not be tortured or receive the death penalty as well as us guarantee that they will be treated according to internationallyrecognized conventions in the destination country without these assurances the gop will have difficulty n supporting repatriation flights through portuguese territory or airspace we eagerly await washington addressees response to the portuguese points as discussed ref c the gop will undoubtedly expect this issue to be discussed at the october 24 meeting between amado and secretary rice in washington the media 7 u the local press eagerly reprints hearsay on this tantalizing subject as left wing politicians unveil new facts every few days to fan the political fires post believes the media will continue to sensationalize the issue as long as it has legs comment 8 snf the normally unflappable amado lost his cool during the testimony an event that is completely out of character and shows the effects of unrelenting media and political attacks despite this outburst we believe amado will continue to reiterate what the investigation has revealed the government has evidence of illegal cia flights onthrough portuguese territory however post underscores the delicate balancing act amado is confronting in minimizing damage to his government however unwarranted due to the cia rendition investigation while trying to convince it to grant our request to repatriate guantanamo detainees through lajes right now it would be to our advantage to stroke him lot hoffman
