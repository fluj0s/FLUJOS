division summary recurring issue in environmental policy is the cost of pollution control imposed on individuals businesses and governments to inform policymakers about these costs number of surveys and analyses have been conducted over the years consistent basic sources have been an annual survey of co sts to manufacturers conducted by the bureau of census boc and an annual analysis of total costs prepared by the bureau of economic analysis bea overall the bea analysis showed the nation spent 122 billion for pollution abatement and control in 1994 or about 176 of gross domestic product personal consump tion expenditures for pollution control were 22 billion government 35 billion and business 65 billi on these 1994 data represent the end of the annual series the boc survey and bea analysis have been discontinued background while debate continue s over defining environmental protection costs and what they mean for society as whole1 every year individuals communities businesses and industries pay billions of dolla rs to control pollution they pay both directly for pollution control technologies and services eg catal ytic converters on auto s and sewerage fees and indirectly for pollution control costs embe dded in goods and services eg the price of electricity may include the costs of electrostatic precipitators and fluegas desulfurization units to reduce air pollution efforts to measure those costs at the na tional level began s hortly after national environmental protection programs emerged in the 1960s beginning in the 1970s several general sources of cost data were widely availabl key sources were annual surveys by the boc and mcgrawhill regula r analyses by the bea and the council onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97459crs2 2for list and discussion of cost surveys

and nonmedia and by state dditional details are also provi ded for example breakdown of operating costs and capital expenditure s are presented for three nonmanufacturing sectors mining petroleum and electric utilities5 despite the thoroughness of the survey the figures probably underreport actual costs in report on competitiveness in 1994 the congressional office of technol ogy assessment ota

data reported in the bo c survey two kinds of figures stand out firstand often the only question asked of th dataare the total costs of pollution abatement the bocs 1994 survey identif ied pollution abatement capital expenditures of 788 billion for manufacturing establis hments and 892 billion for nonmanufacturing establishments see tables 12 plus ope rating costs for manufacturing establishments amounting to 2067 billion see table 1 however boc included depreciation in operating costs net operating costs7 for us manufacturers totaled 141 billion see table 3 this gives gr and 1994 total of 309

whole see table 3 total compliance costscapital co sts plus net operating costs not including recovered costs and depreciati on also vary substantially among industries the ota analysis suggests that share of value added may be the most accurate measure of environmental regulatory burdensince it measures the level of economic activity performed by the establishment and does not include the cost of materials purchased8 by this measure petroleum refining b ears the largest burden of pollution control requirements table 3 national pollution abatem ent and control expenditures beas annual pollution abatement and c ontrol expenditures analysis which appeared in survey of current business takes broader look at the nations pollution control costs it examines spending for pollution abatement across all sectors of the economy including personal consumption business and government it also breaks down data by mediaair water solid wastes nd other surveys including the boc survey of manufacturing costs are sources of nearly twothirds the data indirect sources and estimates account for the remainder the prima ry values of the bea analysis have been its comprehensiveness and its consistent times eries data which cover the period 1972 1994 overall the bea analysis shows the nation spent 1218 billion for pollution abatement and control in 1994 or about 176 of gross domestic product this represented an increase of 31 over 1993 the largest increase was for air pollution control largely to implement the 1990 clean air act amendments caaa in terms of evaluating who pays for polluti on control one characteristic of the bea analysis can be misleading it attributes pollution control costs to the sector that performs rather than pays for the air or water pollution abatement or the solid waste collection and disposal in response to questions about w ho bears the costs of pollution control both crs and ota have in earlier years reanalyzed the bea data to transfer certain costs from those who performed pollution control to those who paid for it the primary shift was to move costs of private septic systems and wer connections to personal consumption from business this reanalysis has been repeat ed here adapting slightly the method used by ota9 see table 4 this indicates 1994 pers onal consumption expenditures for pollution control were 222 billion government 35 billion and business 647 billion pollution control cost data in the future the end of the boc survey and the bea analysis diminishes the limited data on pollution control costs and adds to the difficulty of fulfilling mandates for improved cost analyses of environmental regulati ons for example epas report the benefits and costs of the cle an air act 1970 1990 1996 the first in series required by the 1990 caaa relied heavily on boc and bea data s ources of cost data when epa extends its analysis beyond 1994 are problematic cong ress has recently enacted requirements for costbenefit analyses of other regulations as well even if new data sources for pollution control costs emerge demonstrating reliability and establishing continuity will take timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97459crs5
