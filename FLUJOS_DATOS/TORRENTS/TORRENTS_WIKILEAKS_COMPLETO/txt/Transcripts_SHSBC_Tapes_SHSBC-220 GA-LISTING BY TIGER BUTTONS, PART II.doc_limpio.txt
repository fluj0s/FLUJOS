galisting by tiger buttons part ii lecture given on 2 october 1962 thank you all right the wishing well is outside for your convenience crown why thats wish for good auditor you see and half crown thats to hoping your goal will fire quickly you see theres nice scale of rates here of one kind or another and florin well thats hoping somebody wont start screaming in the rest of the room you see theres rates of pay on this its very interest youll find its very workable anyhow this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course 2 oct ad 12 october and were continuing lectures here on listing 3galisting by tiger buttons now your activitynow hear carefullyyour activity as an auditor on listing session has these responsibilities in an ordinary way that you get the goal to fire and that the pc is not prevented from listing and you get the most items down that you canits quantitative that you dont get him to overlist and you dont make him underlist now theres various ways that you could effect these various things and the first and foremost is you could getbe auditing with your rudiments out now lets be smart about pcs we already know in dynamic assessment if youre running any goal that has been gotten by dynamic assessment youre fortunate because you have data on the pc and i learned this myself just in the last twentyfour hours i finally had to make up my mind about this because man supposing you have pc whose item is floors now look at this man the item is floors now this pc is going to run into lot of floors right now take somebody whose item is people or somebody you know or somebody whose item is rain and its been raining for the last twenty four hours and so forth well now lets be smart about it lets get intelligent about this it isntyoure not an adding machine after all as an auditor or something like that lets take look at this pcthis pc look all right now when i say that i mean you take look at the pc before the session begins go ahead and take look at the pc and the pcs sitting down and youre adjusting the chair and getting the can squeeze and all this sort of thing lets add something in there look at the pc now that might be new and novel but youll find out itll pay very heavy dividends youll find out itll pay very very good dividends indeed your pc doesnt look as good today as pc looked yesterday at session end now look you dont have to have the pc on the meter and be studying the needle and studying the tone arm and all that you dont have to hook him up to battery of instruments to tell you that he looks sort of shopworn today compared to how he looked yesterday i mean you already are battery of instruments that ean detect this kind of thing dont you see in other words look at your pc all right the pc looked raggletaggled and wogged up one way or the other well what are you trying to do getting in your beginning rudiments without running ow why dont you just start the session run ow few commands and so forth and getlet the pc spit it out you know just general ow and get the rudiments in before you put the rudiments in is there anything wrong with that and if this pc is normally quite withholdy and has hard time regurgitating items and so so well run ow put in the random rudiment and then put in rudiment one in other words ask the pc if you missed any withholds while running ow see you get the idea all right lets not just sit there and run some kind of rote lets put the pc in state to be audited see straightawaybang is it all right with you if we begin this session now all right here it is start of session see all right what were going to do here now is going run little ow on you just few commands hope factor see youve already told the pc just few commands see how it goes so we wont have to waste lot of time on rudiments you knowanything you want to say all right what have you done what have you withheld what have you done what have you withheld what have you done what have you withheld ahooowa woooo all right now youve gotten downthe pc is in pretty good shape all right and you say since the last time i audited you have i missed withhold on you thats clean all right are you willing to talk to about your difficulties clean see clean as wolfs tooth since the last time i audited you done anything you are withholdine you already got it clean see do you have present time problem well he did have clean all right roll up the sleeves and into tiger drill get that goal firing now ive been taking sometimes as much as thirtyfive minutes to get in beginning rudiments on pc and i finally realized that i was wasting time because ten minutes worth of ow in every case had finally had to be run after the agony and actually tremendous quantities of time were wasted in the session trying to keep the pc insession when i should have run ow in the first place you understand so your whole interest in listing session is get the pc in some kind of shape so the pc can be insession somebody here suggested the other day that under the control of an auditor should be added to the definition of insessionness and i think this is very wise idea willing to talk to the auditor interested in own case and under the control of the auditor now theres nothing better in running up havingness and that sort of thing than good flashing dash of ow now how much do you challenge those answers how much do you challenge these ow answers you dont man because youre using ow to promote the thing so the pc gives you six motivators and victim fine all right pc figures its something theyve done thats all right because youre using ow to get the pc to talk to the auditor about his difficulties we dont care what the pc says just as long as the pc says something what have you done ive breathed very sarcastic see ive breathed what have you withheld everything what have you done sat here and let myself be butehered up day after day by you what have you withheld my better self get smart get smart the pc is talking to you dont interrupt it for worlds for the pc will slide right on into session as nice as fish going down chute this one i gave this fellow i was telling you about in washington when i suddenly said well to hell with this theres reason of knocking him appetite over tin cup made him sit down in the chair and take up the cans and you know the first questanswers i got to my questions what have we failed to find out about you man they didnt even vaguely resemble answers but he was talking he was talking and remember your insessionness this contains that as primary action pc is talking to the auditor well it doesnt even matter if hes bawling the auditor out hes talking to the auditor you dont recognize that the only serious condition of pc is when they sit there too apathetic to say anything to the auditor if youve driven pc down to that point you ought to be spanked you must have done it because at some time the pc was talking to you and then stopped well what did you do to stop the pc talking to you thats what you would have to patch up matter of fact you could take somebody that had finally run down and wont say another word to you and wont utter anything to you and wont say anything else to you and is never going to talk to you again and is just sitting there blaaah theyre not mad theyre just sitting there blaaah theyre too weak they just feel absolutely clammy on the subject of talking they cant and so forth if you were to say something like this youd be surprised youd surprise yourself youd say how did i stop you from talking to see and the pc says oh well you just wouldnt accept anything i said all right good how else did i stop you from talking oh you were sitting there demanding i tell you things i told you everything i got theres nothing else and look get off of the significance scenic railway huh its beautiful those rails going around the peaks and beautiful snowcapped vistas and forests and streams and waterfalls and so forth the significance railway i mean you know to hell with what scenery lets have some scenery we dont care if this railway is going to start running through garbage dumps see were not going to insist on the beautiful vista lets at least get the railway running you see lets get those cars moving we dont care what the cars are going to go through or how much they clank some auditors are perfectionists and they hear screak in the wheels you know as the car starts up and they stop the car to oil it and theyve stopped the car man and thats everything there is to it they wont get that train going again easily see so the whole thing about session is the pcs willingness to talk to the auditor so in listing session this is terribly important because all doubt about willingness to talk to the auditor must be washed out before you start listing thats real important that pc shouldnt have any qualms about talking to youno qualms at all man qualms at all pc just talks to you you can always bring pc out of missed withholds if the pc will give you any missed withhold or any withhold or any comment about missed withholds if the pc will just talk you can do something about it its when the pc will longer talk that youre in trouble so you really have to have those rudiments in for listing session the best way to get them in get the pc talking to you and youll probably find necessary far more often to run rudiment ow in listing sessions than any other type of session and its so easy that you can overlook these things about listing sessions see that pc has got to be willing to sing now anything the auditor does that is offbeat offline or anything like that is going to prevent the pc from talking now insessionness then doesnt have the importance of getting the meter to read its getting the pc so the pc will be terribly interested in his own items and will be able to asis them and get rid of them bing and you dont overacknowledge you dont underacknowledge what is acknowledgment well its to let the pc know you got it and if you were actually to sit there and say got it got that one all right got it got it got it got it got it got it it would be very effective of course you dont you say good and thank you and so forth but youve got to give the pc the idea that youre getting these now if you put your flat of your hand against the pcs nose and stop the pc while you very carefully look carefully at the pc like youre going to hypnotize him see and you say all right all right now pc keeps giving you items you see all right now look at now all right all right good i dont think youll find thats necessary you see im being kind of hard on you but i meanthese mistakes will be made now you want the amountthe amount of acknowledgment so the pc knows you got it and thats how much acknowledgment you want well thats how many you acknowledge he gives you thirteen so fast you cant go backyou already checked them off herebut you shouldyou dont have to go back and count the number since your last acknowledgment and say well now wait minute now im going to give you good for each one of these see those are all unusual actions pc has to be acknowledged well what is this well its what the pc considers being acknowledged is well what is that well its being acknowledged this is human value its not mathematical value its human value acknowledgments arent oneforone or oneforten or tenforone some poor pcs get ten acknowledgments for every one item you know you wind up asising the pc not the bank so keeping the pc talking to you is question there of how skilled the auditor is in not getting in the pcs road and letting the pc know that the auditor has heard it and thats the type of auditing youre looking at in listing sessions all right now this getting the goal to firenow let give that little more stress getting that goal to fire now did you ever hear pistol tick well when you heard it tick it didnt fire did it that right well thats what i mean by getting goal to fire its not carelessly used see we want rocket reads on this goal man now of course theres this dividing line you can put the pc into terrific anxiety if you cant get his goal to fire i can show you how not to do it sit back well i dont know if its your goal or not im just taking you over from another auditor ive never even ever seen the goal fire dont know whether itd fire or not lets see all right to catch catfish well it didnt fire that time hehheh well that didnt fire so on who said this was your goal you see and somebody say this was your goal have you had any sensation on it at all during your listing with your past auditor oh well that is just plainplain awful you can slaughter goal with the wrong tiger drill now what you want to do with tiger drill just walk in on the goal and clean it up see actually as long as youre taking tiger drill buttonsits big tiger that you use by the way at the beginning of session not small tiger on the sen side of the picture on this why you have three minimum and on the pain side of it you have three minimum pr go into that in minute but you want big tigeryou want big tiger and you want thatyou want that goal firing and just remember this that pistols that tick havent gone off theyre not loaded you want it firing now do you understand now how much is fire how much is fire how frequent must the goal fire in the three reads well let tell you one of the things you can work pc up into an anxiety so you can get rocket read half rocket read and read you say to catch catfish rocket read to eatch catfish half one to eatch catfish read well whats happened pc is sitting there saying did it fire you know heh well did it you know you say to catch fish the goal fired and the pc says to himself did it fire you know then you say to catch catfish next time and he half hears you and hes got the goal somewhat suppressed and then says well god almighty it isnt firing and by the time youve read it the third time of course its totally suppressed thats the end of that then you start in again and this makes the pc very anxious mostly what you do wrongand this is pretty uniformis you dont keep pc genned in you run secret on the pc you run withhold on the pc about whats happening you can tell him with perfect honesty as long as you put in enough hope factor that hope factor is quite important you say well well get this thing to firing oh well well get it to firing well lets brush this one up and get it to firing so we can get going here see now take any of those frames of mind and oppose it to this one well ill see if i can get it to fire well im try you know oh to catch catf doesnt look that good to all right thats nohope factora hope factor you keep it ridingeven if it doesnt fire why you know this is the pcs goal the pc has been getting pain on it and that sort of thing and it didnt fire so you say ah well all right lets get this stuff off of it so itll fire pc sparks right up and gets the stuff off it and it fires again well i dont know whether i can get this thing to fire or not i had an awful time with it yesterday and i dont seem to be doing very good with it that goal wont fire in other words you can predetermine whether or not the goal is going to fire by your attitude of getting the goal to fire got that you predetermine whether or not the thing is going to fire by your attitude toward the job of getting it to fire this isnt necessarily true totally but it also applies in finding goals you get too desperate about finding pcs goal and the pc will suppress all his goals so you want to go into it sprightly you want to go into it rapidly brightly and you just all right lets get the suppressions and stuff off this and get this thing firing or maybe it is firing today well lets hope maybe it ismaybe its firing already all right all right lets see now to catch catfish mmmm see to catch catfish mmmm to catch catfish mmmm what are you doing oh pc says i just had such an awful time yesterday getting the thing to fire you know im just holding my breath you see if i hold my breath just right like that the goal will fire see if i dont hold my breath the goal wont fire sometimes you can say all right now the way to make goal really fire is you hold that cigarette lighter in your hand there back of the can and thats good luck charm and thatll make the goal fire and sometimes it will you follow your natural bent of what the hell are you holding your breath for or even if you say it its better than nothing but dont say to the pc rather patiently like theyre small child well you dont have to hold your breath to make the goal fire or not make the goal fire now ill take care of that and so forth thats reassuring maybe but its on the wrong side of the ledger give them something that they will consider ridiculous or take seriously we dont care which way it is now do something effective in other words you influence the firing of the goal you know that you can make one fire through all of its suppressions and everything else itll just fire naked all by its lonesome right out into the blue you say well all right now im going to read the goal so it will fire to catch catfish thats firing real well thank you very much now well get on with the listing that would be pretty short wouldnt it well you actually the auditor determine how short that will be by your attitude your strain your worry and your lack of assurance and so forth and your lack of hope you want that goal to fire all right then have it your intention to fire the goal that isnt because you make the goal fire thats because you intend to take responsibility for its firing as long as the pc takes responsibility for the goals firing it wont fire because the pc is sitting there in total ive got to do something ive got to do something i dont know what im supposed to do you hear every pc say this i dont know what im supposed to do in order to make the goal to fire when you say this i dont know whether im supposed to sit here and not hold the cans to hold the cans relaxedly hold the cans carefully or if im supposed to sit up straight or so on and so on if im supposed to think something if i supprthink something pr suppress it if i dont think something i wont suppress it you know the pcs frame of mind is pretty ghastly right at that point see but why its only ghastly because youre making the pc take responsibility for it now im take full responsibility for the goal firing you just sit there and relax to catch catfish that fired beautifully all right well go on into the listing session now that would be the shortest one on record wouldnt it nevertheless when i say fire i mean fire any goal will rocket read now you cant expect goal to rocket read three times in row if the pc suppresses the second one and cancels the third one see thats too much to hope for so therefore and thereby your action in getting goal to read is in the direction of effectiveness dont harass the pc dont worry the pc about it but get that goal to fire now the pc says well i have whole bunch of items and lets not fool with the goal today you say well all right lets not fool with the goal today good then ill just read it once and you just sit there pr get it to fire to catch catfish that fired fine give the items see see you did what you were supposed to do you would be surprised if you will take responsibility for the goal firing how often it will fire and if you take responsibility for it and harass the pc for it how often it wont fire you get this im just telling you some of the little tricks of the trade this is completely aside from big tiger which we will have other talks about and lectures on but ive got to tell you that sensensationthis is the result of the pc being slowed down and not being permitted to list and you can list goal straight forward into total sensation now ive already told you that it gets to an allsen proposition now all sensation and the bank beefing up and the pc sick and nauseated are signs of wrong goal when theyre all present but you can actually list goal into all sensation without the bank beefing up and without the pc sick and nauseated and when that condition takes place that is just knuckleheaded auditing that is all thats just preventing the pc from giving you items or being in session its very easy and you can look for it now pain will turn off on goal now the way ifyou tell if its right goal is the ta is moving and it comes down and the pc is cheerful and easily put into session the pc looks good looks young theres pain on it also some sensation and the pcs bank is getting less and the pc isnt sick or nauseated and feels pretty good now thatd be the signs of listing right goal signs of listing wrong goal of course is the ta stuck up there at 45 or 50 and really stuck pc arc breaky chopchop messed up pc looks bad looks old theres pain on it at allits all sensation the bank is getting more solid and ridges are getting more solid andoutside and inside the body pc is starting to get sick nauseated motion sets inits mainly motionthe whole physical universe starts going out of plumb and so on you want to know how it sounds just take some goal that isnt yours and invalidate hell out of it think of somebody elses goal and then go off into corner and make bunch of invalidative critical snappy snarlish remarks about somebody elses goal privately to yourself you can actually start throwing the corners of the room out of plumb see its not your goal and youre gottengetting overts on it and you can turn on sen yourself i dont advise it but thatswould be one way to find out how it feels now its the responsibility of listing auditor that he doesnt list wrong goal see thats the responsibility of the listing auditor you must not list wrong goal you must not do it so you getthis 114line setup is very carefully squared away on this basis because its tiger drill buttons youre getting sort of running prepcheck anyway which makes the goal ease up now thats fine and if you get the goal firing at the beginning of every session and at the end of every session the possibilities of your auditing wrong goal drop to nothing see just by the fact of following these rules get it firing at the beginning of every session get it firing at the end of every sessionof course its just going to tiger drill out of existence now goal that disappears without producing free needle on the meter was the wrong goal goal that only rock slams and you cant turn on any rocket reads of any kind is probably wrong goal goal that ticks only when its protestedthese kind of thingswhen you only get the tiger drill buttons are out does the goal read these are the symptoms of wrong goal and you mustnt list wrong goal so therefore you must get goal firing before you list you get this see when we mean fire we mean rocket reads now those rocket reads will reduce in size as goal is listed quite rapidly theyll come down to about half the size good rocket read is about an inchthreequarters of an inch lets say thats nice rocket read threequarters of an inch all right your rocket read on that goal will reduce quite rapidly by reason of being discharged to about quarter of an inch youbut you still got quarterofaninch rocket read its not quite complete but its rocket read it starts out very fast and decays very rapidlythe motion of the thing and it strikes to the right on the fall side of the emeter rocket reads always strike to the right those that strike to the left are just the reverse side of rock slam and you push them justtheyre wrong goals alwaysyou push them just little bit further they go into rock slam you push them just little bit further and the rock slam drops out they tick you clean up the buttons and theyre gone thats the usual course of goal which at first reading strikes to the auditors left as he faces the meter but you actually cannot forecast whether its the right goal or the wrong goal until it has been made to fire properly now if you demand that goal fires three times in row exactly right with the pc sitting there without much faith in you holding his breath like mad worried stiff about the fact that you may take his goal away from him youre nuts youre just expecting the impossible dont you see but one way to do it is to put the goal in sentence on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed well it read didnt it but just because it only ticks in that sentence is not meaningful either because you havent got enough intention behind saying the goal you understand that thats sure cure but you notice the goal is reading within those sentencesfeel fairly safe as youre tiger drilling youll see lot of peculiarities about goals but dont expect that real goal comes up reads threequarters of an inch right on through to the day that it goes free needle all of sudden vanishes then and free needle ensues because they dont the course of goal is more or less this way course of goal is not down to tick the course of goal is full rocket read and often as the pc isnt suppressing or being careful or something else you can tell its goal because its got nice full rocket read you list few sessions or couple of sessions and so on youve got maybe quarterhalf rocket read something like that to say on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed invalidated you see right straight on down across those buttons burrrrrr to catch catfish see you got to learn to say that suppressed invalidated suggested missedwithheldbecause ive given it to you seeand mistaken you got to be able to say those with read on any one of them see theres read appears on any one of them and read does appear on the goal and thats thecalled the instructors check you can always tell if its right goal you get read on any of those and read on the goal and thats actually later on the only way you can tell goal youve got to make sure theres read on any of those see you can even be fooled by that occasionally he invalidates it before you get to mistaken but if youre going to give that check remember to get withheld not failed to reveal and mistaken or you cant say it in sensible english you have to clean on your tiger drill withheld and you have to clean on your tiger drill mistaken those are the versions that you can get all into one sentence that will make sense lf you get read on those and you get read on goal thats the goal man youre all set if you get reads on those and reads on the goal of course the read on the goal is the read you got on those and on one or another of them or the absence of read on the goal is because suppress is hot you s to how this little cats cradle works out very neatly the only way you can tell goal thats gone along the line for long time is with an instructors check thats the point im trying to put over to you theres hco policy letter form on itpossibly could be modernized little bit all right now the reading of the goal must occur before listing and this will prevent you ever listing wrong goals well so you listed it wrong you listed wrong goal three days running well that meant you tiger drilled it six times you got it to read at the beginning of session you got it to read at end of the session by getting it to read at the end of the session of course you wipe out all the nonsense that might have occurred during the session on mistakes and all of that sort of thing and suppression on items by doing that you obviate further prepchecking on this unless the pc is really in trouble now goal that ticks with high tone arm stuck the goal ticks and the tone arm is stuck high well you better explore this goal you better look this goal over pretty darn good and you better find out what were the conditions of its finding thats the first thing you want to look for on some spook line like this what were the conditions of its finding did the auditor say thats your goal and the pc say that isnt my goal or just before the auditor read it off the list the pc saw it upside down on the list and says you know thats toothats too much recent times thatsthatsthats much too recent time track area to be goal and the auditor gets to it and reads it doesnt pick that up and said well thats your goal and the pc says thats not my goal and the auditor says yes that is your goal and the pc says huhuh thats not my goal and boy you know that goal will read for months and years you got to go back and get that see youve got to get that assert versus the protest you got to get the suggest and the protest off of that thing thats mistake man so that has to be big tigered out you have to take it out with assert and protest now it could be in reverse the auditor says well it cant be your goal because youre woman and it says that the goal is to be man and youre woman and it cant be your goal see some auditor way back and he did this assessment in upper kokono county or something and it was done by an expe member you know now this thing is really goofy and by god you run across it in session and then this is never uncovered and nobody does anything with ityou know that goal will read the only thingweird looking about the goal is it never rocket reads and it always ticks with the same tick or it always goes squrigglewith little dirty needle squriggle bzzzzzt bzzzzzt bzzzzzt and it never does anything else now goal which is in solely by virtue of arc break has constant read real goals have variable read got that so you see goal that always ticks matter what you do you read it to the pc with the pc asleep and on the cans and it still ticks matter what you do or how you read it you always more or less get about the same read boy youd better be awful suspicious because that is not the way goal acts goal goes in and goal goes out and goal rocket reads and goal ticks and doesnt read and it does this it does that and the pc gets very nervous and then you read it and it doesnt read and then you read it and it reads and then you clean it up and it goes tick splash dirty needle huuuh you say thats good thats real goal you got the idea but the one that goesalways goes thirtysecond of an inch tick and thirtysecond of an inch tick and you say oh hell this isnt your goal and read it again and it goes with thirtysecond of an inch tick and you clean that upwhat you just saidand it reads with thirtysecond of an inch tick you get the idea goals arent built that way so the charge of too constant can be leveled at wrong goal and you get down to figure this thing out wen this pc has listed it suppressed items done everything of this sort has gone around trying to tell people that the goal mustthis is actually casethe goal must not be listed with your in the line actually the line would never clear the line was protested every time the auditor read it the pc protested the line that line would never go clear until the protests were taken off of it you understand there was your in it that shouldnt have been in it there it was all right an auditor says well i cant get this to go out i guess thats your goal and the pc says whati never even put it on the list ive never heard of it before and then of course every time somebody tries to list this thing the pc saidtries to tell the auditor look this isnt my goal ive never had this as goal it just came in this way and ive just never had it and the auditor says trying to chicken out and consists goes on listing it see hey you know that confounded thing will tick and itll tick and itll tick and itll tick but it always ticks the same tick see how that constancy gets built into the goal now youit doesnt take any vast prepcheck to strip this out of the goal lets just get slippery lets be good auditors what do you got you got chain you got basic on the chain whats the basic on the chain first time the goal ever appeared to the pcs attention when was it what happened bzzzztbzzzzt all right the whole thing will rip up and it will longer read that goal is out see nobody expects you to sit there by the hour to find out if its wrong goal lets get smart in our old age huh in other words it doesnt take forever to tiger drill goal is what im trying to put across to you did you ever hear of directing the pcs attention what happened when this goal was originally found oh well lot of auditors have gone into that and i always tell them all the same thing its not my goal and you say thank you thank you now what happened when this goal was found well i always tell auditors its not my goal tisnt and so forth yeah thank you thank you very much thanks lot i got that now now what happened when the goal was found when was it found when when oh it was found last summer all right good thank you got him talking hahahahaha got him to answer well take him right down to the arc break that makes that thing read hahaha they go bzzzztno goal see or if it is the pcs goal even though the pc said it wasnt his goal and so forth itll start rocket reading when you get the basic disagreement off of it in other words goal can read by basic disagreement as well as by rocket read but real goal reads occasionally by rocket read once in while it reads by rocket readonce in while so youd better see rocket read before you start to list got that now as you sail down the line one card at timeyouve got the cards all stacked up in front of you and your derringer laid alongoh thats another game you got the cards all stacked up in front of you and you got your pencil ready and youre reading off the linenow the first time you go through these things take them up with the pc and doggone you dont get in any arguments with the pc over these lines because itll act just like ive been telling you about the goal ive been putting on the coal about how invalidation or protest or something can make goal read forever well itll do the same thing with the line and that line will never go free and one day youll get back there and by golly youve got 113 lines free but every time you say who or what would not help suppress catfish the meter reads youll have to prepcheck that line youll have to big tiger the line now the best thing to do is to follow it down to the first time that line ever appears and youll find every time exclusively that that line was the subject of roaring argument that wasnt pulled in the session so if you get into an argument about goal lets get the argument off the goal and if you get into an argument about line lets get the argument off of that lineboth the right wording and the wrong wording well we had pc around here for while that went out and told everybody his goal was plural and his goal was actually on the list as singular and nobody prepchecked or nobody tiger drilled both the plural and singular goals because the singular goal may have been the right one but that being the right one was the only one that was prepchecked or tiger drilled do you see that as an error youve got to take both of them see youve got to take the wrong line and the right line youve also got to take the wrong supposing the pc had misapprehension he thought his goal was to secure elephants he went around telling everybody his goal was to secure elephants when as matter of fact the goal was to keep elephants hey this puts bad mistake on it he finally finds out his goal is to keep elephants well if you let secure elephants ride youre going to have the goal line messed up one way or the other because he isnt sure now youve got to tiger drill this goal to secure elephants and itll go out just in that much tiger drill see its just out right now practically if you pay attention to this fact so you get into an argument when youre writing up lines on pc and giving him lines and constructing lines and boy youve had it by the time youve added five or six versions of this line and tried to shove each one of them down the pcs throat and the pc has protested each version of this line you have now six versions that will have to be tiger drilled in order to make the line go free at the end of processing you got it so dont be knucklehead man you can dig your own grave so just dont get in arguments about lines how do you keep out of arguments about lines well youre supposed to sit down and compose the pcs lines originally in the first place so theyd make sense all right look them over these linesthe old lines the create lines the fifty lines and so forthwere too hard for auditors to do this has got enough lines so that few inevitable errors that will steal into somebodys line is not going to louse up clearing when i say that youre going to run lines five to eight on the effect wording of the goal see all of you have been doing this youve been listing those things as cause see youve been specialized in the cause side of the goal and never list the effect side of the goal see who or what would want to find who or what would want to be found and youll neglect the who or what would want to be found and you say who or what would really want to find and think youve got the effect in see its not see well you could make that mistake and its still an answerable line and the line could still go awry and youd still produce clear see so ive built in bunch of possible errors but this one cant be built into anything get in an argument with the pc about the lines oh see you come to this thing and its you come to this thing and its who or what would goaling blank and youre running suppress see and the goal is to be and you say who or what would to be blank who or what would to be suppress to be suppress well all right yeah well leave that in yeah that looks all right youve got to clear these things the first time you take them up with the pc dontyou list linethe first time youre going through these lines you take it up with the pc you list it then you turn it over and you take up the next line with the pc in other words youve got to clear those commands you just ask him is this line answerable and if its not answerable dont get into dogs breakfast on the thing make the changes he says unless it knocks the whole thing into cocked hat and then delicately point this out but man thats delicate and if you invalidate run it off right there on this line has anything been invalidated you got it dont leave it sitting around because the line wont go clear get inif you do get in an argument about line tiger drill the argument tiger drill the lineright now dont let it pile up because it wont ever list you say who or what would to be suppress doesnt isnt grammatical to be suppress so well put it down who or what to be suppressed that isnt right well im take it up with the pc because i dont understand it and maybe the pc will well thats wrong thinkingyoud better take look at that thing many of youve turned sen on organizing some othersome pcs lines you do to some slight degree you know its all rightruns out but you can do anything you want to with wrong goal except list it on yourself you know i mean you say who or what would beingness suppress who or what would beingness suppress who or what would being suppress who or what would being suppress and then weve got another line here who or what would suppress being oh well who or what would be suppressed by being and then who or what would be suppressed by beingno thats the same line who or what would get suppressed if you were that isnt right who or what would be suppressed who or what would get suppressed if you be and you finally make up your mind to what it is see you come along and the pc takes look at thishes already wogged dont give him too much of one to run into and he who or what would get suppressed by be by being hed say being is right who or what would get suppressed by being all right all right well answer it that way the funny part of it is youre not going to go too far wrong youre going to go much further wrong if you involve it in an argument got the idea make it so that you yourself can think of an answer to it without selfauditing on the thing and then if the pc says he cant answer it then doctor it up so he can but avoid arguments on the thing because this thing is listing in wealth of lines youve got enough lines here so that youve got wealth of lines youve got lots of them unless of course you muck them all up with an argument and if you do that then hell never go clear now if you want to know why some line isnt going clear113 lines are going clear but who or what would worryingwho or what would worrying bethat line hes always had trouble listing it who or what would worrying be he always seems to have trouble listing it the line isnt going clear the line is stuck youll finally find out that you dont have to clear that line what you have to do is tiger drill it who or what would worrying be on this line has anything been suppressed see tiger drill it all of sudden the tiger drill comes out and the only thing that was holding the whole line inwas not the items left on it because they evaporated out from under it on other fronts yeah the only thing you had left on it was stuck line now at the end of listing what happens its just lines one after the other go free what do you do with free line well for the sake of formality you can ask them to give you single item as you go by them or you can say well im just testing thissee if its free and if i get reaction here you can give an item is that all right and you read the line but you dont press this on past free needle and when theyre all nice and free when all the lines are free on the thing another phenomenon should taketook place and that is the goal should kind of go pop pc will have some cognitions concerning the goal if these cognitions concerning the goal never occur the goal is still in i thought it blew today you will get so tired of hearing this from pcs you could spit they come into session every morning and say i thought of couple of items last night myself i put them down here on piece of paper and i know it blew the goal i felt it go you put him on the meter the tone arm is at 70 you see theyre always feeling it blow well when it really does go then they dont feel that it wentthey dont theyll say well when i was thereoh i wont give you the cognition hehhehhehhehheh i wont give you the cognition youll have to find that out for yourself now anyway theres the extentthe extent of listing and ive tried to give you the conditions under which listing should be done what youre supposed to do and the purposes of it if you find out that trying to get the goal to fire at end of the session is too confoundedly difficult and that sort of thing well for heavens sakes the next time you tiger drill it take it before the date of the session see take it since wednesday if your session that you couldntdidnt have time to finish really getting it to fire at the end of sessionthat was on thursday well the next time you tiger drill it on friday take it from wednesday see since last wednesday on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed in other words clued the other session in that you didnt get it to firing and youll have very little trouble if you keep this going now all the preventions i can think of are in this all of the actions the goal itself is very meaningful to the pc very precious to the pc the pc figures the wording of it and so forth has got to be very exact but in the truth of the matter you can almost have 20 percent of these lines written wrong as long as they make some kind of sense and could get some kind of an answer and the pc will still go clear now theres the tiger drill and tigers must be fed so we have the rabbit effect and the rabbit effect is of coursethe girls probably wont understand this too well but the boys doi mean the rabbit effect of course isits very suggestive because it breeds lines see thats why its rabbit effect you got rabbit the pc ishes had this minuteman minuteman you know and does minuteman fit here it doesnt fit there now minuteman minutemanhes always had this minuteman he finally tells you that minutemen subvert oh well give him break put subvert on the list thats how you handle rabbit effect well what would be the relationship of minuteman to the goal so that you cant get it on the list well hed subvert things wouldnt do anything else he wouldnt damage and he wouldnt agree with and he wouldnt destroy and he wouldnt create and he wouldnt withdraw and hed subvert well thats only when you get spare item dont get inventive unless the pc gets in trouble the rabbit effect will then take place and breed you out of existence because it immediately and instantly gives you six more lines one rabbit gives you six more lines you say well what does minuteman do to beingness well he subverts beingness thats the only thing there can be now i wish to call to your attention that lot of old ghosts have arisen and that routine 3 really is routine 3 and this is all very amusing but youre looking now at the reentrance of the prehav seale back into routine 3 this is bobtail version of the prehav scale and i studied the prehav scale for long time to find out what buttons on it were important in goals these buttons certainly are the most important buttons are of courseare ordinary tiger drill button but these buttons would be very important to run now you can change the sense of this by changingbywell take agree withagree with who or what would rabbit agree with to be rabbits goal who or what would rabbit agree with and pc got to get it offgot to get thatin other words its to toyeah i can answer that who or what would rabbit agree to and you say all right well give sample well hed agree to rabbit feeder and hed agree to thished agree to various types of forms to agree withhe wouldnt agree with anything at all hed only agree to all right use agree to see dont get involved in an argument on the thingpc wont lead you too far astray now thats about thethats actuallywith the data that is in this bulletin which hasnt been fully covered and the actual lines themselves the actual buttons themselves and few other things such as your model sessionjust about wraps up how you do listing session i have tried to give you the one thing the bulletin doesnt give you that is how you ask for them and what you do and how the tiger drill works and whatwhat you handle and then whats important about listing session and so on theres only one thing i havent said i havent said whether you bring the list into parity finally or not and somebodys going to be worrying about that well if the pc goes free needle on all lists without you bringing them into parity i am very happy but your ticks will show you that pc if hes jamming is probably jamming on these items that dont have any ticks on them at all and the main ones that youve got to keep parity for are the first twelve theyve got to be in fair parity theyve got to be of somewhat equal length but youll find out that he inevitably scouts oppose all the way through and that line on final test on 114 lines for free needle sticks you can go through those cards and find out well of course it sticks he never listed anything on it so theres something wrong with it or he never gave you any items for it so you straighten out the line is this line answerable you say to him well he says yes he says but nothing would oppose rabbit nothing nothingnothing would oppose rabbit nothing nothing well give him clue you know you say well all right ill take that as an answernothing oh he says that is an answer isnt it all right lets give some more see and coax him out and bzzzt and bow and bang and bang and bang and bang and zoooom and all of sudden this holdout line will go freemerely because you can see very clearly its wording and the fact that it wasnt listed very much so there must have been something happen to it and at the end of clearing which is the end that youll be worried about youll find out those lines wont go free that havent got anything on the cards and theres something wrong with their wording so good auditor can take those cards and he can straighten those cards out and he can straighten those lines out and he can find anything and he can get the few items left on them and he can actually take everything else out of the deck except those few lines that didnt have very much on them bring those things up to date and theyll go free needle too savvy so you need that for your tally work so thats the way that thing is put together its more complicated perhaps than you might have wished there have been people that since 1950 have been dreaming that they wont have to take any responsibility or have any auditing or get off anyi think its to get off any withholdsin order to get clear and somebody would walk in with horse syringe and thrust it into the gluteus maximus press the plunger authoritatively and they would go whee and they would be clear well i can call your attention to the fact that man has been trying to clear man in this way and with other things for very long time and it has yet to be effective now even though this is little more complicated than you would ordinarily look for compared to horse syringe and so forth why you arent spared any of the difficulties that you would be spared with horse syringe because the pc will scream on these lines too every once in while the pc will let out piercing little yeeeep you know and sometimes the pc falls out of the chair and writhes on the ground so what youll find out the pc will go clear if listing sessions are done somewhat as ive told you tonight thank you very much
