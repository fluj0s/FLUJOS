this excerpt has been taken from the factors admiration the renaissance of beingness lectures putting your communication lines out an article by l ron hubbard one of the solutions that was put forward to long time ago was put forward to very interestingly by couple of boyswouldnt you know itin hollywood they said well why dont we get four or five millionaires and process them all up to clear all of us auditors pitch in on it and then wed have plenty of money and that would be the end of the problem and i said be the end of what problem and he said well the problem about money yeah there isnt any problem about money truth be told any good printer can make more money than the government can anyway when you get yourself niceyou confront this thing called security very often it kind of digs you in behind the ramparts you know and you say ive kind of got to hold the fort here somehow or other because lets see i need to make two pounds because two pounds is two pounds and if i dont make two poundsso on i tell you something very funny money is an attention unit crown dollar mark franc is simply an attention unit and do you know that money can be regarded as attention and it follows exactly the laws of attention isnt that peculiar there is the lucky fluke of the guy who all of sudden opens up safe or something and finds he has eight billion dollars or something and he says now im going to take this out one dollar after another and im going to keep myself the rest of my life every once in while the police tear up some old home and they find some guy died of starvation and he had eight hundred thousand dollars parked up in paper sacks or something of this sort well you as an individual will make as much money as you attract prosurvival attention you can just absolutelyyou can plot how much money any man is going to make just with that you can plot them as they walk into processing session this fellow is going to make so much his life potential from here on in terms of currency is going to be just this much itll be your communication lag index because he can get as much attention prosurvival as hes in present time nobody ever got any attention out of present time that was prosurvival it was contrasurvival attention the police arrested him or something of the sort you get the difference of this money flows toward points which attract prosurvival attention all youve got to do is stand up there and keep on being prosurvival and be prosurvival in widening communicating sphere and you will just have to start throwing this stuff away you just turn your back on it it gets little bit tough after while you just have to turn your back on it because money gets you in trouble faster than anything i know more people start jumping you the second that youthey think youve got few bucks its wonderful i mean insurance brokersall your times taken up with trying to fight off securities salesmen if youve got money but this is something you kind of ought to put down
