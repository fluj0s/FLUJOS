mailings in 2001 which culminated in 5 deaths 22 infections and contamination of both postal and congressional buildings intensified concerns about terrorist use of biological agents this event increased congressional interest in actions to limit the vulnerability of the united states to such attacks highthreat biological agents defined by the cent ers for disease control and prevention as category pathogens are considered relatively easy to disseminate have high mortality and have the potential for major public health impacts highthreat biological agents cause different symptoms in their victims depending on the pathogen since the na ture of these agents differs single treatment can be given in the case of biological attack as result treatment of the victims of biological attack especially one which is covert may be difficult the identification process for many pathogens may be complicated by their incubation period and the lack of distinct symptoms early in the diseases progress the difficulties in treating the various highthreat agents may place strain on the resources of the medical system especially in the case of mass casualties protection from biological agents is an area of active research and development the range of protection and tection equipment available to first responders has led to questions regarding equipment standard ization and state and local preparedness development and distribution of vaccines continues to be contentious issue attempts to detect biological releases using sensor technologies or through analyzing public health data conti nue to be implemented but these technologies are in relatively early stages of development it is unclear whether terrorist groups ar capable of effectiv ely using biological agents as weapons of mass destruction but the relatively small amounts of pathogen that may be needed to execute significant attack is source of concern some suggest that terrorist interest in biological agents is increasing however others assert that technical difficulties would make mass casualty attacks unlikely current policies seek to reduce the pr oliferation of biological weapons by relying on both domestic and internationa l controls to increase the number of countermeasures available against such pa thogens through research and development activities to improve the nations ability to detect pathogen releases and to increase the ability of hospitals and care providers to treat mass casualties policymakers may be called upon to fu rther address potential biological terrorism vulnerabilities including overseeing the use of atmospheric monitoring equipment for pathogen detection the direction of continued research and development into biological agent detectors review of further research

detection cu rrent policies and possible future approaches to reducing their threat terrorist use of biological agents would be low probability but potentially high consequence event while there is still debate over whether terrori st groups have the ability to effectively use biological weapons as weapon of mass destructi on the anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted their potential as terror weapon policy approaches for reducing vulnerability to biological terrorism involve both addressing biologi cal agents as group and focusing on specific agents perceived as posing the greatest threat treatments for exposed victims vary depending on the nature of the pathogen and experience in treatment of these diseases is limited due to the rarity of naturally occurring cases what are highthreat biological agents biological agents for the purposes of th is report are pathogens which can infect and cause serious illness in humans1 the level of threat biological agent may constitute is open to interp retation depending on what aspects of pathogen are considered priorities different biological agents are likely to be identified as high threat for example the national institute of justice provides an extensive list of biological agents of concern in thei r handbook on purchasing protective equipment23 in comparison handbooks regarding battlefi eld treatment of biological

shorter list of agents4 the cdc identifies number of different categories of biological agents and rank th various biological agents into categories category diseases anthrax pl ague smallpox tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers are of the highest threat5 the cdc views category pathogens as easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person resulting in high mortality rates having the potentia l for major public health impact potentially causing public panic and social disrupti on and requiring special action for public health preparedness this is in contrast to the category b agents which lack such potential6 the category pathogens will be discussed in this report anthrax bacillus anthracis anthrax is disease caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis 7 bacillus anthracis responds to environmenta l stresses such as nutrient depletion or oxygen exposure by forming spores while the b acterium is dormant in spore form these spores are very hardy and can remain viable for decades in ideal conditions anthrax spores are primarily found in soil and ar endemic to many parts of the world anthrax is primarily an animal disease infecting animals when they ingest bacillus anthracis spores during grazing anthrax is not persontoperson contagious disease the forms of anthrax infection are cuta neous intestinal and inhalation the type of anthrax infection depends on how the victim came into contact with the spores cutaneous anthrax is the most co mmon form of the disease and occurs when anthrax spores contact broken skin intes tinal anthrax occurs after consumption of anthraxsporecontaminated food usually meat intestinal anthrax is less common than cutaneous anthrax inhalation anthrax is the least common naturally occurring form of anthrax inhalation anthrax occu rs when spores are inhaled and germinate in the lungs the symptoms usually appear 48 to 72 hour s after exposure the effects of the three forms of the disease differ from each other drastically cutaneous anthrax is marked by swollen painless black ulcer wh ere the infection occurred in contrast intestinal anthrax is characterized by nausea vomiting and fever followed by abdominal pain vomiting of bl ood and severe diarrhea inhalation anthrax manifests with symptoms resembling common cold fever fatigue and dry cough the symptoms progress to severe difficulty breathing and shock as

infecti on depends both on type of infection and how early treatment begins early treatment of anthrax victims is strongly suggested as late treatment is not as effective in many cases cutaneous infection typically has fatality rate of less than 5 with early treatment in creasing to 20 without any treatment intestinal anthrax has higher mortality rate with fatalities ranging from 25 to 75 depending on eff ectiveness of treatment some medical experts assert that aggressive early treatment of intestinal anthrax will lower the fatality rate8 untreated inhalation anthrax is almost uniformly fatal with early treatment withinthe incubation period the fatality rate can be dramatically reduced in the aftermath of the anthrax mailings of 2001 5 of the 11 people diagnosed with inhalation anthrax died but historically greater than 90 of inhalation anthrax cas have been fatal even with treatment 9 all forms of anthrax are treated with antibiotics several different antibiotics may be used including ciprofloxacin penicillin and doxycycline some anthrax strains may be less sensitive to antibiotics and therefore difficult to treat prophylaxis is available to prot ect against anthrax both via v accination and post exposure antibiotic treatment while vaccine against anthrax has been licensed by the fda it is not currently available to the general public due to vaccine shortage the department of homeland security working with the department of health and human services and other federal agencies is coordinating development of civilian anthrax vaccine policy the department of defense anthrax vaccination policy and the amount of vaccine needed to impleme nt this policy includes vaccination of troops thought to be potentially exposed to anthrax10 after the anthrax mailings of 2001 those individuals thought to be poten tially exposed to anthrax spores were offered vaccination and antibiotic prophy laxis using the drug ciprofloxacin plague yersinia pestis plague is disease caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis plague bacteria are sensitive to sunlight and humidity and do not form spores instead plague bacteria naturally reside in host creatures such as rodents and are found in many parts of the world including the united states plague usually travels within animal populations via insect vectors generally migrating from one animal to another through biting insects such as fleashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31864crs4 11 these are called buboes and give rise to the origin of this plague forms name 12 thomas w mcgovern and arthur m friedlander

3 2000the three kinds of plague are bubonic septicemic and pneumonic bubonic plague and septicemic plague occur when plague bacteria enter the body through the bite of an infected insect pneumonic plag ue occurs when plague bacteria are inhaled into the lungs or develops out of bubonic or septicemic infection pneumonic plague unlike the other forms does not have to pass through an insect vector it is persontoperson contagious bubonic plague is the most wellknown fo rm it is also known as the black death and was responsible for the european plagues of the 14th century victims of bubonic plague develop swollen pain fully inflamed lymph glands11 and also suffer fever headache chills and general weakness septicemic plague occurs in manner similar to bubonic plague except the swellin g of the lymph glands does not occur instead the bacteria multiply in the bl ood causing shock and internal bleeding in addition to the more general symptoms of fever and weakness the symptoms of pneumonic plague include fever weakne ss and cough possibly combined with severe nausea abdominal pain di arrhea and difficulty breathing the recovery rate for treatment of the di fferent forms of plague vary naturally occurring plague in the united states has an overall fatality rate of 14 the majority of these cases are bubonic with some septicemic and very rarely pneumonic plague the fatality rate for septicemic plague is markedly higher than that for bubonic 33 versus 11 between 1980198412 mainly ascribed to difficulties in diagnosing septicemic plague at an early stage pneumonic plague has much higher fatality rate it approaches 100 as the time between infection and treatment increases for effective treatme nt therapy must begin within 18 hours or victims are not likely to survive13 for untreated forms the fatality rate is 60 for bubonic plague and 100 for sep ticemic and pneumonic plague all forms of plague are treated using antibiotic therapy the food and drug administration has approved several antibio tics for treatment of plague and others not yet approved for such have been show n to be effective natural antibiotic resistance in plague bacteria is known so not all cases can be cured using single antibiotic14 plague vaccine has been approved for human use but its production was discontinued in 1998 because of manufact uring difficulties additionally

rash followed by scabbing pustules covering their body the rash nd pustules form over three week period following an incubation time of approximately one to two weeks survivors of smallpox are generally scarred by the diseas the disease has two rare variants one is known as flatpox the other hemorrhagic smallpox17 the fatality rates for the forms of the disease differ for smallpox the fatality rate is approximately 30 though in population lacking natural resistance this rate may increase both flatpox and hemorrhagic smallpox have fatality rate approaching 100 smallpox has specific

ingest contaminated food or are bitten by infected insects may develop swollen and painful lymph glands and eyes sore throat or skin lesions victims exposed to aerosolized tularemia bacteria develop symptoms similar to pneumonia weakness fever aches cough and chest pain tula remia has an incubati on period of 3 to 5 days after exposure the recovery rate for tularemia depends on access to proper

physical measures limit exposure by protecting the eyes lungs andor skin from biological contact and preventing contact with insect vectors medical protection may be effective when the biological agent responds to drug treatment or when an available effective vaccine exists physical personal physical protection against bi ological agents includes masks and protective clothing protective masks filter the air inhaled by the wearer removing particles from the air the most effectiv filters can remove almost 100 of aerosol particles greater than one micron in size by blocking inhalation of pathogens disease is avoided protective garments in the context of biological agents are generally designed to minimize inadvertent selfcontamination with pathogen protective gloves disposable

pathogens take s two tacks one is the preexposure vaccination of populations potentially at ris k for example troops in the middle east have been vaccinated against smallpox and anthrax as protection against potential military use the other is the prophyl actic use of antibiotics following known exposure to pathogen this method wa s used after the anthrax mailings of 2001 the availability of an effective license d vaccine is requirement for protective preexposure vaccination fo r the highthreat biologi cal agents found on the cdc category listing few vaccines are available licensed vaccines exist for both anthrax and smallpox but these v accines are not in public distributi on due to national security needs anthrax vacci ne is being used to innoculate military personnel and sufficient supply of vacci ne has not become available to offer vaccination to the general public recently the supply of the smallpox vaccine has become such that in extremis the entir population of the united states could be vaccinated not all highthreat biological agents have licensed vaccine but some have indstage vaccines which might be used in emergency situations use of ind vaccines might be complicated by supply concerns as only small amounts of these vaccines exist prophylactic use of antibiotics is only ccessful against bacteria viruses are not sensitive to antibiotics and so antibio tic use will not provide protection because the treatment of many bacteria is most effective when treatment is begun at an early stage prophylactic use of antibiotics is usually recommended for those potentially exposed detection of biological agents the detection of pathogens especially in the case of covert release is complicated process when victims of release are hospitalized identification of

installe d in all 282 mailprocessing plants nationwide to protect postal workers biological agen t detectors the field detection of biol ogical agents is usually performed with screening devices which detect specific pathogens typical screening devices use antibody tests or fast genetic tests using polymerase chain r eaction pcr to provide rapid diagnostic for the presence of given biol ogical agent antibody tests are agent specific so different biolog ical agents require the use of different antibody tests pcr screens determine if genetic markers ar present linking the test sample to known pathogen screening tests have varying sensitivity for some highly infectious pathogens the detectable centration of pathogen may be significantly greater than the infectious dose33 consequently such field devices are not generally considered definitive tests for the absence of an agent but rather are used to confirm the presence of significant quantities of agent further development of field devices is ongoing34 subsequent to an initial screening test samples are sent to laboratories where more sensitive laboratory tests are used to ascertain the identity of any pathogen present in general samples even those that test negative through screening tests require laboratorybased conf irmatory analysis the burden of this process on the public health laboratory system has been heavy35 public health monitoring monitoring the public health has emer ged as potentially important method in detecting the covert release of pathogens the centers for disease control and prevention in conjunction with the department of defense the association of public health laboratories and others have upgraded the laboratory response network which connects hospitals public health laboratories

release by terrorist groups ma be sudden increase in the number of hospital patients exhibiting symptoms by analyzing information from such patients likely time and location of pathogen release might be discovered and consequence management plans invoked some cities have further expanded these programs by monitoring purchases related to the public health for example some cities track pha rmaceutical and other medicinal sales operating on the theory that this will provide even earlier detection than hospital arrivals37 it is expected that the early identification of disease outbreak will increase the treatment success nd consequently lowe r the fatality rate biological agents as weapons of mass destruction versus as weapons of terror the likelihood of terrorist use of biological agents as weapon of mass destruction is an area of great debate biol ogical agents have not been used to cause mass casualties in modern times and are incapable of destroying physical infrastructure this raises questions about the claim that they would be effective weapons of mass destruction the t echnical feasability of terrorist groups disseminating biological agents is also open to question some believe that the techniques and technologies required for processing nd disseminating biological agents are beyond the capabilities of rrorist group while others believe that terrorist groups wishing to use biological weapons could easily do so in contrast to chemical agents few biological agents are commercially available in large quantity and so are not readily available for purchas or theft on the other hand biological agents are naturally occurring and selfre plicating which may ease the difficulties of acquiring and manufacturing sizeable quantities because pathogens are selfreplicating very small amounts can cause infection large quantities are not required to cause mass casualties it has been estimated that approximately 100 lbs of an thrax spores efficiently and uniformly disseminated by airplane under ideal conditions in metropolitan area could cause 150000 casualties38 terrorist groups have shown interest in biological weapons but few examples of their successful use and none as w eapon of mass destruction exist one well known example of biologicalweapon use w ithin the united states was by the rajneeshee cult in 1984 there salmonella bacteria was

crs report rs21507 project bioshield by frank gottron detection of bi ological release the deployment of the biowatch prototyp biological agent detector has raised questions about how this system will be us ed such monitoring system for covert releases of biological agen ts may provide important ear ly notification of potential danger since many pathogens have an in cubation period of seve ral days it is often difficult to begin treatment at an early stage early treatment of the inhalation form of these diseases is essential to recovery and system that signaled pathogen release before the appearance of symptoms in victims would be likely to increase the ability of victims to receive medication and surv ive by employing an array of such sampling devices citywide network might detect pathogen releases in smaller amount and also aid in determining the epicen ter of release such information may be important to identify the perp etrators of such an attack since the biowatch detectors are coupled to epa air quality monitors the locations are determined by air quality considerations and it is not readily apparent that these locations will provide adequate sampling of populated areas if the air quality monitor is located well above street level it may not detect the release of biological agents at street level additionally the effectiveness of these detectors in identifying small releases or indoor release of biological agents is not established and so placement of these detectors may provide false sense of security such detection system may also detect naturally occurring biological agents which are not virulent for example anthrax spores na turally occur in some areas of the united states and may provide fals indications of smallscal covert release the continued cost of these detectors reported at 1 million per detector per year is also of concern an unknown aspect of the biowatch progra m is the range of detector coverage it has been reported that each metropolitan area chosen will have 10 to 12 distinct detectors built into different air quality monitors also reported goal of this program is to provide det ection for 80 of the amer ican population by geographic distribution60 since the epa air quality monitors are not evenly spread throughout the various geographic areas of the country it is not apparent whether the biowatch program will be expanded to other sorts of monitoring stations biological detectors development and production of easily portable or handheld biological detection apparatus is another area where pressing need has

potentia lly screened but may decrease as more detectors are manufactur ed and distributed monitoring public health policymakers may choose to address curre nt methods of detecting bioterror events tracking potential bioterror releases through monitoring hospital admissions and physician reports may indeed detect covert pathogen release but such an approach requires that individuals first fall ill from the pathogen release critics claim that in the case of contagious pathogen such as pneumonic plague or smallpox the spread of the disease will occur at rate greater than the government response as there will be time delay due to the incubation period of the disease thus there will be an expanding number of people being inf ected even as public health workers attempt to determine the epi center of the release such an argument has been made especially in the case of smallpox as treatment for smallpox once symptoms have begun to app ear is unavailable in the smallpox case the debate over which vaccination method should be us ed the ring vaccination model based on identifying the initial outbreak of the dis ease and then vaccinating contacts of the victims of the initial outbreak or the ma ss vaccination model where people in geographic area are innoculated if small pox is detected has been very lively advocates of establishing sensors to detect pathogen releases before victims begin to seek treatment claim that the earlier the detection of an outbreak the more effective treatment will be others have asserted that the current model will be effective in limiting casualties from pathogen release they claim that increases in the public health infrastructure have reduced the likelihood th at hospitals and careproviders would be overwhelmed by bioterror event while not rejecting the utility of developing other detection devices to warn of covert pa thogen release some scientists modeling pathogen releases have st ated that even reducing detection times
