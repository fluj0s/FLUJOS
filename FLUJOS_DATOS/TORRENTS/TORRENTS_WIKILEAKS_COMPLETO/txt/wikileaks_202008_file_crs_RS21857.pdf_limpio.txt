equity capital although the in crease in the amount of equity capital was the lowest amount since the 1995 the lower am ount of equity capital represents the relatively slower rate of ec onomic growth

tail trade manufacturing and services all posted substantial increases economic performance by yearend 2005 the latest year for which tailed data are availa ble foreign firms employed 55 million

dutchaffiliated firms are the largest single employers in the retail trade sector and account for nearly onethird of total affiliate employment in this sector while japanese and british firms account for over half of the employment in the w holesale trade sector employment in the information finance r eal estate and techni cal services sectors accounts for another 13 of to tal affiliate employ ment average employee compensation is highest in the finance sector 229000 where swiss cana dian japanese and british account for threefourths of the employme nt the rest of the affiliate employment is spread among large number of other industries the affiliates of foreign firms spent 140 billion in the united states in 2005 on new plant and equipment imported 468 billion in goods and services and exported 181 billion in goods and services since 1980 the total amount of foreig n direct investment in the economy has increased eightfold and nearly doubled as share of us gross domestic product gdp from 34 to 64 it is important to note however that these data do not imply anything in particular bout the role foreign direct investment has played in the rate of growth of us gdp foreignowned establishments on average are far outperforming their usowned counterparts although foreignowned fi rms account for less than 4 of all us manufacturing establishments they have 14 more value added on average and 15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21857crs6 higher value of shipments than other manufacturers the average plant size for foreign owned firms is much larger five times than for us firms on average in similar industries this difference in plant size pparently rises from an absence of small plants among those that are foreignowned as resu lt of the larger plant scale and newer plant age foreignowned firms paid wages on average that were 14 higher than all us manufacturing firms had 40 higher productivity per worker and 50 greater output per worker than the average of comparable us owned manufacturing plants foreignowned firms also display higher capital intensity in larger number of i ndustries than all us establishments these differences between foreignowned fi rms and all us firms should be viewed with some caution first the two groups of firms are not strictly comparable the group of foreignowned firms comprises subset of all foreign firms which includes primarily very large firms the group of us firms in cludes all firms spanning broader range of sizes secondly the differe nces reflect range of add itional factors including the prospect that foreign firms which invest in the united states likely are large firms with proven technologies or technique s they have successfully tran sferred to the united states small foreign ventures expe rimenting with unproven technol ogies are unlikely to want the added risk of investing overseas foreign investors also tend to opt for larger scale and higher capitalintensity plants than the average us firm to offset the risks inherent in investing abroad and to generate higher profits to make it economical to manage an operation far removed fro m the parent firm conclusions foreign direct investment in the united st ates in 2005 rose slightly but still equaled far less than the record amount recorded in 2000 other countries have experienced similar turnaround in foreign dir ect investment inflows esp ecially to some of the less developed economies where there is great potential for investment as the rate of growth of the us economy rises interest rates stay low and the rate of price inflation stays in check foreign direct investment in the united states likely will continue the rebound of particular importance will be public concerns over foreign direct investment in the economy as whole and on the overa ll phenomenon referred to as globalization with its impact on jobs in the economy cerns over foreign direct investment where they exist stem not so much from the perceived potential losses of international competitiveness that characterized similar concerns in the 1980s but from potential job losses that could result from mergers and ac quisitions although such losses could occur whether the acquiring company is foreign or usowned such concerns are offset at least in part by the benefits that are percei ved to be derived from the inflow of capital and the potential for new jobs being created in local areas although job security is an important public issue oppos ition to some types of foreign direct investment stem from concerns about the impact of such investment on us economic and security interests particularly in light of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the us ec onomy however remains prime destination for foreign direct investment as the pace of economic growth in the nation increases relative to that of foreign economies foreign direct investment likely will increase as new investments are attracted to the united states and existing firms are encouraged to reinvest profits in their us operations
