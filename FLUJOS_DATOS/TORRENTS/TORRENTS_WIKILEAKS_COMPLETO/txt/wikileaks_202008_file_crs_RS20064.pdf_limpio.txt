and appendices found in the more detailed presentation section 801 of the omnibus appropriations law proposal originally offered b congressmen mcdade and murtha and passed in october of 1998 pl 105277 requires federal prosecutors to follow state and federal rules of professional ethics i n effect in the states where they conduct their activiti it also continues in place the sixty year old directive that federal prosecutors follow the ethics rules promulgated by th states in which they are licensed to practice proponents claim the change will confirm that federal prosecutors must follow the same ethical rules as other lawyers and wil l enhance the prospect of some protection against wayward federal prosecutors opponents charge that it will implicitly undermine the attorney generals authority t preempt state laws that flict with federal law enforcement interests and that in doing so it will jeopardize the use of undercover techniques against terrorists drug kingpin s and child predators section 801 section 801 of pl 105277 declares that an attorney for the government shall be subject to state laws and rules and local federal court rules governing attorneys i n each state where such attorney engages in that attorneys duties to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that state the phrase attorneys for the government is defined to include only justic department attorneys and those exercising federal litigation authority including federa l independent counsel the attorney general is empowered to promulgate the regulations necessar to implement the statutes instructions the sections provisions becom effective six months after the date of enactment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20064crs2 elsewher the appropriations law reminds the department of the justice that it s attorneys must comply with the ethical standards of the state bars to which they ar admitted legislative background section 801 is remnant of concerns that extend back to the 101st congress when the house government operations committee recommended among other things thorough examination of the ethic rules pplicable to department attorneys and expressed concern over the problems inherent in any system of selfpolicing and regulation hrept 101986 at 35 1990 the issue lay dormant until the 104th congress when representative mcdad introduced bill using essentially the same language as the recently passed section 801 the house judiciary courts and intellectual property subcommittee held hearings bu t congress took other action congressman mcdade reintroduced the measure early in the 105th congress hr 232 he and congressman murtha offered second measure the citizens protection act hr 3396 which identified various forms of punishable conduct and established misconduct review boar d to ensure enforcement of basic ethical standards there were committee hearings held nor reports issued on either bill but the hous appropri ations committee incorporated the citizens protection act into its omnibu s appropr iations measure hr 4276 the committees report tersely explained that th portion of the bill which was eventually enacted was designed to confirm that th attorney general did not have the authority to exempt department attorneys from th ethical standards t which other attorneys were held the senate version of the measure had similar provision the conference committee for the appropriations package s tripped out the punishable conduct and review board sections leaving section 801 to be passed with the rest of the compromise bill senators hatch and leahy the chairman and ranking minority member the senate judiciary committee greeted ction 801s passage with dismay and expressed the hope that it would amended prior to becoming effective during floor debate on the amendment to strike the citizens protection act from the appropriations package several members of the house spoke from personal experience of both specific instances and of general patterns of prosecutorial misconduct thei r disclosures often ended with exasperated observations about the ineffectiveness f existing preventive and remedial measures they were met by proponents of th amendment who cautioned against overreaction and the dangers of subjecting federal law enforcement interests to state regulatory authority httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20064crs3 apparent points of disagreement while single source in the legislative background supplies full explanation r even full identification f the issues reflected in section 801 the legislative record taken as whole reveals the positions of proponents and opponents proponents maintain there are instances of federal prosecutorial abuse traditional checks on federal prosecutorial abuse have eroded the courts have been increasingly reluctant to use thei r supervisory powers to prevent or correct prosecutorial abuse the check once afforded b scarce resources longer applies the incentives for abuse have become more attractiv the judicial remedies available for prosecutorial abuse retrial are costl and do little to discourage or punish overzealous prosecutors the department of just ices system of self discipline has not been effective the disciplinary mechanisms available for enforcement of standards f conduct fo r the legal profession offer an impartial means of deterring and punishing prosecutorial abuse the disciplinary mechanisms are more effective if they can be invoke d where the abuse occurs rather than where the prosecutor is admitted t practice the attorney general lacks authority claimed by the justice departmen t to waive the ethical standards to which fe deral prosecutors must otherwise adhere the enforcement of standards of professional conduct poses threat t effective federal law enforcement should such threat develop th appropriate response is federal legislation critics contend there are few instances of federal prosecutorial abuse charges of prosecutorial abuse are the work defense lawyers attempting to encumber effective law enforcement the justice department s an effective internal means of dealing with any wayward federal prosecutors federal prosecutors have and will continue to observe the highes t standards of professional cond uct but under the guise of ethical standards policy determinations in conflict with existing federal policies state s have introduced into the rules iehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20064crs4 contact rules that hamstring undercover and other legitimat investigative techniques requiring the disclosure of
