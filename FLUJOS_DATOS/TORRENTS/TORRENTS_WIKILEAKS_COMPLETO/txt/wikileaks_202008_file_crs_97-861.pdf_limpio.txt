linked to worker rights provisions in major way its companion side agreement the north american agreement on labor cooperati on naalc which rhymes with talc went into effect with nafta on january 1 1994 the naalc agreement is broad in that nafta signatories agree to enforce their own labor laws and standards while promoting 11 worker rights principles over the long run however under naalc sanctions as an enforcement tool are applicable to only three of the 11 labor principles pertaining to minimum wages child labor and occupational safety and health and are not applicable to three ba sic rights the right to organize bargain collectively and strike naalc and nafta were ne gotiated by the adminis tration and approved by congress under presidential fasttrack au thority without amendment and with limited debate this aut hority which expired in 1994 was included in the omnibus trade and competitiveness act octa of 1988 it encouraged the birth of document such as naalc when it

agreement nafta between the united states mexico and canada went into ffect january 1 1994 with it was the first labor side agreement ever attached to trade agreement this marked the first time that worker rights considerations were ever linked to trade agreement in more than just passing manner the 43page document was called the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc1 naalc and nafta were negotiated under fasttrack authority which congress had given to the president under the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 this authority also c ontained streamlined procedures for congressional consideration of negotiated trade agreement prohibited amendments and limited debate the ne gotiation of naalc was suppor ted by specific language in the 1988 trade act section 1101 identified as principal negotiating objective in trade agreements to promote respect for worker rights presidential fasttrack authority to ne gotiate trade agreements expired in 1994 the 105th congre ss reported two bills to extend this authority which also would have limited somewhat the authority of the president to include worker rights and environmental provisions in future trad agreements this crs report includes an analysis of worker rights provisions in the administrations fasttrack proposals reported on october 8 and october 23 19972 this report also compares provisions

efficiently than its partner does thus these are the goods it is likely to exportthe worker rights and fasttrack controversy the workerrights and fastt rack controversy reflects the concerns of two sets of constituents one set could include some corporations especially multinational corporations they could argue that fa sttrack reauthorization which mandates the promotion of respect for worker rights provisions through trade agreements might hamper their ability to tap the natural comparative advantage3 of lowwage labor abundant countries in producing labori ntensive goods and thereby compete successfully in the international market place into this group could also fall consumers looking for lowerpriced goods and services both groups could want fasttrack provisions which somehow limit the negotiation of labor provisions connected with trade agreements on the other side are some representa tives of organized labor who argue that by promoting worker rights the united stat serves humanitarian objectives they also argue that worker rights provisions linked to trade agreements could offer us workers at least some shelter against competition based on lower wages and lack of worker rights in developing countries these proponents tend to want fasttrack to include broad authority to negotiate strong bor provisions in trade agreements some economists tend to see the worker rights and trade arguments described above as debate over protec tionism vs free trade that is imposing worker rights destroys the basis for trade in these count ries and generally dampens income growth and economic development they point out that as nations develop economically and production rises they tend to adopt worker rights protections as workers shift their focus and their demands from merely wage s and holding job to broader concerns over the quality of their work environment others counter that worker rights adop tion in developing countries is hampered because workers around the globe are conve rging into common labor pool as result workers in any one developing count ry may not approach full employment and thereby have some bargaining power against multinational corporations until some time in the distant future this is because production operations can be easily relocated to country with lower wages and lower standards therefore worker rights advocates argue deve loping countries need to ve labor sta ndards provided for them trade agreements are good vehi cles for promoting these standards the worker rights debate so far has been based largely on theoretical arguments because naalc is the first labor side agr eement it is both an experiment and prototype it provides an early opportun ity to see the benefits and drawbacks of linking worker rights provisions to trade agreements and to evaluate the specific way in which they are linked the purpose of this report therefore is to examine seven years of experience under naalc for insights into the worker rightsandtrade agreement issue whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs3 4 naalc is not included in the 3 755page twovolume set of congressional documents which contain nafta and

workerrights debate and examines practical questions the two main groups of constituents are asking who are the winners and losers from trade liberalization both in general and with mexico how do worker rights requirements in gene ral change that equation what have been the effects of naalc as vehicle fo r worker rights provisions does naalc improve the efficiency and welfare gains to the us economy or does it diminish them what have been naalcs benefits to workers so far the structure that naalc created as first effort to link worker rights and trade agreements naalc is essentially noninva sive way of promoting worker rights4 it is noninvasive in that it does not require any country to adopt an new worker rights laws or conform to any international standards only to enforce what it already has on the books naalc is at the same time both broad and relatively weak the breadth of naalc is in the number of labor principles it includes that each country agrees to promote naalc includes more than ju st the five worker rights principles incorporated into us trade laws or the six worker rights principles identified as core labor standards by the international labour organization ilo it includes all of the above plus two other rights w orkers compensation and migrant worker protection these principl are listed in figure 15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs4 5

enforceable by sanctions if country does not selfenforce the enforceable principles are listed in group iii in figure 1 those in group i are subject only to discussions among naalc partners and those in group ii may be addressed in addition by reco mmendations from an outside committee of experts the road to sanctions against country that does not enforce its own labor laws is long one it can take

obtains ruling from an independent expert selected by the ministerial council that th matter is not trade related or is not covered by mutuallyrecognized labor laws 9 the ap does not issue the sanctions itself rather it makes findings as to implementation or the lack of it which brings into play the complaining partys right under naalc to suspend benefits against the other party article 41 of naalcthe procedure is that an observer may bring complaint called submission to the national administrative office nao in his or her own country6 see figure 2 showing the organizational stru cture established by naalc called the commission on labor cooperation commission each country has an nao headed by secretary and located in its labor department each nao has its own rules on who may file submissions7 naos may consult with each other and hold hearings if the issue cannot be resolv ed by cooperative consultation at the nao level it may be addre ssed by labor ministers involved in the

the history of trade agreements at the same time this existence can be viewed from four perspectives it is an accomplishment to so it falls short of the original plan to others it is signal of alarm to third group and is considered unnecessary by fourth group as an accomplishment naalc promotes international engagement in labor rights and standards on an unprecedented scale11 it is first acknowledgement that workers making goods for export are intimate ly connected with the products that are traded and some would say pawns in the process yet to others naalc falls short of the original plan they argue that naalc does not go nearly far enough in protecting workers if workers were granted status equal to that of the goods they produce the worker rights provisions would be in nafta and enforceable under it the possi bility would exist for the termination of nafta benefits or expulsion from nafta12 instead naalc is only attached to nafta in side agreement maximum disciplinary action is suspension of portion of nafta benefits for one year still others view naalc with alarm they argue that it is like foot in the door it impinges on the freedom of mu ltinational corporations to

voluntary basis and needs assistance in this matter naalc promoter of wor ker rights an d preserver of sovereignty beyond the controversial fact that naalc ex ists at all it can be viewed as vehicle that at the same time both promotes worker rights and preserves sovereignty herein lies another area of controversy naalc promotes worker rights by creating system of mutual obligation and mutual responsibility all countries agree to promote and comply with their own laws relating to the 11 labor principles mutual accountability is enhanced by the fact that there are three parties to naalc and therefore there will likely be majority opinion even if the most powerful tool s available are cooperative consultation among the nafta partners and moral suasion yet when mutual accountability breaks down as it is apt to do from time to time naalcs critics find fault with naalcs enforcement mechanism the fact that not all labor principles under naalc ar equally enforceable has been identified as naalcs fatal flaw13 in that the three most basic of all labor rights to organize bargain collectively and strike are the least enforceable of the 11 labor standards they are subject only to two different levels of cooperative consultation among the three nafta partnersconsu ltation among the naos and consultation among the labor ministers14 all labor principles some argue should be subject to consultations evaluati ons and arbitrations15 naalc preserves sovereignty in severa l ways first it does not require harmonization that the same body of standards apply in all three nafta countries under naalc each country mainta ins its freedom to adopt its own labor laws and standards and enforce them as it sees fit if country does not support labor principle by already having or by adopting and then enforcing national labor law or standard upholding that principle compliant may be brought against it for failure to offer such protections to its workers second naalc preser ves sovereignty by its enforcement mechanism cooperative consultation is the primary way of settling disputes country can be compelled to enforce its own labor laws and standards when

an amount sufficient to collect any previously imposed monetary penalty article 412 if country uses as its measure suspension of nafta tariff benefits it ca n not raise the duty beyond either the most favored nation mfn rate or the prenafta rate whichever is lower in any event the country cannot collect more money than the assessment annex 41bmechanisms of naalc are taken to the limit sanctions are restricted by their attachment to only few standards and monetary penalties are restricted to percentage of goods traded for the most recent year while repeated submissions can be brought against any country that exhib its patterns of nonenforcement there is international court system some observers find fault with naalc s preservation of sovereignty in particular they see as major weakness th lack of harmonization they argue that as an alternative to harmonization of standards entities that do businesses in two or more nafta countries should be held res ponsible for meeting certain standards in all operations such standards they argu could be embodied in corporate code of conduct modeled on the c odes already recognized by the united states canada and mexico in two documents the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises and the ilo tripartite declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy promoters of this position argue th at adherence to the code could be reinforced by an annual labor informati on audit which includes specific inspection of such things as terms and c onditions of employment and wages16 naalcs enforcement mechanism beyond the controversy over promoting work er rights vs preserving individual sovereignty third level of conflict exists over the details of the enforcement mechanism in naalc penalties are one ar ea of enforcement controversy hearings procedures are another penalties under naalc are characterized as low by some and as high by others who argue that naalc should not incl ude penalties those who want to raise penalties have offered suggestions about how to do so one suggestion is to include penalty for anyone offering to waive naalc principle to induce or retain an investment another suggestion is to estab lish an arbitral disputes panel to prevent the importation into any naalc nation of goods produced with exploitative child labor slave or forced labor or by unhealthy processes third suggestion is to raise the penalty limits for any country not complying with its own labor laws17 the hearings process is characterized by required steps and time limits while some see these steps as way to enc ourage compliance with naalc others seehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs11 18 milanovic op cit p 3842 19 local labor board denied

the number of submissions cases that can be processed by the small staff of the various bodies established under naalc s administrative structure final group suggests requiring that hearings be held at convenient site for affected workers ie within the same country as and reasonable distance from the relevant plant18 naalcs results between january 1 1994 when naalc first went into effect and september 6 2000 23 submissions were filed these include 14 allegations against mexico two against canada and 7 against the united states most of the allegations against mexico were for failure to uphold mexican ws giving workers the right to organize and bargain collectively others concerned the illegal use of child labor pregnancy based gender discriminati on minimum employment sta ndards and occupational safety and health the ones against the united states typically involve mexican workers such as migrant workers and i ssues such as freedom of association protection of migrant workers various wo rker standards and safety and health two accomplishments in particular stand out above the others some might say surprisingly first in one case naalc has encouraged mexico to begin enforcing its own labor law permitting workers the right to organize and bargain collectively this came about primarily thr ough sunshine prescribed under the naalc dispute resolution process and against the predictions of many observers19 second major result from naalc so far has been the creation of labor communications superhighway connectin g the three nafta partners before nafta went into

to lesser extent by the bureau of labor statistics an administration report evaluating nafta after three years as required by nafta identified other related acco mplishments under naalc the naalc

after nafta was signed suggesting greater enforcement of its worker rights standards relating to occupational safety and health20 putting naalc findings into the fasttrack debate experience under naalc is important in th fast track debate because it offers lessons from actual events two key insigh ts to be gained from three years under naalc that are applicable to the current debate are these first experience under naalc has shown that openended fa sttrack language endorsing worker rights as pr incipal negotiating objective does not necessarily result in strong labor side agreement that incorporates many sanctions the shape of the worker rights provisions depends little on the language in the original fast track provision provisions in labor si agreement depend on what the specific parties to the trade agreement involved t hus the argument could be made that the shape of worker rights provisions in trade agreement appears to depend much more on what trading partners are willing to ag ree on and very little on the scope of the original fasttrack authority for example when the united stat and canada ne gotiated naalc with mexico the fact that sanctions on key worker rights provisions the right to organize bargain collectively and strike were omitted resulted from the unique identity of the nafta partners and from the resistance of mexico in particular as developing country in general developing countries have been resistant to the idea of linking worker rights provisions and trade agreements this position was made clear at the world trade organization december 1996 singapore ministerial when trade ministers from the more than 110 member countries met to discuss trade issues at that meeting developing countries blocked the formation of group to even study the issue of linking worker rights to trade second side agreement ba sed primarily on c ooperation rather than sanctions can have some effect on promoting adheren ce to worker rights this became evident when mexico finally recognized single union after repeated submissions alleged mexicos failure to grant workers the right to organize referred to abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs13 21 in

produ cers and their employees who formerly produced goods and services which can be more effici ently produced and imported by the developing country partner some small mexican grain farmers for example have lost under nafta to mexican imports of effici ently produced american cornother questions also remain about th effects of including worker rights provisions in trade agreements negotiated under fasttrack language who are the winners and losers generally from trade liberalization how do worker rights provisions in trade agreements change this equation who are the winners and losers under naalc it should be emphasized that the term s winners and losers group various entities into artificial categories in reality winners and losers fall along continuum which includes all combinations between two extremes the discussion below concentrates on salient winners and losers without trying to calculate exactly where they might fall along the spectrum nd without identifying those in the large middle section who are the winners and losers from trade liberalization in general winners from liberalized trade include the overall economies of all countries to the trade agreement this is because trade liberalization improves economic efficiency each country ex ports those goods and services it produces most efficiently and imports those which it produces least efficiently the result is lower costs for consumers but sectoral production shifts along the way may leave in their wake mix of winners and losers trade agreements between developed and developing countries tend to result in three groups of winners for the developed country see figure 4 part i21 the first group typically consists of is higherskill highertech businesses that produce given good or service relatively more efficiently and therefore more cheaply than their developing country trading partners can produce it these are the exporters the second group is laborintensive businesses that relocate to the developing country to save on production costs theoretica lly such businesses could produce in the developing country for both domestic cons umption and for export the third group is domestic businesses which use impor ts from the developing country as components in their production processes losers in the developed country from trade liberalization with developing country on the other hand are often labor intensive lowwage importcompeting busin esses and their workers these groups would loose market share from cheaper importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs14 figure 4 winners and losers in developed country under three conditions of trade with developing country winners losers i potential effects of trade liberalization example naftahigherskill highertech businesses could benefit from reduced trade barriers laborintensive lower wage importcompeting businesses could lose from reduced protections tariffs on competing imports labor intensive businesses that relocate to the country of the trading partner could benefit by reducing production costsworkers in import competing businesses could lose if their businesses close or relocate domestic businesses which use imports as components into the production process may save on production costs ii potential effects of trade liberalization modified by worker rights adherenceadherence to worker rights requirements could raise foreign labor costs slightly making us imports more competitive consequently workers in importcompeting businesses could be under less pressure to either give back wages or have their worker rights protections threatenedon the other hand some multinational corporations wanting to relocate to the developing country to save on labor costs could be discouraged from doing so because worker rights adherence could increase their production costs iii reallife example effects of trade liberalization ie nafta modified by worker rights adherence under naalcnaalcs worker rights effects so far have been sufficiently mild that the end result is more like winners and losers from trade liberalization i above than trade liberalization modified by worker rights adherence ii above httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs15 22 the two recent studies tried to look at the extent to which adherence to worker rights affected not winners and losers specifically but four components of trade in general economic efficiency comparative advantage foreign direct investment and labor costs andor wages one study was undertaken by the oecd an organization that represents mostly developed countries it looked only at the impact on trade of two worker rights provisions for which data for 75 countries we re sufficient freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining the other study was undertaken by the overseas development council odc an organization that focuses on developing countries it included broad range of measures of wo rker rights adherence in 133 countries while the studies generally found little evidence that adherence to worker rights provisions significantly affects any of the above four traderelated measures one study did find one effect the odc found based on about 35 c ountries for which labor cost data were available fairly strong results linking the re lationship between worker rights provisions and labor costs it found that labor costs tend to increase as labor standards become more stringent as correlative the odc study also found that percapita income was higher where labor standards become more stringent without designating eith er percapita income or labor standards as the cause and the other as the effect 23 it is possible that congress could permit the president to include worker rights provisions in trade agreements but make them applicable only to matters that are traderelated while this term has precise definition it could incl ude such employment situations as workers producing for trade workers whose products compete with imports and workers producing domestically in businesses established andor supported by foreign investmenthow does the equation chan ge when worker rights protections are added how do worker rights provisions in tr ade agreement again with developing country change the winnerloser equation at least one study has found that worker rights adherence may raise labor costs22 two recent studies looked at the extent to which adherence to worker rights provisi ons affected winners and losers worker rights provisions which result in worker ri ghts adherence by the developing country could dampen the gains of the winners and lessen the losses of the losers in the developed country trading part ner ie the united states details of how this works are spelled out in figure 4 part ii how does the scope of preside ntial fasttrack negotiating authority affect the picture how does the scope of presidential fasttrack negotiating authority change the picture renewed fasttrack authority could grant the president either broad open ended authority to include worker rights provisions or narrow authority to include worker rights provisions in matters that are traderelated23 or renewed authority could prohibit worker rights provisions in trade agreements altogether or some variant of the above one argument for restricted presidential authority is that fasttrack procedures are not intended to be used to implement general policy goals that are not directly related to trade another argument for restricted authority is that worker rights policies could interfere with benefits of lib eralized trade as disguised form ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs16 24 these arguments were taken from trade agreements authority act of 1995 report to accompany hr 2371 hrept 104285 oct 20 1995 p 12 25 ibid p 2829 26 workers producing for the maquiladora xport sector have traditionally earned wages which were substantially higher than those for workers producing for domestic consumption 27 levinson jerome op cit p 4protectionism they could decrease us mark et opportunities for its exports or distort or impede us exports or imports24 the argument for broad authority is that it is tried and true formula had bipartisan support and allowe d the content of trade agreements to be determined on casebycase basis reflecting the circumstances at the time25 most likely winners and losers in the united states could be the same under both broad and narrow scenarios because u s businesses are affected primarily by what goes on in the trade sector of the partner country26 if worker rights provisions are excluded from trade agreements altogether winners and losers would remain the same as under liberaliz ed trade generally how has naalc affected the mix of winners and losers from nafta naalcs worker rights effects so far ve been mild since they have had very little effect on promoting mexican enforcement of its own worker rights laws therefore the end result from naalc is lis t of winners and losers that looks more like those from trade liberalization figu re 4 part i above than from trade liberalization modified by worker ri ghts adherence figure 4 part ii naalc appears to have offered very little protection for us workers in importcompeting businesses from employ ers who either relocate or close down over the long run however naalc may impr ove the lives of mexican workers and may be able to help low skilled us workers who produce goods that compete with imports from mexico many people argue th at these are worthy goals and that if naalc contributes to them the benefits outweigh the costs to put the naftaandfasttrack debate into larger perspective the basic argument for including worker rights provisions in trade agreements is that this linkage offers workers at least some level of protection from large multinational corporations some argue that the vel of protection ffered under naalc is not enough worker rights are only one aspect of the overall problem in redefining the international trade and investment regime to restore some of the balance between the power of workers and management yet they have been asked to carry disproportionate part of the burden of that redefinition27 others counter that protection offere d under naalc goes too far some of these argue that worker rights provisions really do not belong in trade agreement at all they argue that worker rights provisions should not be included in tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97861crs17 28 hrept 101285 op cit p 12agreements because they are ultimately used for protectionist not tradeliberalizing purposes others argue that while th congress has the power to negotiate agreements on worker rights congress s hould implement such an agreement under normal not fasttrack c onsideration thus the house ways and means committee report on the fasttrack reauthoriza tion bill from the 104th congress included language which read fasttrack proce dures are not intended to be used to implement other more general policy goals28 fasttrack proposals the issue of whether or not to pass new fasttrack legislation has been focus of the 107th congress while relatively quiet during the 106th congress it was major issue during the 105th 1997 house and senatereported fasttrack reauthorization bills on october 8 1997 the senate fi nance committee and on

previous fasttrack language in the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 presidential authority to incl ude worker rights provisions in trade agreements negotiated on fasttrack basi s was openended and not subject to any limitations in part the 1988 act identified as princi pal negotiating objective for any trade agreements negotiated on fasttrack basis simply to promote respect for worker rights in contrast to this broad authority both house and senate bills sharply limited presidential authority to include worker rights provisions in trade agreements negotiated under fasttra ck procedures they did this by setting up three sets of negotiating objectives however while two of these sets principal negotiating objectives and internationa l economic policy objectives included references to worker rights only the narrowlyprescribed principal negotiating objectives were to be included in trade agreements imp lemented under fasttrack procedures principal negotiating

httpwwwustrgovregionseumedmiddleeastusjordanftashtmlthe house bill contained additional restri ctions beyond those in the senate bill among other things it limited worker rights provisions in trade

worker rights but was excluded from fasttrack procedures both bills iden tified as an interna tional economic policy objective to promote respect for worker rights through the international labor organization ilo the effect was to restrict fasttrack procedures to implementing labor provisions identified in principal negotiating objectives29 other labor agreements requiring congre ssional implementation would ve had to be considered under normal legislative procedures as would all labor agreements if fasttrack were not extended limitations on fasttrack procedure are major issue for congressional debate some argue that the limitations streamline trade agreements by focusing them on traditional trade issues such limitations they maintain are necessary to prevent the use of labor standards as barriers to trade moreove r they permit economies to develop naturally on the basis of their own comparative advantage rather than potentially stunting their growth by imposing worker rights requirements on them as they are struggling to grow many of those who oppose the limitation like representative gephardt argue that provisions in both the house and senate bills would have validated the status quo rather than being force for progre ss progress would have been met if people and the environment were given the same protections and enforcement in trade treaties as copyrights including and enforcing worker rights protections would have helped to create more of consuming class more people would have been able to buy more us products co mpanies would not have continued to chase low wages exporting jobs overseas simply to reduce production costs this might have helped to halt the wideni ng income gap between winners and losers that is being observed in many

major companies released report calling anew for fasttrack r eauthorization and suggesting compromise solution the br t argued that the united states was falling behind other countries in trade lead

two ways internationally recognized worker rights or core labor standards internationally recognized worker rights typica lly referenced in us trade laws and trade agreements are defined in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended by sec 503 of pl 98573 as 1 the right of association 2 the right to organize and bargain collectively 3 prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor 4 minimum age for the employment of children and 5 acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages hours of work and occupational safety and health core labor standards are defined slightly differently by the international labor organization ilo they substitute for 5 above freedom from employment discrimination confusing terms for worker rights in hr 3005 and hr 3019 hr 3005 and hr 3019 do not adhere strictly to the above definitions of worker rights which leads to some confusion hr 3005 refers to its standards as core labor standards but defines them with the listof internationally recognized worker rights above hr 3019 on the other hand calls worker rights by four different names for multilateral trade agreements negotiated within the world trade organization wto uses three terms to describe worker rights core internationally recognized labor standards internationally recognized worker rights and int ernationally recognized core labor standards and defines

constitution are technical assistance consultation recordkeeping and persuasion hr 3019s principal negotiating objec tives for an ftaa agreement differ considerably from its objectives for wto trade agreements instead of delegating promotion and enforcement of worker rights to the wto and the ilo institutions hr 3019 would seek to include strict forcement guidelines in the ftaa itself which could take worker rights promoti on and enforcement to new level beyond nafta and the usjordan fta by 1 including in an ftaa enforceable rules for the adoption and enforcement of core bor standards although each country would have the right to establish its own domestic labor standards consistent with core labor standards 2 providing for phasedin co mpliance with labor market standards for leastdeveloped

democrats argued that tp would not get to the floor without an expansion of the taa program this program provides fina ncial and technical assistance to workers and firms to help them adjust to import competition the white house proposal offered to the senate finance committee on march 19 2002 differed on two key issues from s 1209 whos provisions are detailed below first it excluded taa benefits for secondary workers and farmers although the administration more recently has indicated it will support this proposal second disagreement remained over the democrats proposal to provide health insurance benefits to taa beneficiar ies republican opponents argued that this would amount to creating massive new federal titlement program according to the washington trade daily april 10 2002 s

of 2002 to the senate finance committee one of two elements of s 1209 attracting the most discussion was that s 1209 would have combined the old taa and naftataa programs and expanded both to reach three new groups these groups are all workers who lose their jobs because thei r plants relocate to foreign countries both the taa and naftataa programs have traditionally covered workers who lose their jobs because of increased imports but only the naftataa program has also covered workers who lose their jobs because of shift in production abroad b secondary workers whose job loss is dependent on the job loss of workers directly affected by trade and c several groups of workers not previously covered by taa legislation this third group includes farmers fisherme n taconite workers and those engaged in exploration or drilling for oil or natural gas the congressional budget office cbo estimates that these changes woul d nearly double the taa caseload the provision covering secondary workers woul d make up about thr eefourths of the increase in caseload covering shifts in production would ma ke up about onefifth of the increase8 the second controversial element of s 1209 was the inclusion of premium assistance for health care coverage for t aa recipients the proposed subsidy would have paid 70 of health insurance premiums for eligible workers and temporary medicaid insurance for certain uninsured individuals adjusting downward from cbos earlier estimates for high er coverage this could result in an estimated budget outlay in 2003 of 244 million the adminis trations

primarily on two key issues one is differing house and senate versi ons of provision requiring labor rights reports the other issue see below invol ved whether or not to amend hr 3005 in the senate by attaching or linking provisions of s 1209 which would renew expand and reform the trade adju stment assistance taa program labor rights report on the first issue the labor rights report the senate bill would require much more indepth report than the house the house bill requires that the president submit to congress report showing for any new trade agreement the extent to which countries currently have in effect laws governing exploitative child labor the senate bill in contrast requires that the president submit to the house ways and means and senate finance committees meaningful
