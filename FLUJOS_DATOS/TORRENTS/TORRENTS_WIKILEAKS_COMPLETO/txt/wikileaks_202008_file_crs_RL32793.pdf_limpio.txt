administrative staff employment decisions house administration guidelines repor tedly also recommend provision of one third of committee funds for equipment tr avel and supplies to the minority some ranking minority members testifying at the hearing raised concerns that while those funds are generally available to the nority in most committees ranking members do not control the funds and must seek approval from committee chairs in their testimony some committee chairs noted that minority requests for travel supplies and other funds are routinely granted and that under the rules of the house committee chairs are solely responsible for all committee funds all members who testified seemed to agree that while some disparities among committees on the allocation to the minority of travel funds and office equipment may still exist despite house administration guidelines since the 103rd congress the minority party has been treated more equitably than before in the allocation of house committee staff and resources4 typically following the hearings on committee funding requests the chair of the house administration committee then in troduces an omnibus funding resolution which after

appropriated funds indivi dual committee requests are then packaged by the house administration committee into an omni bus primary expense resolution clause 6c requires that the minority party be treated fairly in the appointment of committee staff employed pursuant to such expense resolutions prior to the 104th congress house rules provided base level of 30 socalled statutory staff positions for all house standing committees except the appropriations committee funds for these staff were provided through lineitem appropriation and were not included in the funding resolutions reported from the house administration committee in the 104th congress house rules were changed to 1 provide for biennial committee fundi ng resolutions and 2 include funding authorization for the baseline 30 sta ff positions in each committees fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32793crs4 7 as before these provisions were not made applicable to the house appropriations committeeauthorization7 twenty of these positions are allotted to the committee majority and 10 to the committee minority the house majority leadership has encouraged its committee leaders to move as quickly as possible to provide the minority with one third of the remaining committee staff and resources authorized in the biennial funding resolutions statements made by leaders of the house administration committee at the beginning of its committee funding review for the 107th congress and reaffirmed at the beginning of the 108th and 109th congresses indicate general consensus that all house committees should provide at least onethird minority staffing this congress each committee is encouraged to discu ss its proposed budget and approve it at committee organization meeting some committees however do not prepare or approve their draft budgets this way each committee chair normally introduces house resolution to provide his or her co mmittee with the requisite funds for the two years of the congress these individual re solutions are then referred to the house administration committee which holds public hearings on each committees request the chair and the ranking minority member from each committee normally testify at these hearings the committ ee held hearings on march 10 and 16 2005 and received the testimony of committee chairs and ranking minority members the chair of the house administrati on committee then typically introduces an omnibus funding resolution which after its referral to the house administration committee has served as the legislativ vehicle for full committee markup the chairmans resolution usually incorporat without change the amounts requested by each committee the house normally acts on committee funding resolutions during the last week of march in the first year of c ongress the committee funding resolution is normally called up as privilege d business under the rules of the house allowing it to be called up and considered without th need for special rule from the rules committee privileged funding resolutions are considered in the house under the onehour rule and typically the majority party manager does not yield the floor to permit amendments to be offered the committeereported amendment is automatically laid before the house at the end of one hour of debate the majority party manager moves the previous question nd if agreed to the house votes on final passage of the resolution before the vot on final passage it has become customary for the minority party to offer motion to recommit the funding resolution this motion normally permits the minority to offe r an alternative funding proposal and to obtain house vote on it owing to the bipartisan consensus on the funding resolution in the past three congresses h ouse democrats did not offer such motion in 2005 2003 or 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32793 crs5 table 1 house committee funding requests and amounts authorized by the house 109th congress committee request 1st session 2nd session
