texas twentynine states and the district of columbia had average uninsured rates for children of less than 100 six states arizona fl orida mississippi neva da new mexico and texas had rates of 15 or more generally states with the lowest average uninsured rates for children were located in the midwest and northeast states with the highest rates were in south and west figure 1

h ealth insurance program schip and other governmentprovided health insurance as well as coverage related to employment in the military 4 statistical significance was tested at the 95 confidence level also referred to as the 5 significance level this means that one can be 95 certain that the difference between states uninsured rate and the national rate is not zero ie the states rate is statistically higher or lower or could be zero ie the states rate is not statistically different 5 their uninsured rates are statistically lower than the national rate and are not statistically different from each other 6 because the supplement is now fielded from fe bruary through april it has been officially renamed the annual social and economic supplemen t asec to the cps though many analysts continue to refer to it by its traditional nametable 1 provides private health insurance2 public health insurance3 and uninsured estimates with percentage rankings for children by state the right side of the table indicates whether states threeyear average uninsured rate for children is statistically lower shown with statistically higher shown with or not statistically different shown with x th an the national rate of 1154 both private and public health insurance affect states uninsured rate for example as shown in table 1 maine and new hampshire have similarly low uninsured rates5 however new hampshire has the highest threeyear average private coverage rate for children in the country 814 and the thirdlo west public coverage ra 181 on the other hand maine has much lower threeyear average private coverage rate for children 673 and public coverage rate 360 that is roughly double that of new hampshire thus even though there are diffe rences regarding whether children in maine and new hampshire obtain private or public hea lth insurance the impact is that both have similarly low threeyear average uninsured rates estimates with 95 confidence intervals the estimates in this report are based on data from the march 2006 2007 nd 2008 supplements to the current population survey cps6 the cps is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized population and is designed to produce reliable timates at the national regional and state levels the small sample sizes available from the cps for many states especially when examining subset of the sample such as children under the age of 19 make it prudent to use threeyear average and consider statelevel estimates in terms of range of values like table 1 table 2 shows the best point estimates or single values for the average number and percentage of child ren covered and not covered by health insurance the table also reports range of values the 95 confidence interval for these estimates the larger the confidence interval in relation to the size of the estimate the less reliable the estimate the size of the range depends primarily on the sample size 95 confidence interval means that if repeated samples were collected under essentially the same conditions and their confidence interval s calculated in the long run about 95 of those intervals would contain the true num ber of children with or without health insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97310crs3 reasons for differences in the percentage uninsured figure 1 indicates that children under age 19 in the south and west are more likely to lack health insurance and that those in the midwest and new england are more likely to be covered various ch aracteristics of states popul ation may account for these differences nationwide the uninsured rate for children is related to race and ethnicity family structure and family members employment the prevalence of particular population and employer characteristics may acc ount for some of the regional or state variation in uninsured rates for children th percentage of states child population that is uninsured may also be affected by state policies such as eligibility criteria for the states medicaid program or its state child rens health insurance program schiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97310crs4 table 1 health insurance coverage estimates with rankings by state for children under age
