from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno subject re very urgent help needed to address final draft problem date fri 6 oct 2006 091104 0600 hi keith and eystein thanks for the timely and helpful very feedback keith your suggestions for 4 and 5 seem fine and i wonder only about 6 i too am not sure where the final clause came from but ill guess it was suggestion of stefans that then stood the text of time in the spirit of trying hard not to change the meaning of bullets in the from what the team agreed to in bergen what about changing this clause in the to read natural recovery ie and it is very unlikely that this warming was merely natural recovery from the pre20th century cold period this takes away the ambiguity and does serve to address widely held misconception outside of our community or at least to phrase the issue in terms that some might find more useful if we keep this phrase then i would suggest restating the entire sentence at the end of 663 is this ok again im motivated by our team agreement i do think we could delete this phrase since its more repetitive than new meaning but would rather not unless it really does not work personally i like it as modified above because it hammers the important point from slightly different perspective one that seems to be on the minds of the public still thanks both for letting know what you think fast best peck hi peck and eystein in response to points 46 4 add the following after past 1300 years on line 13 page y33 considering the recent instrumental and longer proxy evidence together it is very likely that average northern hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were warmer than any other 50year period in the last 500 years do not put anything in box 64 which is written frolm the reverse perspective evidence of medieval period not good enough to say warmer than now also confuses statements about 500 years and longer 1000 year medieval time 5 the person who says this has not read the text see lines 2833 on y32 where i think this is well covered 6 if you read the text on lines 110 of page y38 i think this meaning is clearly conveyed it is not in the same words but easily supports the statement however i do not like the last part of the statement and not sure where this came from because it is ambiguous and anyway implied by prior statement i strongly urge you to remove the section and it is very unlikely that this warming was merely recovery from the pre20th century cold period these would sort things out i believe cheers keith at 1926 05102006 you wrote hi keith and tim we just got the attached consistency feedback doc from the tsu and ive added my thoughts in red we need your feedback on items 46 really fast tim if keiths not around to help please do the job the tsu has zero time to give us i think the solutions to 5 and 6 are easy as i suggested although i dont have confirmation from susan or martin that we can just do as i suggest but it seems logical to if you can suggest an even better solution pls do ill send the official chap 6 final draft text next at least as it stands today thanks for dealing with this perhaps before you go to sleep this evening best peck jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu
