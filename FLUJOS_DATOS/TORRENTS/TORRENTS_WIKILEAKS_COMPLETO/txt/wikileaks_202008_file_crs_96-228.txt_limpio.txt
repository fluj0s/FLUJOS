specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division davisbacon employment of helpers on federal contract construction summary the davisbacon act of 1931 as amended requires that not less than the locally prevailing wage not necessarily the union rate be paid to workers engaged in contract construction work to which the government of the united states or of the district of columbia is party the coverage threshold is 2000 under davisbacon the secretary of labor makes wage rate determinations for the various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on covered work the secretary has through regulation recognized apprentices and trainees registered in formal programs as special categories and allowed special reduced wage for these workers some contractors however have created yet another category of worker ie helpers these may be informal trainees or they may simply be general utility workers employed outside of craft classification these workers are most often not recognized as separate category for wage rate determination purposes through the years the department of labor dol had rigorously adhered to this general worker classification system as necessary to assure that not less than the locally prevailing rate would be paid to the various classes of laborers and mechanics on project were helpers indiscriminately substituted for journeymen or laborers dol holds wage rates would be depressed and the intent of congress in crafting the davisbacon act would be subverted in 1979 the carter administration began general review of davisbacon including the helper issue new regulations were issued in january 1981 before they could be implemented they were withdrawn and rewritten by the reagan administration 1982 through the next decade these new davisbacon regulations were largely implemented but the helper segment remained in litigation when in 1992 following series of legal maneuvers judicial approval of the helper regulations was finally secured congress blocked their enforcement through the appropriations process variously denying funding for their implementation in mid1996 the associated builders and contractors sought court assistance to require enforcement of the helper regulation dol responded by returning to the rulemaking process subsequently dol published proposed rule april 1999 defining the concept of helpers and soliciting comment the proposed rule essentially reaffirmed departmental practice of the 1970s with respect to the use of helpers the issue had come full circle this final rule was issued by the department and took effect on january 19 2001 administrative initiatives found counterpart in legislative proposals introduced periodically up through the 109th congress such proposals have as yet been introduced in

employment of helpers on federal contract construction in 1979 following decades of increasingly vigorous argument about the davis bacon act the carter administration agreed to review and ultimately to revise the federal regulations governing administration of the statute this set in motion quartercentury of administrative rulemaking litigation legislative oversight and proposed amendment of the act the process continued through the reagan and bush administrations to the close of the clinton administration and beyond to large degree the core issues from the 1970s and 1980s associated with the davisbacon act remain controversial among these is the question of the employment of helpers on davisbacon covered federal and federallyassisted contract construction work for example how is the concept of helper to be defined for davisbacon purposes what distinguishes helper from other construction workers on davisbacon work should they be integrated into the regular construction crew should helpers receive training to enhance their skills and if so how should such training be structured how should their wage rates compare with those of other project workers these questions quickly became source of contention through more than 2 decades employment of helpers as separate category of worker on projects covered by the davisbacon act remained matter of dispute then in april 1999 the department of labor published proposed rule on the use of helpers that would essentially revert to the 1970s practice of the department so far as the use of helpers was concerned comment period on the proposal closed on june 8 1999 meanwhile legislation was introduced that would have provided statutory definition of helper but legislative action was taken under date of november 17 2000 the department issued final rule on the helper issue to take effect on january 19 2001 during the closing hours of the clinton administration in effect the final rule reaffirmed departmental practice of the 1970s the issue had come full circle although the new rule and confirmation of ongoing practice is now in place some appear to be unhappy with the outcome thus the issue may not yet be entirely resolved introductory comment speaking broadly of the construction industry helper might be viewed as general utility employee who assists more skilled or specialized construction worker normally the helper would be unskilled though in fact he or she could have wide range of skills but not having gone through formal training program crs2 would not be recognized as skilled helper could also be craftsman journeyman down on his luck and forced by economic necessity to accept general utility work below his level of training normally the helper is unlikely to be trade union member or if member not employed under collectively bargained contract he may usually be paid wage lower than that of skilled worker though for particular types of work he may perform equally as well as skilled craftsman because he is cheaper to employ and more flexible in the types of work he may be willing to accept working outside of craft he can be useful addition to work crew where manager carefully supervises the work to be done the less expensive helper can be assigned to perform narrow aspects of an otherwise complex task this process has been referred to as craft fragmentation at the worksite one might expect to find in the absence of workrules that would preclude it battery of helpers working under the guidance of more highly paid journeyman whether such an arrangement is economical in terms of productivity and quality of workmanship is subject of intense and ongoing debate an apprentice or trainee enrolled in formal program could be expected to rotate throughout the worksite receiving onthejob training and in the case of the former outside instruction as well in contrast the helper would normally receive the narrowest possible training more extensive than is absolutely required for the task at hand and in large measure the helper is regarded as temporary worker rather than permanent member of his employers crew as the davisbacon act has been implemented by the secretary of labor the department has recognized apprentices and trainees in formal programs as classification of workers for wage rate purposes it has not generally recognized the category of helper however on the assumption that to do so would undercut the locally prevailing wage structure and skills system that the davisbacon act was designed to protect helpers under davisbacon the context of the issue the davisbacon act 1931 as amended requires that the advertised specifications for construction contracts in excess of 2000 to which the government of the united states or of the district of columbia is party shall contain provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics which shall be based upon the wages that will be determined by the secretary of labor to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of character similar to the contract work in the city town village or other civil subdivision of the state in which the work is to be performed1 emphasis added congress left to the secretary the task of working out the precise manner in which the act should be applied it also left up to the secretary the responsibility for 1 see 40 usc 276a276a5 see also 29 cfr parts 1 3 5 6 and 7 the davisbacon act has now been recodified as 40 usc 31413148 crs3 defining such concepts as wages and prevailing and project of character similar and the scope of the locality in which the work was to be performed each of these concepts has been intermittently focus of contention and often of litigation of rulemaking and of congressional debate through more than 60 years2 question of definition similarly contentious has been the concept of the term helper and further whether the use of helpers has been common practice in the area in which federal construction work was to take place as with other aspects of the act congress had legislated in broad strokes the original act referred to classes of laborers and mechanics employed on public construction projects and to the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on comparable work in the nonfederal sector3 it made reference to helpers nor for that matter to trainees apprentices or other skill groups further definition if such were required was left to the secretary of labor although the act has been amended through the years it still refers only to various classes of laborers and mechanics the phrase being repeated with slight modification throughout the statute4 through the years the secretary developed such definitions as seemed appropriate and necessary the evolving regulations focused upon apprentices and trainees registered in formal training programs for example those under the supervision of the bureau of apprenticeship and training within the dol the term helper did appear in the regulations but seems to have been used casually without precise definition and with hint as to how it might be applied in wage rate determinations or at the worksite this situation prevailed up through the late 1970s5 an industry perspective business economist armand thieblot writing in 1975 observed that the davis bacon regulations were filled with words of art which must in turn be defined by way of example he pointed to the phrase classifications of laborers and mechanics and added openshop firms bidding on covered construction in predominantly union areas might find that some of their own classifications notably helpers would not be considered prevailing classifications as such therefore prevailing wages would be determined for them under such circumstances the helpers would have to be reclassified as journeymen or laborers journeymen if they use the tools of the trade 2 for an

56a2 3 revised edition of july 1 1978 see daily labor report august 14 1981 p e3 hereafter cited as dlr crs4 thieblot noted that many firms are using or would like to use semiskilled labor for uncomplicated aspects of some tasks6 but unless such workers were enrolled in formal dolapproved apprenticeship program they must be considered for pay purposes journeymen of the trade in which they are apprentices helpers he explained will be recognized for davisbacon rate purposes only in those geographic areas where the practice of employing them is prevalent enough that their classification becomes prevailing one this recognition he adds will only apply in areas where open shop firms predominate because unions rarely recognize the helper category7 trade union perspective recalling the origins of davisbacon trade unionists view dols restrictions upon employment of apprentices trainees or helpers at subcraft rates as central to congressional intent and preservation of labor standards in the building trades otherwise they note contractors seeking to undercut the prevailing wage would merely designate the workers by one of these titles and claim that since they are not fully skilled they are not entitled to the prevailing rate further they say by working his employees out of classification he the employer can undercut the prevailing wage rates that he committed himself to pay when he bid on the davis bacon covered project8 apprentices and trainees recognized as such by dol cause few problems in the view of the building and construction trades department bctd aflcio it is the informal and often imprecise titles of helper and trainee the bctd notes that have provoked conflict there is evidence that most of these trainees and helpers are anything but temporary employees who are released when their work on the project is completed dols restriction on the use of helpers strikes at one of the wagecutting devices by which nonunion contractors can achieve the advantage they need to be able more frequently to underbid union contractors on federally funded work and the bctd adds the use of helpers at subcraft wages was one of the abuses the davisbacon act was intended to remedy9 6 armand j thieblot jr the davisbacon act philadelphia the wharton school university of pennsylvania 1975 pp 2021 hereafter cited as thieblot the davis bacon act 7 thieblot the davisbacon

by the late 1970s campaign was underway for reform or repeal of davis bacon ultimately the effort would take two forms direct legislation or conversely reform through the regulatory process the former of course would require action by congress which while it had often reviewed the davisbacon act had not altered it substantially the latter regulatory reform could be undertaken unilaterally by the administration the carter administration regulations 19791981 in late december 1979 the carter administration published proposed rule revising the administration of davisbacon and among other elements adding the following language section 17d d classification and wage and fringe benefit rates will be issued only for identifiable classes of laborers and mechanics distinctions between classifications are based upon differences in the work performed not upon skill and supervisory functions semiskilled classification of laborers or helpers for example is issued when the classification as utilized in the area performs scope of duties which distinguishes it from other classifications in the area prevailing wages for apprentices and trainees are not issued on wage determinations but their use is permitted10 emphasis added thus the proposed rule would establish two tests for designation of special wage rate for helpers first that helpers are utilized in the area of the proposed work and second that the helper is distinguishable from other classifications of laborers and mechanics later the proposed rule specifically defined laborer mechanic apprentice and trainee but for whatever reason omitted any definition of helper11 in midjanuary 1981 as the carter administration was drawing to close final rule was published in an introduction dol explained its position concerning the use of helpers numerous commenters shared the opinion that the policy of permitting only employment of apprentices and trainees under bat bureau of apprenticeship and training approved programs was denying job opportunities to youths minorities and women the department noted however that recognized programs of apprenticeship and other types of training were available to young persons minorities and women and affirmed that through that vehicle it could be assured that the training is real and is not subterfuge through which to lock such workers into low paying unskilled jobs the department stressed that payment of reduced wages to apprentices and trainees was an exception to the requirements of the davisbacon act and that strict conditions must be maintained in order to 10 federal register december 28 1979 pp 7702977030 11 ibid p 77083 crs6 prevent the circumvention of the acts requirements12 but while the terms apprentice and trainee were defined in the final rule once again helper was not13 in its discussion of wage determinations the dol explained that differences in rates would be based upon differences in the work performed not upon skill and supervisory functions14 and further dol explained in any given classification individual skill levels will vary from employee to employee and any attempt to measure and issue rates on that basis is administratively impossible and could throw the procurement into complete confusion15 from this assertion one might infer the difficulties that the department anticipated were it to recognize the use of helpers and to determine an appropriate locally prevailing wage rate for these workers three weeks into the reagan administration on february 6 1981 the department announced delay in implementation of the davisbacon regulations then it withdrew them for further review the reagan administration regulations 1981 ff consideration of the helper issue during the reagan era falls into three periods issuance of proposed rule august 1981 publication of final rule may 1982 and subsequent litigation continuing through the remainder of the reagan administration the proposed rule 1981 on august 14 1981 the reagan administration issued new proposed rule governing the davisbacon act and called for comment the department agreed to allow helper classification on wage determinations when the classification is identifiable in the locality it noted implementation of this proposal would provide recognition of widespread practice in the construction industry and thus allow wage determinations to reflect actual classification practices and rates16 the dol pointed out that it had long recognized the helper category under certain carefully defined circumstances but it concluded the practice had been too restrictive the new proposed regulation would issue helper wage determinations when they can be identified in the locality not only when they are found to be prevailing as in prior practice it noted that the concept of helper would be broadly defined in the regulation and permitted in ratio of one helper to five journeymen17 12 dlr january 19 1981 p g2 13 ibid pp g8 g10 14 ibid p h9 15 ibid p h5 16 dlr august 14 1981 p e2 17 ibid august 14 1981 p e3 it is important to keep in mind the continuing problems of meaning for example how might one define such terms as identified or prevailing crs7 however in order to prevent abuse dol explained the regulation would prohibit use of journeymen as helpers18 there was shift of emphasis from the regulations issued by the carter administration the new regulations stated that the purpose was to provide for the increased use of helpers whenever they are utilized in the area19 the concept of helper was now specifically defined as component of the terms laborer or mechanic helper is semiskilled worker rather than skilled journeyman mechanic who works under the direction of and assists journeyman under the journeymans direction and supervision the helper performs variety of duties to assist the journeyman such as preparing carrying and furnishing materials tools equipment and supplies and maintaining them in order cleaning and preparing work areas lifting positioning and holding materials or tools and other related semiskilled tasks as directed by the journeyman helper may use tools of the trade at and under the direction and supervision of the journeyman the particular duties performed by helper vary according to area practice20 where worker is on the payroll as helper but does not meet the regulatory definition of helper or helper on the job site is in excess of the ratio permitted he or she would be paid the rate for the classification of work actually performed21 following publication of the proposed rule august 1981 the department received approximately 2200 comments more than 1000 dealt specifically with the helper issue22 the final rule 1982 final davisbacon rule was issued on may 28 1995 dol explained that its prior restrictive approach with respect to the use of helpers had been inappropriate23 in setting forth new standard dol rejected the concerns of trade unionists while concurring in the views of industry going beyond the rule as proposed in august 1981 dol affirmed that it had decided to raise the ceiling from one helper for every five journeymen to two helpers for every three journeymen the higher ratio will better reflect the wide diversity in practices among different types of construction and localities24 the new ratio would allow up to 40 of the total onsite workforce to be composed of helpers25 and would increase 18 ibid p e11 19 ibid p e10 20 ibid p e15 21 ibid p e17 22 dlr may 28 1982 p a4 23 ibid p e4 24 ibid p e8 25 ibid p e15 see also p e26 crs8 the cost savings substantially26 where they were hired instead of journeymen27 the actual definition of helper remained as in the proposed rule reaction to the final rule was sharply divided former labor secretary and harvard economist john dunlop termed dols judgment on the 23 ratio helpers to journeymen categorically wrong he observed that the department cites credible evidence to support it the helper ratio and for good reason there is none28 the building and construction trades department aflcio charged that the rule would allow almost unlimited use of helpers within particular craft as well as the use of crosscraft helper the use of helpers the bctd pointed out longer had to be prevailing in an area ie the common practice but merely identifiable under the new rule and it objected that the 23 ratio was not absolute because an option for variances was built into the rule29 industry was favorably disposed having urged just such regulatory change the associated general contractors termed the helper provision the most farreaching change in the new regulation also noting the projected cost savings30 the american farm bureau federation commended the reagan administration for its revision of the regulations31 and the us chamber of commerce noting that the change would permit contractors to expand their use of helpers or semiskilled workers on federal projects at wage rates lower than those paid to skilled journeymen reported that the business community is hailing as major improvement the new davis bacon rules32 litigation 19821983 in late may 1982 the aflcio executive council reviewed the entire new davisbacon regulation and noted that of particular concern was the new treatment of the helper classification it is our view that the redefinition of helper is derogation of the statutory requirement that the secretary of labor determine the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics on federallyfunded and federally assisted construction projects furthermore the changes in the helper requirement will adversely impact upon minority construction workers and will lead to the practices of wagecutting and misclassification which the davis bacon act is designed to prevent33 26 ibid p e8 27 ibid p e7 28 dlr july 22 1982 p a2 29 the builders june 21 1982 pp 34 30 davisbacon report the new davisbacon regulations summary of the changes addendum to

1982 the final rule was scheduled for implementation on july 27 1982 on july 22 judge harold h greene of the us district court for the district of columbia issued preliminary injunction against the secretary of labor35 and among other things addressed at length the issues raised with respect to the helper provision judge greene said at the time of enactment of the davisbacon act congress was acutely conscious of efforts by some employers to classify workers as helpers in order to avoid paying the skilled laborers wage the senate committee report noted that wage standards had been largely broken down by intermediate classifications of labor and failure to retain the strict lines of demarcation intended to be drawn and maintained between skilled and unskilled labor the whole tendency has been for wages of the skilled group to descend toward the level of the unskilled group this by reason of intermediate classification devices the report concluded by recommending that construction contracts contain provision stating that the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics shall be based on wages prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics the language ultimately adopted in 1935 the new regulations will permit precisely that which congress intended to halt in 1935 the concept of classes of laborers or mechanics was and is central to the statutory scheme under existing and longestablished industry and administrative practice class of workers is one that has been historically recognized as such and whose members perform welldefined tasks helpers have therefore been recognized as class only when their use has been prevailing in an area and they have formed distinguishable group performing discrete tasks under the new regulations helpers not only are not defined in traditional terms but they may perform any task throughout the entire construction field they are general helpers as consequence such individuals would be allowed at the discretion of the contractors to perform the tasks of laborers of journeyman mechanics and of laborers and mechanics on crosscraft multitrade basis obviously if contractors could thus assign helper to perform the tasks of any and all classes of laborers and mechanics and they could do so at lesser pay they will do just that and the requirement that wages be based on corresponding classes will effectively be read out of the law as the wage appeals board said in fry brothers corp 123 wab 766 june 14 1977 at p 1516 34 dlr june 11 1982 pp a9a10 e1e5 35 building const trades dept aflcio v donovan 543 fsupp 1282 1982 the secretary of labor at this time was raymond j donovan former construction industry executive crs10 if construction contractor who is not bound by the classifications of work at which the majority of employees in the area are working is free to classify or reclassify grade or subgrade traditional craft work as he wishes such contractor can with respect to wage rates take almost any job away from the group of contractors and the employees who work for them who have established the locality wage standard there will be little left to the davisbacon act moreover under existing administrative practice helper classification is recognized only if it is prevailing in particular area under the new regulations the use of helpers need only be identifiable to be recognized yet the statute itself refers to wages prevailing for classes not to wages identified for classes the effect of this change will be that when there is single helper or small group of helpers in town or metropolitan area helpers may be employed in substitution of traditional craft workers throughout that area in all aspects of construction work in that respect again the new regulations will depart both from prior practice and from the central purpose of the act for these reasons it is unlikely that when the merits are reached this regulation can be allowed to stand36 judge greene noted that eight presidents and 15 secretaries of labor of many political and ideological persuasions had interpreted the davisbacon regulations without the fundamental changes that are brought about by the regulations adopted two months ago and had continued to interpret and enforce the laws precisely in accordance with the original understanding judge green concluded such consistent unwavering administrative construction must be accorded very substantial weight by the court37 on december 23 1982 judge greene having further reviewed the case issued permanent injunction against implementation of the helper rule38 the decision was promptly appealed39 us court of appeals 1983 through the spring of 1983 the us court of appeals district of columbia circuit reviewed judge greenes decision40 on the helper issue the appeals court partly upheld but partly overturned the district court verdict the provision requiring that helper classification need only be identifiable in an area the appeals court declared must be struck down because it operates to 36 543 fsupp at 12851286 37 543 fsupp at 1289 38 building const trades dept aflcio v donovan 553 fsupp 352 1982 the case

aflcio v donovan 712 f2d 611 dc cir 1983 crs11 undermine the fundamental purpose of the act that wages on federal construction projects mirror those locally prevailing further the appeals court pointed to the potential for downgrading classification of work for example making carpenter work into carpenters helper work and in the process reducing the wages to be paid after reviewing the legislative history of the act it observed what is clear is that congress regarded underclassification as contrary to the purposes and most probably to the terms of the act again we have concluded that the secretarys identifiableclassification regulation would virtually ensure underclassification in uniondominated areas41 with respect to the definition of helper the appeals court found that the secretary of labor was entitled to try to come closer than his predecessors have to making wage rates on davisbacon projects accurately reflect local practice it found that shift from definition based upon the use of tools to one based upon the element of supervision was reasonable the change may mean that some unscrupulous contractors will find it easier to shift journeyman work onto helpers it noted but we find it difficult to secondguess the secretarys view that he can catch them42 therefore the appeals court split on the helper issue sustaining judge greene on the question of identifiable versus prevailing practice but accepting the secretarys new definition of helper since the regulation was in effect unit the result blocked implementation of the helper rule helper rule is cleared by the courts the unions appealed the decision of the appeals court but in january 1984 the supreme court declined to hear the case43 thus the decision of the appeals court stood and the secretary of labor was left to restructure the helper regulation in order to win judicial approval on january 31 1985 dol implemented the other portions of the general rule that had been approved but the helper regulation remained under departmental review44 in late august 1987 the department issued new proposed rule on the use of helpers it conceded the issue with respect to prevailing as opposed to merely identifiable thus conforming to judge greenes standard defining prevailing however remained problem dol spokesperson suggested that simply to state that the helper classification is prevailing because most of the contractors in local area use helpers is an oversimplification therefore in the proposed rule the department set forth several options upon which to base determination and called 41 712

building trades unions filed an appeal48 on december 4 1990 the department served notice that the helper rule would become effective february 4 199149 thereafter it would begin surveying for helper use contractors were asked to report the number of helpers apprentices and trainees they employ in each craft as well as their wage rates50 at this point congress interceded the dire emergency supplemental appropriations bill of april 10 1991 pl 10227 provided that funds shall be expended by the secretary of labor to implement or administer the helper regulations title iii section 30351 thus dol was barred from further activity through the end of that fiscal year with respect to the helper regulation whether the restriction was temporary or permanent became subject of dispute in late

1992 the appeals court having once more reviewed the helper regulations concurred in the departments definition of helper and prevailing but it ruled that the ratio of helpers to journeymen two helpers to three journeymen was arbitrary and capricious and therefore this one provision was declared invalid55 in the opinion of the court the ratio was purely arbitrary choice without rational decision making it noted such an unsubstantiated imposition of fixed ratio in regulatory scheme based on statute designed to implement prevailing practices represents the very essence of arbitrariness it is true that regulation must be sustained as long as the agency has articulated reasonable basis for its decision here however all the agency has done is to state that 23 ratio better reflects industry use of helpers than did the 15 ratio to state conclusion is not to reason the matter was sent back to the department56 two months later on june 24 1992 dol issued new final davisbacon rule removing the section of the earlier regulation that had set ratio of helpers to journeymen and thus allowing for an openended interpretation57 the rule was to be effective june 26 199258 this action by the department observed the daily labor report was major blow to building trades unions conversely it could be viewed as victory for industry critics of the act though such groups as the associated builders and contractors had favored more sweeping use of helpers59 congressional interest continues notwithstanding the decision of the department to implement the helper regulation during the summer of 1992 such implementation remained in abeyance both within the congress and in the broader policy community debate continued concerning the wisdom of the helper regulation and its various effects in terms of manpower utilization and in terms of labor administrative and project costs60 legislative initiatives of the 103rd congress major revision or repeal of the davisbacon act through legislation

process another of different persuasion might reverse as early as september 1982 senator nickles had introduced legislation which among its other provisions would have stricken the reference to laborers and mechanics in the act and replaced it with the phrase laborers mechanics helpers or any combination thereof and by adding the classification of helper to the other classifications of workers throughout the act61 although the nickles proposal was not adopted other efforts to codify the davisbacon regulations followed without success as did efforts to prevent implementation of that portion of the regulation dealing with helpers the nicklescraig objection the helper issue was back before the congress during the fall of 1993 during consideration of hr 2518 the department of labor appropriations act of 1994 senator nickles with senator craig proposed deletion of committee language blocking implementation of the dolproposed regulations permitting the use of helpers on davisbacon projects senator nickles affirmed that employment of helpers on federal projects will save the federal government nearly 600 million year on labor construction costs restricting the use of helpers would waste billions of dollars of taxpayer money and deny the opportunity for hundreds of thousands of americans to find work in construction he estimated the employment loss of not implementing the regulations at over 250000 jobs62 senator harkin opposed the nicklescraig proposal recalling that the helper regulations were already decade old to delay their implementation for one year would allow the new clinton administration time to evaluate them he protested that the helper regulations as drawn would have disproportionately high impact upon employment of minority workers and an adverse impact for apprentice training programs these minority and female laborers will face an immediate reduction in employment or they will be reclassed sic as helpers by the contractors who seek to remain competitive on federal construction again with an accompanying reduction in wages and fringe benefits finally the senator from iowa mr harkin disputed that 600 million in savings would result from implementation of the helper regulation63 61 congressional record september 17 1982 p s11738 62 congressional record september 27 1993 pp s12530s12533 both estimates were attributed to the

reappeared on june 21 1994 the house appropriations committee defeated proposal by representative delay that would have removed the helper funding restraint from pending dol appropriations measure hr 460665 on june 28 during floor debate on hr 4606 representative delay urged that this onerous provision the restrictive language be deleted so that the helper regulation could go into effect he suggested that implementation of the rule would produce less costly public construction open up more employment opportunities and help the small local contractors that it was intended to help66 conversely representative william ford declared that the davisbacon requirement prevents wages and benefits in local communities from being undermined ensures quality construction and saves money in the long run representative ford stated that implementation of the regulation would allow contractors to shift work from highly productive journeymen to lower stilled and lower paid helpers this would undermine apprenticeship training programs he argued because contractors would substitute helpers for apprentices both of these practices run contrary to the goal of creating high skilled high paying jobs in the nation instead of low skilled dead end work finally representative ford noted that the department had advised him of its intention to issue revised helpers regulations within the upcoming fiscal year the appropriations language he stated will allow the conclusion of the administrative process and he urged that the delay amendment be defeated67 following review of the issues the delay amendment was defeated by voice vote the language prohibiting implementation of the helper regulations was retained in the bill68 legislative initiatives of the 104th congress through the years congress had sought to modify the davisbacon act through amendments to program legislation and through the appropriations process as well as through free standing legislation or simply to repeal the statute that pattern continued through the 104th congress though at least during the first session emphasis seemed to focus upon the latter course repeal 64 congressional record september 28 1993 p

might be single grouping of workers compensated at single rate or separate subcategories for carpenters helper electricians helper etc potentially compensated at different rates the term prevails remained undefined and unlike the reagan regulations ratio of helpers to journeymen was established these issues with others might have been addressed through the rulemaking process but that in turn could have led to yet another round of court challenges when the 104th congress adjourned action had been taken on the hatfieldweldon legislation and further action on the earlier kassebaum and ballenger bills the labor department reconsiders in november 1993 the department under mandate from congress had suspended the helper regulation74 the spending prohibition through series of legislative actions continued until the middle of fiscal 1996 but such prohibition was imposed during the latter half of fiscal 1996 nor for fiscal 199775 the suspension continues august 1996 in june 1996 noting that here is at present longer any statutory obstacle to enforcement of the revised helper regulations the associated builders and contractors abc brought suit in federal court to require the department to enforce the regulations abc president gary hess stated that the exclusion of helpers has cost the american taxpayer more than 500 million per year he explained all were trying to do is to bring public construction practices in line with those of the vast majority of the industry76 73 in august 1981 dol had explained that it recognized helper classification in some areas under certain welldefined situations that is where 1 it constitutes separate and distinct class of workers ie the scope of duties of the helper is defined and can be differentiated from journeyman duties 2 the particular helper classification prevails in the area and 3 the helper is not used as an informal apprentice or trainee see dlr august 14 1981 p a3 74 federal register november 5 1993 pp

explained by his close relationship with the aflcio and organized labors fierce opposition to helpers crs18 the department it appears responded quickly month later in late july 1996 assistant secretary of labor bernard anderson affirmed that the current helper regulation approved but still suspended simply is nonadministrable anderson explained that the distinction between helpers and other workers in terms of their role and duties was insufficiently clear and that the department had intention of implementing the regulation in its current form77 the policy voiced by anderson was set forth in more detail few days later in the federal register of august 2 1996 the dol observed fourteen years have passed since the department first promulgated the helper regulation and more than four years have passed since the department last attempted to put revised version of that regulation in effect during the extended period of time in which the regulation was suspended dol noted additional information has become available which warrants review of the suspended rule the rule had originally been crafted in part the department explained in the belief that it would result in construction workforce on federal construction projects that more closely mirrored the private construction workforces widespread use of helpers and at the same time effect significant cost savings in federal construction costs the federal register notice continued data developed from the departments experience implementing the helper regulation which was not available during the rulemaking proceedings and upon which the public has had opportunity to comment reveals that the use of helpers might not be as widespread as previously thought the department expressed concern that the helper regulation may create an unwarranted potential for abuse of the helper classification to justify payment of wages which are less than the prevailing wage in the area it also expressed concern about the possible impact of the helper regulations on formal apprenticeship and training programs for these and other reasons including the obvious congressional controversy over the regulation dol concluded that the basis and effect of the semiskilled helper regulation should be reexamined78 dol recalled that there had been public comment upon the helper regulation as revised to meet court requirements further it suggested were the courtapproved rule implementation of which had been withheld by action of the congress to be given effect on an interim basis during further review of the issue by the department such action would create unwarranted disruption and uncertainty for both federal agencies and the contracting community therefore dol determined that the suspension would continue while the department engages in substantive rulemaking concerning the helper regulations79 the department requested comment from the public 77 dlr july 29 1996 pp a9a10 78 federal register august 2 1996 p 40367 79 ibid p 40367 see also dlr august 1 1996 pp a2a3 crs19 final suspension december 1996 nearly five months passed during which the department received and evaluated comments solicited in its august federal register notice some 47 submissions were received from interested industry and trade union groups and others few of the comments the department noted addressed the issue immediately at hand namely continuing interim suspension of the helper rule most dealt with the substantive issues embodied in the rule itself on the question of the interim suspension the building and construction trades department aflcio concurred in the view of the department that the interim suspension was the most prudent and responsible action under the circumstances the associated general contractors agc disagreed arguing that implementation could be effected relatively quickly perhaps 60 days and with little disruption and further that the reevaluation process ought not to be prolonged dol at some length disputed the agc contention the department believes that it would take substantially longer than 60 days to fully implement the helper regulations this view is fully supported by the departments past experience with the helper regulations if the department were to begin implementation of the suspended rule immediately the rule itself would provide 60day effective date to allow affected parties time to come into compliance and would apply only to contracts for which bids are advertised or negotiations concluded after that date bid solicitations to which the regulations will apply must be advertised for at least 30 to 60 days before contract is awarded thus following the effective date of the regulations there will be another 30 to 60 days before contracts potentially containing helper contract clauses could be signed the department noted further conforming changes in government procurement regulations and standard contract forms would also be needed process which has sometimes taken several months but that aside dol suggested certain other factors contractor can use helpers in accordance with the helper regulations only if 1 the contract contains wage determination with helper classification and rate or 2 the contractor awarded the contract requests that helper classification be added to the wage determination and the department determines that the use of the helper classification is prevailing practice in the area in which the work will be performed the time necessary for the department to perform wage determination and prevailing practice surveys would further lengthen the period before contractors could lawfully pay their workers at helper rates furthermore it continues to be the departments intention to complete substantive rulemaking action within approximately one year because of the substantial length of time it would take to implement the helper regulations any saving that might be gained from implementation of the helper regulations during the rulemaking period would be minimal particularly in light of the disruption and uncertainty which would be caused by implementing the rule while the department is engaged in rulemaking crs20 finally the department concluded that the comments had provided information which would change its belief that the suspension of the helper regulation should continue80 on the broader issue of the use of helpers per the department affirmed that it had not decided to repeal the helper regulations nor has the department made final decision to amend the regulations the department has it stated concluded that the basis and effect of the semiskilled helper regulations should be reexamined it noted that in due course it would decide if any changes in the existing rule were in order and if so it would then publish proposed rule for public comment on its substance meanwhile however the department appeared to have reached several tentative conclusions new data it noted suggest that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as initially thought further the department expressed its concern that administration of the helper regulation and the policing of potential abuse of the helper classification may be more difficult than initially anticipated and finally the department expressed concern about the potential impact of the helper regulation on formal apprenticeship and training programs81 while the department expressed its willingness to explore further the extent of private sector helper utilization and related costssavings impacts the potential for abuse appeared to present larger problem dol explained the department notes that the helper classification as currently defined is unique in being based on subjective standards such as skill level and supervision rather than an objective test of work performed the department is concerned that such subjective standard may be more difficult to enforce82 the department observed that the helper classification alone under davisbacon is defined with duties that are specifically intended to overlap with the duties performed by other classifications thus rendering enforcement and administration likely more difficult than the authors of the various versions of the helper regulation anticipated83 critics of the regulation then suspended expressed concern about its potential impact for apprenticeship and training they claim that the ability to pay apprentices wage lower than that paid to journeymen is significant incentive for contractors to participate in formal training programs they also claim the department noted that the availability of lower paid helpers would cause contractors to withdraw from such programs and would threaten private funding for apprenticeship and training dol summarizing this perspective observed that this could pose threat both to industry which would face shortages of skilled trained labor and to the individual workers who would find themselves in deadend low skilled jobs without adequate opportunity to increase their skills at the same time 80 federal register december 30 1996 pp 6864168643 81 ibid p 68644 82 ibid p 68645 83 ibid p 68646 crs21 the department also observed that both the abc and the agc believe such concerns are unfounded some in industry dol pointed out regard helpers basically as entrylevel workers the use of the helper classification it was suggested would allow such workers to gain experience provide the semiskilled with an opportunity to gain experience and provide the unskilled with first step to higher paying jobs some it was noted viewed the helper option as pre apprentice opportunity for unskilled workers to acquire the skills necessary to enter an apprenticeship program these divergent opinions seemed to confirm the departments judgment that the helperapprentice relationship is not fully understood and should be revisited through further rulemaking therefore the helper regulation is suspended until the department either 1 issues final rule amending and superseding the suspended helper regulations or 2 determines that further rulemaking is appropriate and issues final rule reinstating the suspended regulations84 indefinite suspension confirmed by the court during the summer of 1996 the associated builders and contractors abc filed suit to force the dol to implement the helper regulations year later in july 1997 the us district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department had acted properly in instituting an indefinite suspension of the helper regulations in summary judge stanley sporkin observed that the department in the fall of 1993 had good cause for its suspension of the regulations given the prohibition by the congress of any expenditure for their implementation that he suggested was not in dispute but recognizing the good cause for the departments action in 1993 he noted the next question is whether the suspension of these regulations remained valid once the emergency the congressional prohibition expired on april 26 1996 the plaintiffs abc argued that dol was compelled to implement the regulations once the spending ban had expired judge sporkin disagreed holding that rather than being bound by an automatic requirement for implementation of the regulations the department was free to review the regulations to ascertain whether any changes or updating would be appropriate twoandahalf years roughly late 1993 to spring of 1996 passed between the suspension of the revised helper regulations and the expiration of the congressional ban during this time judge sporkin noted the defendants dol had collected new data on the prevailing employment of helpers which the department argued seriously undermined key assumption underlying the development of the revised helper regulations thereby creating substantial doubt about whether these regulations would result in the previouslyprojected costsavings on federal construction projects he explained the department was not required to ignore changed circumstances new concerns or new information that it discovered in the twoandahalf years since the regulations were last implemented especially when this new information 84 ibid crs22 suggests that one of the fundamental bases of the revised helper regulations the widespread use of helpers longer holds true therefore assuming rational basis for the departments findings not only was it committed to the departments discretion to seek an indefinite postponement of the effective date it arguably was its duty to do so judge sporkin pointed out that the department ought not to have waited three months between the expiration of the congressional spending prohibition and the publication of notice of intent indefinitely to suspend implementation of the regulations but since the department had ultimately published such notice the claim attacking that delay is now moot judge sporkin reviewed the contentions of each side noting that while the plaintiffs were clearly opposed to the actions taken by the department they had tended to focus upon the substance of the helper regulations per rather than the procedural issues that were before the court they had offered judge sporkin observed little evidence that the delays on the part of dol were arbitrary and capricious instead he noted they argue that none of the reasons cited by the department justify such reexamination of the helper regulations on the contrary the court found that the rationale offered by the department was on its face reasonable even the assertion that implementation of the helper regulations would reduce the costs of government construction by more than 600 million was called into question by more recent data and altered assumptions the court found ultimately judge sporkin ruled in behalf of the dol with the concurrence of the courts the helper regulation was indefinitely suspended85 proposed restoration of the pre1980s standard in the federal register for april 9 1999 dol published notice of new proposed rule on the use of helpers on davisbacon projects the wage and hour division affirmed that the rule would reinstitute its longstanding policy on the helper issue86 and would reflect current practice87 it would allow the use of helpers on covered projects only where 1 the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of the journeyman or laborers 2 the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and 3 the term helper is not synonymous with trainee in an informal training program88 the notice reviewed the various departmental initiatives the proposals and counterproposals the fate of each before the courts and the restraints imposed by the congress upon implementation of new helper rule even when sustained by the courts it recalled that in crafting the helper proposals of the early 1980s dol 85 associated builders contractors inc v herman 1997 wl 525268 ddc 1997 86 federal register april 9 1999 p 17442 87 ibid p 17455 88 ibid p 17442 the notice signed by assistant secretary for employment standards bernard anderson was dated april 1 1999 crs23 had operated on the expectation that the new policy would more closely reflect private sector industry practice b that it would effect significant savings in federal construction costs and c that it would provide additional job and training opportunities to unskilled workers in particular women and minorities however after nearly 2 decades of hearings and analysis the agency had come to quite different set of conclusions namely that the suspended rule the result of the various earlier proposals likely cannot be enforced effectively b that the use of helpers in the private sector is not so widespread as had earlier been assumed and c that the suspended rule if fully implemented could have negative impact on apprenticeship and training89 new perspective the assumptions and findings of the dol under the clinton administration appear in some measure different from those of the reagan and bush administrations thus the agency that had developed the suspended regulation and that had defended it variously through decade and half now found little in it with which to concur essentially it would revert to pre1980s practice difficult to administer the suspended regulation dol now concluded posed significant administrative difficulties and cannot be effectively enforced in manner consistent with the goals of the statute the department critiqued the definition of helper used in the earlier rule traditionally semiskilled worker as internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from that of general laborer it explained wage and hour has traditionally identified and differentiated among job classifications on the basis of the tasks performed by each classification among the issues wage and hour struggled with in trying to develop enforcement guidelines were 1 what it means to be semiskilled 2 how to identify the line between semiskilled and skilled journeyworkers 3 whether at some point semiskilled helper could acquire sufficient skills to qualify as skilled worker and how to determine when that had occurred 4 whether skilled worker could accept position as semiskilled helper and therefore be paid the lower helper wage rate without violating the regulation or the intent of the act and 5 whether hiring as semiskilled helper skilled worker who failed to disclose his skill level would violate the regulations or the act one by one the department dissected the provisions of the suspended rule supervision by journeyworker is not practical standard for distinguishing semi skilled helpers from others on the worksite as even laborers and journeylevel construction workers may work under the direction and supervision of other journeyworkers dol argued the definition does not indicate the nature or amount of direction and supervision that helpers must receive to distinguish them from others on the worksite the definition in the suspended rule it contended provides little meaningful guidance for distinguishing between semiskilled helper who used the tools of the 89 federal register april 9 1999 p 17444 crs24 trade and journeyworker with little experience that it allowed significant overlap between the duties of helpers and those of laborers increases the difficulty of identifying helpers as distinct classification this overlap it suggested increases the likelihood that helpers will displace laborers or that laborers will be misclassified as helpers further it stated the term helper has multiple quite different meanings within the construction industry the department pointed to the subjectivity of the helper definition in the suspended rule and questioned whether any regulatory definition of helpers would adequately reflect the actual and varied practice in the construction industry as whole or even in any particular area it concluded that conducting meaningful wage determination process concerning helpers would be difficult given that contractors responding to area wage surveys would ascribe very different meanings to the term helpers90 use of helpers not widespread while the suspended rule had been based upon the assumption that the use of helpers was widespread the department now concluded that the assumption had been in error or at least overstated during the later stages of litigation prior to implementation of the rule survey data convinced the department that such use was substantially lower than it had thought here again the problem of definition arose thus survey data may be problematic91 negative impact for apprentice training through the years the department has assumed that formal structured training programs are more effective than informal onthejob training alone it explained workers enrolled in formal apprenticeship training programs are more likely to achieve journeylevel status and to do so more quickly than workers trained informally who may become stuck in lowpaying jobs apprenticeship programs it added are also more likely to produce better skilled more productive and safetyconscious workers one objective of departmental policy as it has considered davisbacon implementation has been to encourage training for unskilled and semiskilled workers including in particular women and minorities by permitting under that act lower rates of pay in structured programs for training apprentices and trainees92 employers are encouraged to enter into such programs wage and hour believes that the suspended helper regulations could undermine effective training in the industry it reasoned if contractors use helpers who may never become 90 ibid pp 1744417445 later the department stated that it would be necessary to develop clear definitions of the duties or tasks that helpers to each journeylevel craft worker would be allowed to perform this would involve extensive occupational analysis and further rulemaking to promulgate helpers duties descriptions this the department pointed out would result in uniform nationwide definitions departing from the principle that classifications are determined based on local area practice see p 17448 it could also involve substantial monitoring to enforce compliance 91 federal register april 9 1999 pp 1744517446 92 here the concept of trainee is of one engaged in structured program not simply an unskilled or lowskilled worker who follows more highly trained worker and who may informally acquire some knowledge crs25 journeylevel workers in lieu of apprentices and trainees participating in formal programs93 call for comment the announcement for the proposed new helper rule provided comment period of two months until june 8 1999 target date was set for publication of final rule review of submissions commenced potentially an extended process but because the new rule would be confirmation of current practice timing may not have been critical legislative interest continues the 105th and the 106th late in the 105th congress representative norwood introduced legislation hr 4546 to establish by statute that helpers of laborers and mechanics be recognized as separate classification of worker under the davisbacon act and paid the prevailing wage of helpers on similar projects in the locality action was taken on the norwood bill early in the 106th congress representative norwood reintroduced the proposal hr 1012 it defined helper as semiskilled worker other than skilled journeyman mechanic who 1 works under the direction of and assists journeyman 2 under the journeymans direction and supervision performs variety of duties to assist the journeyman such as preparing carrying and furnishing materials tools equipment and supplies maintaining them in order cleaning and preparing work areas lifting positioning and holding materials or tools and other related semiskilled tasks as directed by the journeyman and 3 may use tools of the trade at and under the direction and supervision of the journeyman introduced march 4 1999 the bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and subsequently to the subcommittee on workforce protections action was taken on the norwood proposal in presenting it proposed rule of april 1999 however dol without referring directly to hr 1012 reviewed the approach taken in the legislation it concluded that language such as that represented by the proposed legislation was imprecise and would result in significant administrative burdens see discussion above 93 federal register april 9 1999 p 17446 crs26 final rule on helpers goes into effect under date of november 17 2000 the dol issued final rule on the use of helpers on davisbacon projects in its opening summary of the new regulation the department affirmed that it was amending the regulations to incorporate the wage and hour divisions longstanding policy with respect to the recognition of helpers as separate category of workers the regulation took effect on january 19 2001 during the closing hours of the clinton administration94 dol assessment of the suspended rule in assessing comment on the proposed rule returning to 1970s practice the department followed pattern similar to that of prior years and with some detail it explained why the regulations that it had proposed through the years during previous administrations would not work in satisfactory manner first dol concluded that the suspended rule with its definition of helpers would be difficult to administer and enforce and insisted on dutiesbased approach the bctd of the aflcio seems to have concurred industry spokespersons to have dissented the latter reasoned that the department should be able to identify helper classes through area practice surveys as easily as it differentiates among the various trade classifications95 the department reasoned that laborer or mechanic is entitled to be paid the prevailing rate for the work performed according to the local area practice and therefore is classified based on the duties the worker performs it continued because under the suspended definition helpers may perform the duties of other classifications both journeylevel workers and laborers without any limitations other than that they be supervised by and assist journeyworker it would be extremely difficult for the department to identify the work of helper in any given area both for enforcement and wage determination purposes further the department affirmed the suspended rule would allow the duties of helper to overlap with those of other classifications that prevail within the locality possibly leading to the employment of helpers to perform the work of other classifications at lower wages thus the suspended rule it found would have undermined the prevailing wage structure96 indicative of change of policy within the department dol pointed to the vague subjective criteria of its definition of helper in the suspended rule that it had earlier proposed the department stated that it does not believe it dol could draw the line effectively between semiskilled and skilled work especially given that in todays construction market skilled craft workers may perform whole range of 94 federal register november 20 2000 p 69674 95 ibid p 69677 96 ibid pp 69677 and 69678 crs27 duties from unskilled to semiskilled to skilled and laborers often perform what may be considered semiskilled work as well even the element of supervision would not be helpful in this respect the department insisted laborers and journeyworkers dol stated like helpers under the suspended rule also may work under the direction and supervision of other journeyworkers it described supervision on construction worksite as often an amorphous concept and that it does not lend itself to objective evaluation further it stressed the definitional ambiguities of the suspended rule97 dol expressed concern that under the suspended rule the wage and hour administration would not be able to conduct meaningful wage determination process using the suspended definition of helpers in light of the likelihood that contractors responding to area wage surveys would ascribe very different meanings to the term helpers98 the impact of the suspended rule was raised by the mercatus center at george mason university while it acknowledged the difficulties the rule would pose with respect to enforcement and administration it cautioned that they must be balanced against the productivity and costsaving benefits the suspended rule would provide the department countered that although costsaving features are certainly desirable they cannot be determinative where regulation cannot be fairly and effectively administered in manner consistent with the goals of the statute that is to protect prevailing wages for the corresponding classes of work performed further dol recalled that the purpose of the davisbacon act was to set floor on wages so that wages would not be reduced below the prevailing wage in the locality of construction not to secure the cheapest possible labor99 second dol found and argued that helpers are used less widely than had been supposed the department explained that during its initial rulemaking process with respect to employment of helpers during the reagan administration it had been projected that the use of helpers would be found to be prevailing practice in from twothirds to 100 percent of all craft classifications surveyed except where collectively bargained rates were found to prevail and did not provide for helper classification with more recent experience dol found that this was not the case 97 ibid pp 6967869679 98 ibid p 69679 dol summarized the dissenting view of business economist and davis bacon critic armand thieblot dr thieblot stated that surveying for helper rates presents special difficulties since it is wage and hours practice to accept the rates and job titles as submitted by the contractors who paid them whatever those titles might be without analyzing job content it should be more difficult dr thieblot stated as summarized by dol for wage and hour to determine if the job title masons helper prevails in given area than to determine if the job title masons tender prevails the department denied thieblots assertion holding when faced with more than one name for the same type of work wage and hour must determine whether the workers with the various job titles in question perform the same basic duties in which case the data for such work will be combined for the purpose of determining the prevailing classification and issuing single prevailing rate for the particular work performed 99 federal register november 20 2000 p 69680 crs28 in only 69 or 39 percent of the 1763 classifications issued was it found that the use of helpers prevailed it went on to cite other estimates and while there was some variation in the statistics the percentage of helpers estimated as employed in construction was extremely low bls projection set the figure at 12 others marginally higher the issue would seem to have been impacted in part by the assumptions made about the structure of the construction industry and the manner in which such concepts as widespread and prevailing or identifiable etc are defined after lengthy discussion of conflicting methodologies the department affirmed that it continues to believe that helpers are not as widespread as it had previously assumed100 third the department found that the suspended helper rule could have an adverse impact for formal apprenticeship and training programs dol expressed its belief that the suspended helper regulations could undermine effective training in the construction industry if contractors were permitted to substitute lowwage helpers who may never become journeylevel workers for more highly paid apprentices in formal structured programs under the fitzgerald act the national apprenticeship act 29 usc 50 et seq101 the building trades unions argued as summarized by dol that contractors and subcontractors who participate in and provide financial support for formal apprenticeship and training programs would be placed at competitive disadvantage visavis contractors using helpers and that the use of helpers thus would undermine the apprentice training program the unions also expressed concern dol noted that the suspended rules failure to encourage formal craft training would eventually lead to severe shortage of skilled craft workers in the industry this contention was disputed by employers both the associated builders and contractors and the associated general contractors commented that there is basis for the departments concern various employer oriented spokespersons suggested preference for helpers over apprentices or at least that employment of helpers was useful alternative102 the department however held that formal structured training programs are more effective than informal onthejob training alone dol like the unions expressed concern that implementation of the suspended rule would discourage the 100 ibid pp 6968069683 101 under the fitzgerald act administered by dol persons entering construction craft or other fields with dol oversight and ultimate certification become credentialed as journeyman craft workers outside of formal apprenticeship program however trainees or informal apprenticeslearners may be little more than lowwage general utility workers locked in deadend jobs it is also true that many construction workers absent formal apprenticeship experience do very well 102 ibid pp

to hire and to train such persons it might be noted that in survey conducted by the associated general contractors dated september 2000 it was reported that skilled worker shortages confront all contractors through the country see dlr september 26 2000 pp a5a6 crs29 growth of such programs and result in the replacement of dbracovered davis bacon projects of apprentices and trainees enrolled in formal programs by helpers who the department stated could perform the same work as apprentices and trainees at lower cost to the construction contractor and without any restrictions as to how helpers are used it concluded that the increased use of helpers under the suspended rule poses significant risk that formal apprenticeship and training programs on dbracovered projects would be undermined103 final definition of helper after more than 2 decades of consideration the definition of helper was restored essentially to its original meaning the final rule effective january 19 2001 provides 4 distinct classification of helper will be issued in wage determinations applicable to work performed on construction projects covered by the labor standards provisions of the davisbacon and related acts only where i the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as trainee in an informal training program helper classification will be added to wage determinations pursuant to 55a1iia only where in addition the work to be performed by the helper is not performed by classification in the wage determination legislative interest during the new century at the beginning of the 21st century the last outstanding rule from the reagan administration had been dealt with however interest in restructuring the regulation dealing with helpers continued in the congress in the 107th congress on may 23 2001 representative norwood again introduced legislation dealing with the helper issue the helpers job opportunity act hr 1972 action was taken in the 107th congress on the norwood proposal on june 2 2003 the 108th congress representative marsha blackburn r tn with representatives norwood and steve king ria introduced hr 2283 again the helpers job opportunity act the proposal mandated that helpers of laborers and mechanics shall be considered to be separate classification for davis bacon purposes and shall be paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or 103 federal register november 20 2000 p 69684 crs30 mechanics employed on projects which are of character similar to the project in question in the locality of the construction work under the blackburn proposal helper was defined as semiskilled worker other than skilled journeyman mechanic who works under the direction of and assists journeyman b who under the journeymans direction and supervision assists the journeyman in series of specified tasks and c who may use tools of the trade at and under the direction and supervision of the journeyman the bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and subsequently to the subcommittee on workforce protections but action was taken on the proposal on september 27 2005 the 109th congress representative blackburn with representative norwood reintroduced the helpers job opportunities act hr 3907 the measure was assigned to the committee on education and the workforce and subsequently to the subcommittee on workforce protections but action was taken on the measure thus far the specific issue of helpers does not appear to have reemerged during the 110th congress though davisbacon has frequently emerged concluding comment the davisbacon act had been subjected to substantive review by the congress in the early 1960s and has remained focus of public policy debate since that time frequently the subject of congressional hearings reports from gao and expressions of concern by the parties directly at interest contractors and the building trades unions the only major change in the act however that this oversight produced was the expansion of the concept of prevailing wage to include fringe benefit component 1964 new round of review of davisbacon occurred in the late 1970s during the carter administration resulting in rulemaking process that continued to the final days of the carter presidency and carried over into the reagan administration the carter regulations were withdrawn and in 1981 new regulations were proposed these dealt in part with the issue of helpers litigation followed portions of the proposed rule won court approval and through the years were implemented the helper provision won such approval only in 1992 decade after it was first proposed at that point congress intervened and through the appropriations process blocked enforcement of the helper regulation until the middle of 1996 by that time dol was having second thoughts about the use of helpers on davisbacon construction the regulation now was simply not enforced indeed dol declared the regulation to be nonadministrable and suspended it for further review when the associated builders and contractors sought court order for enforcement of the regulation summer 1996 the department reopened the rulemaking process and in december 1996 suspended implementation of the regulation until further notice in so doing dol reverted to the status quo prior to the reagan administration that is to the late 1970s crs31 in issuing its final december 1996 suspension of the helper regulation the department indicated that new evidence had been developed that would make it advisable for the agency to reassess the basis upon which the original rule and its subsequent amended editions had been issued during july 1997 the united states district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department had acted appropriately in its withdrawal of the helper regulation then on april 9 1999 the department published in the federal register notice of new proposed rule essentially the new rule would reinstate the departments longstanding practice with respect to the use of helpers comment period was set expiring after june 8 1999 on november 20 2000 the department published its final helper rule which took effect on january 19 2001 just hours before the end of the clinton administration to this point the process of defining appropriate wage treatment of helpers employed on davisbacon projects had consumed over 2 decades through that period the regulation had never fully been implemented though through brief period in the mid1990s implementation was allowed between 1981 and 1993 the department defended at times vigorously different versions of its proposed administrative reforms then after 1993 it began to reassess its position becoming increasingly critical of its own earlier efforts with publication of its new rule in april 1999 the department would revert to its longstanding 1970s practice where helpers were concerned with the release of final rule in november 2000 dol would largely repudiate its helper policy of the 1980s and 1990s and the documentation upon which it was based congress had followed the administrative proposals dealing with the helper issue variously it had entered into the debate and at times had endorsed the new helper classification in the 109th congress legislation hr 3907 was introduced by representative blackburn with representative norwood once again proposing recognition of separate helper classification on davisbacon projects however the blackburnnorwood bill died at the close of the 109th congress to date the issue has not reemerged in the 110th congress for other versions of
