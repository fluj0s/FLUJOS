fire grants fire departments throughout the na tion apply and award decisions are made by peer panel based on the merits of the application and the needs of the community however the law does require that fire gr ants should be distributed to diverse mix of fire departments with respect to type of department paid volunteer or combination geographic location and ty pe of community served eg urban suburban or rural7 the fire acts implementing regulation provides that in few cases to fulfill our obligations unde r the law to make grants to variety of departments we may also make fundi ng decisions using rank order as the preliminary basis and then analyze the ty pe of fire department paid volunteer or combination fire departments the size and character of the community it serves urban suburban or rural andor the geographic location of the fire department in these instances wher we are making decisions based on geographic location we will use states as the basic geographic unit8 according to the fy2008 program guidan ce for the assistance to firefighters program career paid departments will compete against other career departments for up to 45 of the available funding while volunteer and combin ation departments will compete for at least 55 of the available funding9 however given that less than 10 of fire grant applications are historically received from career departments funding levels are likely not to reach the 45 ceiling for career departments10 additionally each fire departme nt that applies is classifi ed as either urban suburban or rural in fy2005 6 of the total num ber of fire grant awards went to urban areas 17 to suburban areas and 77 to rura l areas of the total amount of federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32341crs9 11 department of homeland security national preparedness directorate capabilities division assistance to firefighters grant program fy2005 report p 14 12 the fire grant program sets limit of up to three applications per fire department per year vehicle application an application for opera tions and safety and regional application thus the number of fire departments in stat plays major factor in the number of fire grant applications submitted and the amount of total funding awarded within given state for example because pennsylvania has by far the largest number of fire departments it is not surprising that it leads the nation in the number of fire grants applications and the amount of funding awarded funding awarded 11 went to urban areas 20 to suburban areas and 69 to rural areas11 finally in an effort to maximize the diversity of awardees the geographic location of an applicant using states as the basic geographic unit is used as deciding factor in cases where applicants have similar qualifications

is down from 21 in fy2006 22 in fy2005 28 in fy2004 nd 34 in fy2003 this reflects the fact that the number of applications and federal f unds requested have trended upward over these years while appropriations for the fire grant program have declined over the same period issues in the 110th congress primary issue in the 110th congress is how appropriations for fire grants should compare with the authorized annual levels of 1 billion the administrations budget propos als have typically recomme nded significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero funding for safer grants opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has argued that reduced levels are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster aside from budget issues an ongoing issue has been the focus of the fire grant program administration budget proposals have sought to shift the priority of the fire grant program to terrorism preparedness firefighting groups have questioned this proposed shift arguing that the original purpose of the fire act enhancing basic firefighting needs should not be compromised or diluted similarly in recent years the house and senate appropriations committees have directed the afg program to maintain broad allhazards focus s 608 the riskbased homeland security grants act of 2007 would direct dhs to conduct study analyzing the distribution of fire grant awards and the level of unmet firefighting equipment needs in each statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32341crs10 related issue is the role of the us fire administration in the administration of the fire grant program at its in ception the program was administered by the usfafema and focused on enhancing the ba sic needs of fire departments across the nation in the fy2004 budget request as pa rt of its effort to consolidate terrorism preparedness grants under single

improve their readiness for terrorism incidents th fy2004 dhs appropriations act pl 108 90 acceded to the administrations request and relocated the fire grants to odp the conferees directed that dhs shall c ontinue current administrative practices in manner identical to the current fiscal year including peer review process of applications granting funds directly to cal fire departments and the inclusion of the united states fire administra tion during grant administration on january 26 2004 thendhs secretary ridge informed congress of his intention to consolidate odp including the assistance to firefighters program into the office of state and local governme nt coordination prep aredness oslgcp the fy2005 homeland security appropriati ons act pl 108334 placed the fire grant program within oslgcp however the assistance to firefighters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108375 designated administration of the fire grant program to usfa acco rding to the fy2006 budget request the fire grant program would be administered by the oslgcp in cooperation with the usfa on july 13 2005 dhs secretary michael chertoff announced restructuring of dhs effective october 1 2005 under the restructuring plan the fire grants as well as the safer grants were to be administered by the office of grants and training in the new dhs directorate for preparedness however legislation considered in the 109th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema ultimately title vi of the
