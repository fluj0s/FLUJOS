oldage survivors and disability insurance program dec 21 2007 at httpwwwssagovoactfactsfs2007_12pdf hereafter ssa fact sheet crs2 how survivors insurance works survivors insurance coverage coverage for survivors benefits is based on the insurance status of the deceased in order to become insured for survivors benefits person must work at job covered by social security person can earn up to four social security credits each year based on his or her earnings in covered job3 the number of credits person needs to qualify for survivors insurance depends on how old the person is when he or she dies person is fully insured for survivors benefits if he or she has at least 40 credits or 10 years of work at death fewer credits are required for workers who die before age 624 spouses former spouses children and parents of fully insured workers are eligible for all types of survivors benefits as long as they meet the other requirements for those benefits5 in 2007 88 of americans over age 20 were fully insured6 deceased workers children and the spouse or former spouse caring for those children could be eligible for survivors benefits even if the deceased worker does not have enough credits to be fully insured the deceased worker is currently insured if he or she httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22294 earned at least six credits during the last three years before death in 2007 97 of covered workers age 20 to 49 were currently insured for survivors benefits7 determining survivors benefits survivors benefits are determined using the same basic formula used to calculate social security retirement and disability benefits benefits are based on the lifetime earnings of the person who died so survivors of higher earners tend to receive higher benefits than survivors of lower earners however the benefit formula is progressive so survivors benefits tend to replace higher proportion of lower earners wages than of higher earners wages when person applies for survivors benefits the deceased workers basic benefit amount is determined8 qualifying survivors will receive percentage of this basic benefit amount depending on their age and their relationship to the deceased worker survivors benefits may be subject to reductions based on their earnings and family size if survivor qualifies both for benefits based on his or her own work record and benefits 3 in 2008 one credit is earned for every 1050 earned in covered employment up to maximum of four credits or 4200 per year this amount increases each year to account for wage growth 4 person is fully insured if he or she has earned at least one credit for each year between age 21 and turning 62 dying or becoming disabled 5 ssa does not pay survivors benefits based on samesex marriages see crs

beneficiaries unless they are specifically exempt many comprehensive social security reform proposals would affect survivors benefits as of this writing five bills before the 110th congress would apply only to survivors benefits hr 340 would allow remarried widowers to continue receiving benefits if the marriage on which they are based lasted at least 10 years hr 341 would extend lumpsum death benefit to all surviving spouses hr 1159 would provide full benefits to all disabled widows and widowers regardless of age or previous benefit reduction hr 1160 would allow widow and widower beneficiaries to receive delayed retirement credits if they take up benefits after their full retirement ages hr 1162 would repeal the sevenyear restriction on eligibility for disabled widow and
