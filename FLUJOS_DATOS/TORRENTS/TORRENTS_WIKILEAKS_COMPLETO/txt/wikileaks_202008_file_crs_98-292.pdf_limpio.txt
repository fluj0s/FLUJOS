amendment to the then proposed federal rules of evidence it was argu ed that evidentiary privileges are not simple legal technicalities they involv extraordinarily important social objectives they are truly legislative in nature i think that the im portance of privileges requires congress to act affirmatively and not to delegate power to the s upreme court to legislate in this area to give you one example i think it would be incredible if that after months and months of controversy and argument we in the congress enacted newspapermans privilege and then the supreme court passed rule modifying

rules draft of the change is made and with per mission of the standing committee is published for comment and mailed to inter alia the bench and bar legal publishers and government agencies duri ng six month comment period the advisory committee schedules one or more public hearings on the proposed amendment after the hearings the advisory committee again cons iders the proposal in light of the public comments if approved the amendment along with report summarizing the public comments and any minority views of the committee is forwarded to the standing committee on rules of practice nd procedure if accepted by that body the proposal is forwarded to the judicial conference for approval the conference normally considers changes to the rules in september and if ratified the proposed rule amendment is forwarded to the supreme court for transmittal to congress9 when new or amended rule is propose d the supreme court must transmit it to congress not later than may 1 of the year in which it is to become effective the rule shall take effect earlier th an december 1 of the year in which it is transmitted unless otherwise provided by law ge nerally the supreme court may fix the
