protection act of 1982 vwpa vested federal courts with discretion to order restitution in any criminal case arising out of title 18 of the united states code or in air piracy cases the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 established mandatory restitution as feature of the federal criminal prohibitions on sexual abuse sexual exploitation of children and domestic violence the mandatory victim restitution act mvra portion of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 made mandatory restitution consequence of conviction in most serious federal criminal cases ie crimes of violence and crimes against property including fraud g24g146g140g157g146g150g156g561 the federal restitution statutes address three questions who qualifies as victim what crimes trigger restitution authority what type of injuries or losses does restitution cover as originally cast section 3663 vwpa authorized restitution for any victim of any crime proscribed in title 18 of the united states code but did not define victim the supreme court read the statute narrowly and held that it authorized restitution only for the crime of conviction it did not authorize restitution for related charges dropped as part of plea agreement congress responded almost immediately with more explicit statemen t of section 3663s coverage it replicated and enlarged that statement when it enacted section 3663a six years later sections 3663 and 3663a authorize restitution orders for the benefit of the victims of the crime of conviction they augment who may be considered victim including persons other than those directly and proximately harmed as result of the commission of an offense sections 3663 and 3663a explain that the term victim includes someone harmed by scheme conspiracy or pattern of activity that is an element of the crime of conviction and twice describe the circumstances under which representatives and others may stand in the shoes of victim finally sections 3663 and 3663a permit restitution orders for the benefit of anyone identified in plea agreement absent either plea bargain or scheme conspiracy or pattern there must be close unbroken connection between defendants crime of conviction and the victims harm person is victim for purposes of sections 3663 and 3663a if he or she has been directly and proximately harmed as consequence of the crime of conviction person has not been directly and proximately harmed if his or her injury is only remotely attributable to the crime of conviction or attributable at least in part to an intervening cause unrelated to that offense the definition of victim for purposes of restitution under sections 3663 and 3663a expands when the crime of conviction has as an element conspiracy or scheme or patt ern of misconduct in the case of conspiracy defendant may be compelled to make restitution both for the harm caused by his or her own misconduct and for the harm of the foreseeable crimes of his coconspirators as for the scheme and pattern exception most federal crimes do not list schemes or patterns among their elements although the mail fraud wire fraud and racketeering statutes do thus in such cases restitution may include the losses incurred from different episode of the scheme than the one mentioned in the indictment yet the scheme must be the same victims entitled to restitution do not include those harmed by an otherwise identical scheme but different in time or place than the crime of conviction the courts are divided of what statutes qualify as scheme conspiracy or pattern laws some courts say the scheme or pattern must be an element of the crime of conviction it is not enough that the defendants crime involves contrivance or repeated related criminality others

need not use the words scheme or conspiracy or pattern although sections 3663 and 3663a employ the same definition of victim they do not authorize restitution for the same crimes the list of crimes for which section 3663 permits restitution supplements the list for which section 3663a demands restitution g5g155g146g150g142g156g497g561g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g345g348g348g345g3g561g507g15g138g151g141g138g157g152g155g162g561g20g142g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g508g561 the mandatory restitution of section 3663a applies upon conviction for 1 crime of violence as defined in section 16 2 an offense against property under title 18 or under section 416a of the controlled substances act 21 usc 856a including any offense committed by fraud or deceit or 3 an offense described in section 1365 relating to tampering with consumer products three restrictions apply to the mandatory restitution authorized for defendants convicted of the predicate offenses listed in ction 3663ac1a first there must be an identifiable victim who has suffered physical injury or pecuniary loss second in the case of the property damagefraud predicates restitution need not be ordered when the number of victims makes an order impractical third again in the case of property damagefraud predicates restitution need not be ordered when the complexity that restitution would introduce into the sentence process would represent an undue burden few other federal statutes authorize restitution most apply the procedures that govern sections 3663 and 3663a to narrower range of crimes but wider range of losses than sections 3663 and 3663a and their attendant enforcement procedures might otherwise permit g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g345g348g348g345g561g507g6g146g156g140g155g142g157g146g152g151g138g155g162g561g20g142g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g508g561 section 3663 authorizes restitution when defendant has been convicted of crime proscribed under title 18 of the united states code it also authorizes restitution when defendant is convicted of any of several trafficking offenses under the controlled substances act or of any air safety prohibitions finally restitution may be ordered on the basis of any crime under the laws governing probation and supervisory release generally thus federal district court may order restitution as condition of either probation or pervised release even with respect to crimes for which restitution is not authorized under any of these sections or under sections 3663 or 3663a g14g152g156g156g142g156g561 the losses for which restitution may be ordered depend on the statute under which restitution is ordered sections 3663 and 3663a make separate provisions for property losses and personal injuries they call for the return of the property if that provides full victim restitution and otherwise for compensatory payments section 3663 separately authorizes restitution for state agencies in certain trafficking cases if there is other identifiable victim neither section authorizes restitution for victims costs associated with the investigation and prosecution of the offense in property loss cases g18g142g155g156g152g151g138g149g561g11g151g147g158g155g146g142g156g561 sections 3663 and 3663a have parallel provisions governing the restitution for personal injuries that permit or in the case of section 3663a require compensation for medical expenses

funeral expenses in the event the victim is killed the medical expenses covered by restitution order may include those paid on the victims behalf by third party and may include the costs of psychiatric and psychological treatment when the victim has suffered physical injury restitution for lost income extends to both past and future lost income both sections authorize restitution for victims costs associated with the investigation and prosecution of the offense awards for investigative and prosecutorial participation may include relocation expenses for threatened victims compensation for wages lost while the victim assisted in the investigation nd attorneys fees related to the child recovery efforts of the victim of an international parental kidnaping the sections mention child care attendance at judicial proceedings and other matt ers that bespeak human victim but the courts have made it clear that other victims are likewise entitled to restitution under the provisions governmental entities may be entitled to restitution awards when they are the victims of qualifying offense but not for the costs of investigating and prosecuting the offense g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g561 section 3664 supplies the procedure that governs th issuance of restitution orders authorized in title 18 of the united states code in most instances the procedure begins upon the conviction of defendant for predicate offense at which point the court directs the probation service to investigate and prepare report identifying each victim of the offense and the extent of their injuries damages or losses the section calls for prosecutors to provide the probation officer with pertinent information the officer is also to ask victims to detail the extent and specifics of their predicate crimerelated losses the defendant is obliged to give the officer complete description of his or her financial situation the probation officers report is presented to the court the defendant and the prosecutor the court resolves contested restitution issues by preponderance of the evidence following hearing at which the prosecution bears the burden of establishing the existence and extent of the victims losses and the defendant bears the burden of questions regarding his or her finances section 3664 is precise when it describes how the court must frame the restitution order the order must envision full compensation for the losses of each victim without regard to the financial circumstances of the defendant in its calculation of the amount manner and schedule of payment for each victim however the court is to consider the defendants assets anticipated future income and other financial obligations compensation may be made in lump sum inkind payments installments or any combination of ch methods of payment inkind payments may take the form of return of lost property replacement inkind or otherwise or personal services when the defendants financial condition precludes any alternative the order may call for nominal periodic payments several courts have emphasized the importance of the courts close attention to the restitution payment schedule by prohibiting sentencing courts from initially ordering that restitution be paid immediately when it is readily apparent that the defendant is unable to do so thereby effectively leaving the task of establishing payment schedule to the probation officer or the bureau of prisons the court may not take into account the fact that victim may have been compensated by insurance forfeiture civil litigation or any other alternative form of compensation of his or her injury loss or damage when the government and the probation officer have been unable to determine the full extent of victim losses within 10 days prior to sentencing they are obligated to inform the court the court is then to set date for the final determination of victim losses within httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22708g20g142g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g155g146g150g146g151g138g149g561g5g138g156g142g156g497g561g3g561g21g148g142g157g140g145g561

claims for restitution relating to undiscovered losses thereafter there has been more than slight difference of opinion among the lower federal appellate courts as to how these provisions should be applied particularly in cases where the time lines have not been observed some courts view the time limits as jurisdictional and deny lower courts the authority to order restitution beyond the statutory limits some consider them akin to statutes of limitation and permit the time periods to be tolled others see the time limits as device designed for the benefit of victims not defendants and for them the failure to honor the time limits warrants relief as long as the victim or the government in the interest of the victim has objection and the defendant is given the opportunity to contest the courts are likewise divided over the question of whether the court may order restitution to be paid to the crime victims fund if the victim refuses to accept it should the court determine that more than one defendant contributed to the victims loss it may apportion restitution accordingly or it may make the defendants jointly and severally liable when defendants are made jointly and severally liable each is liable for the entire amount but the victim is entitled to more than what is required to be made whole regardless of what portion each of the defendants ultimately contributes section 3664i declares that when it comes to restitution the united states is to be served last the provision is cited most often to confirm that under the appropriate circumstances the government and its departments and agencies may be considered victims for restitution purposes where the government is not victim however the forfeiture laws may operate to deplete any assets from which restitution might otherwise have been paid on the other hand the defendant is not entitled to have the restitution award offset by the value of the forfeited property unless the victim is the governmental entity for whose benefit the property is confiscated section 3664j permits court to order restitution to third parties who as insurers or otherwise have assumed some or all of the victims losses although in such cases the victim must be fully compensated first section 3664j also supplies the only explicit offset for the defendants restitution obligations restitution award may be reduced after issuance by any amounts that the victim later receives in the course of related federal or state civil litigation nevertheless the victim the defendant or the government may seek to have restitution order amended to reflect the defendants changed economic circumstances the changed economic circumstances envisioned in section 3664k do not include anticipated future changes nor later better informed understanding of the defendants financial condition at the time of sentence there are several means to enforce restitution order when restitution is condition of probation or supervised release failure to make restitution may provide the grounds for revocation moreover restitution order operates as lien on the defendants property that remains in effect for 20 years the government may also use garnishment and the other collection mechanisms of the federal debt collection procedures act to enforce restitution order victim may also use restitution order to secure lien against the defendants property to ensure the payment of restitution in addition the victims rights provisions of 18 usc 3771 entitle victim to full and timely restitution as provided in law right the section makes enforceable through liberalized form of mandamus in most instances the victim may also sue the defendant based on the conduct that led to his conviction and the issuance of the restitution order during the course of such civil litigation the defendant may be precluded from denying the facts that formed the basis of his conviction

lower federal courts have generally taken the view that the death of defendant at any time prior to the determination of his or her final direct appeal abates all underlying proceedings appeals are dismissed as moot convictions are overturned indictments are dismissed and abated convictions cannot be used in related civil litigation against the estate all as if the defendant was never criminally charged it might seem from this that restitution order would abate as well but there is consensus among the lower federal courts on the issue
