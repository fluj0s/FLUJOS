preven tion and consumer protection act of 2005 bapcpa2 it was designed to facilitate c ooperation between us and foreign courts and to clarify administration of three types of international insolvency proceedings 1 full or main bankruptcy proceedings commenced either in the us with cooperation sought from foreig n courts or vice versa 2 ancillary proceedings such as limited requests to administer specific assets under us jurisdiction and 3 requests to suspend or dismiss us proceedings so as to avoid conflicts with foreign proceedings already in progress provisions addressing these situations in current law first appear ed in the bankruptcy reform act of 19783 and were codified primarily at 11 usc 303306 in response to practitioner requests for greater multilateral cooperati on from 1994 to 1997 the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral developed model law on crossborder insolvency model law4 the bapcpa implemented the model law by adding chapter 15 to the code5 chapter 15 replaced 11 usc 304 which was repealed modified 11 usc 303 305 nd 306 and addresse d other concerns this report summarizes the evolu tion and content of chapter 15 evolution of chapter 15 all international insolvency cases possess tension between the 1 principal objective of the insolvency proceeding which is to preserve the maximum value of the debtors assets wherever those assets are located and 2 jurisdictional reach of state or nations enforcement powers which is limited to territorial borders cooperation between courts of different jurisdictions is essential to efficiently identify preserve manage and allocate the debtors dispersed assets such cooperation between courts is called comity or reciprocity and may be procedural or substantive in form

notifying creditors of proceedings and deadlines exchanging transcripts and documenta tion updating other courts with new information overseeing administration of reorga nization or liquidation plans substantive cooperation has been the prin cipal obstacle for foreign creditors and trustees who may find their claims unrecogn ized by the host court or subordinated to those of domestic parties in interest us creditors and trustees encountered such problems abroad likewise foreign creditors and trustees found their claims against debtors assets impacted by us state statutes depending on the nature of the claim eg wages mortgages or by its timing eg local parties in interest usually were the first to file their claims rather than participating in single pro rata distribution among all parties who f iled claims by set deadline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries several nations entered into bankruptcy treaties or held international conferences in order to facilitate the handling of concurrent bankruptcies in multiple jurisdictions6 the us did not enter into these treaties opting instead to maximize judicial discretion for the relatively few international insolvency cases that us courts encountered7 this ad hoc system existed until three highprofile cases in the mid1970s gave impetus to the 1978 reforms regarding international insolvency8 the discussion below

foreign exchange contracts were the three entities banks or corporations under us law confusion arose because the foreign banks structure did not clearly correspond to us forms of business organization eg corporation partnership the central issue in all three cases was whether the foreign bank was covered by or exempt from the predecessor to th 1978 bankruptcy code the bankruptcy act of 189814 if the banks were subject to the 1898 act then they would be entitled to file petition for voluntary bankruptcy just like any other corporation and benefit from the fact that certain claims made against their assets within four months prior to filing would be voidable preferences under us law15 voiding transactions made within four months prior to the debtors filing was intended to promote equity among all creditors rather than favoring those creditors who first sensed that the debtor was going to declare bankruptcy the 1898 act as amended was silent regarding congress intended
