congress ronald orourke and stephen daggett foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division june 15 2007 abstract congress has several options for responding to recent proposals for procuring dod ships and aircraft with funding mechanisms that do not conform to the full funding policy these options could have the eﬀect of terminating modifying maintaining or strengthening the full funding policy in weighing these options congress may consider several factors including congresss power of the purse its ability to conduct oversight of dod procurement programs the impact on future congresses dod budgeting discipline and the potential impact on weapon costs the process of weighing options may involve balancing need to meet dod procurement goals within available funding against the goal of preserving congresss control over dod spending and its ability to conduct oversight of dod programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31404g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

rule imposed on the department of defense dod by congress in the 1950s that requires the entire procurement cost of weapon or piece of military equipment to be funded in the year in which the item is

reaffirmed over the years by congress the government accountability office and dod in recent years some dod weaponsspecifically certain navy shipshave been procured with funding profiles that do not conform to the pol icy as it traditionally has been applied to dod weapon procurement programs dod in recent budget submissions and testimony has proposed or suggested procuring ships aircraft and satellites using funding approaches that do not conform to the policy as traditionally applied dod s proposals would establ ish new precedents for procuring other dod weapons and equipment with nonconforming funding approaches such precedents could further circumscribe the full funding policy this in turn could limit and complicate congresss oversight of dod procurement programs or require different approaches to exercise control and oversight principal effect of the full funding policy is to prevent the use of incremental funding under which the cost of weapon is divided into two or more annual portions incremental funding fell out of favor because opponents believed it could make the total procurement costs of weapons and equipment more difficult for congress to understand and track create potential for dod to start procurement of an item without necessarily stating its total cost to congress permit one congress to tie the hands of future congresses and increase weapon procurement costs by exposing weapons under construction to uneconomic startup and stop costs supporters of incremental funding however could argue that its use in dod procurement programs could produce certain advantages in terms of reduc ing disruption to other programs avoiding investment bias against very expensive item s improving nearterm production economies of scale and preserving

policy is federal budgeting rule that has been applied to department of defense dod procurement programs since the 1950s although technical in nature the policy relates to congresss power of the purse and its responsibility for conducting oversight of dod programs the application of the full f unding policy to dod procurement programs has been affirmed at various times over the last five decades by congress the government accountability office gao and dod in recent years some dod weaponsspecifically certain navy shipshave been procured with funding profiles that do not conform to the pol icy as it traditionally has been applied to dod weapon procurement programs dod in recent budget submissions and testimony has proposed or suggested procuring ships aircraft and satellites using funding approaches that do not conform to the policy as traditionally applied dods proposals if implemented could establish new precedents for procuring other dod weapons and equipment with nonconforming funding approaches such precedents could further circumscribe the full funding policy which in turn could limit and complicate congresss ability to conduct oversight of dod procurement programs the issue for congress is how to respond to dods proposals for procuring ships and aircraft for dod with funding approaches that do not conform to the full funding policy as traditionally applied to dod weapon procurement programs c ongresss decision on this issue could have significant implications for congresss ability to conduct oversight of dod procurement programs it could also affect dods budgeting practices budget discipline and annual funding requirements for additional discussion of this issue as it relates to procurement of navy ships see crs report rl32776 navy ship procurement

equipment to be funded in the year in which the item is procured the rule applies to all weapons and equipment that dod procures through the procurement title of the annual dod appropriations act in general the policy means that dod cannot contract for the construction of new weapon or piece of equipment until the entire cost of that item has been approved by congress sufficient funding must be available for complete usable end item before contract can be let for the construction of that item 1 crs report rl32776 navy ship procurement alternative funding approachesbackground and options for

policy is to prevent the use of incremental funding in the procurement of dod weapons and equipment u nder incremental funding weapons cost is divided into two or more annual portions or increments that reflect the need to make annual progress payments to the contractor as the weapon is built congress then approves each years increment as part of its action on that years budget under incremental funding dod can contract for the construction of weapon after congress approves only the initial increment of its cost and completion of the weapon is dependent on the approval of the remaining increments in future years by that congress or future congresses there are two general exceptions to the full funding policy one permits the use of advance procurement funding for components or parts of an item that have long production leadtimes 2 the other permits advance procurement funding for economic order quantity eoq procurements which normally occur in programs that have been approved for multiyear procurement myp 3

total procurement costs of dod weapons and equipment more visible and thereby enhance congresss ability to understand and track these costs congresss intent in imposing the policy was to strengthen discipline in dod budgeting and improve congresss ability to control dod spending and carry out its oversight of dod activities understandin g total costs and how previously appropriated funds are used are key components of congresss oversight capability g9g152g159g142g155g151g146g151g144g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the full funding policy is consistent with two basic laws regarding executive branch expendituresthe antideficiency act of 1870 as amended and the adequacy of appropriations act of 1861 regulations governing the policy are found in office of management and budget omb circular a11 and dod directive 700014r which provide guidelines on budget 2 advance procurement funding is partial procurement funding for an item that appears in the budget one or more years prior to the year the item is procured it is sometimes described informally as downpayment on an item to be procured in future year advance procurement funding is used routinely and extensively in the procurement of the navys nuclearpowered warships since nuclearpropulsion equipment has long production leadtimes advance procurement funding is also provided for other dod weapons that incorporat components with long production leadtimes though the amounts of funding provided are usually much smaller than those provided for nuclearpowered warships 3 myp is special contracting arrangement approved by congress on programbyprogram basis that permits dod to use single contract to procure multiple copies of give n item that are scheduled to be procured across series of years an myp arrangement approved for the navys fa18ef strikefighter program for example permitted the navy to procure under single contract total of 198 to 224 fa18efs to be procured during the fiveyear period fy2000fy2004 myp arrangements are governed by 10 usc 2306b eoq procurement involves procuring multiple copies of key component of certain weapon covered by an myp at the start of the myp period so as to achieve significantly reduced costs on that component for example an myp arrangement to procure total of 12 ships of certain kind over period of four years could involve procuring in the first year of the arrangement 12 sets of ship propulsion or shipcombat system equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31404g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g561g18g155g152g140g158g155g142

over the years by congress the government accountability office gao and dod for detailed discussion of the origins rationale and governing regulations of the full funding policy as well as examples of where congress gao and dod have affirmed their support for the policy see appendix b

procurement was accomplished through incremental funding incremental funding fell out of favor because opponents believed it did or could do one or more of the following make the total procurement costs of weapons and equipment more difficult for congress to understand and track create potential for dod to start procurement of an item without necessarily understanding its total cost stating that total cost to congress or providing fully for that total cost in future dod budgetsthe socalled camelsnoseunderthetent issue permit one congress to tie the hands of one or more future congresses by providing initial procurement funding for weapon whose cost would have to be largely funded by one or more future congresses increase weapon procurement costs by exposing weapons under construction to potential uneconomic startup and stop costs that can occur when budget reductions or other unexpected developments cause one or more of the planned increments to be reduced or deferred although incremental funding fell out of favor due to the above considerations supporters of incremental funding could argue that its use in dod or federal procurement can be advantageous because it can do one or more of the following permit very expensive items such as large navy ships to be procured in given year without displacing other programs from that years budget which can increase the costs of the displaced programs due to uneconomic program disruption startup and start costs avoid potential bias against the procurement of very expensive items that might result from use of full funding due to the items large upfront procurement cost which appears in the budget overshadowing the items longterm benefits which do not appear in the budget or its lower life cycle operation and support costs compared to alternatives with lower upfront procurement costs permit construction to start on larger number of items in given year within that years amount of funding so as to achieve better production economies of that item than would have been possible under full funding recognize that certain dod procurement programs particularly those incorporating significant amounts of advanced technology bear some resemblance to research and development activities even though they are intended to produce usable end items

procurement programs implicitly recognize potential limits on dods ability to accurately predict the total procurement cost of items such as ships that take several years to build and preserve

ostensibly fully funded each year by congress like ships procured in the scn account dod in some cases actually applied lmsr funding provided in given year to partially finance the construction of lmsrs authorized in various years for example although congress ostensibly approved 5464 million in fy1995 for the procurement of two lmsrs th fy1995 funds were actually applied to help finance portions of 16 lmsrs whose constructi on contracts were awarded between fy1993 and fy1997 in explaining its use of funds in the lmsr program dod stated the national defense sealift fund ndsf is not procurement appropriation but revolving fund dollars appropriated by congress for the fund are not appropriated to purchase specific hulls as in the case of for example the navys ddg51 program rather dollars made available to the ndsf are executed on an oldest money first basis therefore full funding provisions as normally understood for ship acquisition do not apply 8

2005 some navy officials advocated the use of funding arrangement called advance appropriations for navy ships particularly as means of increasing the number of ships that could be placed under construction in the near term with available funding use of advance appropriations would enable the navy to begin construction on ship in given year even though the budget authority for that year provided only an initial increment of the total procurement cost of the ship under advance appropriations funding for the entire procurement cost of ship would be approved by congress in single decision in c ontrast however to traditional full funding in which the full procurement cost of the ship is assi gned to ie scored in the budget year in which it is procured under advance appropriations the procurement cost of the ship approved in given year would be divided into several portions or increments that would be scored across several budget years starting with the original year of procurement in contrast to incremental funding under which congress must take positive action each year to approve the portion of the ships cost assigned to that year with advance appropriations congress each year would need to take positive action to cancel the portion of the ships cost assigned to that year although navy supporters of the advance appropriation concept stressed that advance appropriations is form of full funding rather than incremental funding they acknowledge that advance appropriations could be described informally as legislatively locked in counterpart to incremental funding omb circular a11 defines advance approp riations as appropriations that are enacted normally in the current year scored after the budget year eg in each of one two or more later years depending on the language and available for obligation in the year scored and subsequent years if specified in the language 17 the circular allows for the use of advance appropriations to help finance capital assets under certain circumstances specifically principle 2 in appendix j on principles of financing capital assets states italics as in the original regular appropriations for the full funding of capital project or useful segment or investment of capital project in the budget year are preferred if this results in spikes that in the judgment of omb cannot be accommodated by the agency or the congress combination of regular and advance appropriations that together provide full funding for capital project or useful segment or an investment should be proposed in the budget explanation principle 1 full funding is met as long as combination of regular and advance appropriations provide budget authority sufficient to complete the capital project or useful segment or investment full funding in the budget year with regular appropriations alone is preferred because it leads to tradeoffs within the budget year with spending for other 17 omb circular

purposes other than capital assets in contrast full funding for capital project investment over several years with regular appropriations for the first year and advance appropriations for subsequent years may bias tradeoffs in the budget year in favor of the proposed asset becau with advance appropriations the full cost of the asset is not included in the budget year advance appropriations because they are scored in the year they become available for obligation may constrain the budget authority and outlays available for regular appropriations of that year if however the lumpiness caused by regular appropriations cannot be accommodated within an agency or appropriations subcommittee advance appropriations can ameliorate that problem while still providing that all of the budget authority is enacted in advance for the capital project investment or useful segment the latter helps ensure that agencies develop appropriate plans and budgets and that all costs and benefits are identified prior to providing resources in addition amounts of advance appropriations can be matched to funding requirements for completing natural components of the useful segment advance appropriations have the same benefits as regular appropriations for improved planning management and accountability of the project investment navy advocates of using advance appropriations for navy shipbuilding noted that the mechanism is used by several federal agencies other than dod18 although use of advance appropriations for navy shipbuilding was supported in 2001 by some navy officials and some members of congress19 the navy in 2001 apparently did not receive approval from the office of management and budget omb to use the approach for shipbuilding and did not officially propose its use as part of its fy2002 budget submission to congress20 congress in 2001 did not adopt advance appropriations as mechanism for funding 18 agencies cited by the navy included the departments of

the social security administration slides for may 3 2001 navy briefing to crs advance appropriations for navy shipbuilding pp 1921 the navy also argued that current law contrary to some assertions does not prohibit the use of advance appropriations specifically the navy argued that 31 usc 1341 the antideficiency act prohibits wr iting contract which involves the government in contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law 10 usc 2306b the provision covering multiyear procurement contracts allows dod and certain other federal agencies to enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of weapon systems as long as there is reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation 31 usc 1105 provision relating to the contents of the federal budget and its submission to c ongress requires that

107298 of november 19 2001 on the fy2002 defense appropriations bill hr 3338 stated that it was dismayed that the navy continues to advocate the use of alternative financing mechanisms to artificially increase shipbuilding rates such as advanced appropriations or incremental funding of ships which only serve to decrease cost visibility and accountability on these important programs in attempting to establish advanced appropriations as legitimate budgeting technique those navy advocates of such practices would actually decrease the flexibility of future administrations and congresses to make rational capital budgeting decisions with regard to shipbuilding programs accordingly the committee bill includes new general provision section 8150 which prohibits the defense department from budgeting for shipbuilding programs on the basis of advanced appropriations 21 the general provision mentioned above section 8150 was not included in the final version of the bill that was passed by

proposals for procuring ships and aircraft with nonconforming approaches congress may consider options for addressing legislatively the application of the full funding policy to dod procurement programs generally in this regard congress could decide to either maintain the status quo or add new bill or report language new bill or report language could be aimed at any of the following basic objectives terminating the application of the full funding policy to dod procurement programs this option could involve dropping the current policy preference for full funding and permitting dod to employ either full funding incremental funding or some other funding approach depending on which approach dod deems most appropriate for the program in question alternatively this option could involve instituting new policy that prohibits the use of full funding and perhaps establishes new policy preference for using incremental funding or some other funding approach relaxing or otherwise modifying the application of the policy to dod procurement programs this option could involve permitting nonconforming approaches to be used for certain categories of weapons or equipment or for procurements conducted under certain circumstances it could also involve permitting dod to make greater use of alternative budgeting mechanisms such as revolving funds for procurement of weapons and equipment as discussed in appendix b 1996 gao report examined some alternative mechanisms used at httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31404g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g561g18g155g152g140g158g155g142

congress should consider enabling agencies to use more flexible budgeting mechanisms that accommodate upfront funding over the longer term while providing appropriate oversight and control23 strengthening or expanding the scope of application of the policy as it relates to dod programs this option could involve giving the full funding provision specific basis in statute for dod or federal programs or applying it to dod programs funded outside the procurement title of the dod appropriations act such as those funded in the rdte account or the national defense sealift fund one recent example of proposed legislation relating to the use of full funding in dod procurement programs mentioned earlier was section 8150 of the fy2002 defense appropriations bill hr 3338 as reported by the house appropriations committee hrept 107298 of january 10 2002 which stated none of the funds appropriated in this act may be used to prepare budget request for submission to congress by the department of defense for fiscal year 2003 that contains any proposal to acquire ships for the department of the navy through the use of incremental funding amounts or advanced appropriations the limitation against incremental funding does not apply to the specific shipbuilding programs that were funded on an incremental basis in fiscal year 2002 as mentioned earlier this provision was not

as also shown in the excerpts presented in appendix b the full funding policy has traditionally been viewed as beneficial in terms of making the total cost of dod weapons and equipment more visible to congress as mentioned earlier understanding total costs and how previously appropriated funds are used are key components of congresss oversight capability incremental funding or other nonconforming funding approaches by spreading the costs of individual weapons or pieces of equipment over several years could complicate the task of understanding and tracking total weapon costs and the uses of previously appropriated funds particularly if such approaches are applied to numerous weapon acquisition programs as also shown in the excerpts from the 1996 gao report presented in appendix b however gaos case studies of certain federal agencies other than dod suggests that there may be room under certain circumstances for using alternative funding mechanisms such as revolving funds in way that preserves congressional control of spending and congressional oversight the issue is whether these alternative mechanisms would be appropriate for dod which has much larger budget and much larger annual capital needs than most other federal agencies g8g158g157g158g155g142g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g142g156g561 as discussed in the excerpts presented in appendix b use of incremental funding or other non conforming approaches could commit future congresses to providing funding for programs initiated by previous congresses and thereby reduce the flexibility of future congresses to adapt currentyear budgets to changing needs alternatively as mentioned earlier it could be argued that incremental funding can enhance congresss ability to respond to changing circumstances by giving future congresses the ability to stop funding the construction of weapon that suddenly becomes unnecessary or inappropriate due to unanticipated shifts in us strategy or the international security environment incremental funding in this view could permit congress to stop throwing good money after bad

importance to congressional powers and responsibilities the full funding policy is viewed by dod and others as im posing discipline on dod budgeting practices as shown in the excerpts presented in appendix b full funding is often viewed as helping to ensure that dod officials identify make investment trade offs on the basis of and budget adequately for the full costs of its weapons and equipment in addition dod has sometimes stated that full funding is source of discipline on dod program managers that encourages them to execute their programs within cost alternatively as mentioned earlier it could be argued that use of incremental funding can assist in the making of unbiased investment tradeof fs by avoiding potential bias against the procurement of very expensive items that might result from an items large upfront procurement cost which appears in the budget overshadowing its longterm benefits which do not appear in the budget or its lower life cycle operation and support costs compared to alternatives with lower upfront procurement costs it could also be argued that some dod procurement

and that gao in 2001 letter report and briefing on incremental funding of capital asset acquisitions stated that it recognizes that some incremental funding for high technology acquisitions is justified because while such projects are intended to result in usable asset they are closer in nature to research and development activities28 in addition it could be argued that use of incremental funding would be advantageous in dod budgeting because as mentioned earlier it reduces the amount of unobligated balances associated with dod procurement programs finally it could be argued that use of incremental funding can be advantageous in dod budgeting because it implicitly recognizes potential limits on dods ability to accurately predict the total procurement co sts of items such as ships that take several years to build g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g151g561g25g142g138g153g152g151g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 funding approaches like incremental funding and advance appropriations can permit the military services to start construction on greater number of weapons in the near term than would be possible under full funding this could make incremental funding and advance appropriations attractive in the near term to service officials industry officials and their supporters particularly given the decreased rates of weapon procurement that began in the early 1990s and are currently programmed by dod to continue for several more years the full costs of weapons started under these approaches however would eventually have to be paid in later years along with the costs of weapons procured in those later years as reflected in some of the excerpts presented in appendix b incremental funding traditionally has been viewed as creating potential for increasing weapon procurement costs due to uneconomic startup and stop costs that can occur when budget reductions or other unexpected developments cause one or more of the planned increments to be reduced or deferred related argument is that if firms are uncertain about approval of future funding increments for particular weapon they may be less inclined to invest in new and more efficient production technologies for that weapon effectively increasing its cost it could also be argued however that incremental funding or advance appropriations can help reduce weapon procurement costs in at least two specific cases the first concerns very expensive item such as large ship that is usually procured once every few years the examples usually cited are aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships if the navy is not permitted to have oneyear spike in the scn account in the year that it procures such ship then fully funding the ship within the scn account could requ ire other planned shipprocurement efforts to be delayed to the following year such delay it can be argued could disrupt the production lines for those other ships which could increase their procurement prices due to the resulting shut down and startup costs the second concerns very specific and perhaps rare scenario under which weapon that is beyond its initial rampup period of

is due to nearterm budget constraints planned for procurement at very uneconomic rate in the near term but at more thaneconomicrate few years later under such specific scenario use of incremental funding or advance appropriations could permit the service to shift the start of production of some of the units planned for later years into the near term improving production economies of scale in the near term while preserving adequate production economies of scale in later years if the nearterm gains in economies of scale are greater than the downstream losses in economies of scale the result could be reduced combined procurement cost for all of the weapons in question two factors bear upon the current debate over whether to procure dod weapons using non conforming funding approaches the first is the relatively low rates at which many dod weapon and equipment programs are currently planned for procurement the second is the interest that some members of congress have in modernizing dods weapons and equipment more quickly than now planned and in maintaining the financial health of us defense firms particularly those that have experienced several years of reduced production rates one potentially important question is whether the military services or defense firms are taking advantage of these two factors to induce congress to adopt nonconforming funding approaches that could permit increased weaponprocurement rates in the near term but also by reducing adherence to the full funding policy permanently weaken congresss ability to conduct oversight of dod programs military and defenseindustry officials likely would not admit openly to pursuing such strategy indeed they might not even be aware that pr oposals for nonconforming funding approaches could pose such tradeoff for congress nevertheless addressing such proposals may involve balancing need to meet dod procurement goals within available funding against the goal of preserving congresss control over dod spending and its ability to conduct oversight of dod programs g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g561g8g152g155g561g8g27g344g342g342g350g561

the time elapsed between the acquisition of the sbirs high geo satellites one and two and the planned acquisition of satellites three and four some significant redesign work is necessary this gap has

fy2008 for procuring the amphibious assault ship lha6 but did not recommend approval of the administrations proposal to use split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the two lead ddg1000 destroyers the committee for fy2007 instead recommended full funding for one ddg1000 and design fundi ng for second the committee also did not recommend approval of the administrations request to use incremental funding for procuring f22 aircraft regarding shipbuilding programs the committees report also states the budget request recommends incremental funding for 3 of the 7 ships in the request including for the first time construction of surface combatant the nextgeneration destroyer ddx furthermore during the consideration of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 pl 109163 the navy sought and was granted the authority to use incremental funding for the next aircraft car rier cvn78 which will be recorded as procured in 2008 the committee remains concerned that the use of incremental funding is not solution to the navys problem in funding shipbuilding while incremental funding can allow the navy to smooth out the dramatic spikes in shipbuilding funding required as result of aircraft carrier construction every four or fi ve years it does not fundamentally increase the number of ships that given amount of money will purchase during the committees hearings on shipbuilding all witnesses emphasized the importance of program and funding stability as the top priority for reducing the cost of shipbuilding and sustaining the shipbuilding industrial base the committee notes that congress adopted the full funding policy in the 1950s in part because of concern that incremental funding was detrimental to funding stability future congresses may find themselves unwilling or unable to fund completion of ships begun in prior years and only partially funded the committee remains convinced that the full funding policy is the correct policy for funding shipbuilding the committee understands that the department of defense this year considered submission of legislative proposal that would permanently authorize the use of split funding for aircraft carriers and large deck amphibious ships and the navys fiscal year 2007 shipbuilding plan already assumes such authority for the second lha class amphibious assault ship the committee has approved the use of split funding for certain ships in certain cases however the committee does not believe that blanket policy supporting incremental funding for any class of ship is appropriate and has not included such provision in the bill pages 6869 regarding the f22 program the committees report states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31404g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g561g18g155g152g140g158g155g142

included 2 b illion for the department of the air forces f22 aircraft program however despite the fiscal year 2006 projection for procurement of 29 f22s in fiscal year 2007 the funds requested for fiscal year 2007 were for subassemblies and not aircraft rather than authorize incremental funding for major aircraft programs which congress has not done in decades the committee recommends an additional 14 billion for the full funding for procurement of 20 f22 aircraft page 14 the report also states the budget request contained 15 billion for the f22 aircraft procurement program but included insufficient funds to procure 20 f22 aircraft in fiscal year 2007 the budget request included an f22 multiyear acquisition strategy to procure 3 lots numbered as lots 7 through 9 each consisting of 20 aircraft between fiscal years 2008 and 2010 as part of this strategy the budget request included plan to incrementally fund each of these three lots over three year period through budgeting for advance procurement two years prior to full funding subassembly activities to be budgeted one year prior to full funding and final assembly to be budgeted in the third year the committee understands that the department of defenses f22 multiyear acquisition strategy is inconsistent with the fullfunding policy which would allow for advance procurement of longlead items to protect delivery schedule and require budget for procurement of complete and useable end items in fiscal year the committee considers the f22 incremental funding acquisition strategy to be wholly unacceptable the committee believes that the fullfunding policy should apply to the f22 aircraft procurement program and any other department of defense aircraft procurement program contemplated in the foreseeable future the committee further believes that incremental funding of aircraft procurement programs presents an unacceptable budgeting risk that due to unforeseen circumstances future funding increments may not be authorized and appropriated to provide the required funding increments which would result in partially completed end items that are of military value to the department of defense or to warfighting commands therefore the committee recommends 29 billion to fully fund and procure 20 f22 aircraft in fiscal year 2007 an increase of 14 billion the committee very strongly urges the department of defense and the department of the air force to restructure its future f22 procurement budget plans to comply with the fullfunding policy page 105 the report also commented on the use of incremental funding for military construction programs which are not procurement programs but rather programs for building military bases and facilities military construction programs are funded through military construction appropriations bill that is separate from the dod appropriation bill and consequently are not subject to the full funding policy that covers it ems funded through the procurement title of the dod appropriation bill military construction prog rams have made regular use of incremental funding with regard to military construction programs the report states the committee is troubled by the january 10 2006 guidance from the office of management and budget to cease use of incremental funding of military construction projects except for the purposes of base realignment and closure activities and projects that have major national security impacts due to the implementation of this guidance during the fiscal year 2007 budget process department of defense

projects that are critical to military readiness important to the effective conduct of military operations or necessary to enhance quality of life have been indefinitely deferred in at least one such case incremental execution would likely be the more efficient means of funding and constructing the project the committee notes that the department has record of effective management while utilizing incremental funding for military construction projects as such the committee recommends reincrementing two projects contained in the budget request including recapitalization of hangar 5 at naval air station whidbey island washington while this would result in funding reduction in fiscal year 2007 of 31153000 the committee recommends full authorization for the project of 57653000 and expects the secretary of the navy to execute the project under proven incremental funding practices page 431 the report similarly states as noted earlier in the report the committee is troubled by the january 10

projects that have major national security impacts in light of the department of defenses proven record of effective management while utilizing incremental funding for military construction projects the committee recommends reincrementing the project to replace clinic at macdill air force base florida while this results in funding reduction in fiscal year 2007 of 41400000 the committee recommends

services committee recommended approval of the administration s proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring lha6 and the two lead ddg1000s with regard to section 121 on aircraft carriers the report states the committee recommends provision that would authorize the secretary of the navy to incrementally fund procurement of cvn21 cl ass aircraft carriers over four year periods commencing with cvn78 procurement in fiscal year 2008 the budget request included 7391 million in shipbuilding and conversion navy scn for cvn78 advance procurement and 451 million in scn for cvn79 advance procurement the provision would also authorize advance procurement for cvn80 commencing in fiscal year 2007 in reviewing the budget request for fiscal year 2006 the committee received testimony from the navy and industry that the low rate of shipbuilding was driving higher costs which in turn further reduced shipbuilding rates creating downward spiral the committee believes that stable ship requirements increased funding in the shipbuilding budget and increased flexibility for funding large capital ships are critical elements of any strategy to reverse this trend the secretary of the navys fiscal year 2007 report to congress on the longrange plan for the construction of naval vessels identifies requirement to procure the cvn21 class aircraft carriers at 4year intervals commencin g in fiscal year 2008 the navy originally planned to procure the first cvn21 class aircraft carrier cvn78 in fiscal year 2006 since then the navy has delayed procurement to 2008 which has delayed fielding this vital capability while significantly increasing the aircraft carriers procurement cost the committee believes that procuring and deliverin g the cvn21 class aircraft carriers over 4 year periods in accordance with the navys longrange plan is vital to the national defense strategy and is vital to the affordability of these capital ships elsewhere in this report the committee has expressed concern with cost growth on the cvn77 program and has urged the navy and the shipbuilder to identify opportunities to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers procurement delays excess inflation and material escalation have been reported as sign ificant contributors to cvn77 cost growth the shipbuilder has proposed to achieve significant cvn21 class program savings through stable procurement plan and through procurement of economic order quantity material for cvn79 and cvn80 in conjunction with cvn78 procurement in view of the potential for significant program savings the committee recommends an increase of 500 million in scn for cvn21 class advance procurement and directs the secretary of the navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the cvn21 class the secretary is to submit report to the congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2008 budget request outlining the advance procurement requirements to potentially optimize economic order quantity savings and escalation avoidance to include offsetting factors for the first three vessels of the cvn21 class of the amount authorized to be appropriated for advance procurement for cvn79 and cvn80 none of the funds are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the secretarys report page 67 with regard to section

approved of incremental funding of certain space programs and select number of shipbuilding programs notwithstanding assertions to the contrary authorizing incremental funding for the f22a would set precedent for funding aircraft the comm ittee sees justification for setting such precedent in the case of the f22a where the department of defense has proposed incremental funding merely as way of alleviating cash flow pressures on the overall department page 94 the report similarly states the budget request included 19813 million in aircraft procurement air force apaf as part of an incremental funding strategy that would lead to production profile of 20 aircraft per year for threeyear multiyear procurement of 60 aircraft beginning in fiscal year 2008 complete f22a aircraft were to be

requests for incremental funding of military construction projects omb has stated the intent to limit incremental funding of military construction projects to an exceptional practice as intended by omb circular a11 this guid ance represents change in policy for the budgeting of certain military construction projects the conferees acknowledge that requesting full funding to ensure military

estimated to exceed 500 million and where the construction period is planned to exceed 2 years congress has supported the use of incremental funding to addr ess the fact that not all military construction funds appropriated by congress for project will be expended in the first year in these cases the department of defense has had the option of requesting only those appropriated amounts expected to be expended in the budget year and notifying potential contractors that the projects completion is subject to subsequent appropriations this option then allows the department to address additional military requirements in the military construction budget request and accelerating the completion of cr itical projects for military readiness operations and service members quality of life because of the efficiencies gained by this method the conferees agreement includes the use of incremental funding not proposed in the budget request for certain military construction projects the conferees also note that the department has requested incremental funding for single military construction projects that will construct multiple complete and useable facilities the conferees are concerned that this practice will encourage the bundling of facility requirements into very large contracts thereby curtailing contractor competition therefore the conferees encourage the department

aircraft the committees report states for fiscal year 2007 the committee faces several challenges in recommending appropriations for the department of defense and the intelligence community first the presidents budget proposes an unorthodox approach to funding two major procurement programs the f22 fighter of the air force and the ddx destroyer of the navy in both cases the budget request includes incremental or partial funding for these two programs in the case of the f22 incremental funding is requested in the middle of the production run

procurement budget of the defense department in manner that is not acceptable to the committee in addition the precedent of incremental funding for these programs could be applied to variety of other procurements leading to loss of budget transparency and reducing the ability to perform oversight therefore the recommendations in this bill include full funding for one ddx destroyer and the f22 fighter program funding of 2568111000 is recommended to complete full funding of one ddx vessel this is the same level as the funding request for this item but under the presidents budget these funds would have been allocated on an incremental basis against two ships in the case of the f22 the committee has added 1400000000 to fully procure 20 additional aircraft in combination with the section 302b allocation for the subcommittee on defense which is 4000000000 below the presidents request this has necessitated difficult tradeoffs within the budget for the department of defense generally and the air force specifically however providing full funding for these programs this year avoids more difficult choices in the years ahead page 4 regarding the ddx the report states the committee recommends 2568111000 for the procurement of 1 ddx destroyer the budget requested 2568111000 to incrementally fund 2 ships with the balance of funding to be provided in fiscal year 2008 the committee cannot support such far reaching policy change which has implications beyond the navys shipbuilding program further the navys proposal requires special legislative authority to be executed and this authority is not included in the housepassed national defense authorization act 2007 hr 5122 page 139 regarding the f22 the report states the budget request proposes to incrementally fund the f22 fighter procurement program this proposal is contrary to the full funding requirement the congress has required for aircraft procurement programs the department of defense presented the committee with essentially two optionsagree to incremental funding or find 1400000000 in savings from other programs to fully fund f22 procurement the committee has chosen the latter option and recommends an additional 1400000000 for the procurement of 20 f22 aircraft in fiscal year 2007 in making these changes and providing the additional funds the committee is reiterating the long standing requirement for full funding of major weapon system procurements page 163 g21g142g151g138g157g142g561 in its report srept 109292 of july 25 2006 on hr 5631 the senate appropriations committee recommends rejecting the air forces request to incrementally fund the next lot of f 22 fighter aircraft and approving the navys request to incrementally fund the first two ddg 1000 destroyers regarding the f22 program the report states the fiscal year 2007 budget requests 1981302000 to begin incrementally funding the next lot of f22a aircraft the committee finds compelling reason to ignore the full funding policy and incrementally fund this program therefore 1400000000 was added to the budget estimate to fully fund the proposed multiyear procurement of aircraft consistent with the guidance in s 2766 the national

ddg1000 program the report states consistent with the senatepassed authorization bill and the navys current acquisition strategy the committee recommendation supports the budget request of 2568111000 for incremental funding of the dual lead ships the committee reminds the navy that this is unique acquisition strategy and should not be used as precedent for incrementally funding any future ddg1000 or any other shipbuilding program page 115 in addition regarding the navys littoral combat ship lcs program the report states with the fiscal year 2007 b udget submission of 520670000 for the fifth and sixth lcs flight 0 ships the navy revealed the lcs unit cost estimate used as basis for last years appropriation was exclusive of contract change orders planning and engineering services program management support and other costs not included in the ship construction contract as result the navy is unable to procure both the third and fourth lcs flight 0 ships without the availability of additional funding the committee is troubled by this revelation and recommends rescinding in section 8043 the insufficient fiscal year 2006 funds currently allocated to the fourth lcs flight 0 vessel the committee is further troubled by reports that the first two lcs flight 0 ships under construction are exceeding their cost as prev iously budgeted as result the committee believes the fiscal year 2007 budget request is insufficient to procure two ships and recommends 300670000 to fully fund procurement of one lcs seaframe which is reduction of 220000000 and one seaframe from the request the comm ittee notes that this recommendation puts the navy on its previously established path of procuring four lcs flight 0 ships by the end of fiscal year 2007 pages 115116

that the total cost of these two ships is well understood and low risk the conferees are willing to make this onetime exception to the full fund ing principle because of the unique situation with the shipbuilding industrial ba and with the ddg1000 program the conferees will not entertain future requests to fund ships other than under the full funding principle except for those historically funded in this manner aircraft carriers and some large deck amphibious ships the unusual procurement of twin lead ships raises the risk that future design changes or production problems will impact two ships under construction simultaneously this could raise costs significantly compared to other lead ship programs however the navy believes the cost and schedule risk in the ddg1000 prog ram is low enough to permit the twin lead ship acquisition strategy the navy has identified the total cost to procure the twin lead ships of the ddg1000 class as 6582200000 the conferees insist that the navy manage this program within that total cost and will be unlikely to increase funding through reprogramming or an additional budget request except in the case of emergency natural disaster or other impact

scheduled to replace th uss enterprise cvn65 scheduled to be decommissioned in fiscal year 2013 additionally this slip translates into cost growth for cvn78 of approximately 4000 million according to the navy the committee is concerned about this delay the committee has been told there is technical reason for the delay but that the lay was driven by budget considerations both the secretary of the navy and the chief of naval operations testified that large capital assets such as aircraft carriers are difficult to fund under the traditional fullfunding policy and that more flexible methods of funding must be found and used the program of record for cvn78 has the detail design and construction funding split between two years this provision would authorize that same funding to be split over

lead items to pport the low rate initial production of five conventional takeoff and landing variants of the joint strike fighter the committee notes that under the revised aircraft build sequence all of these aircraft do not require full funding prior to the beginning of fiscal year 2008 accordingly request to begin advance procurem ent of long lead items two years prior in fiscal year 2006 is funding early to need and contrary to conventional aircraft procurement strategy advance procurement funds should be requested in the air forces fiscal year 2007 budget submission full funding for

in section relating to navy shipbuilding for fiscal year 2006 the committee recommends providing the navy additional reprogramming authority this authority allows the navy through above threshold reprogramming procedures to increase funding for programs experiencing unforeseen shortfalls the committee understands that in fiscal year 2005 after exhausting the 100000000 of the transfer authority the congress provided the navy sought to use dollars specifically appropriated for outfitting and post delivery of completed ships to address shipconstruction funding shortfalls the committee is concerned about this change in navy policy as it will only further obscure actual program costs the new reprogramming authority is provided only with the understanding that this change will not be implemented in the future the additional reprogramming authority essentially provides the navy reactive mechanism or approach to cost management the committee believes the situation requires more proactive program budgetary and contract management and encourages the department of defense to consider whether using advance appropriations in future budgets will improve the shipbuilding program page 126 the committee also stated the fiscal year 2006 presidents budget requests 225427000 for theddg51 destroyer program for what the navy describes as program completion requirements and shutdown costs these funds are requested for mix of class and ship specific plan basic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31404g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g561g18g155g152g140g158g155g142

are traditionally included in the budget request for each ship however when signing the multiyear contract for the construction of the final ddgs of the class the department decided to change its policy and budget for these costs after the last ship was appropriated the committee finds this decision troubling first budgeting for such costs after procurement of the last vessel obscures the actual cost to procure each ship and overstates savings attributable to the multiyear contract authority under which these ships were purchased the congress approved the navys request for multiyear procurement authority in fiscal year 2002 assuming level of savings to the taxpay er that are now not being realized most disconcerting about this change in policy and resultant budget request is the navys assertion that if these costs are not funded the navy will not be able to meet its contractual obligations and the chief of naval operations will not be able to accept delivery of these ships the committee is alarmed that the navy would knowingly sign multibillion dollar contract for ships that would be both nonoperational and undeliverable unless additional dollars outside the contract were provided the committee directs the secretary of the navy to provide detailed report of all the costs required to complete each of the remaining 11 ships and rationale for such contractual arrangement by december 1 2005 until sufficient explanation is provided the committee recommends only providing funds for plans and those costs directly attributable to ships scheduled to deliver in the nearterm as such the committee recommends reducing the budget request by 195654000 page 127

stated the future years defense program submitted with the budget request included full funding for the first lharclass amphibious assault ship in fiscal year 2008 the committee understands that acceleration of this ship by pr oviding the first increment of scn funding in fiscal year 2005 would reduce the cost of this ship by 1500 million the chief of naval operations and the commandant of the marine corps have included this acceleration on their unfunded priority lists therefore the committee recommends an increase of 1500 million for advance procurement and advance construction of components for the first amphibious assault ship of the lharclass page 74 the report also stated to ease the f22 fighter production backlog while maintaining the production rate at that established for the fiscal year 2004 contract the committee recommends decrease in apaf of 2802 million for total authorization of 34 billion for the procurement of at least 22 fa22 aircraft in fiscal year 2005 the committee is aware that the department of defense has approved the fa22 program as buy to budget program if the authorized level of funding is sufficient to procure more than 22 aircraft the air

production rate will be sustained at 16 aircraft from 2007 through 2009 between air force navy and marine corps purchases and potential foreign sales failure to achieve this rate will significantly increase the cost per plane to the air force representing contingent liability the government is obliged to pay at present current projections suggest this rate will not be met with shortfalls of 4 aircraft each in 2007 and 2008 and 6 aircraft in 2009 if these projections hold the air force and the taxpayer will foot the bill in effect the air force has permitted itself to become facto sales agent for this program putting it in position to insist that other elements of the department of defense and the congress help it find way to fund this production profile or pay significant penalties the committee realizes that properly administered multiyear procurements can result in significant savings however the multiple abuses of sound contracting principles and fiscal responsibility by the air force in these instances cannot and will not become model for future multiyear acquisitions accordingly the committee has recommended several modifications to section 8008 of this bill and the committee directs these requirements be met before future multiyear production contracts can be entered into 1 multiyear contracts must follow full funding policies and not be used as vehicles for incrementally funding procurement 2 contract cancellation ceilings may not include recurring manufacturing costs of unfunded units 3 contract payments may not be made in advance of projected manufacturing costs to include purchase of materials for funded units 4 advance procurement funds may not be used to pay the costs of normal fabrication and assembly of unit components the use of these funds should be restricted to longlead items economicorder quantity buys and the onetime nonrecurring costs of improving manufacturing capabilities 5 advance procurement funds are limited to more than 10 percent of total procurement costs and 6 regular procurement funds for units should be requested for the appropriate fiscal year to be obligated to pay for normal fabrication and assembly of funded units and components the committee also takes exception to the ai r forces use of unique provision in the current c17 multiyear contract that allows the contractor to add charges to the fixed price contract if followon contract is not awarded the amended general provision further directs that new multiyear contracts provide for such price adjustment pages 105107 in the section of the report concerning the c17 program in particular the report stated the committee is extremely displeased by the air forces continued use of flawed and irresponsible financial strategy for the c17 multiyear procurement contract in fiscal year 2003 the air force proposed budget request it referred to as transformational the committee however saw it for what it wasan incremental financing scheme that abused the political support for this program and flaunted acquisition regulations and standard practices in that year the congress provided full funding for all 15 aircraft and directed the air force to fully fund the same number in fiscal year 2004

2005 defense budget request the air force has continued its financial sleightofhand on the c17 program based on recently concluded investigation by the committees surveys and investigations staff the committee learned the air force is using combination of advance procurement funding and exorbitant cancellation ceilings to keep the contractor to production schedule which has as many as 5 aircraft at any given time in the production line for which funds have not been appropriated not once in the past has the committee indicated its approval for using advance procurement funding to proceed wi th production of aircraft for which full appropriations have not been approved r is the committee aware of any change in department of defense dod fiscal policy or regulations that would permit this as both dod and office of management and budget financial officials put it to committee investigators the air force had pushed the envelope and in the committees view the envelope has been pushed too far moreover the air force also included provision in the second c17 multiyear procurement contract that assumes additional funding for aircraft w ill be approved following the end of the contract otherwise the department will be liable to pay the contractor significant termination costs this contingent liability places burden not just on the current congress but on the next congress as well and could be interpreted as violation of the antideficiency act in order to prevent such future financial chicanery on the part of the air force or any other military service the committee includes new general provision that significantly amends authority carried in past defens appropriations acts regarding multiyear procurement contracts this provision is discussed elsewhere in this report with regard to the current funding shortfall in fiscal year 2005 the committee has added an additional 158600000 and one aircraft bill language is also included in the aircraft procurement paragraph directing that funds provided are for the procurement of 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2005 that advance procurement funds are provided for the procurement of 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2006 and that the secretary of the air force shall fully fund the procurement of 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2006 in placing this requirement upon the air force the comm ittee would note the commitment of the secretary of the air force during public hearing on this matter to work with the committee to set it right the committee anticipates that the secretary will do just that page 192 in followon section concerning interim contractor support ics for the c17 fleet the report stated in the preceding part of this report the committee expresses its displeasure with the funding strategy the air force has employed to execute the c17 program that strategy has resulted in an incremental funding scheme for the c17 that the committee finds unacceptable in order to fully fund 15 aircraft in fiscal year 2005 the budget request must be amended to provide for one additional aircraft and 158600000 therefore the committee provides increased funding for one additional c17 in fiscal year 2005 and reduced funding in this account by like amount the committee finds it puzzling that the air force refuses to fully fund aircraft in production yet the fiscal year 2005 request for c17 ics includes funding of 176000000 in new capability block upgrades and improvements to the existing fleet in budget justification materials the air force identifies 114000000 of this amount as needed to address unfunded requirements the committee wishes to send very clear messageit considers full funding of the aircraft in production to be this programs number one unfunded requirement once the air force understands this message and provides the resources needed to bring this program in line with traditional fully funded procurement program the

to the existing fleet page 193 in its discussion of the armys proposal for funding the construction theater support vessel tsv through the armys research and development account the report stated fiscal year 2005 is the first year in which funding has been requested to construct such vessel the committee notes that the total cost of this vessel is approximately 141600000 and the army had planned to incrementally fund its construction over the course of fiscal years 2005 through 2007 the committee firmly believes that the department should fully fund major investment items and accordingly has added sufficient funding in the fiscal year 2005 bill to complete this vessel pages 254255 see also page 249 the committee in the above passage is applying the traditional full funding policy to this vessel even though it is being acquired through the armys research and development account which falls outside the procurement title of the dod appropriations act in its discussion of the navys proposal for funding the construction of the lead littoral combat ship lcs through the navys research and development account the report stated the committee recommendation includes increasing the budget request for the construction of the first flight 0 lcs by 107000000 fully funding this construction effort at 214000000 the fiscal year 2005 request included only 107000000 for the first increment of the lcs construction budget documentation indicates the navy plans to request an additional 107000000 for the second and final increment for the first ship in fiscal year 2006 the committee strongly opposes incremental funding of ship construction and therefore has provided total of 214000000 in 2005 for construction of the first lcs fully funding the construction requirement in one year page 288289 see also page 274 the committee in the above passage is applying the traditional full funding policy to this ship even though it is being acquired through the navys

the lhar or more simply as lha in fy2008 the report stated that the navys new plan presumes designing ship that would alter the amphibious nature of the lha and then proposing an incrementally funded construction program should the navy and marine corps determine that the restructure of the lhar program is the way ahead for the future fully funded program for design and construction of ship to

officials on plans for the possible construction of fleet of mpff ships the committee believes the navy must provide sufficient justification of its requests for appropriated funds while the committee appreciates that the timing inherent in the budget process does not always favor rapid transition to new ideas it is not reasonable to request congress provide funds for program with justification except that which is printed in the trade press furthermore the navy is well aware of the committees views with respect to incremental funding of programs the committee finds little humor in being asked to fund an unjustified request of nearly 100 million for what is intended upon its maturation to become an incrementally funded program page 352 the committee in the above passage is suggesting

request for the littoral combat ship lcs and consents to the navys request to fund construction of the first prototype ship for each of two ship designs in the research and development navy account approval for funding lcs in the research and development account is strictly based on the acknowledgement of the prototypical nature and high level of technical risk inherent in this program the

approach reducing prior year shipbuilding costs and providing these programs with the additional flexibility that is inherent in research and development funding the committee is concerned however that the department will not reap the benefits it seeks central to the argument that supports building the first ship in class with research and development funding is the necessity to learn lessons from the research development and testing being done if the navy plans as it currently does to fund the second ship in each of these classes in fiscal year 2006 in scn before actual construction even begins on the research and development funded ships the distinction between funding in research and development and scn only becomes one of fullfunding therefore the committee directs that if these shipsthe ddx and lcsare funded in research and development all research and development acquisition rules will apply including technology readiness reviews milestone decisions and test and evaluation before these ships may enter shipbuilding and conversion navy for procurement if the navy chooses not to follow the acquisition policies required of research and development programs before they enter

g10g152g158g156g142g561 in its report hrept 107532 of june 25 2002 on the fy2003 defense appropriations bill hr 5010 the house appropriations committee stated the following regarding the air forces fy2003 proposal to procure 60 c17 airlift aircraft under followon multiyear procurement myp arrangement approved by congress in fy 2002 that would procure at least some of the aircraft with funding profiles that resemble incremental funding rather than full funding the air force has adopted budgeting approach for the c17 that delays the need to request 1500000000 in budget authority until 2007 and 2008 instead of following the traditional method of requesting funding equal to the cost of the planes being built the air force has matched its funding request to when payments are due to the contractor the air force calls this change transformation the proper term is incremental funding and it is inconsistent with dod fiscal policy although the planes are delivered on the same schedule and at the same cost under either approach in cremental funding allows programs to push off onto future years costs that should be covered now last year when the congress was considering multiyear procurement authority for the c17 the air force sought bill language speci fically authorizing this new approach the congress approved the multiyear but denied th air forces request for special authority nevertheless the air force proceeded with th incremental funding and reinterpreted the regulations as permitting this approach for example while the dod financial management regulations fmr define advance procurement as being for long leadtime items the air force believes that this can be interpreted to apply to any component of the aircraft or even to final assembly while the fmr calls for advance procurement to be relatively low compared to the cost of the end item the air force proposal would in some cases fund half of the cost of the airplane with advanced procurement the air force position is not consistent with any reasonable interpretation of the fmr therefore the committee has included bill language requiring that the fiscal year 2003 c17 advance procurement be used to support the acquisition in fiscal year 2004 of 15 c17 aircraft the planned production rate and di rects the air force to include the funds to complete the purchase of those 15 c17s in its 2004 budget

comptroller to restructure the outyear funding for the c17 program to bring it into compliance with the proper use of advance procurement as defined in the fmr the committee is fully supportive of the c17 program and the multiyear procurement of 60 additional airplanes and directs that these changes be implemented in manner that would not adversely affect the cost or delivery of these planes page

defense pages 45 among these were recommendations to fully fund the c17 multiyear procurement request and to reduce amounts requested for advance procurement for navy shipbuilding programs with regard to the c17 multiyear procurement funding request the committee stated the air force has not requested sufficient funding in its budget proposal to fully fund the purchase of 15 c17 aircraft per year instead it has chosen to request only the amount of funds it expects to obligate each year to start the production of 15 aircraft and finance the remaining costs in later years this financing scheme runs counter to the full funding principles which guide federal government procurement practice and thus creates future liability for the air force and congress for these reasons the committee disapproves the air forces c17 financing proposal instead the committee recommends an increase of 585900000 to fully fund the purchase of 15 c17 aircraft in fiscal year 2003 the committee intends to work with the air force over the coming months to ensure that plans for executing the remainder of the c17 multiyear procurement program are both cost effective and consistent with full funding principles page 147 with regard to requests for advance procurement funding for navy shipbuilding programs the committee stated the committee notes that the navys requests for advance procurement funding for shipbuilding programs have increased in recent years almost universally among programs the cumulative amount requested for advance procurement funds exceeds 30 percent of the total cost of the vessel as stated in dod directive 700014r advance procurement requests should be limited to those items whose leadtimes are greater th an the life of the appropriation and where the leadtime of an item far exceeds the production time of the end item itself the regulation further states that the amounts budgeted for advance procurement should be relatively low compared to the remaining portion of the cost of the end item however based on detailed information received from the department the committee finds countless inconsistencies in the navys adherence to this policy as the committee endeavors to assist the navy in increasing funding for shipbuilding programs in addition to providing increased funding over the budget request it finds that portion of the funds requested for advance procurement would be more effectively used to alleviate the costs associated with completion of prior year navy shipbuilding programs the committees recommendation fully funds the increased costs associated with the swap of ddg51 and lpd17 class workload among the two main shipbuilders further it fully funds the entire ddg51 class prior year completion bill throughout the future years

full funding policy also known as upfront funding is consistent with two basic laws regarding executive branch expendituresthe antideficiency act of 1870 as amended and the adequacy of appropriations act of 1861 as summarized in 1996 gao report the antideficiency act as amended implements congresss constitutional oversight of the executive branchs expenditure of funds the act reflects laws enacted by the congress since 1870 to respond to abuses of budget authority and to gain more effective control over appropriations the central provision of the act 31 usc 1341a1 prevents agencies from entering into obligations prior to an appropriation or from incurring obligations that exceed an appropriation absent specific statutory authority thus agencies may not enter into contracts that obligate the government to pay for goods and services unless there are sufficient funds available to cover their cost in full instead agencies must budget for the full cost of contracts upfront also the adequacy of appropriations act 40 usc 11 established in 1861 prohibits agencies from entering into contract unless the contract is authorized by law or there is an appropr iation to cover the co st of the contract 34 g17g15g4g561g5g146g155g140g158g149g138g155g561g3g556g343g343g561g507g12g158g149g162g561g344g342g342g345g508g561 circular a11 from the office of management omb35 provides guidance

stated in section 3006b specifically requests for procurement programs must provide for full funding of the entire cost remember that administration policy and the antideficiency act require you to

budgeting requires that appropriations for the full costs of asset acquisition be enacted in advance to help ensure that all costs and benefits are fully taken into account when decisions are made about providing resources for most spending on acquisitions this rule is followed throughout the government when capital assets are funded in increments without certainty if or when future funding will be available it can and occasionally does result in poor planning acquisition of assets not fully justified higher acquisition costs project investment delays cancellation of major investments the loss of sunk costs or inadequate funding to maintain and operate the assets section 3006b of the circular states in part italics as in the original b full funding policy the full funding policy see section 314 requires that each useful segment or module of capital investment be fully funded with either regular annual appropriations or advance appropriations for definitions of these terms see section 3004 or the glossary of appendix j appendix j elaborates on the full funding concept see appendix j section c principles of financing appendix j section c lists four principles fo r financing capital assets principle 1 on full funding states italics as in the original budget authority sufficient to complete useful segment of capital project investment or the entire capital project if it is not divisible into useful segments must be appropriated before any obligations for the useful segment or project or investment may be incurred explanation good budgeting requires that appropriations for the full costs of asset acquisition be enacted in advance to help ensure that all costs and benefits are fully taken into account at the time decisions are made to provide resources full funding with regular appropriations in the budget year also leads to tradeoffs within the budget year with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets full funding increases the opportunity to use performancebased fixed price contracts allows for more efficient work planning and management of the capital project or investment and increases the accountability for the achievement of the baseline goals when full funding is not followed and capital projects or investments or useful segments are funded in increments without certainty if or when future funding will be available the result is sometimes poor planning acquisition of assets not fully justified higher acquis ition costs cancellation of major investments the ss of sunk costs or

010202a of dod directive 700014r on budget formulation and presentation updated june 23 2004 states underlining as in the original policy for full funding it is the policy of the department of defense to fully fund procurements that are covered within the procurement title of the annual dod appropriations act there are 2 basic policies concerning full funding 1 the first is to provide funds at the outset for the total estimated cost of given program so that the congress and the public can be fully aware of the dimensions and cost when the program is first presented in the budget

underlining as in the original 3 advance procurement long leadtime items advance procurement requests for long leadtime items shall be limited to the end items in ma jor procurement appropriations long leadtime procurements shall be for components parts and material whose leadtimes are greater than the life of the appropriation 35 years in some circumstances advance procurement is also warranted when items have significantly longer leadtimes than other components parts and material of the same end item or when efforts must be funded in an advance procurement timeframe in order to maintain planned production schedule for new development programs the planned production schedule should be based on full funding basis without the use of long lead material planning the program content this way provides additional flexibility should development delays arise when advance procurement is part of the program however the cost of components material parts and effort budgeted for advance procurement shall be relatively low compared to the remaining portion of the cost of the end item each budget request for advance procurement shall represent at minimum the termination liability associated with the total cost of the long leadtime components material parts and effort for which the advance procurement request is being made the termination liability should not cover the cost of the end item budgeted in the following fiscal years the full cost of components material parts and effort included in the advance procurement request should be budgeted in the fydp

quantity eoq procurement eoq is normally associated with multiyear procurements but can be requested for annualized procurements on an exception basis for unusual circumstances such as combined parts buys for block of satellites it is the general policy of the department of defense not to create unfunded contract liabilities for eoq procurements rather funding for eoq procurements shall be included in advance procurement budget requests unless an exception to the general policy is granted by the usd comptroller the eoq procurement may satisfy procurement requirements for more than five program years unless it would be more effective to fully fund the eoq or the usdcomptroller has granted an exception to the general policy to allow inclusion of eoq costs in cancellation clause the

report on the full funding provision37 outlined the origins rationale and early dod regulations governing the policy although it is long excerpt about 4 pages as reprinted here it is significant as an early and detailed recapitulation of the history of the full funding policy the concept of full funding was initially applied to navy shipbuilding authorized by the act of march 10 1951 65 stat 438 prior to the execution of the act the navy shipbuilding program operated under contract authorizations with funds appropriated in annual increments as estimated to be required for contract expenditures during the budget year after passage of the act the congress appropriated funds for the entire cost of navy shipbuilding programs as then envisaged on the basis of prevailing prices regardless of the period of expenditures under the individual contracts provision wa s made for anticipated increases in costs of materials and labor in letter dated may 15 1957 to the secretary of defense congressman george herman mahon as chairman of the department of defense subcommittee house committee on appropriations stated in part that 37 excerpt from gao report of february 17 1969 entitled application of the full funding concept and analysis of the unobligated and unexpended balances in selected appr opriations reprinted as enclosure i to gao letter report b165069 of february 23 1978 letter to the honorable butler derrick chairman budget process task force regarding the advisability and feasibility of applying the full funding concept to additional programs and activities in the federal budget 38 the gao report does not explain how or why the principle came to be applied to the shipbuilding program that was authorized by this law the explanation apparently lies outside the text of this act itself since the act does not contain any language that on its face creates statutory basis for the full f unding policy described as an act to authorize the construction of modern naval vessels and for other purposes the act is somewhat analogous to the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn portion of today s defense authorization and appropriat ion bills it simply authorizes the construction acquisition conversion of navy ships sections 1 2 authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for these ships section 3 places limits on sellin g transferring or otherwise disposing of navy ships section 4 and rescinds authorizations for navy ships made in four laws passed between 1941 and 1943 section 5 the last of these provisions however may have some b earing on the situation leading to the adoption of the full funding policy as reprinted in united states code congressional and administrative service 82 nd cong 1st sess 1951 vol 2 pp 13361337 the senate armed services comm ittee in its report srept 118 february 21 1951 on the bill hr 1001 stated section 5 of the bill rescinds certain of the outstanding authorizations for ships presently held by the navy it is the opinion of the comm ittee that this is an incomplete approach to problem which must be solved at the earliest possible moment checks indicate that there are many additional authorizations still outstanding under wh ich the navy could construct or convert ship tonnage which makes it extremely difficult for the committ ee to visualize just what is the current situation insofar as aut horization to co nstruct vessels is concerned accordingly the navy department has been instructed to submit to the congress at the earliest possible date legislation which will clean up all outstanding ship authorizations which are not needed to implement the present naval modernization program the committee was informed that such legislation has been drafted and is in the process of being cleared by the executive branch for submission to the congress for this reason the committee does not intend to recommend any changes in section 5 of the bill as it passed the house but fully expects that this plan of cancelling old authorizations be completed in systematic manner within the shortest time possible emphasis added the committees report also states the bill authorizes total of 140 major new vessels weighing approximately 500000 tons and the conversion of 292 vessels the cost of the program is 1070949000 for new construction and 1297143000 for conversion totaling 2358092000 this may be statement of the fully funded cost of the ships in question

funds at the outset for the total estimated cost of given item so that the congress and the public can clearly see and have complete knowledge of the full dimensions and cost of any item or program when it is first presented for an appropriation during the course of these hearings the committee has learned that one or more contracts have been executed for material on partially funded basis with the apparent expectation of completing the financing by ultimately fully obligating the transactions with succeeding years appropriations it is recommended that all necessary action be taken to prevent such practice in the future and to insure that procurement funds are administered so as to accomplish the full program for which the appropriation was justified on may 21 1957 the office of the secretary of defense issued dod directive 72004 funding of procurement contracts and interdepartmental requests and orders for procurement which had been in preparation this directive was responsive to the suggestions expressed by congressman mahon in his letter of may 15 1957 the directive was issued for the purpose of ensuring the orderly execution of the procurement programs within the appropriations and funds available it states in part that procurement of material equipment or work or services in connection therewith shall be directed or authorized unless adeq uate appropriations and funds are available under the applicable department of defense financial plan 1 for obligation 2 set aside in the form of commitment or 3 t aside in reserve account in an aggregate amount sufficient to complete the procurement of specified number of end items including where applicable initial spares and spare parts usable either in service units or for test and evaluation or b when specifically provided for under current apportionment of funds to complete preproduction program or procure components in advance of the fiscal year in which the related programmed end item is directed to be procured the directive also requires that all estimates shall be based upon the latest available firm prices in the event firm prices are not available the best current working estimate of cost shall be used and adjustments will be made promptly when evidence of significant variation in costs becomes available the directive expressed funding policies for all procurement actions subsequent to fiscal year 1957 and requires that all procurements not wholly consummated but entered into up and including fiscal year 1957 be modified to conform to the full funding concept procurements from research and developm ent appropriations are not subject to the provisions of the directive and other procurements may be specifically excepted by the secretary of defense from its provisions under these provisions exceptions were granted to the air force for activities undertaken under procurement appropriations for developmenttype projects such as the intermediate range ballistic missile and the intercontinental ballistic missile though the directive does not employ the term full funding it states the concepts which express the essentials of full funding

subcommittee on the department of defense senate committee on appropriations the assistant secretary of defense comptroller summarized the answers to certain questions which had arisen during the hearings on dod appropriations concerning dod directive 72004 this letter subsequently placed in the record of the hearings explained the provisions of the subject directive and its implementation in fulfillment of the full funding principle which it noted had been applied generally by the congress in providing funds for dod procurement programs dod officials still cite the letter as authoritative in describing their procedures in illustration of the full funding principle the assistant secretary stated in his letter that it has the merit of providing at one time for the total estimated cost of given item or program so that the congress and public can clearly see its full dimensions and costs at the time it is first presented for approval and appropriations as you are well aware this system provides that when any department directs contracting officer to procure hundred aircraft tanks etc funds must be available and set asidesome for obligation at once and some for obligation at later date to cover the total estimated cost to be incurred in completing delivery of one hundred usable end items plus their initial spares and spare parts when required the letter from the assistant secretary also clarified the use of full funding of preproduction preparations for new items to be procured and placed in production in subsequent year the latter clarified also the treatment of advance procurement of longleadtime components budget estimating and cost increases under the full funding concept the military services issued formal implementation instructions on the full funding concept at different points in time the secretary of the navy instruction 70432 was dated june 22 1957 army regulations 3742 was sic issued on july 1 1957 letter from the deputy chief of staff material united states air force to the commander air force materiel command implementing dod directive 72004 was dated august 20 1957 as noted above the air force was granted exceptions from the full funding requirements for certain programs in the fiscal year 1963 budget these included the atlas titan minuteman and skybolt missile procurement programs which were incrementally funded to cover only expenditures plus contractor commitments the assistant secretary of defense comptroller felt however that the capability existed in 1962 to develop realistic programs and budgets for air force ballistic missiles on fully funded basis and establish consistent policy for funding all procurement programs subsequently the deputy assistant secretary of defense comptroller issued instructions to the military services on march 30 1962 that the fiscal year 1964 budget be developed on the basis of providing new obligational authority to fully fund all budget line items and specifically the air forces atlas titan minuteman and skybolt missile procurement programs it was recognized with the office of the secretary of defense that the implementation of the full funding policy would require change in air force missile contracting from the work effort basis to the basis of the total cost of delivery for specific number of missiles the exception for air force ballistic missiles which had been in effect for several years represented carryover of research and development funding policies of those items shipbuilding has been the procurement program most consistently reviewed and revised within dod with respect to full funding this is due to the length of procurement leadtime 3 to 7 years depending primarily on the type of ship procedures have been refined as the need arose from the unique nature of the product prior to the fiscal year 1961 budget ship cost

rates existing at the time the estimates were prepared with increases over the initial estimates being provided for by requesting additional funds in subsequent years or by reducing shipbuilding programs the fiscal year 1961 budget initiated new policy in financing shipbuilding programs termed end cost budgeting construction and conversion cost estimates in that budget represented the full amount required to complete all ships in the 1961 fiscal year and prior years programs and included allowances for such growth factors as design and minor characteristics changes and changes in labor and material rates which would affect costs during construction and conversion periods through the fiscal year 1965 budget the projected costs included estimates for the correction of deficiencies in new ship through its first overhaul this period was curtailed by navships instruction 730125a dated november 24 1967 to period of 11 months following preliminary acceptance trials or through post shakedown availab ility whichever is earlier for fiscal year 1964 and subsequent ship programs recent navy programbudget decision scn shipbuilding and conversion navy financial policy and funding of prior year programs approved by the deputy secretary of defense on december 9 1968 refined the definition of full funding as it applied to ships estimates for outfitting and postdelivery deficiency corrections would be funded when required that is funded on leadtime basis rather than as part of the basic estimate this change in application of the full funding concept to shipbuilding put shipbuilding procurement on the same basis as aircraft and electronics procurement with respect to postdelivery costs and outfitting it also resulted in substantial reduction of fiscal year 1969 and prior years funding requirements for shipbuilding programs still in process bureau of the budget now office of management and budget circular a11 issued in july 1962 stated that requests for major procurements and construction programs will provide for full financing of the complete cost revision to circular a11 39 on july 25 1968 stated request for major procurement programs will provide for full financing of the entire cost although the bureau of the budget uses the terms full financing complete cost and entire cost and the office secretary of defense uses the term total cost of an enditem as stated in dod instruction 50008 glossary of terms used in the areas of financial supply and installation management dated june 15 1961 it is generally understood that all four terms refer to the same concept as does the term full funding to supplement the concept of full funding as expressed in dod directive 72004 quoted above we have formulated the following expression of the concept

november 26 1973 on the fy1974 dod appropriation bill hr 11575 the committee on appropriations af firmed the full funding policy and issued warning against the abuse of the exception permitting advance procurement funding the committee is concerned that there is growing tendency in the department of defense dod to abuse the advance procur ement exception to the longestablished principle of full funding the procurement appropriations it is important to understand that the technique of advance procurement is intended to be well defined and narrowlyapplied exception to general rule the basic rule of financing procurement appropriations commonly known as full funding is that each annual budgetary request for quantity of end items of military equipment will contain all of the obligational authority required to deliver those end items in complete and militarily useful fashion said another way procurement budget request should be dependent upon future year appropriations to make it whole this general rule of full funding is well defined in dods own directive 72004 this same directive also clearly defines and limits the one recognized exception to full funding ie the advance procurement technique where an end item of military hardware contains components meeting specified criteria it is permissible for those components to be budgeted in the year prior to the year in which their intended end items will be budgeted the foregoing rules have been carefully drawn after extensive discussions between congressional staff members and representatives of the dod they represent sound policy unfortunately the department of defense has not always adhered to these rules the secretary of defense is requested to personally review advance procurement funding requests proposed for the fiscal year 1975 budget in light of the foregoing direction and dod directive 72004 if there are future abuses of the advance procurement funding concept the committee will have to reconsider the advance procurement technique itself 40 g343g351g349g350g561g10g152g158g156g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g561 the

full funding policy to additional programs in the federal budget41 at this hearing john r quetsch principal deputy assistant secretary comptroller department of defense provided dods perspective on the full funding policy he began by summarizing the history of the policy in fashion very similar to the above excerpt from the 1969 gao report he stated that the policy was first applied to the navy shipbuilding program authorized by the act of march 10 195142 and that once the principle was established for shipbuilding it was gradually 40 hrept 93662 pp 147148 41 us congress house committee on

letter to the secretary of defense from representative mahon and the secretarys issuance on may 21 1957 of dod directive 72004 which he like gao characterized as responsive to the suggestions expressed by congressman mahon in his letter of may 15 1957 he stated that in 1961 because of the problems that were veloping as result of the exception for shipbuilding wherein costs for changes and escalation were not being included in the original budget request the department of defense proposed and both the house appropriations committee and the senate appropriations committee concurred the funds should be included for all predicted costs through completion of ship construction he stated that as result of gaos 1969 report dod directive 72004 was updated and strengthened on october 30 1969 this version of the directive continues in full force and effect today he then noted the endorsement of the policy in the 1973 house appropriation committee report43 as part of list of some considerations which are derivative from the policy he stated once funds are appropriated by the congress the principle creates an incentive for us to try to manage the program within our estimate the whole system for the reprogramming of funds for procurement and military construction programs system which has been carefully worked out with the congress over many years is predicated on the full funding principle if we were able to apply all current year funds to current year requirements and defer consideratio n of cost growth to the year in which the expenditure would be required the congress and the public would lose substantial visibility if major procurement and construction programs were incrementally funded future congresses would be committed to financing the balance of incremental starts incremental funding would inject more uncertainty into our planning and cause the defense industry to be more skeptical of the stability of dod procurement and construction programs this we believe would translate into higher costs because longterm costsaving capital investments are highly dependent upon perceived program stability continued applied to the shipbuilding program that was authorized by this law 43 he also noted that the house appropriations committee affirmed the full funding policy in its report hrept 94 530 october 3 1975 on the fy1976 military constr uction appropriations bill h r 10029 the committees affirmation which appears on pages 2223 relates to military construction projects rather than to the procurement of weapons and equipment in the dod appropriations bill the committee stated that it notes the comments of the committee on armed services of the senate on phasing or incrementing the authorization of major projects the committ ee agrees with the committee on armed services of the senates comments on the undesirability of such procedures and wishes to remind the services and the department of defense that it is the policy of the committee on appropriations of the house of representatives to provide full funding of major construction programs for the military in those few situations where phased funding is n ecessary to provide adequate congressional control over the use of appropriated funds partial funding of certain projects may be necessary but these instances are few and far between and usually result from unexpected developments in major construction program or poor management in particular partial funding is not to be recommended as way of sharing the wealth by dividing services annual construction budget between as many major claimants as possible

effects on unobligated balances he stated now if the objective were to reduce unobligated balances this incremental approach does that however some unobligated balances would still be required to cover contingencies termination liabilities and other uncertainties the key point in my judgment centers on the fact that the expenditures under both approaches are the same it is expenditures and not unobligated balances which influence the governments need to borrow money since th approaches are equal in this regard the department of defense continues to prefer full funding for procurement and military construction because of the stronger manageme nt control and discipline inherent in this policy while there is the temptation to reduce given fiscal years budget by abandoning the full funding policy and applying prior year unobligated balances this temptation should be resisted the net result would be little change in our annual requests for appropriations instead of dealing with the full cost of new starts in our procurement and construction programs the congress would have to address not only the incremental costs of new starts but also the incremental requirements of previously approved programs in the absence of any advantages of incremental funding in the areas of reduced expenditures or requirements for budget authority the advantages of full funding in the other areas i mentioned are evident 44 when asked whether dod has experienced any operational or procedural problems with the full funding policy he replied we have we like the policy but nothing is free there are two kinds of problems basicallythose internal and those external the external ones i think you are familiar with primarily the criticism of our unobligated balances we basically feel if you go for the principle which is good you have to accept the unobligated balances i will discuss the internal ones basically they are the human resistance to discipline we expect fully funded program to be some sort of commitment on the part of the program manager that he can produce that program that end result that thing at that price and what often happens is people do not like to do that they want to get their foot in the doorthey want to get us they want to get omb they want to get the congress committed to programs to the point where we have to bail them out almost all the internal procedure problems stem from that we have to review as almost every level in dod does the cost estimates to make sure they are realistic and achievable we have not always been successful again going back to the shipbuilding program which is most dramatic we have to include line items for cost growth and escalation because our original estimates were not adequate particularly in period of high and unpredicted inflation we have resisted that in recent years successfully but it can be problem when you run into unexpected inflation or any other unexpected amounts 45 44 ibid pp 1014 45 ibid pp 1617

full funding approach he replied yes sir sometimes at some expense to other programs that is in enforcing the discipline in some cases rather than come back to the congress for the additional needed money we have had to cancel programs in order to complete others or have had to reduce some programs in order to complete others but we certainly feel the discipline on the program manager has paid off substantially because he does know that he has made commitment and he will have to live with it and that he or some fellow program manager will suffer if he does not come in at the budgeted price 46 later in the hearing he stated by appropriating the money on full finding basis you automatically subject it to the reporting and accounting discipline of the agencies involved in addition you have an obligated balance to look at under full funding you do not have any unobligated balances to look at under incremental funding you have measure on the books you have original plan which you can hold the agency to and actually expect them to reflect on the books they can come up every year and explain what happened in the preceding year but not by month sic you cannot see how the project manager is spending against his original estimate and his obligation against his original estimate it full funding gives you on the books of the government record 47 at this same hearing w bowman cutter executive associate director for budget at omb testifying in support of the carter administrations proposal to apply the full funding concept more comprehensively through the federal budget stated the president believes that full funding is desirable because it provides clearer understanding of the total effect of budget proposals since full funding requires appropriations in terms of total costs for an entire project at the time any funding is provided increases flexibility in programming and the ability of the government to speed up the project if changes in economic conditions warrant acceleration permits construction progress at more economic rates with resulting savings to the government by providing program continuity and eliminating uneconomic startup and stop costs that sometimes accompany incremental funding 48 donald scantlebury director of financial and gene ral management studies at gao stated at the hearing 46 ibid p 17 47 ibid p 22 48 ibid p 5 italics as in the

agency to contract for the full cost of an item or items such as ships with the knowledge that full obligational authority is available to complete the item or items and that completion of the work will not be held up or stretched out by budget cuts or funding delays prior to the institution of full funding funds were provided in annual increments shipbuilding has often been used as an example of explaining the fullfunding concept because of the length of procurement lead which ranges from 3 to 7 years depending primarily on the type of ship each year authority was granted for only portion

critical to safeguarding congresss ability to control overall federal expenditures and to assess the impact of the federal budget on the economy without upfront funding projects may be undertaken without adequate attention being given to their overall costs and benefits moreover failure to fully funding projects before they are undertaken can distort the allocation of budge resources and obscure the impact of federal budgetary action on the private sector only few agencies including the army corps of engineers one of our case studies have been exempted from the upfront funding requirement despite these agencies use of incremental funding 51 omb has taken steps to encour age consistent application of upfront funding across government in the future52 the report amplified on these points two pages later although possibly problematic for individual agencies upfront funding has long been recognized as an important tool for maintaining governmentwide fiscal control the requirement that budget authority be provided upfront before the government enters into any commitment was established over 100 years ago in the adequacy of appropriations act and the antideficiency act these acts responded to past problems in which agencies committed the government to payments that ex ceeded the resources made available to them by congress the importance of the principle was reinforced by the 1967 report of the presidents commission on budget concepts which emphasized the primary purposes of the budget as being the efficient allocation of resources and the formulation of fiscal policy to benefit the 49 ibid p 6 50 government accountability office budget issues budgeting for federal capital gaoaimd975 november 1996 51 the gao report has footnote at this point defining

is essential for efficient resource allocation decisions because it helped ensure that the congress considers the full cost of all proposed commitments and makes tradeoffs based on full costs to be useful in the formulation of fiscal policy the budget must be able to highlight the impact of the federal budget on the economy for this purpose the requirement for upfront funding also serves the congress well the point at which capital spending has the largest and most direct economic impact on the private sector occurs at the point the commitment is made that is upfrontnot over the expected lifetime of longlived asset failure to recognize the full cost of particul ar type of expenditure when budget decisions are being made could lead to distortions in th allocation of resources in other words if particular types of spending such as for physical assets were given preferential treatment in the budget by virtue of recognizing only fraction of their total cost then it is likely that relatively more spending for those types of assets would occur while advocates for purchasing some federal assets may see this as desirable end such an outcome may not accurately reflect the nations needs in particul ar other types of federal spending that also provide longterm benefits but that are not physical assets including research and development and spending for human capital would be arbitrarily disadvantaged in the budget process even if national priorities remain unchallenged furthermore failure to fully fund capital projects at the time the commitment is entered into can force future congresses and administrations to choose between having an unusable asset and continuing projects funding for years even after priorities may have changed for example if the congress provides funding for only part of project and that part is not usable absent completion of the entire project then the congress and the administration may feel compelled to continue funding in the future to avoid wasting the initial partial funding that was already spent thus if capital projects are begun without full funding future congresses and administrations may in effect be forced to commit greater share of their annual resources to fulfilling past commitments and thus have less flexibility to respond to new or changing needs as they arise 53 in the final chapter of its report gao stated full upfront funding is one of the tools that has been important to facilitating fiscal control and comparisons of the longterm costs of spending alternatives an essential part of prudent capital planning must be an adherence to full upfront funding when full upfront funding is not practiced the congress risks committing the government to capital acquisitions without determining whether the project is affordable over the longterm incremental funding also compels future congresses to fund project in order to prevent wasting resources previously appropriated as budget constraints continue incremental funding may lock the congress into future spending patterns and reduce flexibility to respond to new needs in the budget process fully funded projects may be disadvantaged in competition with incrementally funded projectseven when the fully funded projects actually cost less in the long run however full upfront funding can impede agencies ability to economically acquire capital in an environment of resource constraints full upfront funding of relatively expensive capital acquisitions can consume large share of an agencys annual budget thereby forcing todays decisionmakers to pay all at once for projects with longlived benefits while various capital budgeting proposals have been advanced to address this the proposals themselves have raised significant concern because of their potential diminution of fiscal accountability and control consequently agencies need financing tools that can provide the fiscal control of upfront 53 ibid pp 3637

within the current unified budget frame work54 gao observed and concluded the following the requirement of full upfront funding is an essential too in helping the congress make tradeoffs among various spending alternatives however in an environment of constrained budgetary resources agencies need tools that can help facilitate these tradeoffs and that enable them to accommodate upfront funding furthermore to successfully implement gpras requirement for program performance measures 55 managers will also need to know the full costs of their programsincluding capital usage some have recommend that the government adopt fullscale capital budget but this raises major budget control issues and may not be necessary to address agencyidentified impediments to capital spending rather our case studies 56 demonstrate that more modest tools such as revolving funds investment components and budgeting for standalone stages can help accommodate upfront funding without ra ising the congressional or fiscal control issues of separate capital budget57 as matter for congressional consideration the gao report recommended the following although requiring that budget authority for the full cost of acquisitions be provided before an acquisition is made allows the congress to control capital spending at the time commitment is made it also presents challenges because the entire cost for these relatively expensive acquisitions must be absorbed in the annual budget of an agency or program fixed assets may seem prohibitively expensive despite their longterm benefits this report describes some strategies that number of agencies have used to manage this dilemma the congress should consider enabling agencies to use more flexible budgeting mechanisms that accommodate upfront funding over the longer term while providing appropriate oversight and control for agencies having proven financial management and capital planning capabilities and relatively small ongoing capital needs these techniques could include revolving funds and investment components such techniques enable agencies to accumulate resources over period of year s in order to finance certain capital needs promote full costing of programs and activities by including costs related to capital usage in program budgets and provide degree of funding predictability to aid in longrange planning as gpra move toward full implementation these and other tools may take on increasing importance in helping managers and the congress to identify program costs and to more efficiently manage capital assets 58 54 ibid p 81 55

senate budget committee the gao prepared briefing on incremental funding of capital asset acquisitions including an assessment of the implications for future dod budgets if the navys shipbuilding and conversion account were to change from incremental to full funding the briefing was given to the staff of senate budget committee in december 2000 and was subsequently given to staff from the senate armed services committee the senate appropriations committee and the house appropriations committee in february 2001 gao prepared letter to the senator pete domenici the chairman of the senate budget committee and other congressional recipients summarizing the briefing and enclosing the briefing slides59 as summarized in the letter the gao briefing concluded the following in part if the navy shipbuilding and conversion account were to be moved from full to incremental funding for given period of time this would not allow the navy to procure more ships for given amount of funding additional ships would require additional funding after the initial year incremental funding reduces the amount of budget authority available to fund new ships in any given fiscal year because portion of the funding must be devoted to completing ships partially funded in prior years in addition there is risk of cost growth associated with all capital projectscost growth has occurred with fully funded projects as well as incrementally funded projects any cost growth on ships partially funded in prior years would further reduce the funding available for new ships in addition costs and commitments continue beyond the year depicted in the briefing slides in all scenarios there are several other budgetary implications as well as acquisition management issues related to incremental funding for the navy and for agencies in general in general full funding ensures that the full estimated costs of decisions are recognized at the time that the commitment is made incremental funding erodes future fiscal flexibility for programs such as shipbuilding because funding is dedicated to completing procurements begun in previous years according to dod and omb officials incremental funding also limits cost visibility and accountability these officials believe that acquisition estimates are likely to increase because there would be an incentive to l ow ball the estimate at the beginning additionally contractors may hedge their bets on pricing because they may not be able to take advantage of economies of scale that can come with longerterm and more certain commitments the use of incremental funding and leasepurchase arrangements in the past has had some negative consequences for example 1996 gao report 60 cited incremental funding as key factor underlying department of energy project cost overruns and schedule delays another gao report61 found that the use of longterm leases for auxiliary ships in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in higher costs per ship 59 letter dated
