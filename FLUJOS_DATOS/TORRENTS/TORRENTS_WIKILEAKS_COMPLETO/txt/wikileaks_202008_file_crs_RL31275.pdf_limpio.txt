divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275health insurance federal data sources for analyses of the uninsured summary the number of people without health insurance continues to be key public policy concern numerous sources of data both public and private gather information on the uninsured but they produce estimates that vary widely this report discusses estimates of the number of uninsured using data from four federally administered surveys the march supplement to the current population survey cps the survey of income and program participation sipp the national health interview survey nhis and the medical expenditure panel survey meps in 1998 the most recent year for which data are available from all four surveys estimates of the number of uninsured for the full year ranged from 212 million using sipp data to 436 million using data from the march cps difference of more than 22 million individuals estimates of the number of uninsured at point in time as well as the number who were ever uninsured during the year also vary among meps nhis and sipp the march cps does not support these estimates the number of uninsured at point in time in 1998 ranged from 392 million from sipp to 423 million from meps estimates of the number who were ever uninsured during 1998 ranged from 500 million from nhis to 603 million from meps to date clear consensus has emerged that explains why these differences exist in the survey estimates of the uninsured however researchers have offered number of explanations that may account for some of the variation these include the surveys ask different questions and use different methodologies to determine who is insured compared to administrative data the surveys report estimates of the percent enrolled in medicaid that indicate an underreporting of medicaid coverage by survey respondents which would affect uninsured estimates the surveys differ in the amount of time for which they ask individuals to remember their health insurance status individuals who are asked to report their status for period of time might not accurately report changes in their health insurance status over that period and the surveys are designed in ways that permit different types of analyses but may limit comparability of the results for example while the sipp and meps allow researchers to track the same individuals over period of years this is not possible using the cps or nhis therefore the varying designs of the surveys permit different types of analyses of health insurance status but the comparability of the estimates may be limited the march cps produces the most widely cited uninsured statistics as the data are timely and can produce estimates for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia while differences in the uninsured estimates persist among the surveys the nhis sipp and meps offer additional data to explore questions about the uninsured for example the nhis contains data to relate health insurance status to health risk factors and general health issues while sipp and meps both are useful in examining changes in health insurance and other characteristics over time httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275contents

httpaspeosdhhsgovhealthreportshiestimateshtm lewis kimball ellwood marilyn and czajka john l counting the uninsured review of the literature the urban institute june 1998 httpnewfederalismurbanorghtmlocc8htm and fronstin paul counting the uninsured comparison of national surveys by employee benefit research institute issue brief 225 september 2000 health insurance federal data sources for analyses of the uninsured the number of individuals without health insurance continues to be key public policy concern the majority of the us population receives coverage through employmentbased plans and employers generally contribute to the cost of purchasing health insurance changes in employment often lead to disruption or loss of health coverage as individuals who lose an employers health benefit contribution often consider the cost of purchasing health insurance on their own too high other working people do not have insurance because their employer does not offer health insurance coverage for these individuals policies to reduce the cost of health insurance such as tax credits or other types of subsidies may increase their enrollment in health coverage public programs such as medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip provide health insurance for certain groups of lowincome families with children but these programs have eligibility requiremen ts that may prevent other uninsured individuals from qualifying for coverage at the same time number of individuals eligible for health insurance through these public programs are not enrolled and are therefore included in current estimates of the number of uninsured for these groups additional outreach activities could increase enrollment in these existing programs given the various reasons individuals lack health insurance coverage analysis of the effectiveness of proposal to reduce the number of uninsured such as those discussed above requires examining characteristics of individuals with and without health insurance coverage numerous sources of data have emerged over time that support estimates of the uninsured however each data source differs in how it collects information from individuals as well as the amount of information it collects related to health insurance status therefore the estimates of the number of uninsured produced by these data sources vary widely1 because proposals to reduce the number of uninsured are informed by estimates of the number of individuals without health insurance as well as the characteristics of the uninsured population determining the appropriate source of data to evaluate these proposals is importanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs2 2 there are other federal sources for estimates of the uninsured including the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss and the national survey of family growth nsfg we did not include these particular surveys because they are not representative of the entire us population brfss collects information only on the adult who answers the phone which excludes all of the children and the other adults in the household the responding adult is not necessarily representative of the rest of the household particularly the children nsfg valuable survey of womens health limits its sample to women aged 15 to 44 in addition it does not occur annually the latest survey was conducted in 1995 there are also nonfederal sources for estimates of the uninsured analysis of these sources is beyond the scope of this report 3 we chose to discuss the surveys in this order simply for the benefit of our readers it is not intended to represent any surveys importance or reliabilitythis report outlines the major advantages and limitations of four federally administered surveys2 the march supplement to the current population survey cps the survey of income and program participation sipp the national health interview survey nhis and the medical expenditure panel survey meps in providing estimates of the uninsured population3 it begins by briefly describing the characteristics of each of these four surveys estimates of the uninsured from these datasets are then presented followed by discussion of possible reasons for the variation among the estimates finally the report discusses potential areas in which each data source might be useful to respond to questions of interest to policymakers in outlining proposals to reduce the number of uninsured in brief all four surveys support representative estimates of the uninsured us civilian noninstitutionalized population although the health insurance questions asked among the surveys differ the march cps produces the most widely cited statistics on the number of uninsured because the data provide the most recent fullyear information and because the data may produce estimates that are representative for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia however its focus is not health insurance but work income and poverty statistics and it does not delve deeply into issues of insurance coverage additionally the march cps provides estimates only of those who were without health insurance for the entire year as opposed to those without insurance for some portion of the year the nhis sipp and meps can not provide statelevel analysis similar to the march cps but these surveys do offer additional data to explore many questions about the uninsured for example the nhis contains data to relate health insurance status to health risk factors and general health issues additionally sipp and meps collect data for every month that the individual is part of the survey and therefore in addition to providing estimates of those without health insurance for an entire year these surveys may also be used to examine changes in health insurance and other characteristics monthtomonth or over period of time tasks that are not possible using the march cps meps also asks the most comprehensive questions about the type and source of peoples health insurance with data from these four surveys it is possible to answer many questions about the uninsured because the estimates among the surveys differ by so much however the results should always be interpreted with some caution until the differences can be reconciled httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs3 4 for each state the allocation is based on 3year average of the number of uninsured children under 19 years of age in families below 200 of the poverty thresholds in some states the number of children in these lowincome families for whom the cps obtains data may be small this may cause the estimates to be less reliable and increase the variability in the estimates of the uninsured from year to year the 3year averages are used to counter these effectsoverview of the surveys appendix illustrates in tabular format the characteristics of the four surveys discussed in this report each of these surveys is briefly described below march supplem ent to the current population survey cps the cps conducted by the us census bureau is the primary source of information on the labor force characteristics of the us civilian noninstitutionalized population the cps is crosssectional survey which means that it does not have the ability to track the same individuals from year to year although cps interviews take place every month the questions regarding health insurance status are asked only in march in the cpss annual demographic survey often referred to as the march supplement at which time individuals are asked to identify their sources of health insurance for the entire preceding year therefore the march supplement to the cps herein referred to as the march cps supports estimates only of those who do not have health insurance for the entire year preceding their march interview of the four surveys reviewed in this report the cps has the largest sample size approximately 50000 households and is the only one of the four surveys able to produce representative estimates for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the formula that allocates funds to states for the schip uses cps statelevel data4 the census bureau releases data from the march cps around september every year the most recent data available are from the march 2001 cps and these data represent the previous calendar year so the march 2001 cps represents information for all of 2000 of the four surveys reviewed in this report the march cps data provide the most recent fullyear information on the uninsured however because the march cps data is not designed to allow researchers to track individuals who may remain in the sample from year to year it cannot pinpoint changes in an individuals health insurance status across time therefore researchers using the march cps can estimate the total number of uninsured for given year and compare the total number of uninsured across number of years for example 1997 through 1999 but can not examine individual changes in health insurance coverage through out the year or estimate the number of uninsured at specific point in time during the year survey of income and program participation sipp in addition to the cps the census bureau also conducts the sipp survey with detailed information on respondents income as well as their participation in government programs unlike the cps the sipp is longitudinal survey which means that individuals who are part of the sample are interviewed multiple times over the life of the survey referred to as panel so that changes in various individual characteristics may be observed respondents in the sipp sample are interviewed every four months with these cycles referred to as waves historically the sipp panels ranged in duration from 2½httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs4 5 the core content of these files is available the sipp also includes additional survey questions that are included in selected waves on special topics these questions are referred to as topical modules examples include topical modules on health care expenditures and utilization disabilities and limitations and home health careyears to 4 years although representative at the national level sipp does not support reliable statebystate estimates the sample size is approximately 37000 households the most recent available data are from the 1996 sipp panel which followed sample of individuals for 4 years through march 20005 given the longitudinal design of the sipp as discussed above these data may be used to estimate the total number of people uninsured for any month for any part of the year for an entire year or over the life of the panel the next sipp panel which will be over 3year period began earlier this year with the first wave of results expected in the first quarter of 2002 however there is set schedule for sipp data releases national health interview survey nhis the national center for health statistics nchs oversees nhis survey completed annually to gather information on americans health similar to the cps the nhis is crosssectional survey and therefore does not allow analyses of the same people from year to year nhis is representative of the us civilian noninstitutionalized population and has the ability to produce estimates for some large states however statelevel estimates for all 50 states and the district of columbia are not supported the sample size is approximately 42000 households the most recent available data from nhis are for 2000 although nhis is similar to the cps because it is crosssectional survey the nhis collects more detailed information on health insurance status among the survey sample than the march cps therefore nhis can produce estimates of the total number of people who were ever uninsured during the year for the entire year or at the time of the survey in addition to health insurance status nhis collects detailed health information on illnesses chronic conditions activity limitations and health risk behaviors another benefit of nhis is that the survey serves as the sampling framework for number of other smaller federally administered surveys such as the medical expenditure panel survey discussed below and the national survey of family growth nsfg therefore individuals in these smaller surveys have also been interviewed in nhis by linking these datasets researchers may have broader collection of healthrelated information for subset of the population medical expenditure panel survey meps the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq administers meps in conjunction with nchs meps has been conducted annually since 1996 it is the most recent in series of medical expenditure surveys that began in 1977 as the national medical care expenditure survey and later became the national medical expenditure survey nmes the primary focus of meps is on the use of and expenditures for health care meps is longitudinal survey like the sipp and interviews the same individuals five times over period of 2 years meps does not support statelevel estimates of the uninsured although like the other three surveys discussed above it does provide nationally representative picture of the us civilian noninstitutionalized populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs5 6 as mentioned above the nhis serves as the sampling framework for meps and therefore the meps survey sample is subsample of the previous years nhis sample which is considerably larger 7 for sipp and meps the percentage of uninsured for the full year excludes those who did not provide data for all 12 monthsmeps has the smallest sample size of the surveys with 12000 eligible households interviewed each year unique to meps are the overlapping panels although individuals are followed for 2 years each year new sample is drawn from the previous years nhis so the sample is replenished annually6 for example the 1998 fullyear meps data represents information from year 2 of households in the 1997 panel and year 1 of households in the 1998 panel the implications of this are discussed in greater detail later in this report the most recent available fullyear data for meps is 1998 however meps also produces pointintime files which represent the first 6 months of given year pointintime information is available for 2000 researchers using the fullyear meps data can estimate the total number of uninsured for any month for any part of the year for an entire year or over the life of the panel in addition to health insurance status meps supplies the most detailed information about americans health insurance benefits and premiums as well as on health care use and spending comparing uninsured statistics among the surveys figure 1 illustrates statistics on the uninsured from 1998 the most recent year in which the full data from all four surveys are available all four surveys provide nationally representative picture of the us population however the estimates of the uninsured vary widely among the surveys as figure 1 illustrates these uninsured estimates are presented in tabular format in appendix b in 1998 using data from the march cps 436 million individuals 163 of the us civilian noninstitutionalized population were uninsured for the entire year this compares to 315 million 118 from meps nhis estimates that 258 million 97 were uninsured for all of 1998 using sipp data this number was 212 million 79 which is less than half of the march cps estimate difference of more than 22 million people7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs6 8 for the pointintime estimate sipp data are from march 1998 nhis data are from interviews throughout the year and meps data are from the first half of

service crs analysis of the march cps sipp nhis and meps notes as discussed in the memorandum the march cps does not support estimates of the number uninsured at the time of the survey or the number ever uninsured during the year and therefore is not illustrated estimates for the number uninsured at the time of the survey pointintime estimate using sipp data are from march 1998 while nhis data are from interviews throughout the year and meps data are from the first half of 1998 for sipp and meps the percentage of uninsured for the full year and at any time excludes those who did not provide data for all 12 months examining the number uninsured at point in time yields higher estimates than the fullyear analysis as illustrated in figure 1 392 million 146 from sipp 395 million 147 from nhis and 423 million 158 from meps the march cps does not support these estimates8 compared to the number uninsured for an entire year the pointintime estimates among these three surveys is higher because the number of people uninsured at point in time would include those uninsured for the entire year plus those individuals who were uninsured at the time of the survey httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs7 9 for sipp and meps as with the full year estimates the percentage of uninsured at any time excludes those who did not provide data for all 12 monthsfinally figure 1 also illustrates estimates of those ever uninsured during the year from nhis meps and sipp the march cps does not support these estimates as illustrated in figure 1 these estimates are higher than the pointintime estimates produced in each survey this is expected since the estimate of those who were ever uninsured during the year would include everyone uninsured at the time of the survey plus those individuals who were uninsured at any other time during the year nhis estimates that 500 million individuals 189 were ever uninsured in 1998 this compares to 552 million 207 using sipp and 603 million 227 based on meps9 potential reasons for variation in survey estimates of the uninsured as figure 1 illustrates the estimates of the uninsured among the surveys vary substantially the march cps produces the largest estimate of the number of uninsured for full year and sipp produce s the lowest estimate meps produces estimates of the uninsured that are higher than nhis and sipp in every time frame measured the following discussion describes differences among the surveys that may account for some of the variation in the estimates health insurance verification question one explanation for the differences in the uninsured estimates may be the variation in how the surveys determine who is uninsured until 2000 the march cps asked respondents generally an adult giving information on everyone in the household whether anyone in the family was enrolled in number of health insurance coverage categories including private health insurance medicare and medicaid at any time during the entire preceding year if respondent answered yes to any of the sources of coverage the names of those with that coverage was requested therefore the march cps produces estimates of the number of individuals ever covered by medicare ever covered by medicaid etc in the entire preceding year the number who do not have health insurance is calculated by looking at the household roster given by the respondent at the start of the interview to determine if source of health insurance coverage was mentioned for every individual those in the household whose names were not given for any source of coverage were then considered uninsured for the entire preceding year however this was not verified with the respondent as there was survey question on the march cps to confirm that those individuals were indeed uninsured for the entire preceding year it is possible that individuals often may not recognize their family members coverage from the interviewers list of health insurance types or that the respondent may simply neglect to mention family members name however when asked directly to confirm that family member was uninsured respondents may be prompted to share that persons coverage to respond to this concern health insurance verification question was added in the march 2000 cps to verify the uninsured status of individuals during 1999 the entire preceding year that is beginning in march 2000 if an individual in the household was not mentioned as being covered by health insurance category thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs8 10 for information on the insured and uninsured population in 2000 based on the march 2001 cps see crs report 96891 health insurance coverage characteristics of the insured and uninsured populations in 2000 by chris l peterson 11 see nelson charles t and robert j mills the march cps health insurance verification question and its effect on estimates of the uninsured august 2001 httpwwwcensusgovhheshlthinsverifhtml 12 u s bureau of the census comparative analysis of health insurance coverage estimates data from cps and sipp by robert l bennefield 1996 hereafter cited as bennefield comparative analysis of health insurance coverage estimates respondent was asked to verify that this individual was in fact uninsured in the entire preceding year in an analysis of this new question conducted by the census bureau released in august 2001 about 8 of those previously calculated as uninsured because they did not indicate that they were covered by any source of health insurance coverage when asked directly whether they were in fact uninsured indicated that they did have coverage because this analysis was conducted after the march 2000 cps data had been released it was not included the original data source however the analysis completed by the census bureau indicates that had these results been available and included when the data were first released the census bureau would have reported that the number of uninsured was 393 million in 1999 33 million less than the 426 million previously published because of these results the census bureau is making the verification question permanent part of the survey and beginning with the march 2001 cps their estimates of the uninsured will be based on the verification question10 however results without the verification question will also be available for those wanting to make historical comparisons11 figure 2 compares selected health insurance coverage estimates from the march cps with and without the verification question to the sipp the only other survey that has released comparable fullyear data for 1999 although the verification question led to significant decrease in the number of uninsured reported by the march cps to 393 million people 143 it is still much higher than the sipp estimate of 212 million uninsured individuals 77 in 1999 difference of 181 million people 66 percentage points before the addition of the verification question census bureau staff had analyzed differences between the march cps and the sipp12 they concluded that the differences were probably due largely to issues with the march cps in particular underreporting of private coverage the addition of the verification question to the march cps addressed this in part by increasing the march cps estimates of the percent ever covered by private health insurance during the year to 721 compared to the previous estimate of 710 while this narrowed the gap between the march cps and the sipp estimates of the percent enrolled in private health insurance difference of 104 percentage points 281 million people remains as shown in figure 2 the verification question also did little to substantially narrow the gaps between the surveys estimates of those ever covered by medicare or medicaid during the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs9 13 this direct health insurance verification question was added to nhis in 1997 14 from conversations with robin cohen statistician at the national center for health statistics hyattsville maryland who works with the health insurance variables in nhis710 132102143721 13210377825 137 134 155 0102030405060708090100 uninsured private

population source congressional research service crs using censusreported percentages for the march cps and crs analysis of sipp nhis is the only other survey reviewed in this report that includes direct health insurance verification question13 unlike the march cps data however the impact of the verification question on nhis estimates of the uninsured has not been significant14 this may be because of the detailed followup questions asked of nhis respondents when they do not indicate coverage questions such as about how long has it been since you last had health care coverage if respondent had neglected to mention any source of coverage these questions may make the respondent aware of the error and provide the opportunity to correct it the march cps is the only one of the four surveys reviewed in this report that does not ask such detailed followup questions about respondents uninsured status this could explain why the verification question yielded significant difference in estimates of the uninsured in the march cps but not nhis in fact staff at ahrq believe that the addition of direct health insurance verification question in meps would be unnecessary because of the detailed followup questions asked in that surveyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs10 15 ibid 16 the cms data are for fiscal year 1998 the survey data are for the calendar year 1998 17 see employee benefit research institute counting the uninsured comparison of national surveys by paul fronstin 18 for discussion of the reliability of medicaid program data see crs report rl30733 medicaid expenditures and enrollees 1998 by evelyne baumrucker and jean hearnewhile the march cps now includes question to verify that an individual is uninsured it does not attempt to verify the coverage of those who indicate they are insured in the 2000 nhis such question was added that directly asks for confirmation that the person was covered by comprehensive health insurance according to preliminary analysis by nchs most of the respondents who had originally claimed coverage but changed their answer did so because they were covered by lessthancompreh ensive coverage such as dental or workers compensation insurance the impact of this verification question was relatively small and approximately offset the effect of the uninsuredverification question on the nhis15 unfortunately it is not possible to know what effect adding verification question for those claiming insurance might have on the march cps estimates medicaid underreporting another commonly cited concern with the march cps estimates of insurance status is the extent to which the number of people on medicaid may be underestimated in 1998 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formerly known as the health care financing administration reported that 386 million noninstitutionalized americans 142 were covered by medicaid figure 3 compares cmss count of those covered by medicaid to estimates from the march cps sipp and meps in 1998 nhis cannot be used to estimate the number of people ever covered by medicaid during the year the march cps data yield the lowest estimate of the number ever covered by medicaid in 1998 264 million people 97 122 million people less than the number using cms data16 as seen in figure 3 sipp and meps data also produce estimates of medicaid coverage that are lower than cmss tabulations though not as low as the march cps survey respondents may underreport their coverage by medicaid because they do not want to admit being covered by public assistance program and this may also contribute to the lower estimates of medicaid coverage among the march cps sipp and meps when compared to the cms administrative data in addition if surveys list of medicaid programs does not include the particular states name or names of its medicaid program respondents may not affirm that they are on medicaid because the name of their statespecific program was not mentioned for example paper from the employee benefit research institute includes an instance where medicaid managed care plan in maryland was not listed in the march 1999 cps and may have been responsible for undercounting medicaid coverage in that state17 while the march cps sipp and meps report lower number ever covered by medicaid than reported by cms it is worth noting that some analysts believe the data supplied by cms may be of poor quality due to variations in state reporting styles double counting of enrollees and classification errors18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs11 264370 344387 0510152025303540 cms march cps sipp mepsfigure 3 ever covered by medicaid during 1998 us civilian noninstitutionalized population in millions of individualsthe addition of the health insurance verification question beginning with the march 2000 cps was expected to reduce the difference s in the estimate of the number ever covered by medicaid in given year between the cms and the march cps although this report focuses on 1998 data in examining the underreporting of medicaid the addition of the health insurance verification question to the march 2000 cps resulted in approximately 331000 more people being classified as ever covered by medicaid in 1999 again this was the first year this verification question was included as part of the survey therefore while the addition of this question has led to more individuals reporting medicaid coverage it appears that the difference between estimates of medicaid coverage between the march cps and cms remains sizable source congressional research service crs using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the march cps sipp and meps the cms data cover the fiscal year 1998 while the other data are for the calendar year 1998 efforts were made to increase the comparability of these estimates by adjusting the cms data to reflect only the noninstitutionalized population three categories reflect services to the institutionalized medicaid population mental health facility services mhf nursing facility services nfs and intermediate care facility mentally retarded services icfmr it is possible that individuals may receive more than one of these services and therefore simply subtracting all three categories of services may underestimate the total noninstitutionalized medicaid population based on conversations with cms officials the cms number was adjusted for figure 3 by subtracting the number of recipients of nfss and icfsmr however as it is possible that residents of mhf may also receive one of the other two previous services these individuals remain in the estimate accounting for approximately 125000 of the 387 million reported by cmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs12 19 us bureau of census comparative analysis of health insurance coverage estimates data from cps and sipp by robert l bennefield 20 the recent results from the census bureaus paper on the verification question may lend more credence to this statement that paper stated that 89 of those who were initially classified as uninsured but who ultimately reported coverage because of the verification question revealed that they had private coveragerecall period another issue that may explain some of the variation in the uninsured estimates is the length of time respondents are asked to remember their health insurance status the recall period individuals who are asked to report their status for period of time might not accurately report changes in their health insurance status over that period of time the march cps requires respondents to recall their coverage over the longest time period 15 months compared to the other surveys for example respondents were asked in the march 2001 cps about their sources of health insurance coverage during the calendar year 2000 nhis asks about health insurance coverage during the previous 12 months sipp during the previous 4 months and meps during the previous 3 to 5 months the longer the amount of time the more likely that respondents may forget source of coverage particularly if the duration of that coverage was short additionally some respondents when asked to report their health insurance status for the entire preceding year may answer the health insurance questions based on their current coverage if true this could explain why the march cpss fullyear uninsured estimates are higher than those from the other surveys but are similar to their pointintime estimates however aside from similar estimate values as illustrated in figure 1 there is little evidence to support this argument in fact according to the analysis by census bureau staff comparing the march cps and sipp the respondents in the march cps do not report annual health insurance coverage information based on their current status rather than the previous year19 instead the analysis found that the key cause for the differences between the surveys is that march cps respondents tended to underreport health insurance coverage from private sources when compared to sipp respondents20 longitudinal design unlike the cps and nhis the sipp and meps re interview the same people over multiple years in order to track changes over time with respect to health insurance therefore the sipp and meps have the advantage of being able to analyze the duration of spells without insurance on monthtomonth basis and over the entire duration of the panel these longitudinal surveys do present unique issues however with each wave of interviews fewer people respond so the sample size and response rates shrink over the life of the panel in the first wave of the 1996 sipp panel the response rate was 92 but by the final wave 4 years later the response rate was 65 of the original 1996 eligible sample this may affect the estimates of the uninsured if those who are uninsured are either more or less likely to drop out of the survey than those who are insured in other words if over the life of the panel we see the percentage of uninsured individuals dropping this may be because the number is truly dropping or because those who are uninsured are less likely to continue responding and therefore be counted in the surveyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs13 21 this is not major concern for analyses that are of individuals rather than families or households 22 the march cps provides only fullyear estimatesthe sipp follows its respondents for 4 years while meps follows its respondents for 2 years because the meps study period is shorter than the sipp meps does not experience similar reduction in sample size meps is also unique because its panels ie survey samples overlap each year meps is administered to new sample of individuals who are drawn from the previous years nhis sample and these individuals are followed for period of 2 years this allows number of estimates to be produced for example the 1996 meps panel provides information on health care utilization and expenditures for calendar year 1996 and 1997 as the panels are followed for 2 years in addition to the information provided in 1997 by the 1996 panel new panel of individuals is introduced in 1997 for whom information is also collected because information is available for both panels for 1997 they both contribute to calendar year data file for 1997 by combining the two samples the total combined sample size increases therefore attrition will be concern in analyzing data for the same panel of individuals for example looking at 2 years of information for the 1996 meps panel as is the case with the 1996 sipp however the calendar year data which combine the overlapping meps panels are valuable because the larger combined sample size enhances the reliability of estimates produced on the uninsured one advantage of longitudinal analyses is following the changing composition of households and families throughout the life of the panel for example suppose single mother and her two children were uninsured at the time of her first interview for the 1996 sipp this mother would be interviewed 12 times the 4year panel in that time it is possible that she would marry at which point her husband would become part of her family if her husband has health insurance the mother and her two children may then be covered under his health insurance therefore as result of the change in family composition over the survey period in this case marriage the health insurance status of the woman and her children has changed however while panel surveys permit more types of analyses they are also more complicated and care must be taken when using these surveys longitudinal capabilities in order to follow changes in health insurance status over time within families or households it is necessary to decide how the household and family changes will be handled21 fullyear analysis the four surveys in this report can be used to count the uninsured using three different time periods the number of people uninsured for full year at point in time and ever during the year each time period gives analysts slightly different perspective on the uninsured the fullyear estimate looks at those who were chronically uninsured those who were not enrolled in insurance at all during the year however many may move in and out of the ranks of the uninsured approximately twice as many people are ever uninsured during the year compared to the number uninsured for the entire year according to sipp nhis and meps estimates as previously illustrated in figure 1 and shown in appendix b 22 fullyear analyses of the uninsured are also complicated by the presence of those who were not eligible for the survey over the entire year particularly infants definedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs14 23 as result one might expect the fullyear estimate for infants to be closer to the pointin time estimate compared to other age cohorts although our preliminary estimates bear this out an indepth discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this reporthere as those less than year old ahrq economists exclude infants from their full year analyses using meps as they are interested in persons unchanged uninsured status over 12month period however the census bureau includes infants in its estimate of the uninsured and in the formula to allocate funds to states for the schip program the march cps questionnaire flows in such way that infants who were uninsured for their entire lives even if they were alive for only 1 month in the survey year would be counted as uninsured for full year23 individual researchers need to decide what is best for their purposes discussion the four surveys reviewed in this report have unique strengths and limitations resulting from differences in each surveys purpose sample and questions one major concern about the march cps has recently been addressed with the decision to include question that requires respondents to verify that one or more household members are uninsured while the addition of this question has decreased the number reported without health insurance the march cps estimates remain much higher than those from the other surveys nevertheless the march cps continues to be the data source of choice by most for estimates of the uninsured because it provides the most recent fullyear information and is representative of all 50 states and the district of columbia however its focus is not health insurance but work income and poverty statistics and it does not delve deeply into issues of insurance coverage in addition the march cps can not provide estimates of those uninsured at point in time during the year or of those ever uninsured during the year it permits estimates only of those individuals uninsured for the entire year as result the other surveys provide additional useful detail related to peoples enrollment in health insurance and their circumstances without it as policymakers develop proposals to reduce the number of uninsured questions continue to be raised that relate to characteris tics of the uninsured given the limitations of the march cps it becomes important to consider other sources for health insurance information such as those available in nhis meps and sipp for analyses that relate health insurance status to health risk factors and general health issues nhis supplies the most complete data in addition nhis is able to link to other surveys such as meps and the national survey of family growth nsfg which allows researchers to examine broader range of issues while nhis collects more detailed information on health insurance coverage the inability to produce reliable estimates for all 50 states and the district of columbia limits its usefulness in evaluating proposals for the uninsured sipp and meps both are useful in examining changes in health insurance and other characteristics over time because of their longitudinal designs sipp is most valuable in its capacity to relate peoples insurance status to their income poverty status assets and liabilities as well as their participation in government programs meps on the other hand supplies the most detailed information to relate insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs15 status to peoples use of and spending on health care of the surveys meps also asks the most comprehensive questions about the type and source of peoples health insurance however these panel surveys that delve deeper into issues face higher costs and longer interview periods with individuals factors that often limit the size of the survey sample both meps and sipp have smaller sample sizes than nhis and cps therefore although these surveys may also produce representative estimates of the us population their inability to produce reliable estimates of the 50 states and the district of columbia also hampers their usefulness in evaluating proposals for the uninsured with data from these four surveys it is possible to answer many questions about the uninsured as discussed in this report the information collected among the four surveys varies but by exploring the various aspects covered in each survey researchers are able to delve deeper into issues that affect the uninsured us population because the estimates among the surveys differ by so much however the results should always be interpreted with some caution until the differences can be reconciled in addition given the variation among states in their policies and programs that affect the uninsured the ability to calculate reliable estimates for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia remains important to this end the march cps remains the most widely cited estimate of the uninsure d because of its ability to calculate reliable statelevel estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31275crs16 appendix comparison of characteristics of federally administered surveys march supplement to the cps sipp nhis

old although the commonly cited march cps estimates of the fullyear uninsured and crss own estimates include infants infants are excluded from our fullyear analysis here for purposes of comparability given differences among the surveys it was not possible to calculate comparable estimates that include infants among the surveys as result infants were dropped in all of the surveys fullyear analyses for similar reasons infants were also excluded from the anytimeinyear estimates similar concerns and complications do not exist for pointintime estimates so infants are included in those estimates
