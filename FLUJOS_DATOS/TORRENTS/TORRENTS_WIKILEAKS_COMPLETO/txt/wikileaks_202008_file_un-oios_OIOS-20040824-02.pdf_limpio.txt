audit of unhcr ope rations in turkmenistan the audit covered activities with total expenditure of us 104 million in 2002 and 2003 an audit observation was shared with the chief of mission in april 2004 on which comments were received by may 2004 the chief of mission has accepted most of the recom mendations made and implemented them overall assessment oios assessed the unhcr operation in turkmenistan s above average overall it was well run and although some weaknesses in the appli cation of internal controls were identified the weaknesses concerned were not suffi ciently critical to compromise the overall system of internal control programme management for the five partners reviewed reasonable assuranc could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements from oios field visits it was also evident that the partners achieved objectives and that resources funds and assets were used efficiently and effectively financial and performance monitoring was adequately performed and efforts intensified to build capacity at partners the government of turkmenistan introduced new law on public associations that is in effect from november 2003 three ngos ie keiko kara ngo miras ngo and my right were not registered and finding it difficult to reg ister the new law prohibits unregistered ngos to operate in turkmenistan if the ngos canno t register programme activities would be hampered and unhcrs capacity building efforts w ould be jeopardized it is rather doubtful that local ngos can sustain financially if not engaged by unhcr ocm ashgabat assists the ngos to register should they not be registered by end 2004 then oios suggests that the bureau of caswaname take up the matter with the government of turkmenistan unhcr pays instalments in us that the partners vert into the local currency manat at an unofficial exchange rate that is more than thr ee times higher than the official exchange rate the new law requires ngos to register all p rojects with the ministry of justice and it was argued that the funds would have to be transfer red through the ministry at the official exchange rate there is commercial exchange rate in use in tur kmenistan that is much more favourable than the official rate of exc hange but the application of ocm ashgabat to use the rate was rejected by the centra l bank of turkmenistan this will have substantial financial effect on the operation ccording to oios calculation unhcr could loose as much as us 450000 in 2004 by appl ying the official rate instead of the commercial rate therefore oios suggests that t he division of financial and supply management request the central bank of turkmenistan to reconsider ocm ashgabats application and to grant the use of the commercial rate of exchange for activities funded by unhcr supply management procurement activities warehousing and asset manag ement were found to be well managed in particular the redeployment of nfis to afghanis tan when the afghan repatriation project was discontinued as of december 2003 security and safety oios found the security measures in place to be ade quate administration in the

review focused on 1998 and 1999 covering proje ct expenditure of us 502000 and administrative expenditure totalling us 262000 3 in 2000 the management of programme and ad ministration was assessed as adequate but oios recommended training for partners to stren gthen internal controls during the implementation of subprojects compliance to unhcr s procurement procedures and strengthened budgetary controls since then progr amme related training was provided that notably improved the compliance of partners with hcrs procedural and reporting requirements the new law of turkmenistan on publ ic associations however could seriously affect the capacity building initiatives and efforts of ocm ashgabat 4 in 2002 and 2003 unhcr assisted total of 550 refugees of which 240 are tajiks and 310 afghans to repatriate voluntarily main element of the operation was the afghan repatriation project that was discontinued as of nd december 2003 the project was oriented towards the repatriation contingency plan ning and the provision of crossborder assistance as well as logistical and administrativ support required by the unhcr sub offices herat and mazarisharif in afghanistan in fall 2003 the remaining stockpile of nfis which was stocked in the turkmenabad warehous was redeployed to afghanistan 5 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the

audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on 2002 and 2003 programm activities under projects 02 and 03abtkmcm200 02 and 03abtkmcm470 and 02 an d 03abtkmls470 with expenditure of us 403000 our review concentrate d on the activities implemented by national red crescent society of turkmenistan nrcs expenditure of us 135000 keik okara ngo keikokara expenditure of us 51000 the world turkmen humanitarian association in mary valayat wthamary expenditu re of us 32000 the womans organisation of lebap valayat wolv expenditur of us 63000 and the youth self supporting centre bosfor bosfor expenditure of us 28000 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expen diture of us 313000 8 the audit reviewed the administration of oc m ashgabat with administrative budgets totalling us 712000 for 2002 and 2003 and assets with an acquisition value of us 686000 and current value of us 293000 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in turkmenistan was 14 this included 12 staff on regular posts and 2 temporary staff one of which performed the duties of adminfin clerk and the other as field clerk 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 10 for the five partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements and oios assessed that internal controls of all partner s were generally in place and operating effectively 11 most of the partners audited maintain cash books but not general ledgers although the transactions incurred by the implementing partn ers were limited in numbers and amounts it was still time consuming to add all the expendit ures per item for reporting or verification and therefore oios suggested the introduction of g eneral ledgers ocm ashgabat introduced general ledgers at the partners and trai ned staff members of the partners to record transactions therein oios views this as commendable step 12 audit certificates were received from t he partners the accumulated amount of subprojects implemented by an individual partner p er year however was below us 100000 and therefore audit certificates were not r equired from them law of turkmenistan on public associations 13 new law on public associations publishe d on 10 november 2003 came into effect on 20 november 2003 it requires ngos to register even if they were previously registered under the law published on 12 november 1991 14 as of march 2004 only three of the ngos ie bosfor nrcs and the womans organisations managed to register under the new law the other ngos ie keikokara miras ngo and my right were not registered the new law prohibits unregistered ngos to operate in turkmenistan and administrative and crim inal penalties have been added in the law also the government has complete control ove r the registration process 15 ocm ashgabat provides support and assistance to th partners in their efforts to register but cautioned that the new legislation sp ecifically prohibits ngos from operating until their applications for registration has been approved and provides for severe penalties both administrative and criminal in the event of noncompliance with this stipulation therefore ocm ashgabat could not consider working with partners until they have been registered 16 the situation is unfortunate unhcrs cap acity building efforts could be jeopardized programme activities could be seriousl hampered also since the partners do not receive any other funding than that of unhcr t heir financial sustainability is rather doubtful if the partnership with unhcr cannot be c ontinued even the salaries of the staff members of some partners are fully funded by unhcr oios therefore suggests that the bureau of caswaname address the matter directly wit h the government of turkmenistan recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau of caswaname in consultation with the ngo coordinator should approach the gover nment of turkmenistan to overcome the obstacles the offi ce of the chief of mission ashgabat is facing in registering its local implementing partners in accordance with the new l aw of turkmenistan on public associations rec01 b social security and income taxation 17 until early 2004 the partners did not pay social security contributions and income taxes as required by legislation ocm ashgabat officially informed all its partners of the need to pay social security and employment taxes i n compliance with local laws furthermore ocm ashgabat drafted letter of ack nowledgment to be endorsedsigned by its partners that clearly underlines the respon sibility of the latter in regard to the payment of all taxes and confirms their compliance with the relevant laws oios welcomes this action taken by ocm ashgabat c salary provisions in subproject budgets of par tners 18 there were differences in the salary provi sions for similar positions in unhcr sub project budgets and staff members under unhcr subp rojects were paid differently than those under projects with other donors as of april 2004 ocm ashgabat harmonized the provisions for salaries of staff members with simil ar functions in unhcr subproject budgets and salary scale was introduced to ensure that staff members in unhcr sub projects are paid the same as staff members under p rojects with other agencies 19 nrcs charged the unhcr subproject for ren tal of office space however the funds were used inter alia for remuneration to staff members other than thos working in the unhcr subproject g iven the general difficulties encountered in the ma nagement of the nrcs subproject ocm ashgabat decided to disconti nue its activities with the partner from 2004 b other programme issues financial and performance monitoring 20 oios assessed that project financial and p erformance monitoring was competently performed good progress was made to build capacity at partners and the recent engagement of locally recruited national united nations volu nteer further increased ocm ashgabats capacity building initiatives b exchange rates and subproject budgets 21 most subproject budgets are in us and in the past partners paid salaries travel allowances and the limited purchases in us and exc hanged us in the local currency manat at an unofficial rate of exchange the u nofficial rate of exchange us 1 22500 manat is more than four times the official rate of exchange us 1 5200 manat the unofficial rate of exchange was also used du ring budgetary discussions and negotiations with partners 22 the new law however requires the ngos to register all projects with the ministry of justice of turkmenistan and it is argued that all f unds received from international donors would have to be transferred through the ministry f justice as to whether the latter would be put in practice is not certain but the new law allows the ministry of justice access to the records of the ngos and it is understood that it is requirement that ngos pay their obligations in local currency 23 therefore and although unhcr may pay the i nstalments in us to the partners the partners will have to use the official rate of exc hange this would seriously affect the programme activities in turkmenistan if subproje ct budgets had to be based on the official rate of exchange the cost of programme activities would almost quadruple according to oios calculation the financial impli cation of using the official rate of exchange could be as high as us 450000 in 2004 24 ocm ashgabat requested approval from the central bank of turkmenistan through the turkmen turkish bank to use the commercial ra of exchange us 1 19000 manat that is more than three times the official rate of exchange us 1 5200 manat ocm ashgabats request was refused in letter fro m the central bank of turkmenistan in april 2004 25 considering the financial effect of using the artificially high official rate of exchange and the serious consequences this would h ave for unhcrs programme activities oios suggests that the division of financial and pply management requests the central bank of turkmenistan to reconsider their decision recommendation head2right the unhcr division of financial and supply manageme nt should request the central bank of turkmenistan to reconsider ocm ashgabats application and to grant the use of the commercial rate of exchange for all activi ties funded by unhcr in order to avoid estimated additional co st of as much as us 450000 in 2004 which would result fro m applying the official rate of exchange rec02 c supply management 26 ocm ashgabat procured assets and other it ems for the partners in accordance with the cooperation agreement with the government of t urkmenistan unhcr is exempt from the payment of value added tax and therefore it is economical to procure under self implementation 27 overall oios assessed the procurement act ivities warehousing and asset management as adequate d security and safety 28 security measures were in place but oios suggested that the security focal point conduct security assessment of residences that in ternational staff wants to rent also to engage security guards through the office by ct and to recover the amounts due from the international staff members on monthly basis to formalise arrangements and to ensure that claims and recoveries are dealt with in time ly manner 29 as of 1 may 2004 ocm ashgabat directly contracts security guards that are deployed at the staff members residences and recov ers the portion due by the staff members concerned at the end of each month administration 30 in the areas of administration and finance the unh cr office in turkmenistan generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review ocm ashgabat also managed the mip system well and claims were settled in accordan ce with the rules v acknowledgement 31 i wish to express my appreciation
