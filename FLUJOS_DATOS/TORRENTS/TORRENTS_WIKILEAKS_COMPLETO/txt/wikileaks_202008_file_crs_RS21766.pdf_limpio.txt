increased government and public concern about such weapons1 this report addresses contr oversies surrounding the health ffects of lowlevel radiation concerns related to decontamination followi ng an rdd attack and issues of federal research into r dd countermeasures rdds are devices other than nuclear ex plosive device designed to disseminate radioactive material to cause destruction damage or injury2 dirty bomb is one type of rdd in which explosives disperse the ra dioactive material but in general rdds do not require explosives research indicates that rdds have little effectiveness as

prepared soldiers3 rdds may pose greater threat in civilian setting while there may be few immediate health effects from the dispersed radiological material longterm health risks such as cancer may increase significant economic damage may result should people be unwilling to live or work in an area with higher radiation level experts contend that terrorists are interested in constructing and using rdds4 terrorist group has used an rdd to expose civilians to radiation so the potency of an rdd as terror weapon is untested5 both the threat posed by terrorist rdd use and the magnitude of impact are matters of some contention some ex perts believe that terrorists could without great difficulty obtain radioactive material nd construct an rdd while ot hers assert that obtaining significant quantities of an intense radiation source would be difficult they additionally claim that radiation sources intense enough to cause casualties in an rdd attack would be injurious to the terrorists during acquisiti on and use most experts agree that few casualties would be likely to directly result from an rdd attack but posit significant economic costs arising from contamination following the attack6 whether terrorists more highly value an rdd due to its potential ec onomic and psychological effects or devalue an rdd due to the inherent difficulties of handling radioactive material combined with limited direct casualties is matter of debate7 effects of lowlevel radiation experts disagree on the health effects of wlevel radiation th is debate centers on the validity of extrapolating to low radiation levels the results from scientific studies conducted at higher radiation vels past and current resear ch efforts have not yet led to definitive conclusion regarding the h ealth effects of wlevel radiation the environmental protection agency epa supports the approach that radiation related health effects can be extrapolated ie the damage caused by radiation exposurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766crs3 8 for example see health physics soci ety radiation risk in perspective position statement of the health physics society march 2001 9 national research

office of the surgeon general depa rtment of the army 1989 chapter 11 is linearly dependent on the intensity of the radiation and exposure to any amount of radiation causes increased health risks such as an increased probability of developing cancer in contrast others including some professional associati ons believe that the linear model may overstate the health risks of lowlevel radiation8 s m x p r t s maintain that threshold exists below which minimal or ill effects occur supporters of the linear model posit that th is model should be used in the absence of definitive experimental evidence since it is the more cautious model supporters of the threshold model point out that safety and regulatory actions that apply to radiation levels below threshold may not be necessary nd may greatly increase remediation costs as part of the effort to assess these mode ls the federal govern ment funds scientific research into the health effects of radia tion exposure in 2005 the national academy of sciences board on radiation effects research assessing the current scientific literature issued draft report concluding that curre nt scientific evidence supports linear threshold relationship between cancer development and lowdose radiation9 medical countermeasures few medical countermeasures exist against rdds exposures and they are limited in scope the department of defense dod has identified tr eatments that ameliorate the symptoms arising after radiation exposure but do not treat the radi ationexposurerelated damage itself for example the dod uses granisetron an antivomiting drug to allow soldiers to complete mission goals following which medical treatment of the radiation effects can be provided10 postexposure medical therapy is designed to treat the consequences of radiation exposure rather than prevent the initial radiation damage medications designed to limit or prevent the damage caused by radiation exposure are called radioprotectants current radi oprotectants are intended as preexposure treatments and have limited application if taken after radiation exposure occurs in clinical settings radioprotectants may be used during radiation cancer therapy to reduce damage to healthy tissue11 many compounds provide some degree of radioprotection but those compounds with the highest protec tion have significant side effects12 also most compounds with high radioprotection require injection for maximum efficacy thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766crs4 13 for example in 1997 it was recommended to th department of energy that because of its side effects amifostine radioprotectant not be used during plannedfor radiation exposures in emergencies joseph f weiss pharmacol ogic approaches to protection against radiationinduced lethality and other

program continuedcombination of significant side effects and the need for injection has limited widespread use of these compounds as pretreatment s for nonclinical radiation exposure13 many postexposure therapies remove ra dioactive contaminants from the body thereby limiting the total radiation dose they either block absorption of radioisotopes by internal organs for exampl potassium iodide decreases radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland or enhance expulsion of radi oisotopes through the gastrointestinal tract radioisotope scavenging compounds such as chelators may be given to those who are internally contaminated with specific radioisotope to reduce the time that the radioisotope remains in the body federal medical countermeasure research the federal government sponsors radioprotectant research the dod has longstanding efforts to develop medications allowing soldiers to work in contaminated environments for many years the walter reed army institute of research s upported an antiradiation drug development program which provided many candidate radi oprotectant molecules14 the armed forces radiobiology research institute afrri is focal point of defense radiobiology expertise and performs resear ch and testing of antiradiati on drugs as one component of its mission15 other federal agencies have been concer ned with the development of antiradiation medications as well the national institu tes of health have funded research into combination therapies using radioprotectiv compounds to enhance radiation treatment for cancer patients in 2003 the national ins titute of allergy and infectious disease organized an expert panel to review and identify areas where specific gaps in rddrelated radiation research and development occur and to generate research priorities to address these gaps16 the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has explored mechanisms of protecting astronauts against radiation in space17 the

radiological contamination some experts believe that the economic and psychological effects from an rdd attack would outweigh the dir ect medical costs these experts weighing the current guidelines on radiological contamination nd the degree of dispersal expected with successful rdd attack state that an rdd attack could contaminate large areas because the dispersal of radiological material would likely be une ven the level of radiation in different areas would vary pending on meteorological fact ors such as wind speed and precipitation some models of an rdd event have sugge sted that the release of finely ground radiological material might contaminate many city blocks to level higher than the current epa standard20 some analysts suggest such models exaggerate the seriousness of such contamination because they are based on the linear nothreshold radiation standard they claim that concerns related to this level of contamination are overstated and contend that some inhabited areas ve naturally occurring background radiation levels higher than the level current epa decontamination standards require oversight issues rddrelated research and development matter of some contention is whether the threat of terrorist rdd use justifies an expansi on of federally funded research on antiradiation therapies in addition to dod research performed at afrri the national institutes of health has increased research into nuclear and radiological countermeasures the development of effectiv medical countermeasures to an rdd attack might have significant health benefits by reducing the number of casualties lower potential casualties might act as disincentive to terro rist acquisition of such weapons health effects from radiological dispersal may vary widely and some analysts assert that

ely be economic in nature additional investment in medical countermeasures w ould not necessarily reduce economic damage21 federal efforts in developi ng medical rdd countermeasur might serve to reduce the psychological aspects of an rdd attack validated medical countermeasures might reduce public panic and concern about the expos ure of first responders to radiation during treatment of casualties alternately similar reduction in the psychological impact of an rdd attack might be achieved through continuing public outreach campaigns22 some companies have urged the department of

requests for proposals related to select types of rdd countermeasures through the project bioshield program23 decontamination standards new decontamination standards developed for rdd terrorist incidents may become an ar ea of future congressional interest the department of homeland secu rity issued draft protective action guideline on january 3 2006 relating to rdd decontamination24 this draft guideline has been criticized as being too lenient and potentially harmful to t hose residing in areas contaminated by an rdd event25 some analysts claim that the decontamina tion standards for radi ological cleanup are too strict and that much of the cost associated with an rdd attack would come from removal of radiological material that has little health impact they assert that the required decontamination under current standards w ould likely create larg amounts of waste contaminated buildings might need to be stroyed and the rubble removed others view the epa standard as ensuring that adverse health effects arise from longterm exposure to rdd residue adherence to stricter decontamination standard might also serve to reduce public anxieties arising from the psyc hological component of an rdd attack26
