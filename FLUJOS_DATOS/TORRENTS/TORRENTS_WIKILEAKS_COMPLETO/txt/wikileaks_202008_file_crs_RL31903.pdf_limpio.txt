industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903relicensing of nonfederal hydroelectric projects background and procedural reform issues summary hydroelectric facilitie s produce approx imately 7 of all electricity generated in the united states and are an important and flexible source of power about half of the hydroelectric power generated in the united states comes from privately owned facilities that ope rate under licenses issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc federal hydropower dams do not require ferc licenses and are not covered by this report new licenses for private facilities establish allowed generation capacity opera ting parameters and nvironmental protection requirements for the next 30 to 50 years given the multipurpose nature of hydropower faci lities and changes in rivermanagement priorities since the 1950s and 1960s it now can take more than six year s and millions of dollars to relicense hydroelectric project since the mid1980s ferc has been working to improve the relicensing process in 1 985 ferc tablished deadlinedriven process known as the traditional licensing process tlp in 1997 ferc developed second more flexible process called the alternative licensing process alp the focus of recent ferc efforts and of this report is on the development of regulations finalized in fercs july 30 2003 rule docket rm 0216000 order 2002 to further modify the licensing process by establishing third process this process called the integrated licensing process ilp incorporates elements of the tlp eg deadlines for multiple steps and the alp eg focu s on early stakeholder involvement in addition the ilp includes new process fo r resolving study disputes and requires ferc to participate earlier in the licensing process ferc indicates that these changes are intended to make the process s horter and more effici ent without altering agencies authorities under the federal powe r act 16 usc 791 et or the clean water act 33 usc 1341 to

facilities account for about half of all us hydropower production relicensing of nonfederal hydroelectric projects background and procedural reform issues introduction1 hydroelectric facilities genera nearly 7 of all ectricity produced in the united states and between 15 and 44 of the electricity in seven states2 hydropower is generated by releasing wate r through set of turbines thus the process does not produce air pollutants and can be turned on or off in matter of minutes this flexibility makes hydroelectric facilities an important source of peaking power3 however the construction and management of these facilities are often contentious because they affect ma ny other resources activities and values for example decisions about when and how to release water from hydro facility and how much water to release can aff ect fisheries flood control irrigation municipal water supplies recreation stream ecolo gy and transportation4 to protect navigable waters and encourage multipleuse hydro projects congress created the federal power commission5 in 1920 and gave it exclusive authority to license nonfederal hydropower f acilities with this authority the federal power commission renamed th federal energy regulatory commission ferc in 1977 licensed facilities in 45 states6 these licenses which are valid for 30 to 50 years establish operating parame ters for nonfederal

wwwfercgov industrieshydropowergeninf olicensinglicensesxlscongress also created major role in the licensing process for federal resource agencies state agencies and agen cies representing indian tribes7 specifically congress gave certain agencies mandatory conditioning authority ie congress requires ferc to include in its license certain agencyestablished operating conditions section 18 of th 1920 federal power act fpa8 for example stipulates that the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce may require an applicant to facilitate th passage of fish safely around barriers created by the facility when project is located on federal reservation eg indian reservations and national forests 4e9 also grants the authority to establish such license conditions to the secretary of the partment under whose supervision such reservation falls specifically the secretary may stipulate license provisions to maintain the reservation for the purposes for which it was designated congress extended this conditioning authority to state resource agenci under the 1972 clean water act cwa under the cwa fercissued license must include any conditions that the state deems necessary to maintain statedeveloped water quality standards10 given their mandatory conditioning authority these federal and state agencies called conditioning agencies are actively involved in the relicensing process pending hydropower relicensi ng activities will involve significant percentage of federally regulated hydropower during the next decade 20072016 115 projects which account for about 30 of ll nonfederal us hydroelectric capacity will face relicensing11 given the multipurpose natu re of hydropower facilities changes in rivermanagement priorities and changes in environmental knowledge and policies since the 1950s and 1960s this re licensing process can be fairly lengthy since the 1980s congre ss and ferc have worked to reduce the time and cost of relicensing specifically congress has pushed ferc to continue evaluating its relicensing process since 1985 ferc s developed three hydropower licensing processes the traditional licensing process tlp in 1985 the alternative licensing process alp in 1997 and the integrated licensing process ilp in july 2003 the ilp integrates components of the tlp eg deadlines for process phases and the alp eg focus on early stakeholder involveme

applicants to propose altern atives to license conditions and requires agencies to accept those alternatives as long as they meet certain environmental and economic requirements some have expressed concern th at this legislation will reduce the effectiveness of the ilp by eroding federal resource agencies conditioning authority historic licensing processes since the passage of the 1920 federa l power act the federal power commission now ferc has been the dominant hydropower licensing authority13 as such ferc developed the procedures through which relicensing may occur until recently ferc supported two relicensing processes the traditional licensing process tlp and the alternative licensing process alp this section describes these licensing processes to provide c ontext for discussing the new integrated licensing process ilp and related legislative issues and concerns the traditional process in 1985 ferc established what is now re ferred to as the traditional licensing process14 the tlp consists of two phases preapplicati on consultation phase15 led by the applicant and postapplication anal ysis phase led by ferc during the pre application phase the applicant notifies ferc of its intent to seek new license the applicant also provides state and federal resource agencies and agencies representing tribal governments informati on describing the proposed project these agencies help to identify studies the pplicant must undertake to determine the projects effects on fish and wildlife cultu ral resources recreati on water and other resources after completing these studies th applicant prepares draft application and obtains comments from resource agencies the applicant may then attempt to resolve any disagreements with the agencies through an informal dispute resolution process16 after the formal application is filed th postapplication process begins during the postapplication process participating stakeholders may request additional studies and provide other comments and recommendations federa l resource agencies may also submit their mandatory license cond itions and state envi ronmental agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs4 17 when project is

comprehensive review and recommendations pursuant to section 603 of the energy act of 2000 available at httpwwwfercgovlegal majordreglanddocsortc_finalpdf hereafter referred to as the ferc section 603 report this report was criticized by the general accoun ting office gao now government accountability office in may 2 2001 report entitled licensing hydropower projects better time and cost data needed to reach inform ed decisions about process reforms gao01499 ava ilable at http wwwgaogov 21 the alp was codified in october 1997 at 18 cfr 434imust submit their water quality certification requirements17 at this point ferc begins its environmental analysis unde r the national environmental policy act nepa18 by scoping the issue and identifying project alternatives then ferc prepares an environmental document that incorporates the study results and agencies license conditions19 after examining the environmental and other project analyses ferc staff recommends the project along with set of conditions to fercs commissioners and the commissioners decide either to grant or to deny the license the median time and expense of this process as calculated by ferc is 79 months and 246 per kw20 the alternative licensing process in october 1997 ferc responded to concerns that the tlp was too lengthy and costly by establishing second process called the alternative licensing process alp21 the alp was designed to shorten the licensing process by encouraging early collaboration among stakeholders since the alp requires collaboration applicants must gain stakeholder support to use this process once the stakeholders agree to use the alp the stakeholders work together during the preapplication phase to develop the application and preliminary draft nepa document ferc oversees the alp and encourages participants to use the voluntary dispute resolution service drs when there are disagreements the drs is mediation service offered by ferc that facilitates negotiations but does not offer recommendations instead the drs can bring in ferc experts to help clarif issues through this process the pre application phase can result in settlement agreement between the applicant and participating stakeholders this settlement agreement describes how the project will be managed and often include s the conditions required by state and federal resource agencies to protect and nhance the environment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs5 22 ferc section 603 report in its report gao01499 gao critic ize these data 23 ferc section 603 report for more information see crs report rl31536 24 ferc section 603 report gao report gao01499 criticizes the ferc section 603 report because the time data are limited almost entirely to the postapplication phase and the report does not include time data for th administrative and judicial reviews of its license decisions after this intensive collaborative proce ss is complete the applicant files formal relicensing applica tion the formal application includes the draft nepa document and reflects any agreements reached by participating stakeholders after receiving the application ferc completes its nepa documentation and rules on the application the median time and expense of this process as calculated by ferc is 56 months and 58 per kw22 major differences between the tlp and the alp multiple differences distinguish the alp from the tlp first activities conducted pursuant to nepa be gin early under the alp under the tlp preparation of nepa documents does not begin until af ter the application has been accepted by ferc and all studies have been complete d when the project being evaluated is controversial beginning the nepa process may help to clarify the issues second an application prepared under the alp c ontains preliminary draft nepa document that is largely the product of stakeholder collaboration rather than document containing the results of envi ronmental studies prepared solely by the applicant this collaborative development of the draft nepa document under the alp may increase the amount of information stakeholders have available when seeking settlement agreement third ferc staff are invol ved in advising the collaborative team throughout the alps preapplication activities in contrast ferc staff are rarely involved in preapplication consultation under the tlp earlier ferc pa rticipation under the alp can familiarize ferc staff with the project and its issues before the postapplication process begins time and cost of relicensing according to fercs section 603 report another major difference between the tlp and the alp is time23 specifically ferc estimated that the median licensing time from the time the applicant submits its initial consultation document to the time ferc issues the license was 79 months under the tlp and 56 months under the alp see figure 1 24 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs6 25 preparing the application including study preparation costs around 22 million per project under the tlp and around 36 m illion per project under the alp section 603 report page 47 gao has also criticized the cost data ferc used in its section 603 report specifically cost data were based on information from 80 nonrandom projects see crs report rl315364032 1647 0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0alptlp months prefiling time processing time56 mo79 mo data source ferc section 603 report 2001figure 1 license duration according to fercs section 603 report the alp is also less costly than the tlp not including the resources expended by ferc federal and state agencies indian tribes and nongovernmental organizations ferc determined that the median cost of preparing the relicensing app lication was 109 per kw under the tlp and 39 per kw under alp25 once the process is complete it can also be expensive to comply with the provisions contained in the new license ferc determined that the median cost of the licenses protecti on mitigation and enhancement measures was 246 per kw under the tlp nd 58 per kw under the alp however the cost differences between the tlp and alp coul d increase or decrease depending on the type of project being relicensed however these figures may not clearly illustrate changes in relicensing time because they can vary significantly depending on the project size and the water resources affected the alp figures are based on projects for which the alp was the selected process the figures for the tlp include projects relicensed before the alp was developed in 1997 depending on pr ojects characteristics the tlp or the alp could be more expedient administrative licensing reform while fercs section 603 report indicated that the alp could reduce the time and cost of relicensing for some project s ferc continued to examine its licensing processes in 1998 ferc joined with other agencies involved in the licensing process to form the interagency task force to improve hydroelectric licensinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs7 26

stakeholders through the tlp and alp26 ferc also held regional workshops with states on how to integrate their clean water act responsibilities w ith the licensing processes in addition to clarifying the current license processes ferc also began developing new licensing process in july 2001 senior staff from ferc and other federal agencies formed the intera gency hydropower committee ihc this committee built on the comments developed by the itf and developed additional procedural modifications to further reduce the time and cost of licensing27 concurrently the national review group nrg an industry and nongovernmental stakeholder forum worked to develop pr oposal for an integrated licensing process in september 2002 ferc used the ihc and nrg proposals as the basis for further discussions specifically ferc published notice requesting comments on the two proposals28 this notice also established public forums and schedule for providing comments and recommendations regardin g the adoption of new hydropower licensing process the integrated licensing process after receiving oral and written comments in december 2002 ferc began developing an additional licensing proce ss through meetings and drafting sessions on february 20 2003 ferc issued its tice of proposed rulemaking nopr29 the nopr set out fercs proposal for ne w default licensing process called the integrated

both structured and collaborative effective july 23 2005 the il p is the default process but applicants may petition to use either the alp or tlp based on anticipated costs level of complexity and controversy related to the relicensing and other factors approval to use process other than the ilp is not automatic31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs8 32 see list of entities recommending early ferc scoping on page 25 of fercs february 20 2003 nopr docket number rm0216000early stages of licensing under the ilp will begin much as they have under the alp the applicant will consult with agenci tribes and the public to decide which studies the applicant needs to complete in addition the ilp adopted recommendation proposed by the hydropower industry and resource agencies that ferc conduct nepa scoping durin g the preapplication phase32 ferc anticipates that moving nepa scoping from the posta pplication phase where it occurs in the alp to the preapplicati on phase could reduce the numbe r of studies ferc requests late in the application process after preapplication consultations and nepa scoping are complete the applicant files draft study plan that includes schedule for all major relicensing steps such schedule could help keep stakeholders on task by providing check points prior to the deadline for submitting th formal license pplication however strict deadlines could prove to be unworka ble in certain situations eg weather disruptions or particularly complex studies once the applicant files the draft study plan the stakeholders meet to discuss the draft and to try and resolve any remaining study disagreements ferc would then approve the study plan with any needed modifications at this stage the ilp tablishes new dispute resolution process to help resolve study disagreements between the applicant and conditioning agencies this process is describe d in more detail below initiating the study dispute resolution process major goal of the ilp is to encourage stakeholders to identify study needs early in the licensing process and to give applicants some certainty re garding study requirements however in developing the ilp ferc recognized that conditioning agencies may require applicants to provide information sufficient to establish their license conditions since the applicant may need study to obt ain this information the ilp establishes special study dispute resolution process for conditioning agencies under the ilp ferc only grants additional study re quests under exceptional circumstances the ilps formal dispute resolution pr ocess differs from the tlp and the alp under the tlp there is formal mechanism for resolving study disputes before the applicant files the license application u nder the alp conditioning agencies and the applicant try to resolve their disagreements using the voluntary dispute resolution service as will be described below major difference between the drs and the dispute resolution panel created under the ilp is that the panel is required to complete its work in set time period and provide recommendations since the formal dispute resolution process may only be initiated by agencies with mandatory conditioning authority other stakeholders have to petition their study requests to fercs director of energy products and face tougher studyapproval standards entities without conditioning aut hority argue that they too should be able to initiate the dispute resolution panel for example state agencies with relicensing responsibilities but without licensing conditi oning authority under the federal power act and clean water act argue that the dis pute resolution panel as described below helps them to obtain information that is critical to their analyses however ferchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs9 33 ferc final rule p 34decided that most study disputes should be resolved during the preapplication consultation phase through voluntary mech anisms and that the study dispute resolution panel is only to be used in situations when conditioning agency is dissatisfied with the study developmen t plan furthermore ferc notes that conditioning agencies must require substantial evidence for their conditions to withstand judicial review study advisory panel when conditioning agency files notice of dispute ferc convenes threemember advisory panel the panel consists of person nominated by ferc staff person nominated by the agency referring the dispute and subjectarea expert selected by the other two panel members the applicant is not panel member but may provi the panel with information various stakeholders have voiced cerns regarding the composition of the study dispute resolution panel the hydr opower industry for example argues that applicants should have greater role in this process members of the hydropower industry are also concerned that the pe rson selected by the agency would face pressure to rule in favor of the study request however ferc and conditioning agencies point out that the person appointed by the agency will not be working on the project in question and would not necessarily be an agency employee industry and nonindustry stakeholders are also concerne d that it may be difficult to find third uncompensated panel member who is not involved with the project but who has the necessary expertise however ferc contends that the panel will be used infrequently and that it has successfully used similar procedures in the past study criteria to make its recommendation the panel would review study requests that contain the following information33 1 description of the goals and objectiv of the study and the information to be obtained 2 an explanation of the relevant resource management goals of the agencies or tribes with jurisdiction ove r the resource to be studied 3 an explanation of any relevant public interest consideration in the proposed study if the requester is not resource agency 4 description of existing informati on concerning the subject of the study proposal and the need for additional information 5 an explanation of the nexus between project operations and effects on the resources to be studied and how th study results would inform the development of the license requirements 6 an explanation of how proposed study methodology is consistent with generally accepted practice in the scientific community or as appropriate considers relevant tribal values and knowledge and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs10 34 the phase depends on the type of studies for example the first phase could be year or season 35 the license will include state and federal license conditions and any other conditions ferc deems necessary to balance multiple water uses as is the case now under existing procedures 7 description of the level of effort and cost as applicable and why any proposed alternative studies would not be sufficient to meet the stated information needs after considering all of the information submitted by the applicant agencies and other stakeholders th panel would make reco mmendation to fercs director of energy products on whether to grant the study request the director will either agree with or overrule the panel and the decision will constitute an amendment to the approved study plan after all initial disputes are resolved the director will issue an order directing the applicant to carry out th study plan as amended once this final study plan is complete any additional requests to alter the plan will be submitted to the director rather than to the panel and will only be granted under exceptional circumstances carrying out the study development plan under the new rule after ferc approves the studydevelopment plan the applicant begins the studies in contrast under the tlp or the alp an applicant begins studies without ferc approved plan during the ilps study phase the applicant submits status reports and discusses the study development plan with other stakeholders the applicant uses its updated status report completed af ter the second phase of studies34 to file draft application to the extent possible th is draft application will include the same information as the final application includi ng information sufficient for tribes and agencies to file their mandatory terms nd conditions fishway re quirements or state water quality certif ication however the ilp doe s not establish procedural mechanism forcing applicants to include all such information in its draft application some resource agencies are concerned that the ilp does not include mechanism for ensuring that the draft or final license application includes sufficient information for agencies to exercise th eir conditioning authority or make other recommendations to ferc some agencies claim that lack of information is often the primary reason that their conditions or recommendations are delayed ferc argues that early resolution of study dis putes will reduce the likelihood of incomplete applications and that conditioning agencies authority to amend or prevent the license is sufficient incentive for applicants to submit all necessary information conditioning agencies respond that thes incentives exist under the tlp and alp and that in some cases they are insufficient final application and licensing following comment period the applicant files the final pplication then agencies submit their recommendations and conditions and ferc considers the recommendations and incorporates the requirements into its final nepa document ferc then rules to grant or deny the license35 ferc rarely denies applications that are based on an uncontested settlement agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31903crs11 36 for more information see crs report rl31536 37 section 603 of the energy act of 2000 pl 106469 38 ferc section 603 report 39 for example special use authorizations fo r projects on forest service lands and similar existing authorizations would be eliminatedmajor differences and other issues as described above the ilp differs from the tlp and the alp in general the ilp is more collaborative than the tlp and more structured than the alp the ilp also moves fercs nepa scoping process from the postapplication phase to the preapplication phase in an effort to resolve study disputes early in the licensing process under the ilp which includes fercapproved study plan ferc is likely to approve new studies as the licensing process progresses this coul d encourage stakeholders to request studies early in the process and could provide pplicants with some degree of certainty regarding the study plan the ilp also develops ne w study dispute resolution panel to help resolve disputes between conditioning agencies and the license applicant although resource agencies environmenta l organizations indian tribes and applicants are optimistic that the rulemaking will improve the licensing process they disagree regarding fercs decision to make the ilp the default process but to allow applicants to petition to use the tlp or the alp specifically resource agencies indian tribes and volunteer organizations argue that the ilp should replace the other two processes after trial pe riod they state that retain ing multiple processes could confuse the public nonprofit organizati ons and agencies involved in mu ltiple relicensing processes however the hy dropower industry opposes single process and argues that there are certain projects for which the tlp or the alp may be more appropriate than the ilp conversely pr oponents of single process argue that the ilp should be flexible enough to accommodate all types of projects these issues and other stakeholder concerns were discussed at regional workshops and at stakeholder drafting session before ferc issued its final rule in july 2003 legislative licensing proposals the issue before congress was whether legislation was needed to make the licensing process shorter and less costly minimize environmental impacts36 and maximize electricity generation or whethe r fercs actions sufficiently addressed concerns about relicensing congress held hearings and took other action to assess the necessity of legislative relicensing reform or other action in 2000 c ongress directed ferc to conduct comprehensive re view of the policies procedures and regulations guiding the licensing process37 ferc responded in may 2001 with recommendations on how to reduce the leng th and expense of obtaining new license38 in addition to administrative refo rms some of which are in fercs 2003 final rule ferc recommended that congress ma ke ferc the onestop shop for hydropower licenses by giving it the author ity to reject or modify resource agency conditions and by eliminating other federal authorizations39 the hydropower industry generally supported this type of legislative reform howe ver these suggestions for legislative changes were not supported by fficials within some resource

to protect nonhydr opower resources officials within some resource agencies and environmental organizations also argued that administrative reforms like the ilp are adequate to improve the relicensing process40 following the issuance of fercs section 603 report legislation was proposed to change components of the licensing pr ocess for example the comprehensive energy bill hr 4 107th congress would have allowed applicants to propose alternatives to agencies mandatory conditi ons under the federal power act required conditioning agencies to consider alternatives to their license conditions and required them to select the alternative if it met certain environmental and cost criteria resolution came out of the 107th congress there was furthe r debate over these issues in the 108th congress but legislation was enacted until the 109th congress with the passage of the energy polic act of 2005 pl 10958 recent relicensing ch anges pl 10958 provisions allowing applicants to propos alternatives to agencies mandatory conditions became law in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 241 an applicant for ferc license or any other party to the proceedings has the opportunity to formally dispute issues that arise in the relicensing process specifically applicants or ot her parties involved have the right to request hearing to resolve disputes regarding fishways and issues of material fact relating to adequate resource protection on federa l lands these hearings are conducted by the agency responsible for the resource in question additionally whenever the relevant management agencies indicate specific conditions that are required for resource prot ection license applican ts or other parties involved may propose alternatives that cost less to implement or improve hydropower production so long as proposed alternatives provide adequate resource protection the management agencies must accept them these same provisions for alternative proposals and th same criteria of adequate resource protection also apply to fishways that may be prescribed as license condition this procedure was tested in 2006 with the first hearing prompted by 241 of pl 10958 the departments of commerce and the inte rior both filed mandatory terms and conditions related to the relicensi ng of pacificorps klamath river project ferc license number 2082 an adminis trative law

recreation water supply irrigation and flood control objectives is nece ssarily lengthy process the length however can be exacerbated by number of factors for example beginning new studies late in the preapplication phase can lengthen the licensing process in formulating the ilp ferc and other stake holders attempted to reduce the likelihood that the applicant will need to produce more information late in the study phase specifically the ilp requires ferc to identify nepa issues during the pre application process and creates study dispute mechanism for conditioning agencies by identifying the information needs of ferc and conditioning agencies early in the process the ilp could reduce the need fo r additional studies near the end of the licensing process furthermore stak eholders with limited personnel resources hope that the timelines developed under the ilp w ill help them to schedule their resources more efficiently in the end it is not the process but the results ie the contents of and conditions on the license that matter most when results are unsatisfactory from the perspective of any stakeholder relicensing may be accompanied by long and costly legal battles bringing all the stakeholders to the table and negotiating relicensing agreement as is done in the alp is one method that may reduce postlicensing litigation like the alp the ilp could courage stakeholder collaboration unlike the alp however the ilp establishes strict deadlines for each phase of the licensing process under the alp negotiations so metimes drag on until pa rties are faced with the deadline for submitting the application therefore the deadlines established under the ilp could prompt parties to reach agreement sooner on the other hand some stakeholders are concerned that the ilps deadlines may not provide sufficient time to negotiate settlement the success of the ilp in achieving settlement agreements may depend on the quality of the information gathered through the study process and on the focused and cooperative efforts of c onditioning agencies license applicants ferc and other stakeholders the question of whether legislative efforts could improve relicensing is difficult because the ilp has not yet been tested on one nd individuals within some resource agencies and environmental organizations are concerned that reducing the leverage of conditioning agencies th rough legislation such as pl 10958 removes an important incentive for applicants to work toward settlement agreement on the other hand ferc and th hydroelectric industry argue that this legislation complements administrative reforms by encouraging license conditions that are equally effective and less costly
