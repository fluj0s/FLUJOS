groups and privacy advocates oppose national identity scheme citing the loss of privacy and fear of misuse4 in addition some argue that nati onal identification card is unnecessary as citizens already have facto identification cards in the form of social security cards and drivers licenses or state identification cards which could be used as national identification cards with modification5 conversely advocates of national identifi cation system assert that such system would serve as an invaluable tool to track the movement of known or potential terrorists thus thwarting terrorist attack moreover such system would facilitate tracking of immigrants migrating in and out of the united states national identification system might facilitate more accurate accountability of the number of immigrants in this country constitutional and legal issues apparently congress could permissibly legislate national identification card under number of its powers enumerated in artic i section 8 of the constitution for example congress has plenary power over naturalization and citizenship6 assuming that national identification system were instituted to track aliens the enactment of such system would appear to fall within congress authority also under the commerce clause congress ma regulate persons or things in as well as those activities having substantial relationship to interstate commerce7 assuming that the purpose of national identifi cation system would be to facilitate better security on instrumentalities of interstate and international travel such system would appear to be sufficiently related to an activity in interstate commerce to fall within congress commerce clause authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21137crs3 8 south dakota v dole 483 us 203 1987 9 id 10 as there are few details on the contents implementation or enforcement of national identification system it is difficult at present to provide specific assessments of the constitutional roadblocks to such

constitution does not explicitly mention the right to travel because such right so elementary was conceived from the beginning to be necessary concomitant of the stronger union the constitution created united states v guest 383 us 745758 1966 kent v dulles 357 us 116 125 1958 stating that the right to travel is part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be prived without due process of law under the fifth amendment cramer v skinner 931 f2d 1020 1029 5th cir 1991 although clause in the constitution specifically provides right to interstate travel the supreme court has inferred this right from various constitutional provisions and from the structure of the federal system itself 12 attorney gen of new york v sotolopez 476 us 898 903 1986 13 id 14 shelton v tucker 364 us 479 488 1960in addition article 1 secti on 8 clause1 of the constitution authorizes congress to use federal monies to provide for the common defense and the general welfare as such congress could apparen tly legislate national identifi cation card by providing funds to states and attaching conditions to these funds without violating the constitution due to the voluntary nature of st ates participation8 states and localities would remain free to reject the federal monies but if accepted they woul d be taken subject to the conditions imposed by congress9 while congress would apparently have the au thority to enact national identification system constitutional and legal concerns could presumably arise in the implementation and enforcement of such system10 for instance implementation and enforcement of such system could conceivably implicate privacy rights as well as the right to travel freedom to travel throughout the united states has long been recognized as basic right under the constitution11 law implicates the right to travel when it actually deters such travel or when impeding travel is its primary objective12 law that infringes the right to travel is subject to strict scrutiny by the courts13 under which compelling state interest must be shown and the gove rnments purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundament personal liberties when th end can be more narrowly achieved14 thus the question whether na tional identification system would impermissibly infringe upon the right to trav would ultimately depend upon the nature and effect of the regulatory scheme adopted where the scheme as implemented actually deters the ability to travel reviewing c ourt would likely inquire into the objective underlying the system to determine whether it is sufficiently compelling to justify thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21137crs4 15 to avoid the constitutional concerns presented by mandatory system some have suggested utilizing voluntary national

except under certain conditions the freedom of information act foia 5 usc 552 et seq establishes right of access to records maintained by agencies within the executive br anch of the federal government it contains several exemptions including one for personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy both the privacy act and foia may then provide so privacy protections for genetic information but they are limited in their scope and would not encompass information held by private entity 18 for discussion of this issue see gostin gen etic privacy 23 j of law medicine ethics 320 1995 19 section 1514 of the 2002 homeland security act pl 107296 states nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize the developm ent of national identification system or cardrestriction on travel in addition the court will examine the availabi lity of means less restrictive on travel that could be utilized to accomplish the governments objectives15 another potential problem could exist w ith the collection and dissemination of information in national identification syst em depending on the type of information contained on national identifi cation card privacy concerns can be raised for example national identification card wh ich contained an individual s name date of birth sex height weight and fingerprint or other biom etric identifier may be less likely to raise privacy concerns than card which also contained blood type genetic or medical information although the constitution does not expressly provide for right to privacy the supreme court has found some ri ght to informational privacy16 however these rights are limited by judicial deference to the governments need to acquire the information and by the fact that constitutional challenge w ould be limited to state action as practical matter this would mean that federal or state collections of information may receive some constitutional and or statutory17 protection but the collecti on and use of information by private organizations would not be covered18 prior legislation bills were introduced in the 107th congress which specifically proposed national identification card19 however several bills were proposed which in some form authorized an identifier to facilitate the tracking of immigra nts for example s 1491 would have required the secretary of state and the commissioner of immigration and naturalization to jointly blish and implement fingerpr int processing system under which an aliens fingerprints would be entered into an electronic database upon issuancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21137crs5 20 s 1491 107th cong 2001 21 hr 3052 107th cong 2001 22 hr 2276 107th cong 2001 s 1400 107th cong 2001 23 s 1489

the fingerprint of the individual seeking admission matches the fingerprint in the database the alien woul d be prohibited entry if th fingerprint did not match similarly hr 3052 would have amended the immigration and nationality act to require nonimmigrant visa applicant to provide machine r eadable biometric identifiers fingerprints or handprints which shall be checked against da tabase for criminal information prior to visa approval21 hr 2276 and s 1400 would have am ended the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 and extend the deadlines for aliens to
