the information ngic assessment ufouo iraq proximity fuzes found on 107mm rockets u purpose u this assessment provides information on insurgent use of proximity fuzes with 107mm rockets and its significance to coalition forces u key points srel to usa mcfi weapons intelligence teams wit and explosive ordnance disposal eod teams discovered 107mm rockets with proximity fuzes following raid on 16 february 2006 ufouo this is the first confirmed instance of proximity fuzes being correctly associated intentionally or otherwise with the 107mm rocket in either iraq or afghanistan ufouo proximity fuzes can significantly increase the effective area of 107mm hefrag rockets ufouo it is not known if the insurgents were aware of the fuze types or were simply using what was available ufouo an md21 does not require manipulation by the user in order to function in the proximity mode and thus increases the rockets effective area u significant cache item found srel to usa mcfi on 16 feb 2006 coalition forces discovered weapons cache at house located near the intersection of rte northstars and rte cannucks 38s mb 10569 98193 the wit report indicated that there was known city within 6 km of the location among the ordnance discovered in the cache were five 107mm artillery rockets at least three of these rockets were fuzed with fuze not previously seen mated to 107mm rockets in iraq these fuzes have been identified as chinese md21 rf proximity fuzes the md21 fuze is produced with green plastic cover on the nose but in this case the covers were removed the absence of this plastic cover is not expected to affect the ability of the fuze to function as designedsecretrel to usa mcfimr page 1 secretrel to usa mcfimru rockets found in cache u rocket background ufouo the 107mm rocket is one of the most commonly encountered indirectfire weapons in iraq and afghanistan the unique finless thrustinducedspin stabilized design gives them the ability to be fired in an improvised manner without conventional launch platform at approximately 18 kg 40 lbs and less than 1 meter in length the rockets are easily transported and concealed while variety of warheads are produced worldwide those encountered in iraq are almost exclusively hefrag with natural fragmentation warhead with between 10 and 13 kg of explosive fill these rockets are surprisingly effective weapons the poor condition of the rockets shown in the above figure is not uncommon for 107mm rockets discovered in iraq or afghanistan the part of the rocket most sensitive to neglect is the propellant so if the rocket motors are still in working order the fuze becomes the determining factor on whether or not the warhead detonates u the following are fuzes designed for use with the 107mm rocket u pointdetonating pd fuzes mj1 and copies u rf proximity fuzes md21 u probable electronic or mechanical time fuzes unknown designator ufouo the mj1 pd fuze is the most common fuze designed for the 107mm rocket and is probably the most common initiator of reported 107mm rocket detonations the md21 was known to exist in iraq and has been encountered on previous occasions but never mated with 107mm rocket time fuzes for these rockets are not believed to be available in iraq or afghanistan srel to usa mcfi while there have been reports of unexplained airbursts from variety of rockets hard evidence of proximity fuze use was lacking this discovery is the first confirmation we have of these fuzes being correctly associated with their intended rockets u advantage of proximityfuzed rockets ufouo an rf proximity fuze such as the md21 uses radiofrequency signal to ping the ground and cause the warhead to detonate consistently within specified height range above the ground according to marketing literature the md21 fuze height of burst hob is preset andsecretrel to usa mcfimr page 2 secretrel to usa mcfimrnominally results in burst altitude of 5 to 8 meters above the ground these fuzes are preset to function in the proximity mode and there are known options for the user to change the setting of the fuze however if the proximity function fails the fuze is designed with pd backup function ufouo in the event of an airburst fragments that would otherwise be directed into the ground immediately below the rocket during typical point detonation have time and space to disperse horizontally and become lethal fragments the following table shows the impact this has on the effective area of 107mm rockets u 107mm rocket lethality data confidentialmean area of

table the increase in lethality due to increased hob depends largely on the nature of the target crel to usa mcfi for comparable angles of fall there is as much as 30 increase in lethal area for standing personnel crel to usa mcfi the lethality of proximityfuzed 107mm rockets can be more than four times greater for prone protected personnel crel to usa mcfi the most significant difference is for protected personnel without overhead cover ie foxhole where proximityfuzed rocket can be 5060 times more lethal than pointdetonating rocket u significance of fuze discovery ufouo anticoalition forces have been known to use variety of fuzes with 107mm rockets including types that are not designed for these rockets and often do not even work it is probable thatsecretrel to usa mcfimr page 3 secretrel to usa mcfimrindividuals launching the rockets are compelled to use whatever fuzes are made available to them as long as they match the fuze threads of the rocket it is clear that the fuzes in the wit report are md21 fuzes designed for use with 107mm rockets but it may be mere coincidence in this case that they were correctly associated with their intended munitions there is not any information to indicate that these fuzes were sought out specifically for their ability to enhance the rockets lethality however the preset nature of these fuzes would allow them to function in proximity mode without the operator ever knowing what type of fuzes they were this is the significance of the discovery regardless of users knowledge of the fuze type md21 proximity fuzes can substantially increase the effective area of 107mm rockets u conclusion srel to usa mcfi the 107mm rockets discovered by the witeod team on 16 february 2006 are fuzed with proximity fuzes intended for use with these rocket types the downrange effect of using these fuzes would be the same whether or not the insurgents knew these were proximity fuzes or if they were simply using the only fuzes available the md21 rf proximity fuze will result in 107mm rockets detonating at burst height of 5 to 8 meters above the ground significantly increasing the rockets effective area ngic1143717606 date
