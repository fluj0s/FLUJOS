the federal unemployment tax act futa and by state payroll taxes under the state unemployment tax acts suta the underlying framework of the uc system is contained in the social security act ssa title iii of the ssa authorizes grants to states for the administration of state uc laws title ix authorizes the various components of the federal unemployment trust fund utf and title xii aut horizes advances or loans to insolvent state uc programs originally the intent of the uc program among other things was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions 1 this intent is reflected in the current uc programs funding and benefit structure when the economy grows uc program revenue rises through increased tax revenues whereas uc program spending falls as fewer workers are unemployed the effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy this also creates surplus of funds or cushion of available funds for the uc program to draw upon during recession in recession uc tax revenue falls and uc program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive uc benefits the increased amount of uc payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy g23g151g142g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g22g138g161g142g156g561 uc benefits are financed through employer taxes2 the federal taxes on employers are under the authority of the federal unemployment tax act futa and the state taxes are under the authority given by the state unemployment tax acts

employers in states with programs pproved by the federal government and with delinquent federal loans may credit 54 percentage points against the 62 tax rate making the minimum net federal unemployment tax rate 08 most recently because new york had unpaid loan balances the new york employers rate was higher for 2004 and 2005 because all states currently have approved programs 08 is the

regulations provide broad guidelines on state unemployment taxes states levy their own payroll taxes on employers to fund regular uc benefits and the state share of the eb program these state uc tax rates are experiencerated in which employers generating the fewest claimants have the lowest rates the state unemployment tax rate of an employer is in most states based on the amount of uc paid to fo rmer employees generally in most states the more uc benefits paid to its former employees the higher the tax rate of the employer up to maximum established by state law the experience rating is intended to ensure an equitable distribution of uc program taxes among employer s and to encourage stable workforce state ceilings on taxable wages in 2008 range from 7000 eight states to 34000 washington the minimum rates range from 0 eight states to 169 rhode island the maximum rates range from 54 17 states to 1096 massachusetts approximately 322 billion in suta taxes were collected in

there is statutory requirement of an adequately funded st ate uc program however the us department of labor dol suggests that to be minimally solvent states reserve balance should provide for one years projected benefit payment needs on the basis of the highest levels of benefit payments experienced by the state over the last twenty years this is called the average highcost multiple ahcm ratio of 10 or greater prior to recession indicates state is minimally solvent states below this level are vulnerable to exhausting their funds in recession dol provides the ahcm in its quarterly program and financial data report in the summary of financial data these reports are available on line at httpwwwworkforcesecuritydoletagov unemployfinanceasp table 1 provides financial information for the third quarter of calendar year 2008 the first data column lists the amount of state taxes collected in the previous 12 months the second column lists the balance each states account in the utf at the end of the 12month period the third column calculates the ratio of the trust fund balance to the estimated sum of wages earned by employees in jobs covered by the uc system the final column lists the ahcm where number less than 1 does not meet dols definition of minimally solvent

if the state does not pay the uc benefits federal law is quite explicit the state will not have uc program meeting federal requirements and thus the federal tax on employers would be net tax of 62 with credit for state unemployment taxes rather than 08 if the state uc program paid benefits and had outstanding loans

program is financed by dedicated tax imposed on employers and not by general revenues thus even if recession hits given state and as result that states trust account is depleted the state remains legally required to continue paying benefits to do so the state will be forced to borrow money from the dedicated loan account the federal unemployment account fua within the unemployment trust fund utf or from outside sources if the state chooses to borrow funds from the fua not only will the state be required to continue paying benefits it will also be required to repay the funds plus any interest due it has borrowed from the federal loan account such states will probably be forced to raise taxes on their employers andor reduce uc benefit levels actions that dampen economic growth job creation and consumer demand in short states have strong incentives to keep adequate funds in their trust fund accounts

fiscal year in which they were obtained under previous law states could receive these loans interestfree the interest is the same rate as th at paid by the federal government on state reserves in the utf for the quarter ending december 31 of the preceding year but not higher than 10 per annum states may not pay the interest directly or indirectly from funds in their state account with the utf states still may borrow funds without interest from the fua during the year to receive these interestfree loans the states must repay the loans by september 30 loans may be made in october november or december of the calendar year of such an interestfree loan otherwise the interestfree loan will accrue interest charges

january 1 on which the state has an outstanding loan if the outstanding loan is not repaid by that time the state will face federal tax increases this means that state may have from approximately 22 to 34 months to repay the loan without federal tax increase depending on when it obtained the outstanding loan if the state does not repay fully by november 10 it becomes subject to reduction in the amount of credit applied against the federal unemployment tax beginning with the preceding january 1 until the state repays the loan fully that states employers must pay the additional federal taxes resulting from the credit reduction later than january 31 of the next calendar year the additional federal taxes are then deposited into the appropriate state account thus the amount of the loan or the funds the state must continue to borrow is reduced by the additional federal taxes paid by the state employers

the credit reduction is initially 03 percentage points for the year beginning with the calendar year in which the second consecutive january first passes during which the loan is outstanding and increases by 03 percentage points for each year there is an outstanding loan for example in the first year the credit reduction results in the net federal tax rate increasing from 08 to 11 in the second year it would increase to 14 there are two potential additional credit reductions on top of the cumulative 03 percentage point increases during the ensuing calendar years in which state has an outstanding loan 1 in the calendar years after which the third and fourth consecutive january 1 pass and 2 in the calendar years after which the fifth or more consecutive january 1 pass

applied in year by meeting certain statutory criteria for example in section 272 of pl 97248 delinquent state may have the option of repaying on or before november 9 portion of its outstanding loans each year through transfer of specified amount from its account in the utf to the fua the state also must repay all loans for the most recent oneyear period ending on november 9 plus the potential additional taxes that would have been imposed for the taxable year in addition the state must have sufficient amounts in the state account of the utf to pay all compensation for the last quarter of that calendar year without receiving loan finally the state must also have altered its state law to increase the net solvency of its account with the utf if the state complies with all these requirements the credit reduction is reduced by statutory formula g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 kathleen romig analyst in
