extortion3 scheidler the supreme court concluded that the fendants conduct coul d not be considered extortion for purposes of the hobbs act the travel act or state law chief justice rehnquist joined by the entire court other than justice stevens noted that the history of the hobbs act makes it clear that its extorti on proscription must include both an element of relinquishing property under threat and an element of acquiring property under threat 123 sct at 106368 the roots of the hobbs act can be traced back through the anti racketeering act of 1934 and the new york penal code to the field code all three proscribed both extortion and co ercion coercion was separate crime that essentially consisted of ex tortion without the elemen t of obtaining property ie the use of threat or fear to unlawfully induce anothe r to do or refrain doing something the victim was otherwise free to do the court conclude d that the congressional decision to outlaw extortion but not coercion in the hobbs ac t precluded reading the obtaining property element out of the hobbs act 123 sct at 1067 with regard to extortion under the trav act and under state law the court explained that extortion referred to the rm as generically understood under the model penal code and the laws of most jurisdicti ons extortion includes an obtaining element 123 sct at 106869 thus the result was th same as extorti on under the hobbs act unless the property relinquished under threat or fear is obtained by another there is generic crime of extortion 123 sct at 1069 justices ginsburg and breyer added parate concurring opinion in which they agreed with the courts refusal to read rico expansively and observed that the freedom of access to clinic entrances act face 18 usc 248 addresses the concerns that gave rise to the case 123 sct at 1069 justice stevens in his dissent objected th at the courts murky opinion seems to hold that this phrase obtaining the property of another covers nothing more than the acquisition of tangible prope rty 123 sct at 106972 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21345crs4 4 the district courts of th united states shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of

v wollersheim 796 f2d 1076 1089 9th cir 1986while on balance it may well have been desirable for congre ss to have extended to private parties the right to injunctive relief under civil rico we are convinced that congress chose not to do so and we must respect and follow that judgment sedima sprl v imrex co inc 741 f2d 482 509 2d cir 1984it thus seems altogether likely that 1964c as it now stands was not intended to provide private parties injunctive relief revd on other grounds 473 us 479 1985 bolin v sears roebuck co 231 f3d 970 977n42 5th cir 2000there is considerable doubt that injunctive relief is available to private plaintiffs under rico johnson v collins entertainment co inc 199 f3d 710 726 4th cir 1999there is substantial doubt whether rico grants private parties cause of action for equitable relief lincoln house inc v dupre 903 f2d 845 848 1st cir 1990it is not clear whether inj unctive or other equitable relief is available at all in private civil rico actions but see bennett v berg 710 f2d 1361 1365 8th cir 1983mcmillian j concurring in part and dissen ting in parti would also reach the question whether equitable relief is available to privat parties under rico question left undecided by the majority banc opinion and an swer that question affirmativelyinjunctive relief the court left for another day the issue of whether private plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief under rico the dispute centers around the language of section 1964 and its legislative history th section has three relevant part s the first part authorizes federal district courts to exercise their equitable powers to prevent and restrain rico violations4 the second part permits the attorney general to request th courts to do so5 the third part allows anyone injured by ri co violation to sue for treble damages and attorneys fees6 until the seventh circuits decision in this case federal appellate courts had either rejected or expressed serious doubts over whet her private rico litigants could claim the benefit of the courts injunc tive and other equitable powers7 the seventh circuit seeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21345crs5 authority in the text of the section other circuits find different answer in the legislative history of the section rico began in the senate where it passed without the private cause of action language now found in 1964c the hous judiciary committee added subsection c to section 1964 with little commentary hrepno 911549 1970 the subsection however was mirror image of the language then found in section 4 of the clayton act 15 usc 15 1970 ed yet it had pr ovision comparable to section 16 of the clayton act which authorized injunctive relief for the benefit of private parties 15 usc 26 1970 ed specific amendment for inj unctive relief was offe red during debate on the house floor along with several proce dural adjustments but the amendment was withdrawn apparently to allow the judiciary committee time to study its implications 116 congrec 35346347 1970 the following cong ress senator mc clellan ricos original sponsor proposed private injunc tive relief amendment that likewise never received full congre ssional approval 117 congrec 268 1971 see also srepno 92 1070 1972 this is thought to suggest that congress never intended to establish private cause of action for injunctive relief suggestion confirmed by subseque nt efforts to provide specific authorization the argument to the contrary is easily stated subsection 1964a grants fede ral courts broad equitable powers available to all comers subsection 1964b permits the attorn ey general to seek pretrial restraining orders and performance bonds subsection 19 64c permits rico victims to sue for treble damages and attorneys fees neither subsections 1964b nor 1964c preclude the attorney general or private parties from seeking the relief made available under subsection 1964a without rega rd to plaintiff status now v scheidler 267 f3d at 697
