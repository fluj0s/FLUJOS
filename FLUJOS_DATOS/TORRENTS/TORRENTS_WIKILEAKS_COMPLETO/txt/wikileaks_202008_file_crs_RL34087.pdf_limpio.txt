emergency housing policies par ticularly its approach to h ealth and safety standards as exemplified by the evidence of formalde hyde in both trailers and mobile homes as well as its overall strategy to perform its housing mission to address disaster housing issues congress could opt to consid er questions such as the following how have disaster housing needs traditionally been addressed under the stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act pl 93288 as amended how did femas approach during hurricane katrina differ fro m previous disasters and why should fema have pursued expanded authorities at the start of the disaster s hould housing vouchers have been used earlier and ta ilored to the disaster event with substantial amount of available funding pr ovided by cong ress but without requesting expanded authority fema found its sole option was to use traditional disaster housing practices those practices successful for disasters of historically familiar size were hardpressed to meet th unprecedented demands of the katrina catastrophic disaster there are potential events new madrid earthquake or other large natural or terrorist events that could conceiva bly produce many of the same challenges presented by the gulf coast hurricane season of 2005 those challenges include large displaced populations spread acro ss the nation and sepa rated families unable to return because of the loss of not only their homes but also their places of employment federal disaster housing po licy may remain an issue in the 110th congress because as hurricane katrina illustrated the tinued existence of communities after catastrophic event involve s extensive federal assistance issues in the past femas approaches ve turned on practical and theoretical considerations practical considerations include the agencys ability to house families and individuals within short time frame and in proximity to the original disaster and in the case of hurricane katr ina to make contact with the hundreds of thousands of applicants who registered for assistance some of the theoretical policy considerations include questions of equity selfreliance federalism and the duration of federal assistance those considerati ons have led to proce ss questions concerning program stewardship and the potential fo r waste fraud and abuse of federal resources the postkatrina act enacted in october of 2006 pl 109295 includes changes in fema housing policy that provide the president with greater flexibility for meeting the challenges of disasters on large scale also public law 11028 has eased the costshare burden for some housing costs and other disaster relief programs future debate on the housing issu will also be informed by the report on the national

acknowledged the difficulty of the task the report noted that some experts believed that the shelter system eventually built up over the opening weeks of the katrina disaster with the inherent coordination that was necessary was similar to opening fortune 500 company in couple days time14 fema provided to the states and thei r shelter partners disasterspecific guidance that listed in great detail the costs that would be eligible for reimbursement15 despite the guidelines th anrc and others involved in sheltering still coped with significant questions raised by the scope of the event emergency shelters are dependent not only on adequate space but also on many other logistical concerns including health and safety the ability to serve special needs populations and the availability of trained volunteers to sta ff these facilities in the case of hurricane katrina the size and scope of this disaster was truly unprecedented in comparison to other large events as such the disaster strained the traditional shelter system16 as noted above emergency shelters funded under section 403 authority are intended to be temporary hous ing solutions the decision by the administration to accelerate the closing of the emergency shelters and move disaster victims to more suitable housing situations by october 15 2005 about six weeks after the hurricane meant that many families and individuals had to quickly find housing alternatives17 at its peak the postkatrina mass shelte r network provided shelter for over 273000 evacuees18 although charting such an ambitious goal did speed up the emptying of the shelters it also meant that alternative forms of housing were needed prior to the registration of evacuees with fema and before any individuals andor families could be presented

of cruise ships as emergency shelters had reportedly been considered by fema fficials as early as 1989 followi ng disaster in the us virgin islands however this form of shelter had never actually been employed19 for island disasters and in coastal areas in particular cruise ships were considered to be strategically valuable form of she lter that could be broug ht rapidly to remote locations despite arguments for thei r use however such contracts had previously been let prior to katrina the katrina experience given the challenges posed by katrina fema chose to use the cruise ship alternative and asked the navy to charter these ships20 the ships most useful capabilities were to house both victims and relief workers in private rooms in close proximity to the disa ster area and to have onsite feeding facilities the ships offered the possibility that some of the victims of the disaster could be part of the rebuilding process by giving them access to the area where the work was being conducted for catastrophi c disaster this is serious concern particularly when large work force is arriving in an area that has had mass evacuation coupled with the destruction of rental units although housing shared by victims and workers arguably has benefits some disadvantages were identified for example at house financ ial services hearing on katr ina housing one member of congress noted that the large fema contingent of workers in the area actually used significant part of the remaining res ources both hotels and other housing and suggested that fema staff were in fact in competition with local disaster victims wishing to return to the area21 during their use the ships housed over 8000 people and served over two million meals to katrina victims and workers helping in the recovery22 while meeting emergency needs critics questioned the cost of housing victims on the ships some doubted the efficacy of the plan the location of some ships the cost and length of the contract and the process used to arrive at the agreement as one story noted the six month contract staunchly defended by carnival but castigated by politicians from both parties has come to exemplify the cost of haste that followed katrinas strike and femas lack of preparation23 while the cruise ships attracted consider able media attenti on one step taken in this process may warrant furthe r

femas emergency trailer parks that were established on the gulf coast when fema child care services or other amenities were eligible expenses for the management of the trailer parks25 similar concerns have long been part of temporary housing operations but the scale of the postkatrina disaster environment brought greater scrutiny to the issues of supportive services for large temporary housing sites traditional hotels and motels the local chapters of the anrc routinely provide brief hotel or motel stays as form of emergency housing around the nation on daily basis for disaster victims including the victims of fires or other local emergencies the local anrc chapters are frequently reimbursed by fema for this work in presidentially declared disasters of much smaller scale than katrina this form of assistance is referred to in regu lations as reasonable shortterm housing expenses26 however because the practice of providing transient accommodations involves working with much smaller numbers of victims the length of stay is usually brief and the task of finding more suitable accommodations not as daunting as the katrina experience the katrina experience hotels and motels were used around the country both by selfevacuated families and individuals and by disaster evacuees who were moved out of shelters and into these establishments by the anrc and fema hotels and motels in the disaster area were also used to house relief workers much of the work of placing victims in these facilities was managed by contractor corporate lodging consultants c lc that worked originally for the red cross and then fema clc engaged the hot els and motels to track occupancy and managed the payments to the participating facilities27 many residents in harms way had sel fevacuated to

program provided some privacy for families that had been spent significant period of time in mass shelters the hotelmotel option gave displaced victims chance to be in room with their own private

the debris removal program congregate sheltering and some other distinct missions such as search and rescue work or the pr ovision of temporar school facilities29 the fema housing mission is in part

approximately 67000 apartment leases in 32 states while the original instructions by fema offered to reimburse leases of up to 12 months states were encouraged to engage in shorter leases if

403 sheltering housing to traditional longerterm section 408 temporary housing assistance was difficult one normally fema works with relatively small population which traditionally makes this crosswalk eas ier however that was not the case for this event fema had to contact all recipients of 403 assistance in order to establish their eligibility for longer rm aid under section 408 that contact also had to include an explanation of the pro cess as well as available housing options the location of some housing resources and th timetables involved disaster victims also had to be assured that the next fo rm of housing assistance was available for those deemed eligible accordingly checks for rental assistance or unit of manufactured housing had to be availabl before the applicants were moved from their current residences eligibility for section 408 assistance is based on several c onditions including finding by fema that the applicants primary residence is unlivable the applicant is experienci ng financial hardship and there are other related difficulties in the aftermath of declared disaster event32 eligibility determinations are routinely made in most disaster situations by staff at femas national process service centers npscs at the npscs staff take registrations both telephonica lly and online working in concert with femas on site staff based at the joint field offices jfos in or near the affected area and with femas contracted housing inspectors major challenge to this traditional approach rested in the sheer number of victims involved in the katrina disaster thousands of evacuees were placed in hotelmotel rooms in 48 states as well as in staterented apartments in 32 states the wide dispersal of victims compounded the transition process this outreach mission was especially difficult to accomplish within shifting deadlines established by the department of homeland security dhsfema due to the extent of the devastation in the affected area housing inspections could not always be conducted within the usual time frames such inspections are generally critical to eligibility decisions in addition fema had to cobble together series of

anothe r state fema also presumes based on typical program performance that th section 408 assistance provided will be relatively short in duration ge nerally much less than the 18 months of eligible help45 certainly many disasters are far more localized within states and communities with localized event the difference in employment is the commuting distance from temporary housing location rather than the retention of the job itself the challenge of continuing employment is one fundamental difference between most disaster declarations and an event such as hurricane katrina this unique circumstance of sudden j oblessness on large scale underlines the difficulties in applying the section 408 authority to catas trophic major disasters of this breadth magnitude and duration in essence hurricane katrina exceeded all previous experience and also the perceived reach of statutory authority an additional consideration in the postkatrina environment was the demographic profile of affect ed residents as one report noted hurricane katrina disproportionately impacted communities where the poor and minorities mostly africanamericans resided the three states where communities were damaged or flooded by the hurricane rank among the poorest in the nation46 this meant more renters were affected and many victims had little means of support these victims were sent far from home taking few

homes and travel trailers to meet the needs of disaster victims when needs cannot be met through home repair or av ailable rental units mobile homes are larger and are generally used to house applicants who ar unable to obtain rental housing in the area additionally they are intended to m eet longerterm disaster housing needs travel trailers are smaller units that are usually parked adjacent to the home so that the individual or family can continue repairs while the home itself cannot be occupied and not have to pay for the space to park the trailer the units are also placed on existing commercial lots and in parks created by fema for that purpose the travel trailers have been used principally for shorterterm housing needs following disaster events48 travel trailers unlike mobile homes ar not classified as housing or dwellings instead they are considered transportation since they are often moved from site to site for recreational purposes hud has not establis hed standards for tra ilers as it has for mobile homes which are considered housin g and are designed to be used as dwelling49 the distinction between housin g and transportation also becomes important

after congressional committee accused fema of pressuring the cdc to downplay health risks attached to the trailers due to liability concerns fema and cdc officials have denied the allegations fema has

regarding housing assistance over the extend ed disaster recovery period65 particular dilemma in implementing this plan has been the relative paucity of rental units available in the immediate disaster area also since the great majority of remaining travel trailer units are on private lots where owners are slowly repairing their homes there may be additional logistical challeng for the government and decisions for families and individuals in testimony before the senate homeland security and government affairs committee dhs secretary chertoff summed up the situation now i recognize the reality is theres not lot of housing in the area and that may mean for some people they will have to move some distance away thats been frankly one of the reasons why i think some people have been reluctant to move out of trailers but from an number of standpoints whether it be formaldehyde or just the fact that these trailers are not designed as permanent residences i think that people would be mu ch better served if they bit the bullet and moved out and we will do everything that we can certainly to facilitate that i guess question we will have to wrestle with is whether we will compel people to move out66 housing inspections stre ngths and li mitations traditionally almost all key decisions in the fema housing missi on are tied to an onsite inspection of the damaged housing by fema

serve as semipermanent or interim housing in the wake of disa ster are mentioned in the draft housing strategy fema has taken several actions that may reflect the eventual contents of its strategy two of these actions are the establishment of the disaster housing assistance program dhap which transf erred management of longterm rental housing to hud75 and femas recent announced reve rsal in the

outer parishes to accept significant number of mobile homes or travel trailers in their jurisdictions by helping them defer increased costs to the community caused by the new temporary sites there is record of fema responding officially to that overall proposal but some examples of previous actions arguably indicate fema had given some support to the concept early in the disaster fema had set up temporary laundry facilities fo r one trailer park during the hurricanes of 2004 in florida fema had helped sewer dist rict expand its capacity following the establishment of trailer park within that jurisdiction in each case these actions had been ad hoc decisions made by the leadership in the field not reflecting official policy79 later in early november 2005 fema hous ing staff in louisiana created their own version of supporting services lis ting to encourage more local support for the trailer parks the proposal from the fema field staff was six page memorandum that described ty pes of assistance that coul d potentially be available to the hosting community from fema or other federal agencies the recognized areas for additional help to the local community included road repair and traffic management public works nd other community services80 this proposal was not adopted but fema continued to review the suggestions fema ultimately decided it was authorized to provide limited community service help and sent out twopage memo in middecember of 2005 offering potential help for fire and safety forces that provide service to the trailer parks in their jurisdictions81 some fema staff believed the dela in arriving at decision and the limited reach of the final decision resulted in increased reluctance on the part of local officials to host such trailer parks femas leadership

and solutions hearing 110th cong 1st sess march 20 2007beyond any and all stafford act authorities noting that these are intended to be temporary sites some cont end that each additional servi ce provided is an enticement to transform temporary site as author ized by law into something far more permanent it is argued that such site with amenities and services sponsored by the government does not contribute to the proce ss of helping residents transition to more permanent housing femas position according to one journalist is that such help if needed should be provided by private charitable groups however in its interactions with charitable groups interested in providing additional services fema has reportedly been reluctant partner in describing the philosophical approach to the management of trailer park site such as renaissance village in baker louisiana one reporter explained the fema position as follows fema is the federal agency charge d with providing temporary housing to displaced people its officials read th at mandate very narrowly they will supply housing and little else for as long as 18 months while people get back on their feet the government provides evacuees trailer water and sewer lines and electricity residents must now get pr etty much everything else on their own or from charity fema does not want anyone to get too comfortable here83 in the case of renaissance village so charitable and social service groups expressed particular concern because anyone included nearly 370 children under the age of 1284 some contend that community services are necessary component of temporary trailer park because ch ildren need recreational opportunities and facilities and child care and related services others however believe that the establishment of services and the longterm residency they imply runs counter to the interest of congress to provi minimal or temporary housing in hearing of the house transportation and infrastructure committees subcommittee on economic velopment public buildings and emergency management the subcommittee chair re presentative norton acknowledged the complexity of the issue representativ norton signaled that fema should not be required to provide comprehensive services on site or establish village that could further isolate the resident s instead she observed that fema should be providing transportation

ortune500katrina_entergy 87 44 cfr 206117biicone limiting factor for housing both tem porary and permanent was the utility problem in new orleans femas contractor s were hard pressed to keep up with the number of requests for tempor ary housing units the lack of utilities meant that site preparation lagged entergy is private utility company that had been new orleans last fortune 500 company but found itself in precarious financial straits following the devastating event86 the lag time on utility rest oration became yet another chicken and egg situation which would come first the arrival of housing units or the utilities to support them s imilar question arose regarding neighborhood schools should the schools be re paired or should the student s be present first the inertia that resulted from these sticking points has been common factor for post katrina communities local leadership and communitybased decision making organizations arguably are equipped to set the priorities that could resolve these issues femas local partnerships par ticularly the interaction of federal coordinating officer and staff with experience in similar situations can be useful their cooperation with local leadership can contribute to more effective transition for the community issues also arise as to where tempor ary manufactured housing should be sited femas regulations prohibit the placement of mobile homes in flood plains to avert similar disasters in the future87 this has discouraged the placement of housing needed by katrina victims fema has how ever permitted the use of travel trailers rather than mobile homes in such vulne rable areas under the assumption that they can be moved out of harms way more ra pidly this assumption is questionable when large numbers of travel trailers ar being used in concentrated area and fema requires that contractors strap down all of the manufactur ed housing installed on the gulf coast the increased safety created by tying down the mobile homes restricts mobility this is dilemma wit hout simple answer since it involves the pursuit of two goals potentially in c onflict the need to provide housing in proximity to the disasterstr icken area and the assurance that safe temporary housing will be placed in secure disaster resistant areas the high levels of formaldehyde in tr avel trailers and mobile homes revealed by the centers for diseas control cdc serves to underline the importance of health and safety concerns when establishing temporary housing for disaster victims fema has indicated it may continue to em ploy mobile homes that are subject to hud and industry standards for their safety but will longer use travel trailers since similar standards do not exist the commitment of dhsfema to longer use one type of temporary unit is arguably unders tandable given the recent experience but some may question what the alternative form of housing will be since the travel trailers were such commonly used resour ce in previous fema recovery operations an additional topic of interest is th influence of femas temporary housing program and policies on eventual resettlement and rebuilding decisions at the state and local levels some of the fema recovery program elements fall outside thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs22 88 42 usc 5174defined temporary housing arena but have direct impact on rebuilding and other related developments within the disaster area this includes elements such as transportation costs for victims to return to their homes the establishment and locations of group temporary housing sites and the progress of infrastructure repair and mitigation projects and the support they could provide for neighborhood redevelopment fema involvement in community rebuildin g is considerable but local decision making is also important to accelerate the work fema actions are dependent on choices and priorities established by the state and local governments in terms of both infrastructure repair and the priority given to debris removal and mitigation projects conversely when fundamental decisions lik those concerning costshare waivers are delayed very little can proceed at the cal level the experience of fema and its federal state and local partners ove r the last two years may provide guide to what worked well what did not and what options remain under current authorities equity in assistance key concern in the imp lementation of disaster temporary housing programs was how to ach ieve equity with huge and diverse population that was receiving various degrees of assistance the variation depended not only on familys or individuals circumstances for example whether relatives were able to provide help but also on the resources of the receiving state one concern was that those receiving 403 assi stance would have all of their 408 accounts remaining referencing th 28200 maximum available under the individual and households program while those who had successfully registered and received help through more traditional fema processes were already drawing down from the total section 408 amount available to them nd their families given the unprecedented size of this disaster the 403 solution boug ht necessary time while the 408 processing went on however as result some we re arguably penalized for their prompt application for section 408 aid efforts to address the equity problems in the delivery of fema disaster housing may consider the exclusion of initia l housing costs under section 408 from the legislative caps see options section of this report under this arrangement all applicants would begin with the same amount of available resources within their ihp accounts this change however would in crease costs since it would be equivalent to increasing the amount of help made availa ble further all of the aforementioned considerations do not include the assist ance some families and individuals received from charitable groups as well choice for disaster assistance applicants disaster victims have limited discretion to choose among the types of housing assistance authorized the stafford act authorizes the president to provide financial assistance and if necessary direct services88 those applying for help must generally accept the form of housing offered this is underlined in femas regulations which stress that an applicant is expected to accept

disaster victims in louisiana fema estimates it will eventually expend more than 10 billion to provide human servi ces housing crisis counseling disaster unemployment assistance to that population90 given such expenditures government officials may be expected to make choices that combine sound stewardship of funds with efficient management conversely the misfortune of natural or manmade disast er can determine familys housing choices and actual housing location for an extended period of time but the housing aid offered has c ouple of imperatives that may not be complimentary key question is whether the goal of the housing mission in the stafford act is to place families as close to their original residences as possible or to house as many people as economically as possible in catastrophic situation involving thousands of evacuees the idea of choice may be temporarily exchanged for an immediate response with different re sults as the director of the natural hazards research and app lication center observed worse yet instead of having their needs addressed in timely manner those stranded in new orleans after katrina were not so much assisted as they were policed literally treated like criminals they were confined to shelters under strict control later they were transported again under the control of law enforcement agencies and the military to over forty states ar ound the country without even having the opportunity to choose where they would be sent91 the use of housing vouchers does not nece ssarily enable victim to return to an area with very few remaining rent units available nor can vouchers accommodate the desire of displaced pe rson for rapid return but the vouchers can provide greater degree of choice as heritage foundation housing expert explained obviously giving evacuees access to housing vouchers that can be used in any metropolitan area in the nation will increase the likelihood that many will choose not to return with vouchers they will have access to better housing than they had in the slums of new orleans and will have the choice to remain in communities where they can improve their standard of living and quality of life92 after

the funds to meet their housing needs and if funds remain to meet other di sasterrelated needs housing vouchers issued by hud can pr ovide both choice and mobility also given the nature of the vouchers being i ssued by housing authorities that establish relationships with landlords the vouchers offer more controls and accountability but in the case of katrina hud vouchers we re never used apart from the assistance given to some households that previously received hud aid in the area of choice the distinction between cash and vouchers becomes more complicated cash grant provides the ultimate discretion to disaster victim on its use with reporting of those uses trailing months behind voucher so gives the victim wide latitude but is more directed toward housing resources additionally the relationship with the issuing authority eg local public housing authority offers the potential of additional help for consultation on housing issues most localized disasters do not involve the problems of applicants being displaced vast distances fro m their homes jobs and schools the evacuation after katrina had to be carried out rapidly si nce there were housing resources in the flooded city the speed of the evacuation appeared to make choice moot point could the evacuation have been organize d to point where evacuees could have chosen destination the requirement for prompt action argued against that but transportation funds were pr ovided to reunite families at the location of their choice although difficulties are readily apparent th matter of choice remains an issue for consideration in general for disaster housing law and policy incentives for communities some contend that in light of the katrina experience the stafford act s hould include incentives for commun ities to host temporary housing sites that could become permanent housing subdivisions it may be argued that congress provided some of this flexibility by replacing temporary housing with semipermanent housing au thority within the postkatrina act pl10929593 on the other hand some may ar gue that hosting communities have existing incentives since they already benef it from spending by the residents of the sites at local business establishments wher they purchase products and services and pay local taxes in the same vein it may be argued th at fema should have explicitly defined authority regarding the agencys ability to make large temporary housing sites more supportive of community spirit nd recovery as the earlier discussion in this section on management of services indicates th ere has been confusion during the post katrina recovery as to who should or would even be per mitted to provide such additional help for these temporary communities some have observed that this form of support for the group traile r sites could become the fundamental contribution made by the state and its local governme nts to the temporary housing

condition of the units was diminished further by repeated travel to disaster sites and back to the storage sites in 1995 femas reinventing government phase ii co mmittee recommended the closing of the two sites and the sale of the units arguing that local purchasing as needed would be more efficient the committee also noted that most temporary housing in the early 1990s had been pr ovided through home repairs and rental assistance this was partly due to the northridge earthquake experience at the time femas costliest disaster where repair and rental assistance due to the area affected were more useful options fo r temporary housing than was manufactured housing this recommendation was adopted the sites were closed and the gsa auctioned off andor disperse d the remaining units as consequence since standby contracts were not in place fema officials had to make fast and expensive decisions to purchase thousands of housing units another unanticipated consequence occu rred with the reduction of home repair grants from 10000 or more to 5000 the limination of the mortgage and rental assistance program mra discussed later in this report and the elimination of the option for households who failed to qualify for sba loans to return to fema for additional help with home repairs those changes enacted in the disaster mitigation act of 2000 dma2k arguably pushed fema back in the direction of providing direct housing assistance in the form of manufactured housing previously greater assistance had been available for home repair since it had long been the preferred form of disaster temporary housing assistance95 as gao pointed out in its report following the northridge earthquake in 1994 individuals and families whose homes are damaged can apply to fema for grant to make repairs to restore bitability for the northridge ear thquake applicants could obtain maximum of 1000096 but at times the amount was more than that as the fema office of inspector general pointed

the legislation 101 pl 109295 120 stat 1448the cap on housing repair was signifi cant part of dma2k pl 106390 and was the main source of savings in tem porary housing that the congressional budget office estimated at 10 million for 2002 and 19 million in each following year98 the 5000 cap had been point of c ontention since its legislative impos ition in 2000 changing the provision had been goal of groups active in disaster recovery work99 some tried apparen tly without success to read additional help for home repair into the law100 but fema contended the cap provided recourse for families and individuals unable to obtain sba loans th cap has now been removed by the post katrina act101 however the cap on home repairs was in place during katrina and for year after that event given the smaller amount availabl for home repairs as well as the devastation of the katrina event that made repairs more costly and time consuming manufactured housing became the only alternative based on the time pressure associated with katrina the priority use of manufactured housing may not have been preferred option but it was one that if coupled with dras tically diminished rental inventory in disaster area eg katrina unlike rthridge provided housing opportunities as other possible housing avenues were decr easing however health and safety concerns based on the katrina experience may reduce the future use of this form of housing vouchers offer some freedom of choice for displaced applicants but the existence of vouchers alone cannot reconstitute rental hous ing

would offer the amenities and s upport services that could lead to transition back to their home communities the plan also included the framework for that same transitional community to become permanent housing addition to its host area though femadhs leadership did not act on the strategy the director of the office of recovery and renewal for th state of mississippi also noted the transitional communities concept as promising avenue to explore as means to supplementing housing needs103 opponents of the concept might contend that communities unwilling to accept temporary manufactured housing would be much less likely to consider semi permanent housing development although the notion of transitional co mmunities was not accepted in the early days of postkatrina recovery subs equent congressional action on katrina cottages and the concept of alternative housing indicates policy shift in viewing some temporary housing as prelude to semipermanent or permanent housing104 when considering such an approach main taining distinction between catastrophic disasters and most disasters may be important the larger events arguably might invite bold thinking and creative appro aches smaller disasters may not require transitional communities only the repair and restoration of the disasterdamaged community victims without homes even with the enormous commitment of federal resources following katrina and the varied forms of available help there were still applicants deemed ineligible for traditi onal federal assistan ce programs from both fema and hud these were people with previous permanent address who were not receiving official government help before they were evacuated in many instances they became wards of the comm unity that had accepted them as

from its investment in such an event if fema temporary housing assistance is not available under current regulations for pr eviously homeless families and individuals then the kdhapsn program might be consid ered as possible model in the post disaster environment for limited servi ce for known population with identified needs as with other housing issues this may be another area that lends itself to more collaboration between fema and hud in establishing gene ral policies rather than ad hoc approaches fema had faced similar problems in the pa st with distinctly different responses and results see appendix b of this report the basic issue is whether federal disaster policy should essentia lly return victims to thei r predisaster conditions or whether the disaster recovery proce ss should facilitate an improvement in individuals conditions or at least tinuation of previous aid such as the hud program in the wake of katrina hudfema and long term housing on april 26 2007 the

costeffective temporary housing assistance where altern ative housing options are less available or less costeffective112 however others might agree with the contention of the fema administrator

safer and more disast er resistant housing section 404 is the section within the st afford act that authorizes mitigation assistance mitigation projects are the projects that provide protection from natural hazards and help to reduce damage from futu re disaster events given the rebuilding going on in the disaster area femas em phasis on stressing the hazard preventive nature of these funds appears to reflect th intent of section 404 what is unclear in the dispute is the degree of agreement between fema and the state of louisiana to ensure that the repair or replacement of homes under the roa d home incorporates mitigation measures to build back sa fer housing and reduce future risks another source of the dispute is that th state has been seeking federal funding commensurate with the number of homes stroyed or with major damage the federal government has re sponded that the help was intended only for flooding victims and not for homeowners who lost their homes due to hurricane force winds115 mortgage and rental assistance congress might elect to give attention in the reviews of the recovery phase of katrina to how mortgages were handled various lenders suspended payment sche dules or made other allowances that permitted homeowners to hold on to their hom while still being able to fund their own interim housing needs for example report by the government accountability office gao noted that huds federal housing administration fha also issued 90day moratorium on foreclosures for all fhainsured loan s on properties located in areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita hud subsequently extended the moratorium on foreclosures twice for areas eligible fo r femas individual assistance because it found that due to the magnitude of storm damage lenders and borrowers may still need additional time to develop nd finalize plans for home repairs and resumption of mortgage payments116 the initiatives of fannie mae were another example of special steps taken in the aftermath of katrina were as fannie mae official explained to address the potential for sticker shock down the road when homeowners began to make up missed payments we authorized loan servicers to modify loan terms and develop repayment plans we placed oneyear moratorium on all foreclosures in the most damaged areas once that moratorium expired we continued to work through our lender pa rtners

the work of the jhsg may be part of the disaster housing strategy that has been promised by fema to be provided to congress in april of 2008 possible congressional approaches congress has generally chosen to address significant disaster situations in an ad hoc fashion in part because individua l disasters often have unique requirements and also because large disasters frequen tly require supplemen tal appropriations124 within those supplemental appropriations bills congress has ddressed disaster created needs across the government this has entailed crafting legislation to fund specific programs within different depar tments and agencies and also directing certain actions or waiving cer tain provisions in law to assist the disaster response and recovery efforts this section di scusses some options congress may choose to consider incorporating into standing law to hasten the response and recovery effort and eliminate some uncertainty in policy and program applications following large disaster events httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs33 125 42 usc 5170catastrophic tier catastrophic tier for disaster relief in housing and other elements of the recovery process is policy area that congress might address the aftermath of hurricane katrina illustrated the challenge of implementing stafford act programs on large national scale progra ms that work effectively in multicounty area of one state or two can be overwhe lmed by multistate catastrophic event that poses problems not previously addressed the catastrophic disaster tier could be triggered by the number of potential applicants or evacuees estimated damage including large per capita amount or disruptions to continuity of government other factors could include widespread nationwide dispersal of popula tion questions regarding the viability of the affected areas to allow residents to return the span of the geographical area affected destruction to centers of employment the time residents might be forced to be away from their homes and similar elements any catastrophic tier could arguably be tied to high threshold not easily reached in lesser events the rhetorical argument often broached is that every disaster regardless of size is catastr ophic event for the individuals and families involved while this argument may be diffi cult to sustain some might attempt to do so some states may point to their own limitations legal and budgetary as an argument for waivers of costshares and regulations in noncatastrophic events the stafford act already provides the president with the discretionary authority to make judgments on when an event is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments125 but while that discretion is provided for an initial disaster declaration additional guidance might be desi rable to establish criteria for separate tier for catastrophic events the following are some of the policy areas that could receive attention with rega rd to disaster housing afte r worst case events occur catastrophic housing one possible approach is to develop something like an automatic threetosix month fema section 403 shelteringhousing program for all disaster victims of catastrophic ev ent with fema section 408 assistance commencing for all eligible applicants at the same date and time when the system is ready to absorb the large numbers the timespan of such shelteringhousing program could be shifted to nine or 12 months dependi ng on the federal and state governments ability to make contact with victims and provide them resources for alternative forms of housing this mig ht help to addre ss equity concerns rather than concentration on secti on 403 congress could consider amending the stafford act or the pertinent hud aut horities to have the catastrophic tier trigger special sixto18 month voucher program administered by hud preferably for this discrete purpose and not impinging on hud s ection 8 for disaster victims this would not be an inexpensive alternative since it would likely be in addition to current section 8 vouchers and would not supplant those vouchers past experience indicates however that it is difficu lt to impose such time cap on housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs34 126 for more information see crs report rl33173 hurricane katrina questions regarding the section 8 h ousing voucher program by maggie mccartyvouchers126 but the same concerns with costs exist regarding current fema temporary housing practices the fema temporary housing program has been extended for long periods and the cost of setting up manufactured housing sites is high and the process compli cated for local governments the hud approach has the benefit of ta pping existing resources local public housing authorities that can provide case management or other services and also linking some victims with longerterm housin g aid that they may require this latter linkage is also something that fema and hud should arguably consider for all major disaster declarations that result in longterm housing challenges some may contend however that disaster housing is best administered by fema officials not individuals concerned with l ong term or permanent housing another factor that might be consid ered as congress weighs the housing voucher issue is whether peopl unfortunate enough to be within an area declared major disaster by the president are entitle d to more housing assistance than ordinary citizens who have been waiting for similar help for an extended period of time this is another side of the equity question raised earlier th voucher approach raises this question of fairness given the long waiting list for hud vouchers in most communities incentives for communities the katrina experience arguably illustrates that fema or hud needs specific language with an explicit defin ition of community housing to provide or augment the basic support services that communities require when hosting tem porary housing group site on the other hand congress could consider defin ition that specifically prohibits such inducements as the earlier discussion on location shows very little assistance is offered to community willing to absorb significant number of disaster victims while debate may ensue on which option is the better policy there is arguably little debate that clarification of the issue would eliminate future confusion and would speed actions during the postdisaster period fema group site ma nagement services the required contributions by either fema or the state to the quality of the temporary housing group sites could be more explicitly stated in the law to make clear delineati on of responsibility for the provision of such supportive services on difficulty in such an approach is that often the affected governments are victims themselves in the early stages of disaster recovery when these large sites are being established for that reason the provision could be flexible and provide fema the discretion to approach this problem on casebycase basis also if the assump tion is that nonprofits and charitable groups can provide such support then disast er housing polices and processes could encourage this help mra restoration some argue that the mortgage and rental assistance mra program was missing component in the menu of available help for disaster victims in the katrina response the fha and fannie mae examples see pages 29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs35 127 42 usc 5141 128 44 cfr 20647 129 pl 11028 121 stat 156 and 30 point to the possible alternativ that would make the mra provisions unnecessary however these ad hoc re sponses were triggered by major catastrophic event it is unclear if similar actions can be presumed for other presidentially declared disasters on smaller scale legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress s 2386 and hr 5685 now part of hr 6658 that would restore the program within the stafford act if the program is restored it could be run cooperatively with fema by another department or agen cy with expertise in this area similar to the department of health and human serv ices involvement with the crisis counseling program or the department of labors management of the disaster unemployment assistance dua program regulatory waivers congress could opt to pr ovide expanded authority for agency heads to issue automatic waiver s following catastrophic event such waivers of current regulations could acceler ate early response work and the eventual recovery operations this could involve automatic waivers or streamlining of regulations regarding debris removal on both public and private property environmental and hi storic preservation and the wa iver of costshare commitments by affected state governments some of these waivers are currently employed during disasters by fema on an ad hoc basis using its authority from the stafford act to waive certain administrative conditions127 the authority is used sparingly by fema while this process can be accelerated it could be expedited if automa tically triggered by catastrophic event also the sooner regulatory waivers are decided the faster recovery activity can advance however it can be argued that an automatic trigger also could represent loss of program control and administrative judgment costshare waivers currently stafford act sections 406 and 407 of public assistance infrastructure repair and debr is removal can be adjusted from 75 federal and 25 state and local cost share to 9010 costshare for largeimpact disasters these large disa sters are identified by per capita cost of over 117 per state resident as of fy2007128 often debris removal costs are waived for the opening days of disaster generally for 72 hour period chosen by the state for katrina the debris removal costs were waived indefinitely congress might explore the implications of allowing other needs assistance ona within section 408 and costshared by statute at 7525 to be provided at the same 9010 percentage c ongress might also consider making ona 100 federal assistance when the actual spending for essential assistance involves many states outside those affected by the event congress recently passed legislation pl 110 28 signed into law by president bush which accomplishes this waiver for the gulf coast states affected by the katrina disaster129 such changes might also be considered for noncatastr ophic disaster eventshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs36 130 libby george lawmakers applaud white house plan on longterm

state the affected states and fema regions would continue to compile list of eligible items and costs that might be reimbursed through blockgrant program administered by the state the responsibil ity of administering the program could then become the state contribution assuming the state has retained the capacity to manage it after significant disaster event th is alternative might be applicable to non catastrophic events too costshare serves not only as necessary legal contribution from the state the investment it represents may also result in more discerning judgment and may contribute to the quality and quantity of projects submitted for supplemental help the difficult challenge under generous cost share is to retain that leverage or incentive for the responsible selection and prioritization of projects by the state to ensure that federal objectives are achieved administrative responsibility another policy ques tion is which federal agency should be primarily responsible for catastrophic disast er housing should hud run the longer term housingsheltering program through state and local housing authorities and nongovernment organizations ngos si nce it has experience with voucher programs and ongoing relationships with thos same metropolitan housing authorities and related ngos while such an approach makes sense for large events spread out over many states and localities some may contend that using the same approach on smaller disast ers may be problematic in those instances the management of housing res ources would be falling on th locality with the fewest resources and to the entity unit of local government that may itself be disaster victim alternatively hud does have the capacity to ca ll on its relationships with phas around the country to assist with unm et needs so transition to hud for the housing mission may be the mo st effective approach on april 26 2007 the administration announced plan in which fema and hud would collaborate to provide housing to katrina victims for an additional 18 months beyond the current august 2007 deadline130 this coupled with previous katrina experience may provide test case for the efficacy of this approach concluding observations the housing strategy employed following hurricane katrina was driven by size time and circumstance wh ile some decisions were forced by immediate needs others were choices made by fema dhs and the administration still other decisions were driven by choices not ma avenues not explored perhaps due to caution or decisions postponed which becam tantamount to decisions themselves since the administration did not request expanded authorities the traditional fema housing programs for much smaller disaster s became the default action plan of the federal government for the largest natural disaster event in us history it can be argued that parts of this plan worked ve ry well such as the rental housing providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs37 131 us department of homeland security federal emergency management agency congressional monthly report may 4 2007 p 10by hosting states however other parts such as the dependence on mobile homes and travel trailers appear not as suitable to either the magnitude or location of this catastrophic event what should disaster temporary housing be is it mainly homerepair option or rentalassistance option either with cash assistance or voucher or should manufactured housing be presented as th only option fema itself has had shifting emphasis over the years much of it driven by the nature and location of individual large disasters which in turn has moved its policie s and vehicles for providing temporary housing on large scale that shifting emphasis is reflected in the temporary housing response to katrina with the discovery of unsafe levels of formaldehyde in trailers fema may be shifting its approach once again more definitive approach might be helpful to fema its state partners and the disaster victims flexibility however might also be needed despite the very real problems encount ered by victims their communities and their host communities thousands of fa milies and individuals have received significant amount of supplemental aid from th government for housing at present the amount of funding spent on housing both rental assistance and manufactured housing for the gulf coast hurricane season of 2005 stands at over 10 billion131 fema and other staff at federal state local and voluntary agencies struggled to address an unprecedented event there have been many challenges along the way perhaps most importantly the difficulty in communicating complicated housing policy decisions to vast and dispersed population many of the staff involved both in the governmental and nongovernmental sectors at all levels provided assistance through th temporary housing programs and administrative channels that existed those programs were severely challenged by disaster of unprecedented size com pounded by unique problem s of devastation and mass evacuations new partnerships we re established and significant level of federal resources were provide d if not always judiciously employed programs that can work well for garden variety di saster may not be appropriate for catastrophic event assumptions based on the average can be overwhelmed by the exceptional for an event such as ka trina new approaches were apparently considered but often rejected in favor of the familiar this is understandable given the propensity to avoid establishing preced ent based on an outlier event and the body of law and regulations nd policies supporting current housing practices however effective leadership and carefully drawn gislation can help to distinguish between the extraordinary and the common events and res pond appropriately even now long after katrinas landfa ll in august of 2005 congress continues to debate longterm recovery roles among federal agencies and state governments that are still uncertain but clearly consequential congress could opt to consider the lessons of this disaster in terms not onl of program adjustme nts and corrections but also the appropriate govern mental role throughout the recovery process for any possible future events of this magnitudehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34087crs38 132 for more information see crs report rs22358 the

targeted population132 further cooperation and inform ation sharing between fema and hud and other federal agencies might contri bute to applicants being aware of all housing options and also lessen each programs susceptibility to fraud there have been frequent references to hud section 8 housing vouchers as solution for the katrina evacuees the res ponse to the northridge earthquake in 2004 is usually listed as prime example of the efficiency of this approach133 fema provided over 140 million in immediate housing help in the form of funds for applicants to rent alternative living spaces three months to homeowners and two months to renters to more than 47000 households134 one consideration is whether such vouchers should be limited as disast er housing assistance is generally 18 months or if they should continue to be renewed in the manne r of regular section 8 vouchers for the katrina disaster unlike some ot her disasters huds help was focused on assisting its own population of clients that had been disp laced by the disaster as noted earlier the disaster voucher pr ogram is the successor to kdhap though unlike kdhap it also provides help to hurri cane rita victims

autumn of 1989 fema administered larg temporary housing program fema asked for proof of residency before pr oviding assistance and required that an applicant live at least 30 days at one address to be eligible for assistance due to the unique nature of the bay areas low income population many of the applicants had lived in single residency occupancy sros apartments that were similar to ymcas due to the force of the eart hquake approximately 2200 of these rooms had been lost oftentimes the applicants had stayed in these rooms for fewer than 30 consecutive days for this reason fema judg ed them to be ineligible for temporary housing assistance the legal aid society of alameda count sued fema over its interpretation of eligibility and preva iled in court the plaintiffs realized that temporary housing as defined under section 408 would not help the applicants because they longer had sro rooms available to them they also realized that the private property owners of the buildings might not be interested in remaining in the sro business instead the settlement was for fina ncial resources to help restore that part of the housing stock the eventual settlement was for 23 million to fund 2200 sro units the settlement sum was arrived at by multiplying the number of sro units lost by unit cost of about 10500 the flexibility of the final settlement was ideal from the point of view of the local agencies because the funds were provided in block grant fashion to the counties and as such allowed them the freedom to decide how to put the money to best use with very few restrictions overall 1200 to 1500 units were actually rebuilt using lawsuit funds140 since fema funds could not be provide d to private developers the local governments arranged for the sale of the buildings to nonprofit groups sometimes using community development block gr ant funds to complete the projects141 hurricane andrew in the aftermath of hurricane andrew in 1992 fema had very large temporary housing progra m in south florida here too many people in the area when the hurricane struck were judged not to be eligible for fema temporary housing assistance because they could not prove previous residency through
