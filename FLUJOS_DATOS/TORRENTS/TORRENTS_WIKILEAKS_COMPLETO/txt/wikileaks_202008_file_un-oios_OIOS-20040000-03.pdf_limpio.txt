allegation of improprieties in the procurement and installation of radar system at pristina airp ort case 21704 i introduction 1 when conducting investigations into alleged wrongdo ings at the public enterprise airport pristina peap pursuant to unmik executiv decision 200316 the investigation task force itf received an allegati on of improprieties during the procurement process and installation of new radar system at the airport the allegations contended that peap management in part icular the official of pristina airport had unduly delayed the radar installation process and agreed to cover the costs for the extension of the interim solution for the r adar system thus incurring additional costs of 570500 ii background information 2 as consequence of the implementation of security council resolution 1244 1999 unmik took over the administration of prist ina airport effective 1 july 2002 the authority over civil aviation was passed from p illar ii to pillar iv at this point in time nato had already advised unmik that by the end of july 2002 nato would withdraw the italian contingent that was running th airport as kosovo is landlocked and transportation through serbia is currently impe ded it was obvious from unmiks point of view that the airport had to be kept opera tional it was also clear that the international civil aviation organization icao wo uld only approve operations at pristina airport if basic requirements of safety an d control were met 3 therefore at nato meeting in berlin in late 2002 it was agreed that iceland should be the lead nation for operations at peap the inte rim period of nato member states running pristina airport was fixed for 18 months til 1 april 2004 accordingly srsgunmik and kfor signed an agreement covering kf or operations at the airport including fire brigade security safety an d radar system provided by the italian air force iaf 4 in 2003 the civil aviation regulatory office caro was created by unmik regulation 200318 in close cooperation with th technical cooperation bureau tcb within icao caro was tasked to cover inter alia specific projects where unmikkta intended to benefit from the knowledge an d experience of icao the radar procurement was one of these projects 5 as nato had agreed to run the operations at peap on ly until 1 april 2004 unmik caro was compelled to look for an operational and t echnical replacement after 1 april 2 2004 one area concerned was the radar as it was fo reseeable that the italians would withdraw their personnel and equipment as of 1 apri l 2004 consequently unmik concluded contract with icao on 4 april 2003 wher eby icao undertook the procurement services for the purchase of surveillan ce radar equipment on behalf of unmik icao was to be reimbursed with an amount equ to 4 of the contract sum 6 as of 1 april 2004 the airport was transferred fro m military to civil administration since caro the responsible body within unmik was unable to monitor the air space of kosovo in the way sovereign states monitor their air space unmik and iceland agreed that from 1 april 2004 onwards the icelandi c civil aviation administration icaa would take over the functions of sovereign state regarding kosovo airspace and caro would certify icaa decisions on behalf of unmik subsequently icaa officials including official 2 and official 1 and former official of pillar iv assumed advisory

7 itf investigators collected and analyzed all releva nt documents from peap and kta and interviewed all relevant persons involved in th radar procurement pursuant to executive decision 200316 v investigative details 8 icao conducted tendering exercise for the radar s ystem on 25 june 2003 and subsequently held technical meeting with potentia l bidders at pristina airport on 28 and 29 july 2003 three companies submitted bids n amely vendor 1 vendor 2 and vendor 3 icaa official 1 advised the itf on 17 ma 2005 that approximately 12 18 months is required to install and adjust new radar system as demanded by unmik icao requested all bidders to detail the cos ts and availability of an interim solution until the new radar system is installed v endor 3 offered an interim solution for period of 38 weeks starting with the entry into f orce of the contract at price of 180000 while vendor 1 proposed leasing mobile system for one 1 year at cost of 950000 vendor 2 did not provide any solutio n for an interim system due to concentration on supplying and achieving operationa l status of the new system by 1 april 2004 9 consequently vendor 3 was awarded the contract and on 29 october 2003 icao on behalf of unmik and vendor 3 concluded contract s tipulating an interim period of 38 weeks starting with the entry into force of the contract on 11 december 2003 attachment ii of the contract determined that vendo r 3 was to be paid 180000 for the interim solution 4 10 itf investigators established from paragraphs 417 and 911 of the contract 30618 for the provision of psr and mssr for unmik pristina airport concluded by icao on behalf of unmik and vendor 3 that the c ontractor shall guarantee full operational and technical performance of an interim radar system at least at the same level as the one existing at pristina airport duri ng the whole implementation time of this contract so that the pristina airport will not suffer lack of atc services until the successful installation of the new radar system in this connection unmikicao shall submit an application to the italian air force head quarters for an extension of the period of availability of the existing radar during the implementation time of the contract 11 paragraph 911 determines that the contract impl ementation shall not exceed thirty eight 38 weeks from the date of coming into force of this contract as the contract came into force on 11 december 2003 the interim sol ution was scheduled to end on 2 september 2004 attachment ii of the contract state s that the cost for the contract implementation will be 180000 or approximately 20000 per month 12 itf investigators obtained the original technical s pecifications of the tender which specified in paragraph 81 the tenderer shall det ermine the best location for the radar and shelter within the pristina airport terminal ar ea in order to satisfy the technical and operational requirements requested in these spe cifications 13 all parties involved including peap official 2 ic aa official 2 icaa official 1 vendor 3 representative as well as fax corresponde nce from the official of the technical cooperation bureau icao addressed to re levant unmik departments dated 11 february 2004 confirmed that as early as januaryfebruary 2004 deliberations had started to relocate the radar sit from the pristina terminal area to the nearby golesh mountain granting much wider vis ibility and coverage of western kosovo territory icaa official 2 stated that the c overage of western kosovo was essential under safety considerations in 1999 an unhcr plane had crashed into the mountains surrounding pristina as radar coverage at that time was insufficient icaa official 2 stressed the need for air safety as per the icao requirements 14 when asked why they had not introduced these delibe rations of better safety and wider coverage at an earlier stage the peap official 2 as well as icaa official 1 and official 2 stated that icao drew up the specificati ons and they were not involved in this process itf did not find any countervailing vidence as icaa official 2 became involved in the process only in january 2004 and bo th peap official 2 and icaa official 1 are not radar experts it was precisely for this reason that icao the experts in the field of air safety were contracted by unm ik to draw up the specifications and conduct of the radar procurement 15 when icao was asked by icaa and peap whether it was possible to amend the specifications in light of icaa official 2s recomm endations icao responded that it was possible however icao made it clear from the beginning and throughout the 5 entire installation process fax from 11 february 2 004 to unmik representatives that the relocation of the radar site would delay the in stallation of the radar and consequently lead to additional costs as the inter im solution would most likely have to be extended 16 peap official 2 who was responsible for the radar project on behalf of peap management as well as icaa official 1 and official 2 confirmed that they were aware of potential additional costs however icaa official 1 and official 2 emphasized that for safety reasons this was the pr eferable solution moreover icaa official 2 questioned whether the interim period of 38 weeks originally negotiated by icao was sufficiently protecting the needs of unmik as in his view the installation of new radar system takes from twelve to eighteen months normally 17 as consequence of the envisaged change of the loc ation site in march 2004 peapicaa mandated three companies vendor 3 vendo r 4 and vendor 5 to conduct feasibility studies regarding the radar site at gol esh mountain declared that the relocation would be possible but would cause additi onal costs of approx 25 million vendor 5 and vendor 4 listed the advantages and inc onvenience of each solution the principal advantage of the site at golesh mountain was the wider visibility but the main disadvantage was the fact that this site was n ot easily accessible in winter and would not cover the immediate approach of airplanes to pristina airport below 500 feet 18 at this point the civil works for the radar instal lation at the terminal site had come to halt due to the uncertainty of the radar location vendor 3 representative stated that correspondence had been sent from icao to vendor 3 requesting vendor 3 not to proceed with any civil works for the radar installa tion at pristina airport until further notice was received from icao this information is confirmed in an email from an icao staff member dated 23 march 2004 addressed to unmik and airport representatives 19 icaa official 1 told itf investigators that icao wa s exerting considerable pressure on icaa and peap management to abstain from the gol esh mountain radar site location heshe stated that icao was trying to avo id conflicts with serbia as the golesh location would allow scrutiny of serbian ter ritory given the political situation in kosovoserbia this would have created additiona l tension which icao attempted to avoid 20 on 24 june 2004 the then unmik pillar iv senior of ficial sent letter to an official of the technical cooperation bureau icao confir ming that the radar should be located at the airport site as originally suggeste d by the supplier vendor 3 on 6 july 2004 peap official 2 sent an email on behalf of icaa and airport management to icao icaa vendor 3 unmik caro about the final decision of the location of the new radar referring to the email it was agree d that the radar site location should 6 be at the terminal site as icao had requested an pproach radar covering the immediate approach of aircraft to pristina airport it was also agreed that the airport should procure secondary radar with narrower cov erage and position it at golesh mountain such action addressed the icaas safety c oncern that better coverage for the western sector of pristina airport was required 21 icaa official 2 told itf investigators that this condary radar was easily installed and that it was also able to provide the entire airport with sufficient radar coverage for limited interim period thereby easing the pressur on the airport regarding the extension of the interim solution however during the procurement for the secondary radar peap management discovered that the three co mpanies that submitted bids were in fact all subsidiaries of one and the same compan therefore this tender had to be reissued in august 2004 thus adding to the delay of the radar solution 22 itf investigators were able to establish from the p arties concerned except vendor 3 that failed factory acceptance test fat by vend or 3 in may 2004 added to the delay however according to all persons involved i n this process vendor 3 was able to conduct successful fat in july 2004 the indic ations as to how much of the delay was attributable to vendor 3 vary from time at ll to two months at the most moreover it has to be taken into account that the delay of the fat occurred during the exact time period when civil works for the radar at pristina airport had been put on hold anyway due to the uncertainty as to the radar location 23 peap steering committee meeting minutes of 23 septe mber 2004 and email correspondence from icao dated 15 september 2004 sh ow that airport management was trying to find solution for the delay of the installation of the radar system caused by the feasibility studies on the radar location an d the failed fat test icaa offical 1 and icaa official 2 stated that peap official 2 w hen launching the tender for the secondary radar was still confident timely solu tion would be found thus avoiding an extension of the italian kfor radar beyond septembe r 2004 24 however since the expiration date of the interim s olution was fast approaching and the secondary radar was not ready due to the delayed pr ocurement process peap icaa and vendor 3 agreed to extend the interim solution deadline vendor 3 then demanded monthly rental fee of 101500 instead of the ori ginal 20000 per month vendor 3 provided breakdown of its costs and referred to t he fact that since 1 april 2004 when the italian air force had left pristina airpor t vendor 3 had to provide for personnel and maintenance of the radar 25 itf investigators found that the monthly rental rat for the radar of 20000 was an unusually reasonable rate mainly due to the fact th at vendor 3 had benefited from its links to the italian air force to be able to offer cheap interim solution in order to bolster its bid in fact vendor 1 the only compet itor who offered an interim solution as well gave the price of their interim solution t 950000 for oneyearperiod furthermore itf investigators obtained corresponde nce from icao to peap 7 management dated 24 september 2004 stating that 95000 was fair market price for an interim radar 26 peap management and icaa then tried to lower the mo nthly rate quoting draft memo from representative of vendor 5 vendor 5 dat ed 15 september 2004 and referring to the lower rate of 20000 however ve ndor 3 continued to refer to the reasons for the costs incurred since the departure of the italian kfor operating the radar and the unusually low price the parties then agreed on monthly rate of 81500 scheduled to be paid for seven months from 15 october 2004 until 15 may 2005 for total of 570500 the first two weeks f october 2004 were to be provided free of charge by vendor 3 15 may 2005 was set as the final implementation date 27 all parties interviewed by itf investigators stated that this agreement was at least to large extent based on the fact that peapicaa xclusively relied on the interim radar to continue services at the airport peap of ficial 2 relied exclusively on the interim solution and only took measures to ensure n alternative option for the radar system in august 2004 when the interim solution was due to expire on 12 september 2004 moreover peap official 2 in conjunction wi th icaa official 1 and icaa official 2 pushed for an alternative radar locatio n thereby aggravating the time constraints regarding the interim solution 28 all relevant parties interviewed by itf investigato rs stated that until february 2005 payments were made by peap peap official 3 did not see any justification for the payment because from hisher point of view the extension of the rental of the interim system is considered to be an amendment to the original contract and should be signed the same way b the price level agreed upon for the extension of the rental is outrageous compared to the price for the period of thirtyeight 38 weeks c as of 11 february 2005 she had not seen the new contract vendor 3 then threatened peap that unless payments were made they would turn off the radar under pressure from vendor 3 on 10 february 2005 an agreement was sig ned that stated the delay is accepted due to the fact of delayed decision on rad ar site location and severe weather conditions at pristina airport 29 icaa official 1 and icaa official 2 stated that eve n though vendor 3 might have been responsible for up to two months of the delay icaa as well as peap were compelled to sign this agreement this resulted fro m the fact that vendor 3 threatened to turn the radar off and would not accept any weak er wording in the agreement given the fact that money had been transferred to vend or 3 for the interim solution vendor 3 representative told itf investigators that the wording severe weather conditions was meant to express the hardship of bu ilding the civil works for the radar at pristina airport in winter times rather than in spring or summer 30 consequently peap official 1 in his capacity as signatory authorised the payments on 11 february 2005 for the following invo ices 40002 period 1 october 31 october 2004 40003 period 1 november 3 0 november 2004 40005 8 period 1 december 31 december 2004 and 50002 period 1 january 31 january 2005 in the sum of 326000 the remaining invoices for the months of february march april and may 2005 are still outst anding vi findings 31 the itf found that the delay incurred by the search for new radar location can be explained by safety concerns as specified by offici 1 and official 2 of icaa 32 the itf found that the price negotiated by peap off icial 2 icaa official 1 and icaa official 2 for the extension of the interim so lution was reasonable market price as stated by icao 33 the itf found that peap official 2 did not approach vendor 3 in timely manner to ask for an extension of the interim solution of the radar nor did heshe attempt to find an alternative solution for the vendor 3 radar when heshe saw that the procurement of the secondary radar would be delayed vii conclusions 34 the itf concludes that peap official 2 did not viol ate any pertinent rules or regulations as to hisher failure to improve peaps negotiation position nor does hisher failure to act amount to irresponsible eco nomic activity or entering into harmful contract under pcck 35 the itf concludes that peap official 2s failure to exhaust all possible means to find an alternative option for the interim solution of t he radar constitutes repeated mistake under section 114 of unmik regulation 200127 in the context of the findings and conclusions of previous investigations conducted by the itf most notably in case 35204 issued to the srsgunmik on 05 january 2005 viii recommendations 36 as result of this investigation itf recommends t he following recommendation 1 the itf recommends that unmik pillar iv take into ccount the above findings and conclusions when taking appropriate action against peap official 2 according to itf report 35204 submitted to the srsg on 05 january 2 005 and any other report submitted by the itf iv0421701 9 recommendation 2 the itf recommends that unmik pillar iv advise all senior poe managers that during the establishment of the terms of contracts the need for the inclusion of specific terms to enable contract extensions be given carefu l consideration particularly in the case of interim solution contracts for equipment pu rchases andor replacement iv0421702
