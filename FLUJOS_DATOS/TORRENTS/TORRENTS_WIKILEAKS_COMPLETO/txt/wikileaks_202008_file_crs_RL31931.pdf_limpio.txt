proposed responses generally require action at the national level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industri alized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases over the past 16 years variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of electric utility carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources this report provides background on the evolution of us climate change policy from ratification of the unfccc to the george w bush administrations 2001 rejection of the kyoto protocol to the present recent federal court decisionsmost notably the supreme courts 2007 decision in massachusetts v ep that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air acthave raised the issue of whether epa should directly regulate greenhouse gases this report focuses on major regulatory programs that monitor or re duce greenhouse gas emissions along with their estimated effect on emissions levels the george h w bush clinton and george w bush administrations largely relied on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions this focus was particularly evident in the current administrations 2006 climate action report car submitted under the provisions of the unfccc of roughly 50 programs summarized in the 2006 car seven were described as regulatory however this small subset of the total us effort accounts for large share of greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved over the past decadeandahalf in general these efforts were established and implemented in response to concerns other than climate change such as energy efficiency and air quality the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 included provisions indirectly related to greenhouse gas emissions such as energy efficiency and renewable energy the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 addresses renewable energy and conservation but also includes provisions specifically on climate change these include requirement for the use of renewable fuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuels and the establishment of an office of climate chan ge and environment in the department of transportation to implement research on mitigating the causes and addressing the effects of climate change on transportation in june 2008 the senate considered bill s 3036 to establish an economywide capandtrade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however after discussion cloture motion on this bill failed and the bill was tabled while some provisions in energy laws enacted over the past 16 years have led to lower greenhouse gas emissions or addressed climate change directly other provisions in those same laws have almost certainly resulted in higher emissions to date energy law has had reducing greenhouse gas emissions as the main organizing principle energyrelated activities are responsible for about 86 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions and 98 of its carbon dioxide emissions climate change policy directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions must address energy supply and consumption and thus be integrated with energy policy this will be pivotal challenge to the 111 th congresss and the incoming administrations anticipated efforts to enact legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions

called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases over the past 16 years variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol to the unfccc which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 1 he also rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions since then the bush administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions this focus was particularly evident in the administrations 2006 climate action report car submitted under the provisions of the unfccc of the roughly 50 programs summarized in the 2006 car only seven were described as regulatory 2 these regulatory programs were generally implemented to achieve energy or environmental goals other than the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but produced concomitant emissions reduction in this sense they could be considered the results of regrets 3 policy in which climate change effects resulting from related air quality and energy policies are included in the decisionmaking process on new or modified rules however indirect regulation and regrets policies may be supplanted by direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in its 2007 decision in massachusetts v ep the supreme court found that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the clean air act 4 further the court directed epa to begin the process of determining whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare if epa finds that they do then epa would be required under the clean air act to regulate their emission however it is also possible that epa would find that greenhouse gases do not endanger public health and welfare or that there is insufficient evidence to make finding either way further in june 2008 the senate considered legislation s 3036 to enact an economywide cap andtrade system to reduce us greenhouse gas emissions5 however cloture motion on this bill failed and the bill was ultimately tabled capandtrade system is the favored approach of 1 for further information see crs report rl33826 climate change the kyoto protocol bali action plan and international actions by susan r fletcher and larry parker 2 most of the programs outlined in the report involve research technical assistance information gathering or technical assistance programs initiated by the federal government or voluntary emissions reduction programs coordinated by the government 3 the regrets policy was one of establishing programs for other purposes that would have concomitant greenhouse gas reductions therefore only those policies that reduced greenhouse gas emissions at additional cost were considered 4 for more information see crs report rs22665 the supreme courts climate change decision massachusetts v epa by

orientation in 1992 with completion of the unfccc in rio janeiro both nationally and internationally much of the debate over policies to address climate change has focused on energy use because fossil fuel consumption is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in most countries during the deliberations on the unfccc the national academy of sciences nas released report on global warming in this report policy implications of greenhouse warming the nas stated the united states could reduce or offset its greenhouse gas emissions by between 10 and 40 percent of 1990 levels at low cost or at some net savings if proper policies are implemented 6 the nass energy policy recommendations focused on increasing energy conservation and efficiency incorporating global warming as factor in future energy planning and studying and eventually implementing full social cost pricing of energy although the report was widely publicized many of its recommendations were not applied driven by concerns about scientific uncertainty and the potential costs to the economy of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the george h w bush administration refused to agree to the negotiation of binding agreement to reduce the nations carbon dioxide co 2 emissions by specific date the unfccc reflects the negotiating position of the united states and many other countries in that it called only for voluntary control measures senate floor debate on ratification of the unfccc brought out concerns by some senators about the cost of compliance its impact on the countrys economic competitiveness and the comprehensiveness with respect to the omission of reduction commitments for developing countriesconcerns that were lessened because of the nonbinding nature of the reduction goals 7 those arguing for emissions controls argued that controls could create jobs and enhance economic health and that high emissions indicated inefficiency asserting that the developed country parties should take the lead in reducing emissions the unfccc set the goal that developed countries aim to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 6 national academy of sciences policy implications of greenhouse warming

countries agreed in principle to adopt national plans and policy options to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic emissions and enhancing sinks the united states submitted such plans in 1992 1994 1997 2002 and 2006 as discussed below9

energy policy act of 1992 epact is the principal statutory basis for programs that constitute the us response to the unfccc 10 programs developed pursuant to epact including appliance energy efficiency standards and updated building codes are discussed below primarily crafted as part of an energy policy response to the persian gulf war of 1991 its energy conservation renewable energy and other titles were also seen as having beneficial effect on global climate change concerns being debated at that time in international circles in its 1992 submission to the unfccc the george h w bush administration listed 11 different titles of epact as extremely important to its overall strategy of reducing greenhouse gases 11 some of the previously referenced recommendations of the nas were embodied in several sections of epact these sections included provisions to establish energyefficiency standards promote dissemination of energysaving information establish several national research and development programs related to deployment of energyefficiency technologies and authorize the department of energy doe to evaluate costeffective energy efficiency technologies in addition to these activities to improve energy efficiency epact title xvi aimed to incorporate global warming concerns in energy policy planning title xvi authorized doe to collect analyze and report information on climate change resulting doe activities included report on the various economic energy social environmental and competitive implications of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the development of leastcost energy strategy designed to achieve the stabilization and eventual reduction in the generation of greenhouse gases the creation of director of climate change and the developmen t of an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and early reductions in such emissions indeed epacts authors anticipated that it would help stabilize or even reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at little cost in line with the 1991 nas report as stated by the house report the committee expects that if fully implemented hr 776 will result in substantial reduction in us greenhouse gas emissions relative to forecasted levels the bulk of these reductions result from the programs that will demonstrate and transfer advanced clean coal and renewable technologies abroad and from the domestic energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives the provisions on electric utilities alternative fuels and coalbed methane are also significant 12 8 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc

reduction goals at little or cost underlies many of the global climate change initiatives during the previous bush and clinton administrations including the george h w bush administrations regrets policy and 1992 climate action plan and the clinton administrations 1994 and 1997 climate action plans13 using such an approach to climate change policy neither of these administrations requested regulatory authority from congress to implement climate change policy both advocated strategies of undertaking governmental implementing actions that could be done administratively unless congress legislated otherwise and of creating incentives for private industry to voluntarily undertake emissions reduction initiatives the clinton action plans were similar to the plan developed under the george h w bush administration both were designed to foster market choices that would conserve energy increase energy efficiency and encourage natural gas use both were also designed to strengthen selected regulatory standards that concomitantly reduced greenhouse gas emissionssuch as landfill regulations that curtail methane releases several actions in the 1994 clinton plan expanded programs listed in the george h w bush administrations plan by augmenting funding or technical support to increase anticipated reductions other clinton proposals were new examples included golden carrot pr ogram to induce efficiency improvements of industrial equipment renewable energy consortium program to encourage employers to replace parking subsidies with cash incentives to ride transit car pool or find other ways to commute and program to promote more efficient nitrogen fertilizer use 14

goals would not be met parties to the unfccc began negotiations that culminated in the 1997 kyoto protocol to the unfccc this protocol outlined legally binding emissions reductions for developed countries to specified amounts below 1990 levels averaged over the years 2008 to 2012 the clinton administration committed to 7 reduction below 1990 levels the kyoto protocol if it had been submitted to the senate and ratified would have changed the us commitment from voluntary one to binding commitment critics of the kyoto protocol raised concerns similar to those debated in connection with the unfccc in 1992 concerns about cost comprehensiveness and competitiveness the possibility of failing to comply with binding commitment intensified the focus on potential costs of the us global climate change policy the united states along with most of the world failed to meet the goal set at rio of returning 2000 emissions to the level that existed in 1990 fact that raises questions about the premise that significant greenhouse gas reductions can be achieved at little or costs 15 for those who believe substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would entail substantial costs the

exclusion of developing countries from mandatory emission reductions comprehensiveness that cost competitiveness and comprehensiven ess remain pivotal factors in climate change policy is illustrated by the george w bush administrations rejection of the kyoto protocol early in 2001 in his june 11 2001 speech on global climate change the president stated that the kyoto protocol was fatally flawed in fundam ental ways primary flaw outlined by the president is the exemption of china and other large developing countries from its emissions reduction provisions this comprehensiveness concern was closely followed by cost and competitiveness concerns president bush stated kyoto is in many ways unrealistic many countries cannot meet their kyoto targets the targets themselves are arbitrary and not based upon science for america complying with those mandates would have negative economic impact with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers and when you evaluate all these flaws most reasonable people will understand that its not sound public policy 16 to respond to global climate change president bush called for new approach focused on science and on flexible control mechanisms that employ marketbased incentives among the principles that the president argued should guide such program were the following we must always act to ensure continued economic growth and prosperity for our citizens and for citizens throughout the world and finally our approach must be based on global participation including that of developing countries whose net greenhouse gas emissions now exceed those in the developed countries 17 the administrations 2001 proposal initiated new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program similar to ones introduced in previous administrations the plan focuses on improving the carbon intensity of the economy reducing current emissions of 183 metric tons of carbon equivalent per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp by 2012 the plan proposed several voluntary initiatives along with increased spending and tax incentives to achieve this goal however the administration stated that threequarters of the projected reduction would be achieved through current efforts underway not by new initiatives the administration projected that by 2010 the program could result in an emissions reduction of approximately 45 relative to business as usual however this level would still be approximately 28 higher than the 1990 level defined by the unfccc further without explicit requirements it is unclear whether the targets set by the administration will be met key piece of the administrations proposal was announced on february 12 2003 18 climate v oluntary innovative sector initiatives

plans to reduce greenhouse gas intensity and to publicly recognize the efforts of those sectors another administration initiative the asiapacific partnership on clean development and climate focuses on international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions outside of the kyoto protocol of the six countries the united states and australia have rejected kyoto three countrieschina india and koreaare not subject to binding limits under kyoto only one member of the partnership japan has ratified the kyoto protocol the partnership is focused on development and trade of clean energy technologies as well as emissions reductions from key sectors 20 this international initiative was followed in may 2007 by the presidents announcement that the united states would convene meeting of the worlds major economies that are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions held in september 2007 the final statements of the major economies meeting on energy security and climate change emphasized the need to integrate such meetings into the overall unfccc negotiations the us summary of the meeting focused on the aspirational nature of reduction goals reflecting the administrations

each of the climate action reports submitted by the united states to the unfccc has included compilation of the several dozen programs that various administrations have felt are relevant to reducing us greenhouse gas emissions 21 regulatory measures that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions are small subset of the total us effort numerically but are responsible for proportionally larger share of greenhouse gas emission reductions22 in general these regulatory programs were established and implemented primarily for reasons other than climate change concerns it should be noted that reductions from these programs combined represent about 3 of year 2000 greenhouse gas emissions and total us emissions have continued to grow emissions increased approximately 3 between 2000 and 2005 emissions have grown approximately 17 since 1990 23 the list of federal regulatory programs discussed here is primarily drawn from activities listed by the george w bush administration in its most recent 2006

many ozonedepleting substances are also greenhouse gases such as perfluorocarbons therefore efforts to protect the ozone layer also tend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions there is complex scientific relationship between ozone depletion ozonedepleting chemicals and climate change title vi of the 1990 clean air act amendments re presents the united states primary response on the domestic front to the ozone depletion issue it also implements this countrys international responsibilities under the montreal protocol to reduce ozonedepleting substances 29 section 612 requires epa to develop program to identify alternatives to ozone depleting substances banned under the montreal protocol in determining the acceptability of an alternative epa is to assess the overall risk to human health or the environment that the alternative poses compared with other alternatives in promulgating the implementing regulation for the program in 1994 epa identified increased global warming as one of the risk criteria that it would use in determining the acceptability of an alternative 30 snap determinations focus on the global warming potential of various substitutes used in place of the ozonedepleting chemicals banned under the montreal protocol not on the global warming potential of the banned ozonedepleting chemicals themselves under the regulation epa has restricted or na rrowed the use of hydrofluorocarbons hfcs and perfluorocarbons pfcs where alternatives with lower global warming potentials exist epa estimates that the restrictions reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 26 million

changeas specific issue needing regulatory responsewas debated during deliberations on the energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 and recognized in passage of senate amendment 866 expressing the sense of the senate that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions the energy independence and security act eisa of 2007 directly addresses some climate change issues but still generally focuses on energy supply and consumption the overall effect of epact 2005 and eisa on future greenhouse gas emissions is unclear and specific action on the issue will depend on efforts to enact the national program called for in senate amendment 866 an attempt to pass an economy wide greenhouse gas capandtrade program in the senate was unsuccessful in the 110 th congress while some provisions in energy laws enacted over the past 16 years have led to lower greenhouse gas emissions or addressed climate change directly other provisions in those same laws have almost certainly resulted in higher emissions65 to date energy law has had reducing greenhouse
