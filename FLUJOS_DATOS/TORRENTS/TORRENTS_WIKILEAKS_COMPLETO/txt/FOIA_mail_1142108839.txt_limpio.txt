date sat 11 mar 2006 152719 0500 est cc mmanningalnoaagov ssolomonalnoaagov friends in the ipcc wg1 ar4 my impression is that for good reasons the us nrc panel looking at the record of temperatures over the last millennium or two is not going to strongly endorse the ability of proxies to detect warming above the level of millennium ago and that careful reexamination of the chapter 6 wording and its representation in the ts and spm would be wise some of you have seen some of the discussion that follows in some of the rapidfire emails over the last day or two but id like to clarify little please note that i am not on the nrc committee do not speak for them and have inside knowledge of what they are doing i was asked to testify to them and i heard remarks from some other speakers and questions from the committee in public forum i did not represent the ipcc to the committee either i stated that although i was proud to be participating with the ipcc i absolutely was not speaking for representing or presaging anything in the ipcc i was however favorably quite impressed with the nrc committee and their efforts someone else may have different impression of what went on this is mine among the presentations involving borehole temperatures corals glaciers and ice cores and historical records that which to seemed to interest the committee most was from rosanne darrigo who reported among many other things on justpublished study in which northern treering sites were revisited and updated and in which many of those sites failed to track the recent warming documented instrumentally she did not make big deal out of this but several of the questions afterward from the committee focused on this divergence problem and to note rosanne did not discover the divergence problem which has been around and discussed for while her testimony including the recent large effort to update some treering records stirred interest from some committee members i would also note that one of the committee members was asking each presenter whether the presenter believed that temperatures could be reconstructed for 1000 years ago within 05 c and that the presenters were answering with some qualified version of my guess is that the nrc committee will put these things together find some papers on ozone damage and co2 fertilization consider rosannes statement that the preferred temperaturesensitive trees are rare and in restricted places and thus that prolonged warming could easily move those trees out of the sensitive band and conclude that treering reconstructions include larger errors than are returned by any of the formal statistics from calibration or aggregation of records and thus that there is less confidence than previously believed in the relative warmth of recent versus medieval times i also consider it possible that they will point out the difficulty of using composite temperature history consisting of proxy and instrumental data if some of the proxy data do not track the morerecent part of the instrumental data the ipcc must be the ipcc not the nrc but if the ipcc and nrc look very different there will be much comment and we will have to be very sure more importantly i believe that real issues are raised here and that better discussion of this should be included in chapter 6 and probably brought forward at least into the ts i know im not in chapter 6 i know im not treering expert and i know im sticking my nose in where it might not belong or be welcome but the flurry of emails in the last couple of days has not convinced that this one can be ignored indeed i am more convinced that there exist issues that the ipcc must discuss more thoroughly my impression of the status and my thoughts about what chapter 6 might say from whole lot of quick reading your emails and the testimony and questions i heard is along the lines of the tar highlighted temperature history composited from multiproxy paleoclimatic indicators plus the instrumental record showing anomalous recent warmth with the recent warmth emerging well above the 95 confidence interval for the last millennium the multiproxy paleoclimatic indicators reflect treering results more than any other source treering records are responsive to many factors and great care and effort go into isolating the temperature signal from other signals treering data in common with essentially all paleoclimatic data are not collected in continually updated operational fashion analogous to that used for meteorological data so the data sets end at different times data used in the multiproxy reconstructions cited in the tar ended between the 1990s and the 1940s this difficulty motivated the need to include instrumental as well as proxy data in the reconstructions in those data there was some suggestion of nontemperature influences on the treering reconstructions in particular some of the mostrecent records did not record the full amplitude of the instrumental warming this has come to be known as the divergence issue much research has been conducted since the tar and additional evidence of divergence has emerged in some records causing some aggregated reconstructions from proxy records to show less warming than does the instrumental record there are many hypotheses for nontemperature influences on treering records including i recent damage as by ozone ii recent fertilization as by co2 and iii decreasing sensitivity of treering growth to temperature with increasing temperature once its warm enough the trees are primarily responsive to other things the nature of these and their timing relative to the interval in which treering data were calibrated to instrumental records would control the effects on climate reconstructions in general i would mean that recent warmth is underestimated but warmth from millennium ago is not ii would mean that recent warmth is overestimated but warmth from millennium ago is not and iii would mean that both recent warmth and warmth from millennium ago are underestimated various arguments have been advanced to support i ii or iii with many workers in the field favoring i nonetheless further characterizing recent nontemperature influences on treering growth remains an open research question and broad consensus has emerged on i ii iii or something else these considerations do not affect the conclusion that recent warmth is anomalous over the last few centuries the strong correlations of the proxy data with temperature over the instrumental record and the strong treering signals are evident these considerations do not affect the best estimate that recent warmth is greater than that of millennium ago the central estimate from proxy data of lattertwentiethcentury warmth is still above that of millennium ago with greater spatial conherence recently in the signal these considerations do somewhat affect the confidence that can be attached to the best estimate of recent warmth versus that of millennium ago if the paleoclimatic data could be confidently be interpreted as paleotemperatures then joining the paleoclimatic and instrumental records would be appropriate and the recent warmth would clearly be anomalous over the last millennium and beyond by demonstrating that some treering series chosen for temperature sensitivity are not fully reflecting temperature changes the divergence issue widens the error bars and so reduces confidence in the comparison between recent and earlier warmth richard richard b alley evan pugh professor department of geosciences and earth
