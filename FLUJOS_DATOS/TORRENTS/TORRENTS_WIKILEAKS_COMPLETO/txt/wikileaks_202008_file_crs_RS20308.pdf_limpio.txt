were single amendment appeal the ruling of the chair any member may appeal ruling of the chair simply by sayingi appeal the ruling of the chair however decisions 1 ruling actions out of order as dilatory 2 involving recognition of members and 3 concerning the appropriate timeliness of actions are not subject to appeal appeals from decisions on the priority of business and the germaneness of debate are not debatable all other appeals are debatable under the fiveminute rule to counter challenge to the chairs ruling another member can move to table kill the appeal the motion to table is not debatable if the ruling of the chair is appealed the following steps would be taken member supporting the chair would immediately move to table the appeal the chair calls the vote on the motion to table if motion to table is made the chair would call the question on the appeal shall the ruling of the chair stand as the ruling of the committee conference authorization to go to to avoid possible objection on the floor to unanimous consent requests to go to conference committee can at the time bill is initially reported authorize the chair to make motion at the appropriate time to send the

amendments as they want if not dilatory debate on an amendment or section of the bill can be ended by moving to close debate or by unanimous consent the am endment under consideration must still be

or the substantive effect of an amendment the chair does not respond to hypothetical questions responses to parliamentary inquiries are not rulings and thus are not subject to appeal members must have the floor to pose parliamentary inquiry if another member controls the time that member would have to yield to the member seeking to pose the inquiry the time it takes to discuss the inquiry is

the right to make or reserve point of order provided that it is made in timely manner points of order on an amendment must be made after it has been read but before debate on the amendment begins reserving point of order occurs at the same point but points of order can be reserved only at the discretion of the chair once point of order has been made debate on it is at the discretion of the

has been read for amendment or if the bill is open to amendment at any point one advantage of considering an amendment in the nature of substitute is that the previous question can be moved at any time ie as device to cut off amendments after initial debate on an amendment member may say mr chairman i move the previous question on the amendment and all amendments thereto the chair puts the question the motion is in order and is not debatable as many as are in favor if the motion is successful then the chair puts the question on the pending amendment s the previous question having been

consider this bill may be raised before debate has begun the motion is not debatable and may not be tabled if made in timely manner the chair puts the question without debate does the committee wish
