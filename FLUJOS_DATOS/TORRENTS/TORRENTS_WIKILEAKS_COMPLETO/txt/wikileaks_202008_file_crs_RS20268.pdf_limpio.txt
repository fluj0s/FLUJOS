to congre ss the appropriations subcommittees hold hearings on the individual agency budget requestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20268crs2 agency officials usually testify before the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the agencys budget request central element of this testimony is the detailed written budget ju stifications prepared by an agency and submitted to the applicable subcommittee the testimony and written justifications usually are published as part of the subcommittees hearings each year the hearings of the house appropriations subcommittees combined of ten exceed 100000 pages covering testimony of about 10000 witnesses which include nongovernmental as well as agency officials the written justifications typi cally vary in form and content with each agency and appropriations subcommittee reflecting the ongoing relationship between them an agencys budget justification generally consis ts of detailed descri ption of each program activity and its purpose agencies also incl ude an extensive explanation of the proposed changes in appropriations and program activities for the next fiscal year often concentrating on the increase or decrease in spending the primary purpose of the budget justifications is to provide an appropriations subcommittee with more detaile d information about an agencys program activities and their relationship with the ppropriations request than is contained in the presidents budget documents agency officials use th is detailed information to support their testimony at subcommittee hearings although the budget justification is not included in appropriations acts and thus does not have the force of law it serves as an agreement with the appropriations subcommittee as to the activities an agency plans to carry out during the next fiscal year subcommittee often modifies these plans by including language in the appropriations committees report accompan ying the appropriati ons bill for more information on appropriations committee report language see crs report 98558 appropriations bills what is report language an agency usually has to go through formal process if it wants to change the program activity plans contained in its budget justification material after the fiscal year begins for example if an agency wants to shift funds from one purpose to another within the same appropriati ons account referred to as reprogramming funds an agency often is required to notify the relevant appropriations subcommittee and in some cases must get advance approval to go forward with the reprogramming finally it is important to note that when agencies interact with congress they are required to support the presidents budget propos als to ensure agency compliance with this requirement section 22 of omb circul ar a11 sets out gene ral responsibilities of agency officials when dealing with congre ss on budgetary matters in particular all budgetrelated materials including the budget justifications must be submitted to omb for clearance prior to transmitta l to congress see section 223
