offenses include state murder robbery kidnaping arson extortion br ibery and drug trafficking felonies 18 usc 19611a they also include hos t of federal crimes ch as mail fraud wire fraud felonious drug dealing and any fel onious federal crime of terrorism 18 usc 19611b g numbered among the money laundering predicate offenses are all the rico predicate offenses other than felony violations of 31 usc ch 53ii relating to monetary reporting requirement s and substantial number of additional federal crimes such as theft of federal pr operty food stamp fraud and cy ber crime 18 usc 1956c7 d 18 usc 1957f3 money laundering in violati on of section 1956 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years 18 usc 1956a andor fine of not more than the greater of twice the amount involved in the

fall into one or more of three categories they amend the substantive or procedural features of the money laundering statutes they add crimes to the list of money launderi ng predicate offenses either directly or i ndirectly by adding them to the rico predicate list or the list of federal crimes of rrorism they recognize money undering offenses as predicate offenses for other federal crimes patriot act pl 109177 hr 3199 the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109 177 contains severa l money laundering amendments some add to the money laundering predicate offe nse list either directly or as consequence of being added to the rico predicate offense list or to the definition of federal crimes of terrorism and thus to the rico predicate offense list paragraph 112a1 of p l 109177 adds 18 usc 2339d receipt of military training from foreign terrorist organization to the inventory of federal criminal offenses in 18 usc 2332bg5b this alone would be sufficient to add it to the rico predicate offense list and thus to the mone laundering predicate offense list 18 usc 19611g 1956c7a subsection 4091 confirms the assign ment by expressly listing 18 usc 2339d as money laundering predicate in secti on 1956c7 the act reflects the view that launderi ng the proceeds of section 2339d violation is more serious than the underlying violation itself since section 2339d is 10 year felony 18 usc 2339da while money laundering is 20 year felony 18 usc 1956a the paragraph makes proceeds of the offense more forfeitable than they would otherwise be since without reference to

predicate offense list section 1960 makes it five year felony to engage in an unlicensed money transmission business or to fail to comply with federal regulations governing money transmission business or to transmit funds derived from or inte nded to support criminal activity subsection 403a make s it 20 year felony to launder the proceeds of section 1960 violation or to use series section 1960 vi olations in the operation of an enterprise with an effect on interstate or foreig n commerce 18 usc 1956a 19 63 without recourse to the status of section 1960 offens as money laundering predicates property involved in section 1960 violation is ready subject to confiscation 18 usc 981a1 982a1 subsection 4091 expressly adds viol ations of 18 usc 2339c financing terrorism and 2339d receipt of military trai ning from foreign terrorist organizations to the list of money laundering predicates in 18 usc 1956c7 in doing so it confirms standing they enjoy as federal crimes of terrorism any crime
