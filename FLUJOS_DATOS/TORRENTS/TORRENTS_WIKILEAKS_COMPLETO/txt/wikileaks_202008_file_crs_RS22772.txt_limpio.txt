u s senate to come into force usaustralia treaty on defense trade cooperation former prime minister of australia john howard and president george w bush signed the usaustralia treaty on defense trade cooperation in sydney on september 5 2007 immediately before the asiapacific economic cooperation apec summit proponents view the treaty as bringing what are already very close allies even closer together by facilitating defense trade between the two states and members of their respective defense industries however some are concerned that treaty approach is not the best way to deal with perceived problems with arms and defense technology export controls the treaty the treaty would ease restrictions associated with the international trade in arms regulations itar by creating comprehensive framework within which most defense trade can be carried out without prior government approval the trade must support combined usaustralian counterterror operations usaustralia research and development production and support programs and australia and us governmentonly crs2 enduses in order to be eligible1 exports of defense articles outside the community consisting of the two governments and approved companies of the two nations would require us and australian government approval supporters state that the treaty will help the two nations strengthen interoperability between their military forces help sustain them and use defense industries in direct support of the armed forces2 many of the details of how the treaty will operate have yet to be worked out according to press releases under the implementing arrangements that are contemplated by the treaty our industries will move from the licensing regime under the us international traffic in arms regulations to the more streamlined procedures that will be set forth in these implementing arrangements3 the australian perspective the treaty which was negotiated under the former liberal right of center government that took office in 1996 would provide australia with streamlined access to us defense trade this treaty would simplify us export controls on defense articles to australia that reportedly along with us defense industry has been frustrated with httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22772 existing restrictions4 australia and the us reportedly approved 2361 licenses and concluded 312 agreements in 2006 the treaty would also provide australia with operational benefits from greater access to us support improvements to military capability development due to earlier access to us data and technology cost and time savings from significant reductions in the number of licenses required for export of defense equipment and improved access for australian companies involved in bidding on us defense requirements or in supporting us equipment in the australian defence force adf inventory5 if passed the treaty will likely require the enactment of enabling legislation in australia and as result will need the support of the newly elected government of kevin rudd to come into force key legislation that may require amendment are the customs act of 1901 customs regulations 1958 and weapons of mass destructionprevention of proliferation act of 1995 rudds labor partys sweeping victory in the november 24 2007 election has given him strong mandate 1 treaty aimed at achieving similar cooperation

accusations in australia that it would in some way downgrade the australiaus alliance and stated labor will enhance our strategic relationship and seek to make an already special friendship even stronger and more effective6 the defense trade treaty is expected to be supported by the new prime minister due to the large bipartisan support for the australianew zealandunited states anzus alliance in australia while prime minister rudd views the united states and the anzus alliance as central to australias security he has indicated that australia would begin staged withdrawal of troops from iraq he has also stated that under his leadership australia would consider increasing the number of troops stationed in afghanistan7 prime minister rudd has stressed that the history of the alliance is bipartisan one that was instigated in world war ii by president roosevelt and australian labor party prime minster john curtin he has also stated that for labor the us alliance sits squarely in the centre of our strategic vision intelligence sharing access to advanced technologies systems and equipment together with combined military exercises and training enhances australias national security8 rudd has been described as believing that strong american presence in the region is crucial to regional stability and that us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22772 strategic engagement in asia is central to australias security9 the strategic and political context and us interests the treaty would further draw australia into very small circle of closely trusted allies that have stood with the united states not only in past conflicts but also in recent conflicts in afghanistan and iraq it would do this at time when the united states is increasingly unpopular in the world in may 2007 secretary of state condoleezza rice described the alliance as one that reflects the deep bond of enduring ideals and shared history colonial origins democratic development and shared political and cultural values ours is an alliance that remains strong10 during his september 2007 visit to australia pacific commander admiral timothy keating stated every war we fought for the last century the australians have been with us and we have been with them they are members of the coalition of the committed not just the coalition of the willing11 the treaty could improve the image of the united states in australia

significantly in recent years only 48 of australians polled thought that the united states would be very close economic partner of australia in five to ten years as opposed to 53 that thought china would be this is quite remarkable given that australia is longstanding treaty ally that has fought alongside the united states in most of americas wars and established free trade agreement fta with the united states in 200512 several factors have contributed to the decline in us popularity in australia these include bush administration policies the view that the united states is self proclaimed world watch dog the war in iraq and us foreign policies dissatisfaction with the bilateral fta and with the united states position on global warming also appear to be key factors in recent poll sixty seven percent of australians polled had an unfavorable opinion of president bush despite former prime minister john howards close relationship with the president some 48 of those polled in 2007 felt that it would be better for australias national interest to act more independently of the us13 despite these negative polling results some 92 of australians believe that the us will be very close or close security partner over the next decade14 and some 79 still httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22772 believe that the us alliance under anzus is very important 37 or fairly important 42 to australias security it is striking that despite the decreasing popularity of us foreign policy since 2001 some 74 of australians polled still trust that the united states would come to australias assistance were it to be threatened by some other country thus it appears that australians draw distinction between the current us government and its policies and the long term value of the anzus alliance15 issues for congress some have expressed concern that the treaty as proposed with australia could lead to reduced congressional oversight many of those concerned with the treaty are concerned not primarily because they believe australia would transfer military technologies to unfriendly states or entities but out of concern that the treaty could undermine existing congressional oversight as defined in itar the lack of supporting implementing arrangements to accompany the treaty document is also of concern to some in september 2007 the australian embassy reportedly stated that details of the 12 alan

the treaty would be worked out in the coming months16 the arrangements will define precisely how the treaty will operate in both australia and the united states and how its obligations will be implemented to the mutual satisfaction of both countries these arrangements include identifying the changes that might be needed to our legal and regulatory regimes and putting these changes into effect17 until such time as the implementing arrangements are made known it will be difficult to comprehend the full scope of the treaty by using treaty which must be ratified by the senate to redefine defense trade cooperation with australia the administration appears to some to be putting in place an arrangement that avoids the existing regulatory structure proponents argue that the benefits of streamlining defense cooperation with this close ally far outweigh separation of powers concerns as well as the potential that australia would be the source of technologies or weapons falling into unfriendly hands18 the potential that third party transfers could result in the reexport of us technology to potential enemies is reportedly addressed in the treaty by allowing the united states to vet httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22772 such transfers19 the treaty has been welcomed by representatives of the us defense industry as most of australias key weapons systems are americanmade by
