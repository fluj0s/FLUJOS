act would draw in some respect s they continue to provide laboratory in which prevailing wage policies are tested the pros and cons of such labor standards requirements are they still needed are they inflationary can they be fairly enforced etc continue to be debated both at the stat and federal levels the development of state prevailing wage acts observed university of wisconsin economist david

the davisbacon act instituti onal evolution and public policy by william g whittaker though early versions of the davisbacon legislation had been introduced in the late 1920s the 1931 measure wa s presented as an emergency antidepression bill and was strongly backed by the hoover administration 3 during the 1920s and 1930s i ndustry had become concerned bout unfair competition from firms it regarded as irresponsible and unable to make good on contract commitments some firms it was alleged would bid low and once aw arded federal contract would shop for sub contractors who in the depressed state of the general economy were willing to accept work and to provide workers at progressively lower ra tes see for example g f schlesinger responsibility as prerequisite the constructor aug 1928 pp

jersey 1913 and massac husetts 1914had adopted legisl ation dealing with this issue they tended to focus upon hours of work per diem wages and to larger degree than later enactments upon the fair treatment of workers for laws passed after 1931 however there appears to have been greater emphasis upon the stabilization of industry and of the community an outgrowth of the depression1 the architects of the davisbacon act 1931 pointed to internal industry problems to itinerant contractors from beyond the area of construction often dubbed flybynight firms such contractors it was charged carried with them crew of lowwage non resident labor that worked under adverse conditions and in that manner competed unfairly with local companies and retarded the economic recovery in targeted locality2 federal contracting policy of th at period required that public contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder with responsible narrowly defined3 after 1931 johnson concludes state prevailing wage laws had their origins in the depression and were designed to protect labor standards from co st cutting pressures ttendant upon competitive bidding they were far more than just laborprotective measures however4 state prevailing wage statut differ from each other and for the most part from the federal davisbacon act some of the early laws have been repealed or have been found unconstitutional some have been replaced in modified form coverage varies widely from broad generic concept of public works to narrow application to segment of public work for example to highways or to school facilities dollar volume thresholds for coverage also differ from statetostate some state acts apply to general contractors others to subcontractors as well not all craft and skill classifications are treated in precisely the same manner concepts locality or prevailing wage for example differ among the statutes as to their enforcement and recordkeeping requirements where state

normally prevails5 impacts of state prevailing wage laws as with the federal davisbacon act the little davisbacon acts have been focus of controversy6 critics argue among other things that they are burdensome for employers costly to enforce inflate the cost of construc tion and are basically unnecessary with the fair labor standa rds minimum wage act of 1938 in place defenders of the acts contend that they serv to stabilize the constr uction industry protect workers and the industry from cutthroat em ployers promote skills transfer through apprenticeship training and have increasingl opened new fields to minority and women workers defenders would argue that the prevailing wage requirements help to assure higher quality of public work given the ofte n lowbid mandate in pub lic contracting but critics argue that private sector construction is every bit as good as public construction even though the prevailing wage statutes do not apply to the private sector the debate is circular with counter argument s for each assertion pro and armand thieblot marylandbased management specialist and longtime critic of prevailing wage statutes argues that the absence of such statutes has little effect on unionization in the industry or on individuals wages he notes that in the private construction market where prevailing wage laws are not an issue union contractors not only are able to participate but remain the major force in such sectors of construction as large office buildings and major industrial c onstruction he concedes however that wage differential between uni on and open shop firms has undoubtedly cut into their the union firms market share he affirms however that st ates without prevailing wage law still manage to retain adequate construction work forces thieblot concludes all state prevailing wage laws subject contractors to risks and to the possibility of civil or criminal prosecution for carryin g out their businesses in ways which are perfectly acceptable to all other purchasers of construction except governments and government agencies all of them tend to make buildings and projects more expensive and give governments less value for their construction dollar than private person would receive all of them tend to use the contracting mechanism as hidden conduit for income transfers from taxpayers to construction workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20940crs4 7 armand j thieblot jr prevailing wage laws of the states government union review fall 1983 pp 6265 8 peter philips garth mangum norm waitzman and anne yeagle

committees of the congress in opposition to the davis bacon act counsels that by interfering with the free market prevailing wage laws insure that wage inflation in the construction industry will outpace that in other fields7 others argue fervently in support of such legislation peter philips and team from the university of utah have investigated the implications of repealing the little davis bacon acts and have come to conclusions different from t hose of professor thieblot whether prevailing wage laws are wise public policy can be disputed but the original purpose of such legislation was not to fi nd the cheapest possible labor but rather to sustain local standards to prevent the g overnment from hiring bor at belowstandard rates repeal they found using utah as case study resulted in lowered construction wages but also in loss of tax revenues and increasing project cost overruns these they explain are part of the hidden cost of the repeal of prevailing wage laws in utah cost overruns resulted from an overheated bidding process in which contractors shaved their bids in an urge nt effort to obtain government contracts after the repeal winning bids on state jobs came in lower than ever before having underbid jobs contractors and subcontractors would arrange change orders to get the jobs done or simply walk away from badly underbid jobs and leave the state to pick up the pieces8 such irresponsible practices had been an i ndustry concern in the late 1920s and seem to have contributed to actment of davisbacon9 in addition the utah team pointed to such issues as lessskilled labor force b ecause of reduced training opportunities in the absence of davisbacon or little davisbacon requirements with subsequent skills and manpower shortages they refer as well to slowed economic gains by minority workers and to increased workrelated inju ry rates the c onstruction industry is turbulent they state and characterized by perennial boombust cycle with fleeting relationships they conclude the construction labor market has traditionally been tempered by prevailing wage legislation and labor unions absent these institutions it is unclear how or whether the market will regularly and carefully train workers or assure safety and health on the job site or provide training opport unities for minority workers or offer the incomes needed to make construction an attractive career these hidden costs loss of human capital and career jobs in this industry they observe do not appear as an entry in the ledg ers of any single contractor but if not part of projects direct cost th ey argue they are costs nonetheless10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20940crs5 10 continued philips the effects of the repeal of utahs prevailing wage law on the labor market in
