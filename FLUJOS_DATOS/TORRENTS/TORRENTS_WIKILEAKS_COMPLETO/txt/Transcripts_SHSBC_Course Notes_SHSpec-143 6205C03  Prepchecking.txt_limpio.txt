6205c03 shspec143 prepchecking here is how to make prepchecking not work ignore the pc and omit the datum that it is easier for pc to confront think than mass gpm is thought chamber surrounded by mass the pc is perfectly happy to look at the thought chamber but doesnt like looking at the mass so he gets the thought first and confronts the mass an gradient this is why it is possible to get much deeper into the gpm with goal than with an item he can confront the goal because it is thought running routine3 we have the pc confront all the little masses the lock items first and then he will gradually get to where the goal starts showing up toward the end of the list the goal ticks because it is surrounded by mass then you list the item and it appears towards the end of the list you went into the gpm on the wings of thought and you follow through with the ugly burr and buzz of heat cold and lightning the somatics this is like taking jet plane to africa eventually you have to walk but in running routine 3dxx you travel by thought only short distance using the prehav scale take the first level that keeps banging from then on it is all mass listing items the pc does the same thing with his withholds and missed withholds pcs will confront any quantity of thought and ideas if the auditor doesnt push and shove the pc will go nowhere except on the wings of thought which dont really get the pc anyplace in 1956 lrh noticed that lots of thinkconfront didnt change graph much it at all by 1959 he had determined that you had to be able to confront the mass to get anyplace the pc is working on secondhand thought anyway pulled out of locks in the gpm you will be fooled by such processes as rising scale processing in this process though the process is pure thoughtconfront if the pc made gains it is because he confronted some mass or changed position in the gpm every now and then you do get some results with confronting thought and because of your own willingness to go an confronting thought you buy it as good procedure but it is the rearrangement on mass that really produced the gain it is the same in prepchecking every now and then you will get good win by taking thought instead of deeds you have to get action to get masses to move the pc can add thinks to his case faster than you can pull them off in session there is doingness going on except thinking so it is fine to take thoughts as session missed withholds his thoughts in pt cancel out the thinks of past goals which is why you have to keep ruds in while listing something in pt is much more important to the pc than something that happened billion years ago even though it is the billion years back stuff that aberrated him but auditing is done in pt and the pc is always trying to sell the auditor on the ideas that 1 his thinkingness is what is wrong with him 2 pt is far more important than anything the auditor is trying to go into the auditor must not q and with his own human agreement with this he must have certainty that the longer ago it happened the more effect it had on the pcs aberrated state and that doingness and havingness are more important than thinkingness you clear up ruds as close to pt as possible and you prepcheck as far from pt as possible given the goal of each procedure that is the most effective thing to do you dont have the time or inclination to clear up ruds on the whole track because you are handling the whole track with beefier processes just because you can do something in ruds by pulling thinks dont be fooled into supposing that running think will get you anywhere in prepchecking in prepchecking you have to get dones there is basic difference on importances between the auditor and the pc concerning the location of the charge in prepchecking you cannot let the pc direct the questioning he will stay close to pt and in think if you dont have good auditor control good prepchecking is impossible you can key things out by shallow looks this is fins for ruds but you dont get any resurgence to speak of permanent change if the pc is thinking about it now he did it then you must operate on the basis that the chain is long and has basic that is unknown to the pc all this is available to you by taking locks off the top and going back under good auditor control of the pc you only get charge off later incidents to the point where the pc can see earlier the chain the auditor is getting the pc to go down has r for the pc because he has c with its further reaches the withhold system steps 2 3 4 and 5 of prepchecking when all appear and who see p 186 above and see hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what for more current procedure takes the charge off each incident brings the incident to view so that he can asis it and then go earlier he will go earlier god help you if you go into the gpm with this but persevere find an incident that happened earlier memory is occluded by the most recent overt on the chain recovering memory of who one was in ones last life has virtually therapeutic value though it is very interesting to the pc and gives some resurgence you are prepchecking chains of similar incidents the charge is built up out of the first unknown in routine 3 you are dealing with packages of engrams called identities so routine 3 deals with whole lives of engrams all in bundle leading to the gpm prepchecking deals with chains of incidents and when you get the earliest unknown the whole chain will blow the pc will know where things come from and will feel better the permanent gains you can expect from adroit prepchecking are 1 the pc understands his case better 2 he sees where things come from 3 he feels better about life people and the environment around him buy prepchecking doesnt solve the whole case from one end to the other
