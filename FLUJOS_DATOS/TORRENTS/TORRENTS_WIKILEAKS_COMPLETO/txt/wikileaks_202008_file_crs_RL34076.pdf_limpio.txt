programs however the re port does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory lhhsed programs such as medicare or social security nor does it follow any authorizing legisla tion that may be needed prior to funding some of the presidents budget initiatives for glossary of budget terms and relevant websites see appendix terminology and web resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34076crs5 the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion and stem cell research this bill provides discretionary and mandatory funds to three fede ral departments and 14 related agencies including the social security administration ssa discretionary funding represents only onequarter of the total in the bill among the various appropriations bills lhhsed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic nondefense federa l programs the department of defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs this section presents severa l overview tables on funding in the bill particularly discretionary funding summarizes major funding changes proposed and enacted for lhhsed and discusses relate d issues such as 302b allocations and advance appropriations ter sections provide details on individual lhhsed departments and agencies discretionary and mandatory funding program level and current year appropriations table 2 summarizes the lhhsed appropriations for fy2008 including both discretionary and mandatory appropriations the tabl shows various aggregate measures of lhhsed appropriations enacted for fy2007 and proposed and enacted for fy2008 including the discretiona ry program level current year level and advance appropriations as we ll as scorekeeping adjustments program level discretionary appropriations reflect the total discretionary appropriations in given bill regardless of the year in which they will be spent and ther efore include advance funding for future years unless otherwise specified appropriations levels in this report refer to program level amounts current year discretionary appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in given bill for the current year plus discretionary appropriations for the current year that were enacted in prior years for example fy2008 appropriations that were enacted in the fy2007 act as the annual cong ressional appropria tions process unfolds current year discreti onary appropriations including scorekeeping adjustments see below are measured against the 302b allocation ceilings discussed ter in this report note that media reports and comments from the administration about appropriations activities typically cite figures representing the current year discretionary totals rather than the program levels in the bill advance appropriations are funds that will not become available until after the fiscal year for which the appropriations are enacted for example funds for certain ducation programs like title i part grants to local educational agencies for the education of the disadvantaged that were include d in the fy2007 act that could not be spent before fy2008 at the earliest discussed later in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34076crs6 scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations as monitored by the congressional budget office cbo because appropriations may consist of mixtures of budget authority enacted in various years two summary measures are frequently used program level appropriations and current year appropriations how are thes measures related for an operational definition pr ogram level funding equals current year plus b advances for future years minus c advances from prior years and minus d scorekeeping adjustments alternativ ely current year funding is derived by taking the program level total in the bill subtracting the advances for future years adding in the advances from prior years and applying the scorekeeping adjustments table 2

stem cell research funding restrictions on august 9 2001 president bush announced decision to use federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells for the first time but limited the f unding to existing stem cell lines embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body and have the potential to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and parkinsons disease in response to the presidents announcement the nihhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34076crs32 developed registry of 78 embryonic stem cell lines eligible for use in federally funded research however many of these lines were found to be unavailable or unsuitable for research only 21 of the 78 eligible stem cell lines are currently available for general research purposes some scientists are concerned about the quality longevity and availability of eligible stem cell lines many believe that the advancement of research requires new stem cell lines possibly including stem cells derived from cloned embryos the use of stem cells however raises ethical issues for some because the embryos are destroyed in order to obtain the cells an fy1996 appropriations c ontinuing resolution pl 10499 128 prohibited nih funds from being used for the creati on of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embr yos are destroyed since fy1997 annual appropriations acts have ex tended the prohibition to all lhhsed funds with the nih as the agency primarily affected the restriction originally introduced by representative jay dickey has not changed significantly since it was first enacted the current provision can be found in 509 of pl 110161 division g the senatereported bill s 1710 included new 520 th at would have allowed if certain ethical requirements were met amounts appropriated under the act to be used to conduct human embryonic stem cell resear ch as long as the cells were derived before june 15 2007 thus changing the august 2001 policy of the bush

authorization levels some would contend that the esea authorizations of appropriations as amended by nclba represent funding commitment that was promised in return for legislative suppor t for the new administrative requirements placed on state and local educational systems they would contend that the authorized levels are needed for implementing the new requirements and that the differences between promised and actual funding levels represent shortfall of billions of dollars others w ould contend that the authoriz ed funding levels represent more than appropriations ceilings and as such are different from authorizations for most education programs that is wh the authorization amount is specified it represents only maximum amount with th actual funding leve l to be determined during the regular annual appr opriations process in th past education programs with specified authorization levels genera lly have been funded at lower levels few have been funded at levels qual to or higher than the specified authorization amount five esea programs as amended by nclba have specific authorization levels for fy2 002 thr ough fy2007 title i part grants to local educational agencies leas 21st century community learni ng centers 21cclc the education block grant school choice and the fund for the improvement of education for fy2007 the aggregate authorization for these five programs was 289 billion and the appropr iation was 144 billion or 145 billion less than the amount authorized all current esea program authoriza tions expired after fy2007 they have been automatically extended however fo r one additional year under section 422 of the general education provisions act g epa 20 usc 1226a providing for contingent extension of programs therefore current esea programs are authorized through september 30 2008 gepa also specifies that the amount authorized to be appropriated for prog ram during the extension shall be the amount that was authorized to be appropriated for the program during the terminal fiscal year of the program thus in the case of the five esea programs with specific authorization levels for fy2007 those aut horizations remain the same for fy2008 therefore for fy2008 the aggregate author ization for the five programs is 289 billion and the programs were funded at 157 billion or 131 billion less than the amount authorized idea

amount authorized as with esea and nclba some view these differe nces as funding shortfalls while others see the maximum federal share and the specified authorizations as nothing more than appropriations ceilings for additional information please see crs report rl32085 individuals with disabilities educa tion act idea current funding trends by richard n apling and ann lordeman maintaining integrity and ethical values in the department of education the fy2008 enacted appropriations added general provision that requires the secretary of education to imp lement procedures 1 to assess whether an officer or professional employee of ed contractor or subcontractor of ed member of peer review panel of ed or consultant or advisor to ed has potential financial inte rest in or impaired objectivity toward product or service purchased with guaranteed by or insu red by funds administered by ed or contracted entity of ed and 2 to disclose the existence of any such financial interest or impaired objectivity the inspector general must subsequently report to the house and senate committees on appropriations regarding the adequacy of the procedures implemented by the secretary within one year the inspector general must conduct at least one review of thes procedures and ma ke any recommendations for modifying the procedures that are needed to identify and disclose the existence of such potential financial interests or impaired objectivity forward funding and advance appropriations most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year of the appropriations bill for example most fy2008 appropriations will be available for obligation from october 1 2007 through september 30 2008 several lhhsed programs including some of the larger ed progra ms have authoriza tion or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and seconda ry education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as th appropriations and re main available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2008 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on july 1 2008 and will remain availabl until september 30 2009 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or multiy ear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time fo r school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2008 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 20082009 academic year unlike funding for elementary and secondaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34076crs43 3 fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 division g section 528a2education programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which th appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2008 appropriations f unds normally would have become available october 1 2007 under regular f unding provisions but will not become available for some programs until july 1 2008 under the forwar d funding provisions discussed above however if the july 1 2008 forward f unding date for obligation were to be postponed by three months until oct ober 1 2008 the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2009 for example the fy2008 budget request for title i part grants to leas was 139 billion this amount includes not only forward funding of 65 billion to become available july 1 2008 but also an advance appropriation of 74 billion to become available october 1 2009 like forward funding provisions these advan ce appropriations are specified through provisions in the annua l appropriations bill what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the appropriations level there is differe nce between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period availa ble for obligation at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the threemonth delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for st andard school year occur after october 1 at the scorekeeping level however sign ificant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary appropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence threemonth change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations for more inform ation please see crs report rs20441 advance appropriations forward funding and advance funding by sandy streeter potential problem with the treat ment of prior year advance funding in general the funding amounts discussed in this report focus on the funding actually provided in the fy2008 acted appropriations changes made to prior year advance funding in the enacted appropriations do not affect discretionary funding provided for each program as th prior year advance funding was accounted for in the previous years appropriati ons act eg fy2007 enacted appropriations as previously discussed however for th purposes of determining compliance with the 302b allocation prior year advance fundi ng counts toward this allocation for the current year as it is funding that is availabl for the fiscal year to which the allocation applies as part of the effort to m eet the 302b allocation for
