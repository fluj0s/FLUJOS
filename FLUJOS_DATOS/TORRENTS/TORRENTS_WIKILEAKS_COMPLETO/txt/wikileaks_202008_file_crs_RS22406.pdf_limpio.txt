nsl letter provision is an exception to privacy protections afforded by the right to financial privacy act rfpa its history is not particularly instructive and consists primarily of determination that the exception in its original form should not be too broadly construed but the exception was just that an exception it was neither an affirmative grant of authority to request information nor command to financial institutions to provide information when asked it removed the restrictions on the release of customer information imposed on financial institutions by the rfpa but it left them free to decline to comply when asked to do so in certain significant instances financial institutions had declined to grant the fbi access to financial records in response to requests under section 1114a the fbi informed the committee that the problem occurs particularly in states which have state constitutional privacy protection provisions or state banking privacy laws in those states financial institutions decline to grant th fbi access because state law prohibits them from granting such access and the rfpa since it permits but does not mandate such access does not override state law in such situation the concerned financial institutions which might otherwise desire to grant the fbi access to customers record will not do so because state law does not allow such cooperation and cooperation might expose them to liability to the customer whose records the fbi sought access hrept 99 690 at 156 1986 congress responded with passage of the first nsl statute as an amendment to the rfpa affirmatively giving the fbi access to financial institution records in certain foreign intelligence cases at the same time in the electronic communications privacy act it afforded the fbi comparable access to telephone company and other communications service provider customer information together the two nsl provisions afforded the fbi access to communications and financial business records under limited circumstancescustomer and customer transaction information held by telephone carriers and banks pertaining to foreign power or its agents relevant to foreign counterintelligence investigation both the communications provider section and the rfpa section contained nondisclosure provisions and limitations on further dissemination except pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the attorney general neither had an express enforcement mechanism nor identified pe nalties for failure to comply with either the nsl or the nondisclosure instruction in the mid1990s congress added two more nsl provisionsone permits nsl use in connection with the investigation of government employee leaks of classified information under the national security act the other grants the fb i access to credit agency records pursuant to the fair credit reporting act under much the same conditions as apply to the records of financial institutions the fbi asked for the fair credit reporting act amendment as threshold mechanism to enable it to make more effective use of its bank record access authority fbis right of access under the right of financial privacy act cannot be effectively used however until the fbi discovers which financial institutions are being u tilized by the subject of counterintelligence investigation consumer reports maintained by credit bureaus are ready source of such information but although such reports are readily available to the private sector they are not available to fbi counterintelligence investigators fbi has made specific showing that the effort to identify financial institutions in order to make use of fbi authority under the right to financial privacy act can not only be timeconsuming and resourceintensive but can also require the use of investigative techniques such as physical and electronic surveillance review of mail covers and canvassing of all

of credit reports hrept 104427 at 36 1996 the national security act nsl provision authorizes access to credit and financial institution records of federal employees with security clearances who were required to give their consent as condition for clearance passed in the wake of the ames espionage case it is limited to investigations of classified information leaks both the fair credit reporting act section and the national security act section contain dissemination restrictions as well as safe harbor immunity and nondisclosure provisions neither has an explicit penalty for improper disclosure of the request but the fair credit reporting act section expressly authorizes judicial enforcement the usa pa triot act amended three of the four existing nsl statutes and added fifth in each of the three nsl statutes available exclusively to the fbithe electronic communications privacy act section the right to financial privacy act section and the fair credit reporting act sectionsection 505 of the usa patriot act expanded fbi issuing authority beyond fbi headquarter officials to include the heads of the fbi field offices ie special agents in charge sacs eliminated the requirement that the record information sought pertain to foreign power or the agent of foreign power required instead that the nsl request be relevant to an investigation to protect against international terrorism or foreign spying and added the caveat that such investigation of an american can be predicated exclusively on first amendmentprotected activities the amendments allowed nsl authority to be employed more quickly without the delays associated with prior approval from fbi headquarters and more widely without requiring that the information pertain to foreign power or its agents subsection 358g of the usa patriot act amended the fair credit reporting act to add fifth and final nsl section and the provision had one particularly noteworthy feature it was available not merely to the fbi but to any government ag ency investigating or analyzing international terrorism notwithstanding section 1681b of this title or any other provision of this subchapter consumer reporting agency shall furnish consumer report of consumer and all other information in consumers file to government agency authorized to conduct investigations of or intelligence or counterintelligence activities or analysis related to international terrorism when presented with written certification by such government agency that such information is necessary for the agencys conduct or such investigation activity or analysis although the subsections legislative history treats it as matter of first impression congresss obvious intent was to provide other agencies with the national security letter authority comparable to that enjoyed by the fbi under the fair credit reporting act the new section had nondisclosure and safe harbor subsection but express means of judicial enforcement or penalties for improper disclosure of request under the section

requirements of the first amendment on appeal one was dismissed as moot and the other sent back for reconsideration in light of the amendments following remand the district court for the southern district of new york concluded that the amended nsl secrecy requirements violated both first amendment free speech and separation of powers principles the governments asserted interestprotection of national security against terrorismis compelling one yet the court felt the procedure envisioned in section 2709 even with the addition of judicial review was insufficiently confined in either scope or duration to satisfy first amendment demands moreover it found that the judicial review provisions offended separation of powers principles because they purported to compel court to apply statutory standard to the resolution of first amendment issues that differed from the constitutionallyrequired standard the case has been appealed to the second circuit court of appeals

inspector general to review and report on the fbis use of nsls in early march 2007 the inspector general released the first of two required reports that covered calendar years 2003 through 2005 the second covering the time period through the end of calendar year 2006 was released in march 2008 the initial report noted that fbi use of nsls had increased dramatically expanding from 8500 requests in 2000 to 47000 in 2005 seventyfour percent were issued in conjunction with counterterrorism investigations most of the rest in connection with counterintelligence investigations and less than 1 percent as part of foreign computer intrusion investigation during the three years under review the percentage of nsls used to investigate americans us persons increased from 39 in 2003 to 53 in 2005
