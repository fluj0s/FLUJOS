primarily responsible for safety in the rail industr fras safety programs were last authorized in 1994 their authorization expi red in 1998 most measures of rail safety have improved significantly since fras st authorization including the number of grade crossing collisions and fatalities and the number of employee injuries and deaths these improvements came while th amount of both freight and passenger rail activity on the nations rail infrastructure was increasing however the improvements in safety measures have levele d off in recent years given significant projected continued increases in freight and passenger rail activity in the coming decade there is concern that without additi onal efforts some of the gains of the past decade may be lost among the issues that have dominated bate thus far are alleged shortcomings in the rail hours of service statute 49 usc 21101 et seq that limit the acts effectiveness in preventing fatigue among train operating crews which may be contributing factor in significant number of train accidents related issue is limbo time time that train operating crews spend on shift but not engaged in safetyrelated duties after they have reached the limit of their shift under the rail hours of service act which also contributes to fatigue unlike the hours of service rules for other transportation modes the ra il hours of service rules ar set in law and cannot be altered through the regulatory process other prominent issues have included implementation by railr oads of automated collisionpr evention technology in trains the adequacy of fra track inspections and safety at highwayrail grade crossings the house on october 17 2007 and senate on august 1 2008 passed differing versions of hr 2095 the fede ral railroad safety improvement act on september 24 2008 the house agreed to the senate amendment with an amendment pursuant to hres 1492 this amended ve rsion of hr 2095 incorporated another piece of legislation the passenger rail investment and impr ovement act of 2008 differing versions of which were previo usly passed by both the senate and house as s 294 which reauthorizes amtrak and federal passenger rail programs further action is now up to the senate according to press reports and information at the house transportation and infrastructur committees website the amended hr 2095 includes provisions that would increase the length of the minimum rest period under the rail hours of service act and give fra the authority to further increase the minimum rest period through regulati on increase the number of fra safety inspectors and mandate implementation of positive train control it would also authorize about 13 billion in funding for amtrak and passenger rail activities and direct the department of tr

federal railroad administration fra of the us department of transportation is the federal agency pr imarily responsible for promoting and regulating the safety of the railroad industry the fra s rail safety programs were last authorized in 1994 pl 103440 that authorization expired at the end of fy1998 fras safety programs have c ontinued to be f unded through annual appropriations bills reauthorization of the fra is taking place in context of improvement in most measures of rail safety however th ere continue to be around 1000 railrelated deaths each year the trend of improvement in some rail safety measures such as train accidents and deaths in gradecrossing collisions has leveled off in recent years and with forecasts of significant growth in rail traffic in the future there is concern over the need to make more progress in rail safety several hearings have been held in the 110th congress in both the house and senate on reauthorization of fra an administration proposal to reauthorize fra has been introduced by request as the federal railroad safe ty accountability and improvement act hr 1516 and s 918 action has been taken on this legislation in either the house or the senate representative james oberstar chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee has introduced reauthorization proposal the federal railroad safety impr ovement act of 2007 hr 2095 managers amendment wa s adopted with amendments and was ordered to be reported out of the transportation and infrastructure committee on june 14 2007 the amended bill was re ported by the committee on september 19 2007 and was approved by the house of representatives on october 17 2007 senator frank lautenberg chairman of the senate commerce committees subcommittee on surface transportation and merchant marine infrastructure safety and security has also introduced reau thorization proposal the railroad safety enhancement act of 2007 s 1889 ma nagers amendment was adopted

new requirements for highwayrail grade crossings policy context the nations railroad sector consists of both freight rail companies and those passenger rail systems that use the nation s intercity rail netw ork ie both amtrak and commuter rail systems the sector cons ists of roughly 570 freight railroads and 118 passenger commuter and excursion ra ilroads these organizations employ around 235000 people and operate roughl 220000 miles of track the vast majority of the rail sector consists of freight railroad operations the freight railroad industry is divided into three classes based on operating revenue s there are only 7 railroads in the top category class i for which the threshold is roughly 320 million in annual revenues but those 7 railroads represent about 70 of freight rail industry employment and own roughly 70 of total us rail mileage the staggers rail act of 1980 pl 96448 largely deregulated the freight rail industry since that time there has been extensive consolida tion of th industry employment has been reduced from 480000 1980 to 235000 2006 while freight revenue tonmiles have increased fro m 918 million 1980 to 196 tr illion 2006 the miles of road operated1 in freight service have been reduced from 177000 1980 to 141000 2005 while the number of trainmiles opera ted has increased from 718 million 1980 to 811 million 2006 the number of pa ssengermiles has increased from 12 billion 1980 to 16 billion 20062 during this period the overall safety record of the industry has shown great improvement between 1980 nd 1994 the annual rate of tr ain accidents that is the number of accidents divided by the number of miles traveled by trains declined from almost 12 accidents per million train miles to just under 4 per million train miles however since 1994 the improve ment has leveled off and the rate of train accidents has varied from 35 to 44 per million train miles since then3 in addition to this lack of improvement in the train accident rate several recent serious accidents have raised concerns about the need for furt her improvement in rail safety4 the numbers ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34128crs3 5 for 2006 fra estimated that track conditions

juries and deaths declined until 2003 but has shown little improvement since then most railrelated deaths are to pedestrians trespassing on rail lines and motorists colliding with trains at highway rail grad crossings while there are nearly 1000 railrelated deaths each year only around 2030 rail employees are killed while on duty each year and railroads have lower em ployee injury rates than other modes of transportation and most other major industries fra classifies the causes of train accidents into five categories human factors track and structures equipment signal and train control and miscellaneous of these human factors and track are responsib for the majority of train accidents 5 examples of human factor causes of acci dents include improperly positioning the switches that determine which track train will follow the cause of the graniteville sc accident moving rail car s without checking for safe conditions in the vicinity and leaving rail cars in position that bloc ks track examples of track conditions that lead to accidents include defective join t bars that connect one piece of rail to the next defective or ineffective crossties t hat maintain the proper alignment of the parallel rails that form the track and broken or worn switches without further reductions in the rate of train accidents the number of train accidents and resulting deaths and injuries is likely to grow due to expected increases in train traffic the department of transportation dot has estimated that between 1998 and 2020 the amount of freight moved by rail measured by weight will increase by roughly 506 also many communities are interested in establishing or expanding already ex isting commuter rail operations which generally operate on the freight rail network to provide transportation alternatives and manage congestion thus the number of train miles on the nations freight rail network is likely to significantly increase in the coming years if train accident rates do not improve this may lead to increased numbers of accidents injuries and deaths fras role in rail safety fras role in rail safety is threefold to assess the safety of rail operations to promulgate regulations to promote coste ffective improvements in safety standards and to enforce compliance with federal rail safety laws and regulations these regulations address such topics as track condition passenger nd freight equipment signal and train control systems maintenance of active warning devices at highway rail grade crossings accident reporting alc ohol and drug testing operating rules and practices and many others fra also enfo rces the hazardous ma terials regulations prescribed by dots pipeline and hazar dous materials safety administration as they apply to rail

are classified as safety personnel including around 430 inspectors supplemented by 160 state inspectors who work with fra on safety oversight of railroads to oversee an industry with over 235000 employees 220000 miles of trac k 158000 signals and switches and over 13 million freight cars and other equipmen t in service although fra and the state investigators conduct some 63000 in spections each year these inspections cover only small fraction of the operations of railroads each year7 to make the most of its resources fra focuses inspecti ons at locations judged as likely to have safety problems based on accident data and results of previous inspections fras annual budget for its core safety responsib ilities that is excluding funding for grants to amtrak is roughly 200 million fras new initiatives to promote safety fras traditional approach to safety is to regulate the design of rail structures and the behavior of rail workers then to use inspections to enforce compliance with the specific standards the government accountability office gao has noted that these inspections focus on compliance with minimum standards and are not designed to determine how well railroads are managing safe ty risks throughout their systems that could lead to accidents8 in response to reviews of its work by the dot inspector general and the office of management and budget fra has begun to adopt new approaches to supplement its traditional safety program these include efforts to target its inspections using more quantitative assessment of risk as well as new initiatives that make use of risk management approaches to improving sa fety for example fra has implemented confidential close call reporting progra m pilot project this project allows employees of participating ra ilroads to report close calls that is incidents where an accident could have occurred but didnt the information on the close calls is kept confidential so that both employees and the participating railroads are shielded from punishment for providing the informati on team composed of representatives of the participating railroads labor organizations fra and the bureau of transportation statistics will review the information to identify safety problems similar program has been in place in the av iation industry for many years and has contributed to improveme nts in safety there fras national rail safety

safety action plan provides reasonable framework for guiding the agencys efforts9 since the plan was introduced relatively recently most of its initiatives have not ye t been fully implement ed and their overall impact on safety will probably not be know n for several years some of the initiatives rely on voluntary actions by railr oads such as the adoption of worker fatigue model to help railr oads schedule the duty periods of train crews so as to reduce worker fatigue thus their implementation is uncertain gao noted that while fra has goals for its safety efforts eg to reduce train accidents caused by human factors it does t have measures of the direct results of its inspection and enforcement programs that would show their contribution to achieving those goals neither has fra evaluated the effectiveness of its enforcement program in achieving its goals selected reauthorization issues the major issues in the current reauthorization debate include addressing employee fatigue through changes to the federal rail hours of service legislation implementing new train cont rol technology that promotes safety improving the condition of track and imp roving safety at highwayrail grade crossings train operator fatigue in the rail industry which operates heav machinery in all conditions around the clock the impact of employee fatigue on safety is an everpresent concern the fra estimates that fatigue is at least contribu ting factor in 25 of serious train accidents that are caused by human factors the national transportation safety board ntsb has identified fatigue as factor in at least 18 rail accidents since 198410 and notes that given the difficulty of identifying fatigue as cause or contributor to accidents the number of accidents due to fatig ue is likely to be underestimated11 ntsb has had operator fatigue on its list of most wanted transportation safety improvements since it began keeping such list in 199012httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34128crs6 13 the rail

are still validrail hours of service act congress enacted legislation in 1907 to limit the amount of time certain rail workers such as train operating pe rsonnel and signalmen can work at one stretch and to specify the minimum amount of rest they must be provided before reporting for work again13 these limits are enacted in law14 unlike the hours of service limits for workers in ot her

hours of service law has not been substantially changed since 1969 under the current law train operating crews and signalmen can work maximum of 12 hours after whic h they must be given at least 10 hours rest however if they work less than 12 hours they are only required to be given 8 hours of rest15 under these rules train crew worker can work 432 hours month this compares to maximum work

service law although ordinarily observed do not seem adequate to effectively control fatigue18 the ntsb has made several recomme ndations to dot over the years to change the rail hours of service act but dot has not been able to respond to these recommendations because the rules are set in the statutes among the issues that have been raised regarding the shortcomings of the current hours of servi ce rule are inadequate rest periods and schedules that conflict with circadian rhythms inadequate rest periods while workers are required to have at least eight hours off duty between shifts that means that the worker has eight hours to commute home enjoy any leisure time take care of any personal tasks that need to be done rest then commute back to the work site moreover the employee may not know whether they will have to return to work in 8 hours or whether they will have longer period to rest if they are called to retu rn to work in 8 hours the call to report to work which is required by labor agreemen ts to come early enough to give the employee time to get to work may come as much as 2 hours in advance of the time to report to work which could be only 6 hour s after the employee ft work at the end of their previous shift thus worker could even under ideal circumstances away from the job have as little as 5 to 6 hours of undisturbed rest before returning to work the difficulties created by the relativel short length of the minimum offduty period set by the hours of service act can be exacerbated by the uncertainty of rail employee work schedules it may be diffi cult for rail employees to make effective use of their available rest time between shif ts because when they leave work at the end of shift train crews do not always know when they will next have to report to work the fra has testified that crews of freight trains rarely have predictable work schedules the united transportation union s testified that the majority of train crews are subject to call with little notice19 this uncertainty makes it difficult for train crews to know how to make th best use of their offduty time this uncertainty of employees work schedules is due in part to labor agreements which affect the work sche duling practices of railroads these agreements prioritize the availability of em ployees for work based on factors such as seniority employees who are called to repor t to work when they feel they have not had adequate rest can decline the call but may face disciplinary action if they do so conflict with circadian rhythms researchers have learned that human

unctions and may impair their performance the work schedules permitte d under the current hours of service rule may in certain instances conflict with employees circadian rhythms making it more difficult for them to get adequate rest under the current regulations rail workers can work 8 hours and rest 8 hours and maintain that schedule i ndefinitely thus one day they might be resting from midnight to 8 am the next day from 4 pm to midnight the next day from 8 am to 4 pm and the next day back to midnight to 8 am backwardrotating schedule that never allo ws the workers to establish circadian rhythm current efforts to address fatigue fra has adapted model developed by researchers working with the us military that can estimate the degree of fatigue likely to be experienced by person based on such factors as the time of day the amount of sleep they last got when that sleep occurred and how long the person has been awake since then fra has tested th is model against record of crew work schedules and found that it is useful in pr edicting when an employee may be fatigued to the point of increased risk of contributing to an accident fra is encouraging rail companies to use this model to inform their crew scheduling practices fra is also encouraging and supporting efforts to addr ess sleep disorders among rail employees railroads and rail bor have cooperated in effort s to address fatigue for example the bnsf railway company pr ovides train crews 14 hours of undisturbed rest after working 8 hours csx tr ansportation provides 10hour period of undisturbed rest as well as fixed work rest schedules in some locations20 however efforts by rail management an d rail labor to address fatigue issues have often achieved limited succe ss factors that have c onstrained the success of the various initiatives include the variability in demand for rail services which can increase the need for rail labor more quickly than employees can be added staffing and retention issues that have affected the supply of rail labor and provisions in collective bargaining agreements which may make fatigue management practice mandatory in one location and optional in another even within the same railroad according to rail labor representatives programs to provide more predictable work schedules are currently covering mo re than 2 of affected employees21 also even successful voluntary programs are s ubject to being changed or eliminated as conditions change in the industry more fundamental difficulty facing effo rts to address fatigue is that both rail managers and rail workers have incentives to maintain the status quo regarding rail hours of service for managers the cu rrent system allows more flexibility inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34128crs9 22 federal railroad administration department of transportation decision of the united continuedscheduling employees for work than any lik ely alternative for workers the current system provides the opportunity to work more hours and thus earn more income than any likely alternative for these reas ons voluntary efforts to address fatigue are likely to face much resistance another difficulty in attempting to address fatigue is the degree to which the current hours of service regime has beco intertwined with the contractual arrangements that have been negotiated over decades by rail labor and management these labor agreements resulting from collective bargaining often include provisions that affect how often and under what circumstances employees can work changes in the hours of service regime may affect the impact of these provisions and thus upset the balance of interest s achieved through long negotiation limbo time limbo time refers to situation where train operating crew has reached the limit of the am ount of time it is allowed to work at one stretch under the hours of service law 12 hours but has not yet reached the location where it is to be released from duty in such situation the crew is required to stop the train and not engage in safetyrelated dutie s but it is not allowed to leave the train until replacement crew arrives at which time the original crew can be transported to final release point the time the crew spends being transported to its final release point is neither onduty time for purposes of the hours of serv ice law and so not violation of the hours of service law nor offduty time nd so does not count against the amount of offduty time the crew is required to be given in order to rest after their shift hence limbo time the train crews are generally paid for limbo time but there is concern about its impact on employee fatigue the minimum rest period currently required after 12hour shift may not be sufficient to recover from shift that was more than 12 hours long in some cases much mo re due to the addition of limbo time limbo time was created in 1969 amendmen ts to the rail hours of service law prior to that change the time the original crew spent being transported to its final release point was considered offduty rest time rail labor requested that the transportation time be considered as onduty time but railroads objected that that change would create increased scheduling difficulties for them since they would have to arrange to stop the trains even fu rther from the prearranged destination and have the original crew spend more time being transported to its release point limbo time was created to ensure that train cr ews offduty period did not begin until they were truly off duty so that they had the opportunity to rest during their rest period while still providing railroa ds operational flexibility w ithout endangering safety fra has also interpreted the time the original crew spends waiting with the train for the arrival of transportation to its final release point as limbo time an interpretation that has been upheld by the supreme court fra has expr essed concern about employees being held on trains for long periods of time while awaiting the arrival of transportation in the absence of any valid emergency that would justify such long waits22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34128crs10 22 continued states

consisted of many midsized companies operating in relatively small regions and railroads typically had employees stationed every few dozen miles who could be sent to pick up train crews whose shifts had expired since then there has been significant consolidation in the rail industry which is now dominated by few major companies whose operations span much larger territories the average distance covered by train crew during shift is now much greater and there may be few or even intermediate locations from which transportation can be dispatch ed to pick up crew whose shift has expired industrywide statistics on limbo time are not available so the full extent of limbo time is not known nor can an increase in the incidence of limbo time be documented industrywide the brotherhood of

illinois alas ka and among the eastern railroads in 1997 fra asked the rail safety advisory committee to examine ptc the advisory committee concluded that the safety benefit of ptc to railroads did not justify the significant costs of deploying such systems it estimated that ptc deployment on the class i railroads w ould cost from 12 billion to 78 billion over 20 years depending on the

are public crossings where the railroad tracks are crossed by public road the remaining 90000 or so crossings are known as private crossings where the railroad tracks are crossed by for example driveways or farm roads the number of collisions and fatalities at grade crossings has been reduced significantly over the past few decades even as the amount of both train and highway traffic has significantly increased since the fra was last authorized train miles traveled have increased by 24 from 655 million miles in 1994 to 810 million miles in 2006 while road vehicle miles traveled have

crossings in urban areas have been provi ded with automated warning devices the provision of automated warning devices to the more than 80000 public railhighway crossings that do not have conventional au tomated warning devices is constrained by both the costs of the devices and by concern on the part of public authorities that increasing the protection provided to motori sts at one crossing could be used in lawsuits to argue the inadequacy of prot ection provided at other crossings in the area35 another method of reducing grade crossi ng accidents is to eliminate the grade crossing in some cases this is done by evating the road or rail crossing but this is very expensive option most often this is done by closing the road where it crosses the railroad tracks in 1994 fra set go of reducing thethen 280000 public and private grade crossings by 25 to 210000 that goal has not been achieved though some 30000 crossings have been clos ed since then fra encourages states and
