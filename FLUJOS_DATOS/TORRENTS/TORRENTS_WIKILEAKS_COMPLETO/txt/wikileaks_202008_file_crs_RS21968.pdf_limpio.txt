reconciliation will largely depend on the degree of implementation of the adopted laws the legislative progress achieved breakthrough on february 13 2008 with passage unanimously with 206 members voting of an amnesty law the provincial powers law and the 2008 national budget however june 2008 study by the government accountability office gao08837 said the legislative moves have had limited effect in healing the rifts in iraqi politics iraqs performance on the benchmarks is in the table below during 2008 malikis growing perceived strength helped him rebuild his government but has caused some adverse consequences for his political position the pullout of the accord front the sadr faction and the bloc of former prime minister iyad alallawi in 2007 left the cabinet with about 13 vacant seats out of 37 seat cabinet march 2008 offensive ordered by maliki against the sadr faction and other militants in basra and environs ultimately pacified the city weakened sadr politically and caused some sunnis and kurds to see maliki as more evenhanded and non sectarian than previously thought this contributed to decision by the accord front to return to the cabinet in july 2008 other cabinet vacancies were filled mostly by independents to the point where the cabinet now only has one vacancy ministry of justice at the same time us officials became concerned that malikis growing independence from the united states could lead to reversals for example by creating restiveness among the sunni sons of iraq fighters who he has refused to integrate wholesale into the iraqi security forces the 100000 fighters nationwide cooperate with us forces against qaeda in iraq and other militants still the assumption of the payments of the sons by the iraqi government in november 2008 has been relatively without incident to date calming us fears to some extent emboldened by his political strength but also attentive to pressure by iran maliki insisted on substantial us concessions in the usiraq status of forces agreement sofa that pa ssed the cor on november 27 2008 over sadrist opposition and notwithstanding sunni efforts to obtain assurances of their future security the pact took effect january 1 2009 limiting the prerogatives of us troops to operate in iraq and setting timetable of december 31 2011 for us withdrawal malikis growing strength is causing concern even among malikis erstwhile political allies the kurds key source of support for him are increasing at odds with his leadership because of his formation of governmentrun tribal support councils in northern iraq which the kurds see as an effort to prevent them from gaining control of disputed territories isci the longstanding main ally of malikis dawa party is competing with the dawa for provincial council seats as discussed below and accuse him of surrounding hi mself with dawa veterans to the exclusion of other decisionmakers the competition has prompted reports that several major factions are considering attempting to bring about noconfidence vote against maliki the late december 2008 resignation under pressure of sunni cor speaker mahmoud almashhadani who was perceived as blocking confidence motion could be one outward indicator of the dissension still malikis opponents are said to be unable to date to agree on who would replace him as prime minister consideration that was widely judged to have kept maliki in office in 2006 and 2007 g18g155g152g159g146g151g140g146g138g149g561g7g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 the bush administration and presidentelect obama are

presidential veto of the july 22 2008 election law needed to hold these elections the draft law provided for equal division of power in kirkuk between kurds arabs and turkomans until its status is finally resolved prompting kurdish opposition to any weakening of their dominance in kirkuk following the summer cor recess the major political blocs agreed to put aside the kirkuk dispute and passed revised provincial election law on september 24 2008 providing for the elections by january 31 2009 this is now formally set the revised law stripped out provisions in the vetoed version to allot 13 total reserved seats spanning six provinces to minorities however in october 2008 the cor adopted new law restoring six reserved seats for minorities christian seats in baghdad nineveh and basra yazidis one seat in nineveh shabaks one seat in nineveh and sabeans one seat in baghdad us officials have hoped that the elections would bring sunni muslims ever further into the political structure sunnis boycotted the january 2005 provincial elections and are poorly represented in some mixed provinces such as diyala it is also hoped that the elections will help incorporate into the political structure the trib leaders awakening councils who recruited the sons of iraq fighters these sunni tribalists are hoping to show strength at the expense of the established sunni parties others see the elections as key opportunity to move moqtada alsadrs faction firmly away from armed conflict against the mainstream shiite parties that conflict surged in the march 2008 basra offensive discussed above as campaigning heats up in january 2009 there are 14500 candidates vying for the 440 provincial council seats in the 14 arabdominated pr ovinces of iraq this yields an average of 33 candidates for each seat which some see as enthusiasm for democracy in iraq v oters can choose an individual candidate or they can vote for political parties instead the parties will then choose who on their slate will occupy seats allotted for that party some of the political tensions and fissures are evident in the candidate lists offered so far in the mostly shiite southern provinces isci and malikis dawa are offering competing lists sadr announced in october 2008 that he would not field separate list in the provincial elections but support sadrists on other lists sadrs faction has not yet announced who are the candidates it is supporting but the prosadr risalyun mission grouping has filed candidate slates in several provinces mostly in the south two other parties competing are considered sadrist the blamelessness and reconstruction party and the sadr aliraq party the shiite independent interior minister jawad albulani has fielded cand idates under his constitutional party not only in the shiite south but also in sunni areas suggesting he is trying to portray his party as national and nonsectarian the competition in the provincial elections in the south comes amid move by many basra citizens to file petition under the 2006 regions law to form new region consisting only of basra province whether or not formal referendum will take place in basra could be determined before the provincial elections and could thereby favor or hurt such basra specific parties as fadhila virtue an offshoot of the sadr faction
