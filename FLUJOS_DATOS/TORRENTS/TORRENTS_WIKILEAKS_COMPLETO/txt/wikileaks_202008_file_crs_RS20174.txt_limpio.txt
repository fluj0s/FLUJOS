comparison vladimir n pregelj specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the tariff and quota treatment of us imports from mexico under the north american free trade agreement has resulted in distinct and increasing competitive disadvantage for imports from the beneficiary countries of the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera to eliminate this disadvantage proposals have been made to extend to imports from caribbean basin countries preferential treatment equivalent to that accorded imports of identical goods from mexico this report compares the provisions of four such proposals title i of hr 984 title i of s 371 hr 1834 and s 1389 including measure identical to s 1389 included as title ii in substitute amendment proposed in the senate to hr 434 and passed subject to restrictive amendment all four would accord during limited transition period to imports of certain products primarily textiles and textile apparel from cbera countries unilateral preferential treatment equivalent to that accorded to comparable imports from mexico under the nafta this report will be updated as events warrant background with the entry into force on january 1 1994 of the preferential tariff and quota provisions of the north american free trade agreement nafta the earlier trade advantage of the beneficiaries of the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera over mexico until then beneficiary of the generalized system of preferences was eliminated the further gradual implementation of the naftato be fully completed by january 1 2008has placed those countries in an increasingly disadvantageous competitive position compared to mexico as in three previous congresses proposals have been made in the 106th congress which would mitigate if not eliminate the adverse effect of the competitive advantage that mexico has gained and will continue to gain relative to cbera countries these proposals would during limited transition period accord to certain imports from cbera countries that are by law ineligible for the cbera preference tariff and quota treatment identical with or very similar to in parity with that accorded to similar congressional research service the library of congress crs2 imports from mexico under the nafta they would also aim at the eventual accession of all cbera countries to multilateral freetrade agreement nafta or the proposed free trade area of the americas ftaa by the year 2005 or the conclusion of an equivalent bilateral agreement with the united states proposals in the 106th congress four cbinafta parity proposals have been introduced united statescaribbean trade partnership act title i of hr 984 caribbean and central america relief and economic stabilization act and three measures titled identically united statescaribbean basin trade enhancement act cbtea title i of s 371 central american and caribbean relief act hr 1834 the administration proposal and s 1389 of these hr 984 has been ordered reported on june 10 1999 and s 1389 has been reported favorably sept 16 1999 srept 106160 the reported language of s 1389 has been included as title ii in senate substitute amendment sp 2325 to hr 434 not treated individually in this report amended further and passed by the senate on november 3 1999 as the trade and development act of 1999 including an amendment denying any benefits granted under the act to countries not enforcing the standards of the ilo convention for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor although these measures differ in certain particulars all four have in common twofold purpose 1 unilateral extension by the united states to imports from the cbera countries during limited transition period of varying length in each proposal of preferential trade treatment equivalent or similar to that accorded to imports from mexico under the north american free trade agreement nafta and 2 the eventual accession by the year 2005 of all cbera countries to multilateral freetrade area including the united states nafta or the prospective free trade area of the americas ftaa or bilateral freetrade agreements with the united states comparable to relevant multilateral one in all four measures the focus is on imports of textiles and textile apparel while three of them also provide preferences for certain other importsensitive articles1 all of which are at present ineligible for the cbera preference but benefit from the gradual elimination in stages of all trade barriers under the nafta the countries benefitting from the program are called partnership countries in hr 984 and beneficiary countries in s 371 s 1389 and hr 1834 the term beneficiary country is occasionally used in this report also to double as the meaning of partnership country where applicable beneficiary or partnership countries of the program are defined in all four proposals as the current beneficiary countries of the cbera with hr 1834 and s 1389 1 defined in section 213bbf of the cbera as footwear ineligible for dutyfree status under the gsp tuna in airtight containers petroleum or petroleum products watches and watch parts containing material produced in nonmfn country and articles subject to reduced rather than zero duty rates handbags luggage flat goods work gloves and leather wearing apparel ineligible for gsp dutyfree treatment duty rates on such articles have been reduced by 20 but more than 25 ad valorem below those applied on december 31 1991 crs3 also requiring the president to determine countrys eligibility for the program by considering lengthy list of additional criteria comparable to some of those contained in the nafta and the world trade organization wto agreement transition period varies among the proposals in hr 1834 it runs from october 1 1999 through june 30 2001 in s 1389 from october 1 1999 through the earlier of december 31 2004 or the day ftaa or an equivalent bilateral trade agreement between the cbtea country and the united states enters into force in s 371 from october 1 1999 through september 30 2005 and in hr 984 from the date of its enactment through the earlier of the date five years after its enactment or the date of the cbera countrys accession to the nafta or comparable bilateral agreement preferences for textiles and textile apparel the key category of articles addressed in the proposals also vary among them in some instances preferential treatment is specifically made identical to that of imports under the nafta in others dutyfree or reducedrate treatment is only functionally identical with or very similar to nafta treatment tariff treatment specifically identical to that accorded to identical mexican articles under the nafta2 would be extended under hr 984 to articles originating as defined in the nafta in partnership country while nonoriginating articles or those not qualifying for other dutyfree preferences provided by hr 984 see below would be subject within import quotas allocated among the partnership countries to the same duty rates that apply to tariffquota imports for nonoriginating articles from mexico this preference may be implemented by the president after consultation with domestic textile and apparel industry and other interested parties dutyfree treatment without specific reference to nafta treatment would be accorded under 1 hr 984 s 371 and s 1389 to apparel assembled from fabrics wholly formed and cut in the united states from usformed yarns usually referred to as yarn forward situation and entered under the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus subheading 98020080 productionsharing provision3 or under chapter 61 or 62 in hr 984 also chapter 63 which would qualify for htsus

yarns wholly formed in the united states in s 371 and s 1389 also assembled with usmade thread 2 although most textile and textile apparel imports from mexico already are duty free under nafta many are still dutiable at rates that are being gradually reduced to zero 3 under htsus subheading 98020080 any imported article assembled but not further processed in any foreign country from usorigin component parts is not assessed any duty on the value of such component parts but is assessed import duty at the regular rate on the remainder of its value for the purpose of textile apparel component

under chapter 61 62 or 63 which would normally qualify for htsus 98020080 status except for certain additional marginal operations cf 1a above 2 cut in beneficiary country from fabrics wholly formed in the united states from yarns wholly formed in the united states and assembled with usmade thread 3 identified under the prescribed procedure as handloomed handmade or folklore articles quantitative restrictions import quotas would apply under any proposal to any articles qualifying for dutyfree or reducedduty treatment except to those subject to import quotas under hr 984 as nonoriginating all four proposals provide for bilateral emergency action import relief by the president in case of serious injury or threat thereof to us domestic industry by imports from cbera beneficiary country under the same rules and conditions as apply to imports from mexico under the nafta all four authorize tariff action imposition of or increase in duty rate tariff quotas hr 984 and hr 1834 also provide for quantitative restrictions penalties for transshipment differ among the proposals 1 hr 984 s 371 and s1389 provide penalty for the exporter or any successor for willful illegal transshipment or willful customs fraud by denying all cbera benefits for two years crs5 2 under s 371 and s 1389 country not taking measures to prevent transshipment may be penalized by reduction of its textile and apparel quota by three times the quantity of the transshipped articles 3 hr 1834 provides for reduction of transshipping countrys existing import quotas by an amount determined by the president and also defines transshipment as providing material false information concerning the country of origin manufacture processing or assembly of the article in question or any of its components preferences for other importsensitive articles ineligible for basic cbera preferences zero or reduced duty rate4 are included in two proposals 1 hr 984 and s 1389 authorize for any originating importsensitive article tariff treatment equivalent to that which applies under the nafta to identical articles imported from mexico in instances where the nafta duty rate would still be in the process of being reduced in annual stages to zero and the cbera reduced rate would be lower than the current nafta rate the cbera rate would apply 2 under hr 1834 and s 1389 the president would be authorized to proclaim reductions of duties on imports from cbtea beneficiaries up to the entire difference between the applicable regular cbera rate and the naftamexico rate in all three cases hr 984 hr 1834 and s 1389 the reduction based on the nafta rate would not apply to any article already accorded duty free treatment under us note 2b to subchapter ii of chapter 98 of the htsus5 s 371 contains provisions dealing with the duty rates on other importsensitive articles but such articles continue to benefit from the dutyfree treatment under us note 2b see preceding paragraph modification of preferential treatment is provided for in three proposals 1 under hr 984 the president may withdraw suspend or limit upon 60day notice and explanation to congress the parity preference for any article of partnership country if he determines on the basis of his triennial cbera report to congress see below reporting requirements the appropriateness of such action 4 as mentioned above these are defined in section 213bbf of the cbera as footwear ineligible for dutyfree status under the gsp tuna in airtight containers petroleum or petroleum products watches and watch parts containing material produced in nonmfn country and articles subject to reduced rather than zero duty rates handbags luggage flat goods work gloves and leather wearing apparel ineligible for gsp dutyfree treatment duty rates on such articles have been reduced by 20 but more than 25 ad valorem below those applied on december 31 1991 5 this provision authorizes dutyfree importation of any article except textile or apparel article or petroleum or petroleum product assembled or processed in cbera beneficiary country wholly from usproduced components materials or ingredients and imported directly from the country of manufacture crs6 2 hr 1834 and s 1389 authorize the president under similar notification conditions as above to 1 withdraw or suspend any countrys designation as beneficiary of the parity preference or 2 withdraw suspend modify or limit the parity preference with respect to any article of any country if he determines such action appropriate upon an evaluation of the criteria for the designation of beneficiary country it also requires the president to modify withdraw suspend etc countrys eligibility for the basic cbera preference in the same manner in which he modifies withdraws suspends etc the countrys eligibility for the gsp for failure to comply with one or more eligibility criteria common to both programs customs procedures including the requirement for certificates of origin for imports under all four proposals are identical and must be similar in all material respects to the procedures applicable to imports under the nafta an articles qualification for parity preferential treatment is indeed contingent on presidential determination that the beneficiary country from which it is exported andor in which materials used in its production originate or undergo production follows or is making substantial progress toward implementing the relevant customs procedures of the nafta all proposals contain reporting requirements of varying frequency and scope 1 hr 984 requires onetime report based on us customs service study on the cooperation of other countries concerning circumvention transshipment to be submitted by the us trade representative to congress by october 1 1999 2 periodic reports by
