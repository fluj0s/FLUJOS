from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd re even more on loehles 2000 year climate analysis date wed 05 dec 2007 113740 0500 replyto mannpsuedu well put phil i think youve put your finger right on it jgratmospheres has been publishing some truly awful papers lately we responded gavin james annan to the awful schwartz sensitivity estimate paper but there are so many other bad papers that are appearing there chylak etc that its just impossible to respond to them all i hadnt seen this latest one though mckitrick and michaels team up again wow maybe mckitrick has figured ou the difference between radians and degrees this time talk to you later mike phil jones wrote mike also i see him writing things then people saying you should write this up for paper as though it can be knocked up in an afternoon he realises he cant do this as it takes much longer then we wastes more and more time opening up new threads he doesnt seem clever enough to realise this gavin and rasmus have seen the attached piece of garbage uah is correct therefore the land surface must be wrong lets adjust it for dodgy reason ah it now agrees with uah lets forget that the land now disagrees with the ocean surface if only id thought of that first i could have not bothered with the awful analysis if only id just believed rss in the first place cheers phil at 1516 05122007 you wrote hi phil thanksthats good re loehle mcintyre funnyw each awful paper ee publishes mcintyre realizes that it compromises the integrity of his own work even further he cant distance himself from ee much as hed like to he also seems to be losing lots of credibility now w all but his most loyal followers which is good to see mike phil jones wrote mike yes the 1990 graphic is in an appendix the last few are being regularly hassled by thorsten the guy from epri larry really wants something submitted soon so working here to get something in by end of jan keith is going to get it fasttracked through the holocene well thats the plan the loehle paper is awful as you know so is another article on the ipcc process in ee i did look at climate audit week or two back i got the impression that mcintyre is trying to distance himself from some of these ee articles by saying we have to be equally skeptical about them as well cheers phil at 1400 04122007 you wrote hey phil thanksnice coincidence in timing so the 1990 graphic will be discussed in this review paper right perfect ill let gavin know will look into the agu fellowship situation asap i dont read ee gives indigestioni dont even consider it peerreviewed science and in my view we should treat it that way ie dont cite and if journalists ask us about paper simply explain its not peerreviewed science and sonja bc the editor has even admitted to an antikyoto agenda i do hope that weichyung pursues legal action here so didnt see this recent paper nor have i heard about the ijc paper christy and spencer continue to lose more and more scientific credibility with each awful paper they publish gavin is planning to do something on the loehle paper on realclimate im staying away from it i have revised set of hemispheric reconstructions which ill send you soon its basically what i showed at agu last year submitted to pnasmore soon on that mike phil jones wrote mike some text came last night from caspar keithtim writing their parts still i have text from francis so almost all here now still need to find some time maybe the christmasnew year break here to put it all together there is so much else going on here at the moment with other papers it will be hard to find some time i wish they had all responded much sooner as for agu just getting one of their fellowships would be fine i take it youve seen the attached in ee ive not heard any more from weichyung in the past couple of months im working on paper on urbanization i can show china is hardly affected will send for you to look over when i have it in form that is sendable would appreciate your thoughts on how i will have said things have another awful pdf of paper accepted in ijc it ws rejected by all three reviewers for grl it is by douglass christy singer et thus youll know what it is on have booked flights for tahiti in april just need to do the hotel now cheers phil cheers phil at 0207 04122007 you wrote hi phil i hope things are going well these days and that the recent round of attacks have died down seems like some time since ive heard from you please see below gavin was wondering if there is any update in status on this by the way still looking into nominating you for an agu award ive been told that the ewing medal wouldnt be the right one let know if you have any particular options youd like to investigate

jones and caspars investigation of the ipcc90 curve phil wanted us to hold off for some reason but is that done with thats great story that needs to be told gavin on mon 20071203 at 1424 michael mann wrote thanks eric thats great ive again copied in gavin so that he has this info too will keep you in the loop mike eric swanson wrote hi mike i do hope you all are able to put this all together there were several comments on ca about realclimate suggesting that rc wouldnt say anything as ee publication has such bad rap perhaps my biggest complaint was also one mentioned by another poster on ca i dont like using simple linear interpolation between data points for these series where there are many years between samples heres the other fellows comments 11 httpwwwclimateauditorgp2380comment162478 12 httpwwwclimateauditorgp2380comment162654 13 httpwwwclimateauditorgp2380comment162665 i would go further than that these data sets represent samples of time records the sampling does not produce value for single year rather each sample represents some number of years of the variable as averaged in the process of collecting the material to be analyzed consider an ocean sediment core such as keigwins data the subcores are sampled every 10 cm assume the material is taken with device that collects mud from 04 cm area along the core thus the sample would contain 410 of the material deposited at that 1 cm per sample rate of change in time if the agedepth model at that point yields 100 year per cm rate then the sample would represent an average over 40 years simple linear interpolation assumes continuously varying change between the points while the sampling process would give brief 40 year value with the other 60 years being unknown what if the entire cm of the core were analyzed one would not know unless one had contacted each research group that did the analysis and requested more information than that which might be found in the published reports note i looked at keigwins data when i wrote comment on loehles 2004 paper comments on climate change detection and attribution of trends from longterm geologic data by c loehle ecological modelling 171 4 2004 433450 ecological modelling 192 2006 314316 you may add my name to the list for what its worth best regards eric swanson at 0118 pm 12307 0500 you wrote ericthis is great thanks for all of the info ive taken the liberty of forwarding to gavin as were thinking of doing an rc post on this and this would be very useful we should certainly list you as coauthor on this if thats ok w you looking forward to hearing
