2 provision regarding removal and 3 consumer class action bill of rights it would control and restrict class action lawsuits by shifting some of the suits from state to federal courts this would be achieved by creating federal jurisdiction over class action suits when the total amount in dispute exceeds 5000000 and when any plaintiﬀ lives in state diﬀerent from that of any defendant the bill would treat certain mass actions with more than 100 plaintiﬀs as class actions for purposes of jurisdiction s 5 would require judges to review all settlements based on the issuance of coupons to plaintiﬀs and limit attorneys fees to the value of the coupon settlements actually received by class members it would also require careful scrutiny of net loss settlements in which class members ultimately lose money the legislation would ban settlements that award some class members larger recovery because they live closer to the court it would allow federal courts to maximize the beneﬁts of class action settlements among other things s 5 would also require that notice of proposed settlements be provided to the appropriate state and federal oﬃcials such as the state attorneys general it

action fairness act of 2005 article iii section 2 of the united states cons titution provides that when lawsuit involves citizens from di fferent states or foreigne r federal courts are given primary jurisdiction this provision was added for the purpose of limiting discrimination against outofstate litig ants however under the doctrine of complete diversity current judicial rules provide that as long as at least one defendant and one plaintiff in lawsuit ar from the same state they should proceed in that states court system even if th case involves millions of plaintiffs and is purely interstate or national in nature in addition even when complete diversity exists the amount in controversy must be minimum of 75000 per plaintiff consequently national class ac tions with plaintiffs from all 50 states and defendants from multiple states are rarely eligible for federal court jurisdiction it is generally agreed that class action lawsuits can facilitate the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties for these reasons the federal and state courts rules of civil procedure are designed to enable the litigants to proceed on class basis in appropriate cases in recent years there have been allegations of abuses in class action suits there are claims that some class action plaintiffs attorneys have abused the class action procedures there is distortion of the fede ralist system by the action of few state courts there is excessive compensation to attorneys at the expense of the injured plaintiffs these suits cr eate unprecedented costs to the national economy and they class action suits have cause d an overall decline in public respect for our nations judicial system or so business groups and other supporters contend1 consumer groups and the plai ntiffs bar associations such as the trial lawyers groups oppose the legislation they conte nd that it would unfairly help corporate defendants in class action suits by moving cases to federal court where damages awarded are generally smaller as result they argue that the legislation would be inconsistent with the principles of federalism and it would create clog in an already overburdened federal c ourt system thereby slowing the pace of certifying class action cases2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32761crs2 2 continued congress class action fairne ss acts of 2003 and 2004 at 910

class action fairness act of 2005 this section also states that it amends title 28 of the united states code section 2 findings and purposes of the act the act sets out congress findings describing in essentially these words the 1 circumstances in which class actions are valuable to our legal system 2 abuses of the class action process that have harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly adversely affect ed interstate comme rce and undermined public respect for our judicial system 3 the manner by which class members have been harmed by number of actions taken by plaintiffs lawyers which provide little or benefit to class members as whole including i plaintiffs lawyers receiving large fees while class members are left w ith coupons or other aw ards of little or value ii unjustified rewards made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members and iii confus ing published notices that prevent class members from being able to fully understand nd effectively exercise their rights 4 abuses in class actions which undermine the national judici system the free flow of interstatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32761crs3 commerce and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the united states constitution in that state nd local courts are i keeping cases of national importance out of federal court ii sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against outofstate defendants and iii making judgments that impose their view of the law on other stat and bind the rights of the residents of those states the acts stated purposes are to 1 ensure prompt and fair recovery of legitimate class action claims 2 reflect the purpose behind the constitutions diversity jurisdiction clause and 3 to encourage commercial innovation and consumerfriendly prices section 3 consumer class action bill of rights and improved procedures for interstate class actions s 5 would add five new sections to 28 usc which are intended to provide greater protections for class members in particular section 3 would add the following section 1711class action definitions 1 class actionthe term is defined to include any civil action filed in federal district court under rule 23 of the federa l rules of civil procedure as well as actions filed under si milar rules in state court that have been removed to federal court 2 class counselthe term is defined as the persons who serve as the attorneys for the class members in pr oposed or certified class action 3 class membersthe term is define d as the persons named or unnamed who fall within the definition of the propos ed or certified class in class action 4 plaintiff class actionthe term is defined as class action in which class members are plaintiffs 5 proposed settlementthe rm is defined as an ag reement regarding class action that is subject to court approval and that if approved would be binding on some or all class members section 1712judicial scrutiny of coupon and other noncash settlements this provision is aimed at certain pr oposed settlements of class actions in which the plaintiffs lawyer and the defendant work out settlement that provides class members with essentia lly valueless coupons while rewarding the lawyers with substantial attorneys fees to address this problem this section provides that judge may approve proposed settlement under which the class would receive noncash benefits or would otherwise be re quired to expend funds in order to obtain part or all of the proposed benefits only after hearing to determine whether and making written finding that the settlement is fair reasonable and adequate for class members in doing so the judge on the motion of any party may receive expert testimony as to the coupons valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32761crs4 9 28 usc 1332 see also zahn v international paper co 414 us 291 301 1973the supreme court decided that in class actions based on diversity of citizenship every single class member must satisfy the matter amount in controversy requirement of section 1332 it would require that attorneys fees be based either on the value of the coupons actually redeemed by class member s in contingent fee cases b on the hours reasonably billed in presenting the cl ass action or c on the value of the coupons redeemed and to the extent settle ment provides for equitable relief on reasonable hourly rate and to tal attorneys fees coupon calculations could not be based on unredeemed coupons although with court approval the value of unredeemed coupons could be distributed fo r charitable purposes specified in the settlement agreement section 1713protection against loss by class members this provision provides that judge may not approve class action settlement in which the class member will be required to pay attorneys fees that would result in net loss to class member unless the court determines in writing finding that the benefits to the class member substantially outweigh the monetary loss section 1714protection against discrimination based on geographic location this provision provides that settlement may not award some class members larger recovery than others solely because the favored members of the class are located closer to the courthouse in which the settle ment is filed section 1715 notifications to appropriate federal and state officials this provision requires defe ndants to notify the appropriate state and federal official of the particulars of any class action settlement and delays the effective date of the settlement until 90 days after they have done so the appropriate federal officials include the attorney general and in the case of financial institutions the federal regulatory authorities state officials entitled to notice include the authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over defendant in any state in which any member of the class resides should defe ndant fail to comply with the notification requirements any individual class member would be free to walk away from his obligations under the settlement agreement section 4 federal district court jurisdiction of interstate class actions article iii of the cons titution protects outofstate litigants against the prejudice of local courts by allowing fo r federal diversity jurisdiction when the plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of different states however under current law federal diversity jurisdiction for class action does not exist unless every member of the class is citizen of different state from every defendant and every member of the class is seeking damages in excess of 750009 this section would change the law by providing additional protection for outofstate litigants by creating minimalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32761crs5 10 hr 1115 in the 108th congress would have provided for the removal of class actions to federal court if less than onethird of the plai ntiffs are from the same state as the primary defendant and the suit involves more th an 500000000 s 2062 substantially broadened the two thirdsonethird analysis to elim inate consideration of defendants state or residence in determining whether to remo ve an action to federal district courtdiversity rule for class actions and by determining satisfac tion of the amountin controversy requirement by looking at the total amount of damages at stake under the proposal federal di strict courts receive orig inal jurisdiction over any class action in which the amount in contr oversy exclusive of interest and costs exceeds 5000000 and in which any member of class of plaintiffs is citizen of state different from any defendant b any member of class of plaintiffs is foreign state or citizen or subject of foreign state and any defendant is citizen of state or c any member of class of plaintiffs is citizen of state and any defendant is foreign state or citizen or subject of foreign state this rule holds true if less than onethird of the plainti ffs and the primary defendants come from the state where the suit is filed has applicati on if twothirds or more of the plaintiffs and primary defendant come from the state where the suit is filed and applies at the discretion of the federa l court if more than onethird but less than twothirds of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants come from the state where the suit is filed10 in the exercise of their discretion the federal courts must consider whether the claims asserted involve matters of national or interstate interest whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws of the state in which the action was originally filed in the case of class action originally filed in state court whether the class action has been pleaded in manner that seeks to avoid federal jurisdiction whether the action was brought in forum with distinct nexus with the class members the allege d harm or the defendants whether the number of citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed in ll proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other state and the citizenship of the other members of the proposed class is dispersed among substantial number of states whether 1 or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or othe r persons have been filed this section contains similar class action definition as section 3 defining class action as any civil action filed pur suant to rule 23 of the federal rules of civil procedure or similar state statute or rule it also deems to be class actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32761crs6 11 the house bill in the 108th congress deviated from the senate version with regards to two kinds of lawsuits that are not class actions 1 private attorney general cases brought by named plaintiff other than state attorney general and 2 nonclass action cases involving 100 or more plaintiffs known as mass tort cases 149 cong rec at h5295 hr 1115 would have imposed the new class action rules on both cases 12 see s 5 proposed 28 usc 1332d4 5 13 under hr 1115 any defendant named plainti ff or unnamed member of plaintiff class would have been able to seek removal at any time certain other types of civil actions 1 an action that asserts claims seeking monetary relief on behalf of 100 or more persons in which the claims involve common questions of law or fact and are to be jointly tried but not 2 an action on behalf of the general public pursuant to state statute11 again in order that actions lacking national implications remain in state court the minimal diversity rule does not apply in any action where twothirds or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed b the primary defendants are states state officials or other governmental entities against whom the district court may be foreclosed from ordering relief or c the number of members of all proposed plaintiff cla sses in the aggregate is less than 10012 section 5 removal of interstate class actions to federal district court under existing federal law civil actions filed in state court which might have been filed in federal court can be removed to fe deral court under some circumstances see 28 usc 1441 et seq section 5 would permit removal from state court of minimum diversity cases that section 4 would permit to have been filed originally in federal court it would allow class action lawsuits to be removed from state court to federal court by any defendant without the consent of any of the other defendants13 section 6 report on class action settlements this provision directs the judicial conference of the united states with the assistance of the director of the federal judicial center and the director of the administrative officer of the united states courts to report to the judiciary committees of the senate and house of representatives within 12 months of th enactment with recommendations on the best practices to further ensure fairness in class action settlements with regard to class members and attorneys fees which shoul d appropriately reflect the extent and success of the attorneys efforts section 7 enactment of judicial conference recommendations this section which

permitting defendants to remove most state class action suits to federal court the removal from state court to fede ral court would leave consumers shuttling back and forth between state and federal court because while consumers class could meet state law class certification requirements it could fail to meet the class certification requirements set forth in federal law the result they cont end
