served in the early years of the programs existence were usborn african americans or nonhispanic whites however recent study revealed that most 89 of students currently served are hispanic and increasingly foreignborn 3 the study also found that the number of limited eng lish proficiency lep participants has risen in recent years growing from 22 of mep participants in 19981999 to 31 in 20002001 the study also found that mep services ar concentrated at th elementary grade level 43 of mep participants were served in elementary grades 16 30 in secondary grades 712 19 in presc hool programs and the remaining 8 in ungraded or outofschool programs to put these proportions in the proper context one must also keep in mind that more th an half of the migrant student population does not complete high school4 ed data also reveal that migrant stude nts are more likely than other children of school age to come from families with w levels of educa tion househol ds with incomes below the poverty vel and to experience health problems including nutritional diseases and respiratory infections another ed study reports that the majority of migrant students receiving services through the mep were concentrated in five sending states california florida michigan texas and washington5 migrant families typically travel in three patterns of migration also known as mig rant streams th migrant streams include 1 texas and north through the cen tral plains region 2 california to the northwest and western stat and 3 florida and north along the east coast legislative history the mep has

population served while the latter has simply attempted to keep track of these elusive students the funding formula for the mep has remained largely unchanged over time however it received significant modification in the most recent reauthorization student eligibility criteria the major revisions to mep eligibility criteria have been the inclusion of additional migratory worker occupationa l groups wider age groups and broader geographic areas consideration of migratory students themselves as workers and restriction of the number of years of eligibility initially the mep was designed to serve the children of migratory agricultural workers the children of migratory fishers were added to the program in 19746 and children of agricultural dairy workers were added in 19887 the amendments of 1988 also expanded th eligible age range from the 5 to 17 group as defined in the initia l legislation to persons between 3 and 21 the 1966 provisions required that stude nts cross school district bounda ries to be classified as migratory the 1988 amendments expanded th is criterion to include 1 moving from one administrative area to another within state having si ngle school district applicable to hawaii and puerto rico and 2 living in school district of at least 15000 square miles and migrating at leas t 20 miles to temporary residence to engage in fishing activity applicable to alaska finally the 1988 amendments established the national commission on migrant education to study issues related to the education of migrant children8 in response to the commissions report the amendments of 1994 made two important changes to the mep9 first the definition of migratory child was extended to include unaccompanied minors who are themselves migrant workers or who are married to migrant worker as well as those under the legal guardianship of migrant worker second eligibility was restricted to those moving in the last three years where previ ously it was five years student records transfer to enumerate migrant students and m ove records between schools congress established the migrant student records transfer system msrts through the education amendments of 1974 prior to that time data from the department of labor were used to determine the number of eligible migratory children for purposes of calculating state allocations the 1994 amendments eliminated the use of the msrts because of its high cost and alleged ineffectivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31325crs4 10 migrant student locator demonstration project report on the findings from the migrantmobile school locato r demonstration project april 1998 available online httpwwwedgovofficesoesemepprelimguidelocatorhtml 11 additionally the nclba requires that sea report cards on pupil performance be disaggregated by number of student ch aracteristics including migrant status 12 although the definition of migratory student as was discussed earlier and the fraction of the ppe has evolved over time the basic formula has remained the same 13 the ppe used in the case of puerto rico differs slightlythe 1994 amendments also charged the ed with developing new system for counting and keeping track of migrant students to this end the migrant school locator demonstration project was established and pointed to the feasibility of using the internet to count migrant stude nts and locate student information10 compared to the msrts the locator project simply coordinates operations run at the state level this decentralized approach doe s not send actual educational records from one school system to another ra ther it helps seas and leas verify the correct student and contact information for the school in which the student had been previously enrolled by the 19971998 school year eight st ates were participating in the project further the 1994 amendments provided funds for improving this type of inter and intrastate coordination among educational agencies and ensuring the linkage of migrant student records systems across ag encies the ed awarded discretionary grants to seas leas institutions of high er education and othe r public and private nonprofit entities to support such agency coor dination in the child left behind act of 2001 nclba up to 10 million can be reserved for these and other coordination activities11 funding formula the nclba also modified th funding formula for the first time in many years since the programs inception the formul has been based on the product of each states share of migratory students and fraction of its perpup il expenditure ppe12 however good estimates of migratory st udent enrollment have been difficult to obtain thus even though the msrts was eliminated in 1994 current counts of migratory students partially rely on that years enrollment estimates the nclba amendments are intended to modify this practice after the fy2002 allocations each state is entitled to an amount equal to the number of migrant children multiplied by 40 of the average ppe in the state with the resulting amount not to be less than 32 and not greater than 48 of average ppe in the us13 beginning in fy2003 appropriations above the fy2002 level will be allocated based on the same formula but with different enrollment figures the hold harmless language is meant to mitigate any drastic redistribution that may occur as result the new enrollment estimates used af ter fy2002 simply end the practice of adjusting them to conform to the historic trend in seasonal patterns of mobility specifically the prefy2003 formula used data from msrts to adjusted estimates of the number of fulltime equi valent fte migratory child ren residing in each statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31325crs5 14 these fte estimates are based in part on s tatespecific factors that were developed from calendar year 1994 mrsts data and repr esent each states reported ftes as fractional proportion of the unique count of those children who generated ftes memorandum from ed director of the office of migrant education to state directors of migrant education 15 ed was also directed to velop funding mechanism that accurately reflects the cost factors involved in conducting different types of summer programs such as schoolbased versus homebased programs the focus on summer programs is due to the wide variation in the cost of these programs compared to schoolyear programs 16 the data source used for these state grant figures were taken from tables released by the budget office of the partment of educationduring the current school year as well as durin g the summer and intersession14 the amended formula for distributing appr opriations over the fy2002 level uses an unadjusted count of the number of migratory children residing in the state during the previous year plus the number receiving serv ices under the mep in summer or inter session during the previous year if funding is insufficient to pay in full the amounts for which all states are eligible the secretary may ratably reduce th amount allocated to each state in the case of states receiving grants of 1000000 or less the secretary will consult with the state agency to determine if consortium arrangement would be most beneficial to service delivery15 funding history table 1 shows the funding history for mep since fy1980 these figures indicate that funding for mep has genera lly and incrementally increased from year to year the distribution of mep appropria tions among the states has remained quite stable over time three states california texas and florida have traditionally received the majority of the funds availa ble for state distribu tion in fy1980 texas received 27 of these funds followed by ca lifornia at 22 and florida at 8 in fy2004 california received 33 of the f unds followed by texas at 15 and florida at 616httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31325crs6 table 1 esea title i migrant education program appropriations fy1980fy2006 fiscal year

national commission on migrant education congress ordered major evaluation of the mep through the esea amendments of 198817 this law established the national commission on migrant education to study issues related to the education of migrant children the commission released its re port in september of 199218 the highlights of the report focus on the changing population served by the program the difficulties faced by this population indicators of their academic achievement and suggestions for improving the program according to the study the migrant population has changed from be ing predominantly usborn children of agricultural workers following crops to predominantly immigrant population whose parents are or have recently been employed in agricultural work increasing numbers of new farmworkers are young immigrant males ma ny of whom are unaccompanied minors poverty lack of english proficiency parents and other family members with low educational attainment and isolation from the larger community all contribute to difficulties migrant children face in integr ating into the social mainstream and obtaining comparable edu cational opportunities as consequence of these challenges the dropout rate for students in the mep is estimated to be several times higher than the national average the commissions report concluded that while the mep has changed and expanded in scope since 1966 the students served by this program are often overlooked and further the program has been significantly underfunded the commission noted that appropriations in 1991 were only 33 of full funding of the formula in the legislation postcommission evaluations on the heels of the commission report westat inc under contract with the ed released report which provided br eakdown of mep partic ipation services and student achieveme nt data for 1992199319 more recent westat report was released that focused on summerterm projects and produced similar results mep participants were more
