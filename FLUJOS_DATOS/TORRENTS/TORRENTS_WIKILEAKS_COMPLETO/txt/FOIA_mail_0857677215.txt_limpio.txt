the project multimillenniallength dendroclimaticreconstructions at highlatitude regions of siberia 42 summary this research will make major contribution to our knowledge of highresolution climate variability at high latitudes of western and middle siberia throughout the holocene using the unique potential of treering data the specific objectives of this proposal are the development of two supralong each spanning 69000 years up to present continuous larch ringwidth chronologies at two distant each other highlatitude locations of siberia yamal and taimyr peninsulas ringwidth chronologies developed from coniferous trees growing at the polar timberline in siberia contain very strong climatic signal mainly summer air temperatures with these chronologies highresolution continuous and quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures will be made as in the areas of the past and present polar and upper timberlines trees megafossils have been preserved properly in large quantities in the holocene deposits alluvial lacustrine and peat there is good possibility to develop continuous multimillennial treering chronologies now the material already collected and measured 1800 subfossil wood samples from yamal and 280 samples from taimyr has yielded the ringwidth chronologies continuously spanning the last 3200 years yamal and 950 years taimyr however there are also many more samples that have been measured and have provided data now assembled in number of provisionally floating chronologies covering much of the period from 7000 to 1700 bc based on some 70 radiocarbon dates of samples of this wood there is fair chance that 69000year continuous chronologies will be constructed within the span of the proposed project these chronologies and temperature reconstructions will be the first to be so long reliable annuallyresolved and preciselydated with known reliability across the whole of northern hemisphere these reconstructions will allow to compare and contrast the details of temperature changes at the moderatecontinental region of yamal peninsula with the continental region of taimyr peninsula and allow modern and predicted temperature patterns to be compared with variability patterns of preindustrial era participants of the proposed project are the wellknown institutions which are engaged in the field of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and have

make major contribution to our knoweledge of highresolution climate variability at high latitudes of western and middle siberia throughout the holocene using the unique potential of treering data the specific objectives of this proposal are as follows to develop two supralong each spanning 69000 years up to present continuous ringwidth larch chronologies at two highlatitude locations of siberia using these treering chronologies tomake multimillennial highresolution continuous and quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures to analyse spatiotemporal patterns of temperature variability at these locations over range of timescales annual decadal multidecadal and centennial and their connections with various forcing factors and other annual resolution records being developed elsewhere in the arctic and subarctic 33 background reconstruction and analysis of natural climatic changes through the whole holocene at high latitudes are of great importance as climatic conditions especially air temperature are most variable and sensitive to various forcing functions budyko 1980 jones and kelly 1983 intergovernmental panel on climate change 1990 however there are minute quantity of long preciselydated and highresolution proxy climatic series for these regions the territory of yamal peninsula located on the eastern boundary of influence of the atlantic air masses and the territory of the eastern part of taimyr peninsula located between the arctic high and siberian high are of major importance for monitoring regional and globalmean air temperatures and assessing theories and models concerned with past current and future climate changes lamb 1977 briffa and jones 1993 moses et 1987 tree rings as proxy indicator of the past climatic conditions are of special interest as they allow to reconstruct climatic parameters with seasonal and annual resolution for many hundred and thousand years to provide an exact absolute and relative dating of the treering data to establish highfrequency climate changes from interannual to centennial timescales with high confidence to obtain dendroclimatic information practically for every site where trees grow at present or grew in the past intensive dendroclimatic investigations are carrying out in many countries and regions mainly in temperate and subtropic zones fritts 1976 1991 at high latitudes such works began later during the last two decades and living trees were used primarily for developing treering chronologies of 200500 years long aniol and eckstein 1984 shiyatov 1984 1986 jacoby and darrigo 1989 schweingruber briffa

megafossils have been preserved properly in large quantities on the surface and in the holocene deposits alluvial lacustrine and peat there is possibility to develop continuous multimillennium and

schweingruber and briffa in press and in the lower indigirka river at present now the longest continuous and absolutedated ringwidth chronologies developed for the yamal peninsula spanning 3200 years and for the northern scandinavia spanning 2160 years and the floating chronologies dated by the radiocarbon method extended back 9500 and over 7000 years respectively ringwidth chronologies developed from coniferous trees growing at the polar timberline in moderatecontinental and continental regions of siberia contain very strong climatic signal mainly summer air temperatures of tree growth year graybill and shiyatov 1992 briffa jones schweingruber shiyatov and cook 1995 hantemirov 1995 vaganov shiyatov and mazepa 1996the explained variance over the calibration and verification periods is highest reported in the literature to date 6570 and it allows to make quantitative reconstructions of summer temperatures these chronologies and temperature reconstructions will be the first to be so long reliable annuallyresolved and preciselydated with known reliability across the whole of northern hemisphere these reconstructions will allow to compare and contrast the details of temperature changes at the moderatecontinental region of yamal peninsula with the continental region of taimyr peninsula and allow modern and predicted temperature patterns to be compared with variability patterns of preindustrial era participants of the proposed project are the wellknown institutions which are engaged in the field of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and have collaborated with each other during the last 6 years the group of treering and site of the swiss federal institute for forest snow and landscape research birmensdorf switzerland the group is currently engaged on major programme of densitometric and ringwidth chronology development involving many sites across the whole of the northern hemisphere including sites with living trees in the polar timberline area of russia this work is specifically designed to provide climaticallysensitive data for use in large spatial climate reconstruction work dr fhschweingruber head of the group is known throughout the world for his work in wood anatomy and dendrochronology and the development of treering densitometry he has published extensively in different areas of wood anatomy and treegrowth research and has authored several classic books the laboratory of dendrochronology of the institute of plant and animal ecology of the russian academy of sciences ekaterinburg russia is one of the leading laboratory in the field of dendrochronology in russia the laboratory has an international reputation for its work on the developing ringwidth chronologies at high latitudes and altitudes reconstruction of climatic conditions developing longterm chronologies studying cycles in treering series using treering data for studies of the upper and polar timberlines dynamics and forest succession dr sgshiyatov head of the laboratory is one of the pioneers of dendrochronology in russia and has worked for more than 30 years in the far north and mountains of the urals siberia far east and middle asia he has published more than 130 articles and three monographs dr shiyatov was the first who began to collect subfossil wood in russia for developing longterm chronologies the laboratory of dendrochronology of the institute of forest of the russian academy of sciences krasnoyarsk russia is another leading laboratory in the field of dendrochronology in russia dr eavaganov director of the institute of forest and head of the laboratory of dendrochronology has an international reputation for his work on the cell structure of wood lyers of coniferous trees seasonal growth variations and cambium activity developing simulation models of seasonal tree growth developing ringwidth and cell chronologies reconstructing climatic conditions of the past using treering chronologies he has published more than 100 articles and 5 monographs the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia norwich great britain is one of the worlds leading research organisation specialising in the study of climate change climate history current climates projected changes and impacts dr krbriffa senior research associate at the climatic research unit has considerable experience in climatology and with the use of statistical methods of climate analyses and dendroclimatic reconstruction especially with regard to largespatialscale reconstructions of climate patterns and published many articles on the theoretical and practical aspects of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and on use of paleoclimate data for understanding current and possible future climates 34 scientific and technical description 341 research activities treering data will be obtained from living trees and subfossil wood of siberian larch larix sibirica ledeb in western siberia and gmelini larch larix gmelini pilger in central siberia the first location is situated in the southern part of yamal peninsula 67688n 69718e the second location in the eastern part of taimyr peninsula 71738n 981058e there is great many properly preserved subfossil wood in the holocene deposits at both locations mainly in the alluvial and peat deposits the main variable measured will be ring width this variable reflects properly climate influences on tree growth at the polar timberline areas of siberia having continental climate ringwidth chronologies for the last 400500 years will be developed from the oldest living trees extensions to these chronologies back further in time will be made by using subfossil material joined with the living material by standard crossdating procedures highprecision radiocarbon dates will be used for rough dating of floating treering chronologies the sampling subfossil wood and development of the yamals supralong chronology began since 1982 by the workers of the laboratory of dendrochronology ekaterinburg most intensively this work was carried out during the last five years now the material already collected and measured 1800 subfossil wood cuts has yielded the ringwidth chronology continuously spanning the last 3200 years however there are also many more samples that have been measured and have provided data now assembled in number of provisionally floating chronologies covering much of the period from 7000 to 1700 bc based on some 45 radiocarbon dates of samples of this wood these chronologies separated by 50 to 500 year length gaps there is fair chance that 9000year continuous chronology will be constructed for this location within the span of the proposed project similarly work with shorter history than the yamals research has clearly established potential to build chronology at least as long in the taimyr peninsula where the modern polar timberline extends to about 72830n most northern over the world this work is not so advanced as in yamal but the work to date suggests that very rapid progress is likely samples from living and dead trees have already been assembled at the laboratory of dendrochronology krasnoyarsk into the 950year continuous chronology the collections from this location are not so extensive as those made to date at yamal 280 subfossil wood samples but there is an abundant supply of subfossil trees many with over 300 annual rings 25 radiocarbon dates of samples of this material suggest major phases of tree growth around 8500 bp and 5000 bp the general distribution of the radiocarbon dates suggests that eventually sufficient trees can probably be located to span the whole of the last 10000 years it is not expected that continuous 10000year ringwidth chronology will be produced within timeframe of this project however there are good prospects of producing 56000 year chronology to the present 342 research results during three years we expect to develop the continuous and goodreplicated treering 9000year larch chronology for the yamal peninsula and the 56000year larch chronology for the taimyr peninsula using these chronologies we intend to reconstruct and analyse summer temperature variation at several time scales annual decadal multidecadal and centennial and compare the data obtained with other highresolution holocenelength proxy data ice cores laminated sediments historical documents the results of this project will be published primarily in the scientific literature in russian and english and presented at different national and international conferences because of the fundamental interdisciplinarity and collaborative interaction within the subgroups number of multiauthored papers will be produced the individual and mean ringwidth chronologies and the reconstructions produced will be distributed to the international scientific community through submission to the international treering data bank boulder colorado usa and to other national and international institutions and data centres 35 management information 351 task division dr fhschweingruber swiss federal institute for forest snow and landscape research will be the project coordinator on the proposed project from

highlatitude locations yamal and taimyr peninsulas using helicopters boats and ships to finish the development of the yamal chronology it is necessary to collect additionally less than 300400 cuts of subfossil wood much more intensive collecting 600800 cuts for two field seasons is needed to develop the taimyr chronology all samples collected during these two years and earlier will be measured and crossdated at ekaterinburg and krasnoyarsk laboratories until the middle of 1999 the russian laboratories together with the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia during 19971999 will be analysing the material obtained standardization of individual series development of mean chronologies studying growthclimate relationships developing statistical models of tree growth extracting
