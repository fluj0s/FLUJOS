bridge publications inc newsletter date high certainty level on techniques but do you know you could take the finest processes in the world and if they are not understoodtheyre not understoodyou have diminishment of their value and use more important than this if the person who is using them does not have subjective reality upon their usefulness you might as well let him stand there and throw ham omelets at the preclear you got it takes subjective reality and then it takes an objective reality and it takes both realities and when person has both of those realities theres stopping him you can take poor technique on which an auditor has high certainty and good technique on which he has low certainty and give him the two to audit on preclear and the techniques reverse in their value the one that he has good reality on works on the preclear well and the one he has reality on even though its better technique works more woodenly thats quite remarkable so it takes both of these things then doesnt it l ron hubbard excerpted from the power of simplicity lectures the original mockup of the body an article by l ron hubbard from the power of simplicity lectures im going to let you in on something its horrible if you havent already established this fact the human body at one time or another was mocked up to persist through an evolutionary cycle and it did that but what did it consist of of what did the human body consist at the moment of its mockup it wasnt necessarily small it wasnt necessarily big it was mocked up to do cycle and its still doing it well ill let you in on something it had lungs it had stomach it had intestine it had bones didnt have any cells it just worked and then helpful little thetans coming along started to invent things for it as an example of this we read in the vedic many of the four vedic books we read along there and we find theres rather uniform agreement that at certain stage people all went to the devil everybody went to the devil and theyve been there ever since and going further to the devil and they got so bad it says in these ancient books that they began to eat it got so bad that they began to eat now thats pretty bad see they evidently considered that was horrible now how do you get all this genetic blueprint what is the genetic blueprint actually it is an additive history of various types of forms which didnt succeed which had to go someplace so they got installed by fac ones the evolutionary track is apparently swindle because the mechanism of it can be run out and the fellow suddenly winds up with evolutionary track but you didnt erase the evolutionary track you erased the machinery which created one the body was evidently originally very simple thing one of these days we might get up to point where you can mock up visible body we have techniques that go there right away by the way quite fascinating the experimental evidence back of this howeverive only mocked up shimmer ive only had preclear up to mocking up shimmer in the middle of the room that somebody else then entering the room saw this shimmer in the center of the room thats as far as weve gone l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture

high certainty level on techniques the original mockup of the body the power of simplicity lectures the power of simplicity once upon time there was little thetan and he was happy little thetan and the world was simple thing it was all very very simple and then one day somebody told him he was simple and ever since that time hes been trying to prove that he is not l ron hubbard thetan in his native state is utterly simpleand powerful but colliding with the seemingly endless and intricate complexities of living in the mest universe being can find himself unable to hold position unable to perceive unable to duplicate or act as well as he knows he truly can in this series ron covers in detail the factors of simplicity and complexity relating them to such scientology fundamentals as
