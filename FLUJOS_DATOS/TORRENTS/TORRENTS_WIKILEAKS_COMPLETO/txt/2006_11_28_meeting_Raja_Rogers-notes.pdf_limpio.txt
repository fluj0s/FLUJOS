raja rogers domain of atlanta recertified governors meeting november 28 2006 pandit housing raja rogers said we are building new building s about 30 each little sthapatyaved house will have 4 pandits so that is enough for 120 we have on order 120 units which will give us 480 there are trailers in hope arkansas we are trying to get the government to release the government could not use the trailers for katrina trailers cannot be put in low areas that may flood our dear jefferson who helps raja wynne and bevan and raja rogers who was in india with us jefferson was years ago with fema and he with others instigated the rule that you could not put trailers in low lying areas that may flood so now there are 10000 trailers at hope airport and they have been there for 2 years right after katrina and they are slowly starting to deteriorate but the government still wont release them raja wynne called up on behalf of maharishi vedic city and fema said it would take an act of congress for cities to use them and within week there was an act of congress to release them now we are hitting the administrative quagmire of government that slows down everything they have to pay 25000 month to the city of hope to store the trailers and thousands to build maintenance shop to take care of the 10000 empty trailers we are hoping to get inexpensive or even free trailers from fema so that is the report on the houses inspiring meditators to stay regular regine in st augustine we have couple going back for 3rd time don and sonja miller who have been hosting us they are in sthapatyaved house people who have been coming regularly say coming to group program prolongs the effects of the invincible america course and helps to maintain and stabilize those experiences i have been trying to make plans for the new year historically the best time of year to catch people to start the tm program or strengthen their meditation practice is after the new year becau holidays are over they have made new years resolutions and are starting new cycle over all years of teaching even doing refresher courses people get sucked back into the relative world when i went to fairfield i noticed profound silence that seems to be everywhere but even with taste of it the relative is so noisy it silences any silence they might have been feeling i have been thinking to do more of meditator support i have been thinking about it for quite while program easy to do from teaching stand point and for meditators to participate in when i call meditators for checking they might or might not come we do checking for ½ hour then spend ½ hour trying to figure out how they can fit in their 20 minutes i know that the most powerful groups for change are peer groups i was thinking to start meditating 2 and health and enlightenment club and as much as possible to have the group meet in person if that doesnt work an online group experience i was thinking to have regular check in the way we report super radiance daily or weekly and if they knew they were part of group they might find inspiration and accountability we might have an email that would come daily or weekly with an inspirational quote from maharishi or an ayurved tip nothing would be teaching so if the email should get further out it would be fine uplifting for anyone they would feel support and would transcend geographical boundaries people are finding comfort finding people of like mind that might give them support to keep them mediating has anybody being doing this should i submit outline for approval or to circulate among other recertified governors i was talking to ruth moses and she said she would be happy to help to put something together raja rogers that would be wonderful idea in old days we used to have advanced lectures every week maharishi had the idea long time ago something he called passport to perfect healt h this is in the same genre of thinking it would be wonderful if you and ruth could think about this and come up with ideas then we would start implementin g regine we can put together couple of points should i give it to charlie elaine or you raja rogers email it to all of us and we can circulate it is interesting because you can lead horse to water but you cant make it drink regine this isnt to crack hard cases this is for those who need hand stretched out to them we have for many years had advanced lecture series some people dont like group things but emailing has little more anonymity little more neutral than social evening just need daily or weekly reminder about meditating invincible america course is reenlivening raja rogers or news item it is wonderful you have the right idea you have hard cases that will go to water and wont drink the support is helpful we used to have atr where you would teach few months then go to atr the reason i brought that up is that stuart and joan rothenberg were here for 10 days and they called the night before they got on plane saying how wonderful it was to be here and how much they felt rejuvenated and enlivened i am sure they were looking bright and glowing very important to inspire people who cant be here full time it is good to enjoy and get batteries recharged who cant come permanently i remember how radiant we felt after atrs people come here and they are changed even though stuart and joan are very strong it never hurts to have boost i was just talking to dr hagelin we hit 1730 last night i dont have the numbers today so that is good sign and more people are still coming but it is very important to inspire everyone to come in our area because of this atr refresher effect they go back and people join local flying group and maintains liveliness and enlivens absolute longer so it doesnt fade so quickly it is also important because out of 1700 people we have flying here 100 are people 3 who are rotating through like joan and stuart which is important to keep numbers high for national coherence importance of staying on the self raja rogers in the last few days maharishi has been saying and bevan has been repeating how important it is to focus inward and how not to pay attention to everything that is happening and not to pay attention to gossiping and to really let the attention be inward even to point everythin g else is waste of time he is being very strong and we had the experience time and then we had the celebration time as things changed after the election and we are back to experiences on slightly different spin he is encouraging peopl to focus attention inward and not to be too drawn out into activity people have little taste then are drawn out and overshadowed by activity we have to be alert not to be overshadowed by the strong pull of maya in the relative all of this is very appropriate for the time and what maharishi is thinking so anything we can do to enliven people and help them to understand the value whatever the means then we do it inspiration of recertified governors return ing jane returning recertified governors will inspire the meditators they bring back the atmosphere of the course as regine has done in speaking to us tonight sue dudley called today and her influence fresh from the course was enlivening excuse not to attend the invincible americ course regine i had been hesitant to go on the course because it is so easy to get entangled dr hagelin ws so inspiring but what really got to go was jeff saying as newly recertified governor you should go it goes back to our peer group and inspires us to go on and on the importance of the company of the wise raja roger like i have said in several of our talks when we have had our chats one of the most important techniques for gettin g enlightened is being in the company of the wise and wise are those who are very devoted to enlightenment and this is from shankara crest jewel of discrimination that is exactly it we are helping each other we are not thinking about peer group pressure but support we all have moments when we need little boost maharishi has been kind to give us boost year after year he is setting up mecca where we have permanent place where we can be enlivened and come back out refreshed this is one of the spiritual teachings of the sankaracharya this is purpose of peace palaces and this is double effect because vastu homes generate huge positive influence we have two positive influences right away from our peace colonies being in company of the wise and living in vastu buldings someone came to my vastu today before i 4 went over to see dr hagelin this was the second person in two days and they immediately commented on how quiet settled profound the vastu was the vastu has tremendous effect plus they are occupied by people on pathless path you keep magnifying and compounding everything so maharishi has very good plan wonderful we are thinking how we can encourage and bring along those who are starting stepping on to technique they are the beginners maharishi said when new trees comes up they have to be protected and have fence around them when the tree is big strong oak there is need for protection self sufficient that applies to our new meditators older meditators each step of the way they are becoming stronger and stronger also when someone goes into higher state of consciousness the kavach needs to be there so it is principle in each step of evolution our responsibility as knowers of the knowledge is to help it is timely topic that has come up tonight vastu for meditators alcine i got call from someone who wants to build 3 bedroom house moving to gainesville and i dont think she is meditator raja rogers find out more information and call m did say he had idea that people should movement should own the houses and lease them on long term leases to people maharishi was asked why not own and he said not just anyone can have pure vastu house you need someo ne who can appreciate and understand what it is so it supports them as it is supposed to not to have people who are violating natural law so right now there is question whether plans are going to be readily available however that was couple of months ago that was thought and principle then once that principle is established maharishi comes back to the very practical aspect the practical aspect is many people would like to have their own home rather than lease somebody who is not meditator i will have to check more about that alcine something on the website plans what i can do is get her started in transendental meditation very important augment effect of vastu raja rogers tell her lot less expensive to start meditation and immediately have benefits john litman is the person you need to contact the wisest thing is to start meditation right away and immediately start having that benefit and next step would be vastu house consciousnessbased education in the schools legal question maryo we are in the process of establishing the tm program in this particular school carol has emphasized that there needs to be discretion and we dont want lot of news coming out carol was asked to go through security check she was asked if she was volunteer and what was her purpose raja rogers which school is this maryo this is high school that has major problem of drop out students teacher principal counselors are on board and we understand we also include 5 the parents but this is promising and success ful outcome of the luncheon they are ready to go that is why carol was called through security charlie we can take it through legal channels jane please let dr dillbeck and the cbe legal council and bobby roth know the outcome ray they asked if you are volunteer and she said yes as they caught her by surprise raja rogers what context did they ask the question ray whenever you enter school you have to have background check need clearance school wants to keep everything private carols instinct was to say yes rather than disrupt progress that was made jane i would like to reassure the recertified governors who will be conducting the school program that the david lynch foun dation is working to make sure that they will be compensated it is year long program with checking and knowledge meetings while the recertified governors are teaching they will not be able to do the other activities that bring in revenue this is an important point that the teachers will not be volunteering it is an under taking that will take considerable time and serious commitment you might explain that the program was introduced by the committee for stressfree schools community organization concerned about the stress in our schools that foundation will be funding the program and that you will be teaching and administering year long followup program raja rogers we need to understand the questi on we work for nonprofit educational organization which is promoting better schools and all our programs the foundation pays for the students take it to the legal team we have to understand the question if you are working for another organization to bring stress free schools it might be considered to be volunteer organization ray we are nonprofit organization implementing the programs of the stressfree schools organization alcine we are not paid by the school ray the school wants to keep it private they dont want everything disrupted 30 or 40 teachers on board plus principal and viceprincipal raja rogers great we keep it private we are working for foundation that is there to help and we wont be charging the school hard to answer question as not in context whatever you can find out and then run it by legal department maryo main thing is to have standard answer across the country so we can specify it in same way national call center raja rogers we opened the national call center on monday and so we have people taking calls when people call the learn tm number that is on the national website so the telephones are being answered ray they sent someone to your area today ray i didnt receive call i get everything through my answering people 6 raja rogers one of governors working telephones said she contacted someone in your area check on that and alert everyone they may get call from us and to know what it is that we are answering the telephone as maharishi wanted and we will be calling people to say you should call them in next 24 hours this will enliven the teaching when call goes to answering machine we loose 23 of people and maharishi picked up on this and was very strong about it since the first recertification course this is up and running in atlanta domain we have had few glitches and fielded unusual questions but our team is dealing with them nicely if there is big question they come to or someone who knows the answer be alert and respond as quickly as you can if we call that means it is fairly good lead if they call and are gabbing away unless it is obvious they want to learn tm we wont bother you in next few days we will be setting up ranking system with a1 top level lead and b lead not so enthusiastic alcine monday night i got call at 330 am and they said where can i learn tm near where i live they lived in gainesville i said what are you doing up at this hour they went away i failed i did answer it at 330 i thought maybe they were testing the system raja rogers the national call system only takes calls from the 800 learn tm number your local number is still on the webs ite they can still see the tm center number there email responses disappointing ruth moses we have been receiving emails through gulf port sylvia richards someone will email us for information then once we ask them for their telephone number we feel we need to be able to give them more information as we are asking them to drive up to baton rouge from new orleans i want to make sure people who take those calls at the call center know that email wont work the moment we ask more about them then they are gone raja rogers we try to get their email and their telephone number so you can call them back if they wont give us their telephon number we can only go with what we have i will try to find statistics about how many are giving us their telephone numbers the data is very valuable this is interesting information you give what do you ask them in their email ruth it is mostly people from new orleans they are probably still fearful and they are reaching out for relief from inside but they are not trusting to give out telephone number it is important that if they are going to drive out to baton rouge it is important that they know the course fee and that they have loan application we get an email with one or two sentencesplease tell where there will be lecture we email that it would be very good if we can speak with you to answer your questions raja rogers better not to ask for their telephone number say please feel free to call dont ask for the number 7 ruth probably so many scams police have told them not to give their telephone number alcine i also direct them to tm org and tell them how long the course is and give them the cost it is also on tm org and i tell them it is continuing program and there are student loans available jeff in lexington internet inquiries are very unreliable 90 will not come even if they made reservation it is the nature of internet it is not that personal contact i would do all these things it is very good idea to have your telephone number and invite them to call you and that national website number raja rogers people are more used to calling 800 numbers and it has certain legitimacyyou have to pay for the service good to always include tmorg site for more information alcine i tell them we are registered with the state raja rogers we dont have to be that defensive give them the site and the 800 number give them the choice to call us with our number also knowing you are dealing with specific audience and they explore on the internet and dont feel too obligated it is lower percent that show up debbie we have created folder of all people who have called whenever i have lecture planned i automatically invite them when they start i remove them from list sometimes they do respond after several weeks or months when i send information out i might add one of the magazine articles something inspiring or informative and i always include tmorg website one of reasons they dont come is price and distance they have to travel and so many other things are calling for their attention raja rogers what debbie has done is good idea now we should all get our rest maharishi is saying the focus on the cours is rest and flying jai guru dev
