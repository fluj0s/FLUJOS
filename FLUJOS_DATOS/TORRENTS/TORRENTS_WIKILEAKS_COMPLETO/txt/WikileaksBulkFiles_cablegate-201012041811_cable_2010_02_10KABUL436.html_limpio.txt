00000436 0012 of 002 classified by dambassador ricciardone reasons b and d 1 s summary president karzais chief of staff and former ambassador to iran omar daudzai offered the palaces outlook on irans role in afghanistan daudzai suggested that karzai could provide an open door for the united states to engage iran at such time as the us may judge this useful daudzai had found in iran that paradoxically the iranian people hate foreigners except for americans but that the iranian revolution survives on its animosity towards the united states he said that the iranians longer deny their support for the taliban while there is room for indirect usafghan cooperation on afghanistan daudzai cautioned that at best the iranians would only tolerate our presence in afghanistan end summary we can help open the door to iran 2 s at meeting within the giroa with cos daudzai damb ricciardone asked for afghanistans outlook on the anticoalition jundullah organization septel and karzais and daudzais assessments of afghanistans interests with iran daudzai confirmed february 2 that only he and president karzai had any substantial political engagement with the iranian government karzai does pay close attention to iran daudzai said and he suggested that karzai could help open door for the united states to engage iran perhaps after ahmadinejad leaves the scene or at any time the usg may judge useful he explained that karzai had maintained excellent relations with iran and khatami personally and that karzai had obtained the former iranian presidents support for daudzais appointment as afghan ambassador to tehran relations had become more complicated with ahmadinejads election daudzai went on to serve about year and half in tehran from 20042005 3 s damb ricciardone posited that while president obama and secretary clinton had made clear the united states willingness to discuss our differences with the iranians iran evidently is not ready to engage with us even though we believe that many iranians desire more normal relations with the united states the iranian government appears out of touch with its people in particular an increasingly angry middle class 4 s daudzai related that after the first and only time he was summoned to the mfa for complaint on alleged giroa support for jundullah septel and his categorical denial later proved true he developed excellent relations with iranian officials nonetheless living in tehran had been challenging at first iranian intelligence shadowed daudzais every move after he told the iranians that he was annoyed that he was being followed the iranians became more subtle in their approach he was astonished that while there were sunni mosques in tehran an estimated 30 to 40 percent of its population was sunni combining iranian and afghan sunnis residing there he established an informal mosque in the basement of the afghan embassy an act that drew much appreciation from the sunni population iranian people dislike foreigners except americans 5 s reflecting on his time in tehran daudzai said he had reached two main conclusions 1 common iranians hate foreigners except for americans whom they miss to illustrate he said that even his wifes doctor told her please tell the americans to bring their soldiers to our country next 2 paradoxically the iranian revolution lives on its animosity towards the united states if this animosity ends then the revolution will end the national leadership knows this and thus do all they can to sustain the revolution while daudzai did not foresee that the iranian revolution would end under ahmadinejads tenure he predicted that ahmadinejads influence over the remainder of his term would wane therefore he said it was opportune to now start preparing the ground for us relations with iran under better leader who would replace ahmadinejad even though the supreme leader really calls the shots daudzai said that irans real foreign minister is not motaki but rather ali akbar velayati who reports to the supreme leader the two sides of iranian influence in afghanistan 6 s daudzai said irans influence in afghanistan like kabul 00000436 0022 of 002 pakistans has been both helpful and hurtful last year daudzai had acknowledged that iran paid limited amounts of money to the palace only episodically and unpredictably he contrasted this with sustained us financial support to afghanistan with far more than the iranians occasional cash payment iran and pakistan each had supported their own favored afghan mujahedin groups against the soviets largely along religious affiliations likewise in the current conflict iran pakistan and saudi arabia were each supporting their preferred taliban groups this time however irans support was driven by war of objectives not religious sympathies iran would even support sunni taliban to counter western influence in afghanistan so long as the taliban factions they supported were not affiliated with mullah omar 7 s daudzai said that two years ago when he raised with the iranians their support for afghan taliban they had flatly denied any involvement however over the past half year the iranians including their ambassador in kabul longer deny this assertion now they remain silent he said daudzai attributed the iranian change in posture to their awareness that the giroa has evidence of iranian support for some taliban elements 8 s daudzai said that on occasion young afghan males are allowed to cross into iran where they are recruited and trained before returning to afghanistan to fight against the giroa and coalition forces the iranians also recruit afghan university students and graduates daudzai said that approximately 7000 afghans hold iranian university degrees including three of president karzais cabinet picks who fortunately parliament did not confirm he claimed that iran is also offering threeyear visas to afghans who deposit usd 100000 in an iranian bank account 9 s according to daudzai iran grooms thousands of afghan religious scholars after completing their education in iran they return to afghanistan to work in madrassas where they continue to receive support packages from iran the support package included monthly salary daudzai claimed that man named ibrahim directed this program from the supreme leaders office he also asserted that in addition to financing afghan religious leaders iran had provided salary support for some giroa deputy ministers and other officials including one or two even in the palace daudzai claimed that some of these officials had been relieved of their duties because you cant be an honest afghan if you receive iran package usiranian convergence of interests is complicated 10 s daudzai opined that there could be room for indirect but not direct cooperation between iran and the us regarding afghanistan iran at best would tolerate the us participation in an area of common interest here he said he would reflect further on the subject and would look forward to continuing the conversation eikenberry
