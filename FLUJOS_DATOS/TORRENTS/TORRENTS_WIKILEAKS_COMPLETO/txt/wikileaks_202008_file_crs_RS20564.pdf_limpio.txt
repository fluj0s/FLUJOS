the same case eliminating the only significant precedent supporting the farmers view of the payments several bills to exclude crp payments from self employment earnings have been introduced since the wuebker decision background the conservation reserve program became law in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 1231 et seq codified in 16 usc 3831 et seq the current version of the program extends through calendar year 2002 it permits the secretary of agriculture to enroll up to 364 million acres in conservation reserve program to assist farmers to conserve and improve the soil and water resources of their lands the program is implemented by entering into 10 to 15 year contracts with farmers under the contract the farmers agree to follow an approved conservation plan for converting lands normally devoted to agricultural production to less intensive use in exchange the department of agriculture usda shares the cost of carrying out the conservation plan provides technical assistance and pays an annual rental payment for converting highly erodible cropland to less intensive use the rental payments can be in cash or commodities according to the facts presented in wuebker v commissioner 205 f3d 897 6th cir 2000 the usda pays farmers approximately 18 billion each year under the crp httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20564crs2 the tax treatment of crp payments has been bone of contention between the irs and farmers there is disagreement that the payments should be included in income but the irs takes the position that if individuals are engaged in the trade or business of farming the crp payments are farm income which they must report on schedule f if the individuals are simply landlords they report the crp payments as farmrelated income on form 4835 this form is designed for land owners who rent their farms and who do not materially participate in the operation of the farm since the selfemployment tax rate is currently 153 farmers would like to follow the tax court opinion in wuebker v commissioner 110 tc 31 1998 reversed 205 f3d 897 6th cir 2000 which viewed the crp payments as rental income which is excluded from the definition of self employment income under irc 1402a1 irc 1402a defines net earnings from selfemployment as follows the term net earnings from selfemployment means the gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by such individual less the deductions allowed by this subtitle which are attributable to such trade or business except that in computing such gross income and deductions 1 there shall be excluded rentals from real estate and from personal property leased with the real estate including such rentals paid in crop shares together with the deductions attributable thereto except that the preceding provisions shall not apply to any income derived by the owner or tenant of land if such income is derived under an arrangement between the owner or tenant and another individual which provides that such other individual shall produce agricultural or horticultural commodities including livestock bees poultry and furbearing animals and wildlife on such land and that there shall be material participati on by the owner or tenant as determined without regard to any activities of an agent of such owner or tenant in the production of such agricultural or horticultural commodities and b there is material participation by the owner or tenant as determined without regard to any activities of an agent of such owner or tenant with respect to any such agricultural or horticultural commodity emphasis added when the exception was originally enacted it was intended to provide social security self employment coverage to sharefarmers and to landowners participating in the production so that they would have some sort of guaranteed retirement income when they were too old or too disabled to continue farming because large number of farmers would have been excluded from the social security provisions if they could not count their cropshare income as selfemployment income the exception language was added to the code in 1956 the senate report associated with the social security amendments of 1956 s rep 2133 84th cong 2d sess as reprinte d in vol 3 1956 us code cong admin news at 3877 38833884 indicates that the bill would remove any doubt as to whether sharefarmer was an employee or selfemployed person and that it would extend coverage to landownerfarmers who had income from working and who were at risk for the types of income loss against which the social security program was designed to protect according to rev rul 6032 19601 cb 23 which discussed payments made to farmers under an earlier acreage reserve programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20564crs3 acreage reserve and the costsharing and annual conservation reserve payments whether in cash or at the option of the producer in grain are in the nature of receipts from farm operations in that they replace income which producers could have expected to realize from the normal use of the land devoted to the program as such they are includible in gross income without analysis rev rul 6032 concludes payments and benefits attributable to the acreage reserve program are includible in determining the recipients net earnings from selfemployment if he operates his farm personally or through agents or employees this is also true if his farm is operated by others and he participates materially in the production of commodities or management of such production within the meaning of section 1402a1 of the selfemployment contributions act of 1954 as amended if he does not so operate or materially participate payments received are not to be included in determining net earnings from selfemployment rev rul 6032 did not address whether crp payments should be considered rental income according to the irs farm income and farm income substitutes such as crp payments are treated as farm self employment income if the recipient of the payments is farmer ie the recipient is in the trade or business of farming and materially participates if the recipient is retired farmer or if the recipient is strictly landlord the payments are not selfemployment income the irs analysis is that since the crp payments are received in the trade or business of farming they are automatically farmself employment income use of the materially participates language is somewhat confusing since it derives from the arrangement exception to the rental income rule wuebker v commissioner wuebker v commissioner 110 tc 31 1998 was the first case to explicitly find that crp payments were rental income and thus not subject to selfemployment tax in wuebker the special trial judge rejected the existing precedents and determined that crp payments were rental income which did not come within the arrangement exception and therefore the farmer did not have to pay selfemployment taxes on crp payments the special trial judge rejected rev rul 6032 as unpersu asive and rejected ray v commissioner tc memo 1996436 as precedent because the ray court did not address whether the crp payments qualified under the rental exclusion provisions of section 1402a1 the other cases dealing with this issue have not directly addressed the rental income exclusion from selfemployment taxes applies to crp payments while ray did not explicitly address the issue of whether the crp payments were rental income the ray court did note that the taxpayers had reported the payments as rental income the court said that taxability of the payments was not in question the only question was whether they were selfemployment income in ray the court followed revenue ruling 6032 and found that the crp payments were selfemployment income because of the nexus of the payments and the trade or business from which they are derived dugan v commissioner tc memo 1994578 set forth the irc 1402a1 analysis when the income was derived from sharecropping rental arrangement but the court did not apply the analysis to the crp payments since there was net loss on the crp payment land meaning selfemployment taxes would be due in hasbrouck v commissioner tc memo 1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20564crs4 249 which was suit for attorneys fees and costs and did not involve selfemployment taxes the facts showed the irs and the taxpayers switched their usual sides the irs maintained that the crp payments were not properly reported on schedule f but should have been treated as farm rental income because the irs did not believe the taxpayers were in the trade or business of farming the taxpayers claimed the crp payments were farm income because they wanted to deduct certain business expenses before the case went to trial the irs conceded the issue based on ray the tax court decision in wuebker is the only case in line of precedent dating back to 1960 to have found the payments excludible from selfemployment income taxes the tax court was reversed in 21 decision by the sixth circuit court of appeals on march 3 2000 wuebker v commissioner 205 f3d 897 the sixth circuits analysis was that the wuebkers were in the trade or business of farming and that the crp payments should be viewed as derived from the farming business the sixth circuit did not attach as much significance to the fact that the crp payments were termed rental payments by the statute as the tax court opinion did using the argument that substance should prevail over form the sixth circuit rejected the idea that the payments were rent because the department of agriculture was not paying to use or occupy the property the court acknowledged that the usda was restricting the uses that the farmer could make of the land but the court did not believe that such restrictions constituted use by the usda this analysis along with prior precedents convinced the majority that the tax courts decision should be reversed the dissenting judge believed that the wideranging limitations on the use of the land did constitute use by the usda legislative reaction since the sixth circuit reversed the tax court in wuebker several bills have been introduced in the 106th congress to overturn the wuebker decision hr 4064 s 2344 hr 4212 and s2422 4 the house bills are identical all the bills would amend the definition of net earnings from selfemployment in irc 1402a to exclude amounts received as payments under the crp program from such earnings the house bills would add new paragraph to the list of exclusions the senate bills would amend the existing paragraph dealing with rentals from real estate the house bills would also amend similar definition in section 211a of the social security act all the bills would apply to crp payments received before on or after the date of enactment the bills do not indicate whether the irs would be required to refund selfemploym ent taxes paid by farmers on crp payments prior to the date of enactment but presumably irc 6511 would authorize the irs to pay refunds claimed within three years of the time return was filed
