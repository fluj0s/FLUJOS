mac however is unclear the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an independent office within hud which oversees the safety and soundness of the gses has announced that it is disappointed that increasing the limit was not part of general regulatory reform and that the gses should subject the higher priced mortgages to rigorous new product development risk management and capital reserves requirements4 this suggests that hud might require the gses to submit their plan to purchase the larger mortgages for regulatory review5 unlike the gses fha part of hud is not under independent re gulatory authority given implementation delays and the limited lives of the programs it is not clear how much use the gses or fha would ma ke of their temporary authority as stockholderowned companies the gses woul d balance their fiduciary responsibility to earn profits with the requirements in thei r congressional charters to assist housing markets fha would probably consider th risk to the financial soundness of their insurance fund against temporary assist ance to parts of the housing market other factors tending to limit the impact of the increased mortgage

and sell the mbs to large investors the gses have announced restrictions on the mortgages that they will purchase under the temporary increase for example fannie mae and freddie mac will only purchase

finance reform act of 2007 on march 9 2007 the five cosponsors were from both parties senator schumer introduced s 2036 without cosponsors it was referred to the committee on banking housing and urban affairsunderserved areas goals hud estab lishes numeric goals based on the housing and community development act of 19928 and help fha compete against private sector lenders and possibly open homeownership to borrowers who fo r one reason or another could not qualify for conforming mortgage to purchase more expensive home the approach taken in hr 5140 to rais ing the conforming loan limit differs from that in hr 1427 federal housing finance reform act of 2007 wh ich passed the house on may 22 2007 and s 2036 the protecting acce ss to safe mortgages act which was introduced in the senate by senator charles schumer on september 10 20079 hr 1427 and s 2036 would increase the conformin g loan limit for fannie mae and freddie mac to the area median house price subject to maximum of 150 of the national limit in 2008 absent hr 5140 the national limit is 417000 making the highcost limit 625 500 hr 5140 has higher absolu maximum 729750 versus 6250 00 in 2008 is permanent instead of temporary and would increase the limit in areas where 125 of the median house price exceeds the current national limit of 417000 for example the most recent median existing home price data from the national association of realtors third quarter 2007 in barnstable massachusetts was 400600 the conforming loan limit under hr 5140 woul d increase to 500750 in barnstable
