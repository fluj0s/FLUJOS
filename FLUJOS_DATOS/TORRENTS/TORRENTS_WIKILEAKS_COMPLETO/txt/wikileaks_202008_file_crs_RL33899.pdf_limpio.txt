oﬀsets for these modiﬁcations including alterations to the amt and to the regular income tax these measures include higher rates under both the amt and the regular income tax reduction of preferentially treated items under the regular income tax and measures to reduce the tax gap many of the revenue oﬀsets examined are designed so that the burden of paying for amt modiﬁcations is borne by those taxpayers for whom the amt was originally intended ie taxpayers at the highest income levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899 order code rl33899 modifying the alternative minimum tax amt revenue costs and potential revenue offsets march 18 2008 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899modifying the alternat ive minimum tax amt revenue costs and potential revenue offsets summary congress enacted the precursor to the current individual alternative minimum tax amt in the tax reform act of 1969 to ensure that all taxpayers especially highincome taxpayers paid minimum of federal taxes initially the minimum tax applied to fewer than 20000 taxpayers in 2007 it applied to 42 million moreover absent legislative action the amt will aff ect significantly more middle to upper middleincome taxpayers by 2008 up to 26 million taxpayers are projected to be subject to the amt the amts expanded coverage will occur because temporary increases in the basic amt exemptions and provisions allowi ng taxpayers to apply certain tax credits against the amt have expired to keep the amt from affecting more taxpayers in the future would at minimum require 1 that the higher amt exemption levels be maintained and that they be indexed for inflation and 2 that all personal tax credits be allowed against the amt this patch is estimated to cost about 75 billion in its first full year if the recent reductions in the regular in come tax expire at the end of 2010 then the patch would cost 313 billion over the fy2009 through fy2013 period and 724 billion over fy2009 through fy2018 if the reduc tions in the regular income tax are extended past 2010 then the cost of the amt patch would have increased to 13 trillion dollars over the same 10year period repealing the amt would be even more expensive while offsetting the costs of amt relief may prove difficult several approaches are being discussed one approach woul d shift amt taxes from middleincome to highincome taxpayers by some combinati on of higher amt rates and taxing capital gains and dividends at the amt rates proponents argue that including capital gains preferences in the amt would be consis tent with the original purpose of the minimum tax in other proposals amt relief would be fi nanced by raising regular income tax rates for example raising the top three rates by 24 another approach might be to repeal or restrict some of the pr eference items under the regular income tax however income tax base broadening may be difficult because many of these provisions are both longstanding and popular another approach to financing amt relie f might be to focus on reducing the tax gap although the tax gap is estimated to be in the neighborhood of 300 billion the revenue yield from proposals to reduce the ga p appears to fall far short of the amount needed to address the amt this report will be updated to re flect legislative

current alternative minimum tax amt for individuals in the tax reform act of 1969 to ensure that all taxpayers especially highincome taxpayers paid at l east minimum amount of federal taxes1 initially the minimum tax applied to fewer than 20000 taxpayers however absent legislative action the amt will affect si gnificantly more middle to uppermiddle income taxpayers in the near future in 2007 about 42 million taxpayers were subject to the amt but by 2008 up to 26 milli on taxpayers would be subject to the amt without legislative action commonly referred to as the amt patch in december 2007 the latest one year extens ion of the patch was adopted without revenue offsets two main factors have caused the increase in the number of taxpayers affected by the amt first the regular income tax is indexed for inflation but the amt is not over time this failure to index has reduced the differences between regular income tax liabilities and amt liabilities at any given nominal income level differences that will continue to shrink in the absence of amt indexation second the 2001 and 2003 reductions in the regular income tax have further narrowed the differences between regular and amt tax liabilities2 because of these two factors many taxpayers will find that their regular income tax liability has been so reduced relative to their amt liability that even though they have few if any tax preferences they may still be subject to the amt an increase in the basic exemption for the amt and provisions allowing certain personal tax credits to offset amt liability have temporarily mitigated the increase in the coverage of the amt for 2007 the amt exemption was 66250 for joint returns and 44250 for unmarried taxpayers under current law the basic amt exemption is scheduled to revert to 45000 for joint returns and 35750 for unmarried taxpayers in 2008 in additi on starting in 2008 veral personal tax credits will not be allowed against the

continue to be allowed against the amt in full 4 see previous footnotethis report first reviews the cost of modifying the amt to reduce its coverage it then discusses range of potential revenue offsets for these modifications including alterations to the amt and to the regular income tax these measures include higher rates under both the amt nd the regular income tax reduction of preferentially treated items unde r the regular income tax and measures to reduce the tax gap many of the revenue offsets exa mined are designed so that the burden of paying for amt modifications is borne by those taxpayers for whom the amt was originally intended ie taxpayers at the highest income levels structure of the amt the amt operates as parallel tax system to the regular income tax under current law calculating amt tax liability requires taxpayers to first add back various tax items called adjustments and preferences to their regular taxable income the three major preference items added back to the amt tax base are personal exemptions state and local tax deducti ons and miscellaneous itemized deductions these three items account for over 90 of the total amt preference items and adjustments added back to regular taxa ble income for amt purposes other items subject to tax under the amt include net operating losses passi ve activity losses incentive stock options and pr ivate activity bond interest this grossedup income becomes the tax base for the amt for tax year 2007 basic exemption of 66250 for joint retu rns or 44350 for si ngle and head of household returns is subtracted to obtai n amt taxable income these exemption levels are temporary and are scheduled to revert in 2008 to their prior law levels of 45000 for joint returns and 35750 for unmarried taxpayers the basic amt exemption is phased out for taxpayers with high levels of amt income two tiered rate structure of 26 and 28 is assessed agains t amt taxable income the tax is 26 of amt taxable income up to 175000 and 28 of amt taxable income in excess of 175000 the taxpayer compares his amt tax liability to his regular tax liability and pays the greater of the two it is important to note that even thoug h taxpayer may not be subject to the amt it can still affect his regular income tax liability the reason is that after 2007 so personal tax credits under the regular income tax are limited to the amount by which regular income tax liability exceeds amt liability4 thus taxpayer who has regular income tax liability of 5000 and 1000 of these affected personal tax credits will effectively see these regular income tax credits reduced in value by 300 if his amt liability is 4300httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs3 revenue effects of modifying the amt the fact that the amt is poised to affect so many taxpayers in the near future has prompted calls for change absent legislative action the amt will take back much of the recently enacted reductions in the regular income tax for millions of taxpayers because personal exemptions are not allowed against the amt large families will be par ticularly susceptible to the amt in addition because deductions for statelocal taxes are not allowed against the amt taxpayers who itemize and deduct these taxes on their regular income tax returns are also more likely to be adversely affected by the amt howeve r modifications to reduce amt coverage would prove costly in rms of forgone revenue when discussing the longrun beyond 2010 revenue implications of modifying the amt it is critical to specify whether it is assumed that the 20012003 tax cuts are allowed to expire after 2010 as schedule d or whether it is assumed that the tax cuts will be extended beyond 2010 allowi ng the 2001 tax cuts to expire as scheduled will reduce the costs of modifying the amt extending the tax cuts beyond 2010 substantially increases the costs of modifying the amt if the 20012003 tax cuts are extended then as r ough estimate the cost of most options for modifying the amt would almost doubl the revenue effects of several modifications to the amt are shown in table 1 to keep the amt from affecting more taxpayers in the out years than it did in 2007 would at the least require maintainin g higher exemption levels and indexing the amt for inflation according to th congressional budget office cbo this option which is often referred to as patch and assumes llowing personal tax credits against the amt and indexi ng the basic exemption levels of 6625044350 along with the amt tax brackets for inflation after 2007 would reduce revenues by 75 billion in its first full year if the recent reductions in the regular income tax expire as scheduled at the end of 2010 then the patch will cost 313 billion over the pe riod fy2009 through fy2013 fiveyear cost and 724 billion over the fy2009 through fy2018 period 10year cost however if the reductions in the regular income tax are extended past 2010 then the cost of the amt patc h as outlined by cbo rises to 13 trillion dollars over the same 10year period if thes changes are debt financed not paid for by either raising other taxes or reducing expenditures then the cost of the patch rises significantly because of the higher net interest outlays repealing the amt is even more expens ive although the data here are not for exactly the same years the fiveyear cost of repeal could be around 408 billion the 10year cost of repeal could range from around 851 billion to 17 trillion depending on whether the reductions in the re gular income tax are extended past their 2010 expiration again if the repeal was debt financed the cost of debt servicing would engender considerably more cost the additional policy options outlined in table 1 would be less expensive than the patch or outright repeal of the am t but these options would mean more taxpayers would fall under the amt in th future than in 2007 these estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs4 predated the enactment of the patch

them and this dichotomy will grow over time as shown in table 2 only 31 of taxpayers in the highest income class were subject to the amt in 2006 or 2007 table 2 percentage of taxfilers with amt

tax policy center amt participation rate by individual characteristics jan 29 2008 even if the basic amt exemption reverts to its lower priorlaw levels and certain credits are longer allowed against the amt coverage in the highest income class will only be 39 2010 on the other hand there will be signif icant expansion of amt coverage for taxpayers with cash income in the 50000 to 1 000000 range if the basic amt exemption reverts to its lower priorlaw levels and certain credits are not allowed against the amt for example in 2006 48 of taxpayers with income in the 100000 to 200000 range were subject to the amt by 2010 over 80 of taxpayers in that income range will be subject to the amt there are several reasons why highincome taxpayers will be less affected by the amt in the future than their lowerincome counterparts first the marginal tax rates highi ncome taxpayers face under the regular income tax tend to be higher than the marginal tax rates they face under the amt under the regular income tax the top two marginal income tax rates are 33 and 35 the top rate under the amt is 28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs6 second under the regular income tax pe rsonal exemptions are phased out for highincome taxpayers so the fact that personal exemptions are not allowed under the amt does not have significant effect on highincome taxpayers who do not get personal exemptions under the regular income tax third under current law the basic amt exemption is phased out for taxpayers filing joint returns when amt taxable income exceeds 150000 for joint returns in 2008 the basic amt exemption is fully phased out at amt taxable income levels in excess of 330 000 hence many highincome taxpayers do not get basic exemption under the amt therefore th scheduled reduction in the basic amt exemption will have little or effect on their amt liabilities finally highincome taxpayers like their lowerincome counterparts generally derive significant percentage of their total income from capital gains and dividend income these items receive pr eferential tax treatment under the amt as well as the regular income tax under both the tax rate on longterm capital gains and dividend income is limited to maximum rate of 15 income from dividends and capital gains is an important source of income at high income levels table 3 below shows the share of in come in interest dividends and capital gains by income class for example in the highest adjusted gross income class over 1 million on average 303 of income is from capital gains and 4 is from dividends currently taxed at 15 in contrast taxpayers in the 75000 to 100000 agi range derive 11 and 08 of their income from capital gains and dividends respectively table 3 interest dividends and capital gains by adjusted gross income

justice progressive solution to the amt problem december 2006 at http wwwctjorgpotential cost offsets for amt modification there are many ways that the amt could be changed to mitigate its impact in future years this report concentrates on the two most widely discussed alternatives shortterm patch to the amt or outright rep eal of the amt this section discusses what revenue offsets would be needed to pay for these two solutions to the amt problem the revenue offsets are grouped into four main categories offsets derived from 1 changes to the structure of the amt 2 changes to the individual income tax rate structure 3 income tax base broa dening and 4 reducing the tax gap offsetting amt revisions with changes to the structure of the amt one approach to dealing with the expa nding scope of the amt would shift the amt tax burden away from taxpayers with agis in the 50000 to 500000 range and towards higherincome taxpayers this approach appeals to some because it helps restore the amt to its original purpos ensuring that highincome taxpayers pay what many argue is their fair share of the federal tax burden revisions within the amt could take many forms but three revisions are of special interest amt tax rates could be increased or dividends and capital gains income could be included in the amt tax base at regular amt tax rates or both either increases in the amt tax rates or combination of increases in amt tax rates and subjecting capital gains and dividend income to full amt tax rates could raise enough revenue to offset th costs of an amt patch increasing the top rate of the amt is one option for shifting the burden of the amt to higherincome taxpayers fo r example in paper written in 2002 researchers at the urbanbrookings tax policy center tpc proposed revenue neutral amt revision that included incr easing the basic amt exemption lowering the income level at which the amt rate increases eliminating the phaseout of the amt exemption and raising the top amt tax rate to 355 the citizens for tax justice ctj recen tly presented proposal to tax capital gains and dividend income at ordinary amt tax rates rather than the lower dividend and capital gains rates applicable under the regular income tax6 according to the ctj analysis such change would pay fo r 87 of the cost of the amt exemption increase making the higher exemption levels permanent and indexing them for the next four years they also calculate that including capital gains and dividends in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs8 7 leonard burman william g gale gregory leiserson and jeffrey rohaly options to fix the amt tax policy center january 19 2007 available at httpwwwtaxpolicycenterorghome this study examines variety of revisions to the amt that would be revenue neutral over nyear budget horizon however the baseline for their estimates is current law which assu mes that the reductions in the regular income tax expire after 2010 if the tax cuts are extended either in part or in total then these options to reform the amt would not be revenue neutral amt combined with an increase in the top amt tax rate to 29 would make the proposal revenue neutral ctj argues that this change would restore the amt to its original purpose the principal target and most critical preference in the initial minimum tax was the capital gains preference more recent study by researchers at the tpc discusses variety of revenue neutral revisions over the tenyear budget horizon fy2007fy2016 that would shift the burden of the amt to higherincome taxpayers7 these revisions were made prior to the enactment of the amt patch and were for earlier years the cost of patching the amt tends to rise as we m ove through time because each year is closer to the expiration of the 2001 tax rates th options are still relevant as ways of addressing the amt problem one proposal for an amt patch which is very similar to the ctj approach would be paid for by including capital gains and dividend income under the amt and subjecting them to amt tax rates combined with 3 increase in the amt tax rates to 268 nd 289 this option would more than pay for itself over the next four years according to tpc projections however the ctj and tpc estimates assume capital gains realizations are fixed if realizations decline in response to these tax increases then other measures would be needed to make up the revenue ss both studies acknowledge this issue although ctj argues that capital gains rea lization responses are small with realization response including capital gain s as preference item in the amt will not raise as much revenue as these two estimates indicate the joint committee on taxation jct takes an expected decline in realizations into account in its estimates of the revenue effects of changing tax rates on capital income based on the jct estimate of the effect of the tax rate ch anges on realizations in the late 1980s only about 43 of the static gain from incr easing the tax rate on capital gains and dividend income would actually be realized recent evidence suggests the realization response would be such that up to 80 of the static change in revenue would be realized this issue is disc ussed in more deta il in the appendix it is worth reiterating that in large part congress enacted the first minimum tax largely to recapture the capital gains in come that was excluded under the regular income tax in 1969 50 of longterm capital gain was exempt from tax under the regular income tax the longterm capita l gain income that escaped tax under the regular income tax was included as pr eference item under the original minimum tax and subjected to minimum tax rates pr ior to 1969 many highincome taxpayers used the preferential tax rates on capital gains income to reduce their federal incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs9 8 us congress joint committee on internal revenue taxation general explanation of the tax reform act of 1969 december 3 1970 p 105 it is worth noting that after 1986 when the preferential tax treatment of capital gains income was repealed under the regular income tax the number of taxpayers subject to the amt fell from around 60000 in 1986 to around 11000 by 1989 9 this proposal is reviewed in crs report rl34249 the tax reform and reduction act of 2007 an overview by jane g gravelle tax liabilities to levels that congress deemed inappropr iate for their levels of economic income8 offsetting amt revisions with individual income tax rate increases another option to pay for amt revisions is raising the individual income tax rates in tax reform proposal intr oduced by ways and means committee chairman rangel hr 3970 prior to enactment of the 2007 patch the amt was repealed and the revenue offset by 4 surtax on adjusted gross income over 200000 and 46 surtax on adjusted gross income over 5000009 this additional tax would be applied not to taxable income but to adjusted gross income larger base the tpc study discussed above contains variety of scenarios where rates are increased to pay for the amt revisions for instance increasing the top three individual income tax rates by 24 over the next four years would offset the cost of repealing the amt this would require raising the top three rates from 28 33 and 35 to 348 41 and 435 respectively to pay for the amt patch the tpc estimates that the top income tax rates would have to be increased by 2 from 28 33 and 35 to 286 337 and 358 in addition this option would requi re taxing dividends and capital gains income at regular amt tax rates over the first few years this option actually increases total revenues by about 28 billion according to tpc projections note that these options do not account for any cap ital gains realization responses and these projections were made prior to the enac tment of the amt pa tch for 2007 and relate to earlier years offsetting amt revisions with income tax base broadening it is possible to pay for repeal or patch to the amt through income tax base broadening there are many provisions in the income tax law that narrow the tax base compared to tax base that approximates economic income but many of these tax benefits are both popular and long established the amt patch for 2007 was not paid for by revenue offsets however there were bills passed in the house that would have paid for the patch hr 3996 which also included provisions that might be considered base br oadening to pay for the oneyear 2007 amt patch and extending some other expiring provisions the revenue raising provisions included two individual tax provi sions relating tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs10 10 for discussion see crs report rs22717 taxation of private equity and hedge fund partnerships characterization

total to be allocated between foreign and domestic income for purposes of the foreign tax cred it each of these three provisions raised around 25 billion over ten years since th provisions revenue gain over ten years would only offset the amt patch for about year they would not be adequate to finance permanent changes there are several legislative proposal s that would use more general base broadening to offset amt reforms senator ron wyden nd representative rahm emmanuel introduced legislation s 1927 and hr 5176 in the 109th congress that would have repealed the amt and provi ded for overall tax re form and senator wyden introduced similar bill s 1111 in the 110th congress the cost of this legislation would have been offset throug h income tax base br oadening and increases in the individual income tax rates in the 110th congress senator john kerry has introduced legislation s 102 that would partially offset the cost of oneyear amt patch by rolling back the lower rates for dividends and capital gains for 2009 and 2010 under this legislation the maximum tax rate on capital gains income would increase from 15 to 20 and dividend income would be taxed at regular income tax rates the lower rates on capital gains and dividends are set to expi re after 2010 and so increasing these rates for 2009 and 2010 would only have shortr revenue effect for scoring purposes based on revenue estimates done by the jct in 2003 changing the tax rates on capital gains and dividends appears to increase revenues in the neighborhood of 20 billion per year for dividends and 4 billion for capital ga ins these capital gains estimates involve some timing ffects and were estimated at time when gains were smaller capital gains rea lizations are very volatile based on the most recent estimate of capital gains liabilities 75 billion for 200511 static gain from increasing the rate by third from 15 to 20 would be 25 billion the actual revenue gain would be about 40 of the static cost or 10 billion if the realization response is around 07 10 re duction in tax leads to 7 increase in realizations 60 or about 15 billion for realization response of 046 range 78 or about 20 billion if the realization response of 025 range and 90 or about 23 billion for responses of 011 these effects would not c over the full cost of the patch but could provide some revenue there are several sources

options to improve compliance and reform tax policy january 27 2005 and an unnumbered report continuedthe presidents advisory panel on ta x reform proposed variety of base broadeners including disallowing the ite mized deduction for state and local taxes in their tax reform plans13 some of these revisions di d not involve total elimination of the tax benefits but placed limits on them such as cap on deductions for health insurance or floor on deductions for char itable contributions it might be more feasible to restrict rather than eliminate major tax expenditures cbo has also provided list of possible base broadeners that in many cases would modify rather than eliminate tax provisions14 for example they discuss proposals for 2 floor for state and local tax deductions and for charitable contributions which would respectiv ely raise 266 billion and 199 billion in fy2009 floors already exist for some ite mized deductions casualty losses and medical expenses and they tend to simplif tax compliance especially in the case of charitable contributions the cbo st udy from 2005 also discussed proposal to limit health benefit deductions which would raise 303 billion in fy2007 and lower the ceiling on mortgage interest duction from 1 million to 400000 which would raise 49 billion in fy2009 proposal to llow the benefits of itemized deductions at 15 rate is estimated to yield 5 35 billion in fy2009 cbo also discussed proposals that primarily affect corporations such as liminating gradua ted tax rates 3 billion in fy2009 and lengthening preciable lives 129 billion in fy2009 offsetting amt revisions by reducing the tax gap and greater tax compliance the tax gap is the difference between the taxes legally owed and the taxes actually collected the latest estimate of the tax gap for 2001 indicated gross tax gap of 345 billion15 if significant fraction of that gap could be collected then it would be possible to finance the amt revi sions with tax compliance measures the net gap after collections irs expects to make with audits and other measures is estimated to be 290 billion the discussion below summarizes some legislative options aimed at closing the tax gap16 it is not comprehensive as there are numerous small changes in rules andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs13 16 continued additional options to improve tax compliance august 3 2006 finally many of these

basis is establis hed when some but not all of type of assets for example shares of particular stock are so ld currently variety of rules are availablerequirements that could alter tax compliance these changes are discussed in some of the sources cited in this section unfort unately there are timates for the revenue gains for many of the measures and those that are available indicate that the revenue gains are small increased withholding or third party reporting tax gap estimates indicate that compliance is greatest with direct withholding rather then with third party reporting wages which are subject to withholding have 1 nonreporting rate interest dividends social secur ity payments pensions and unemployment payments which are generally subject to third party reporting have 45 non reporting rate for income that has some but not substantial reporting such as partnerships corporation income alimony reportable exemptions deductions and capital gains the rate is 85 income not subject to reporting which includes proprietorship income rents and roya lties has noncomplia nce rate of 5417 businesses with cash transactions are timated to have non compliance rate of 8118 number

compliance if related challenges are addressed gao06603 june 2006adopting due diligence rule for preparers relating to offshore banks and similar operations reporting distributions to partners and s corporation shareholders in personal service businesses requiring corporations to report interest deductions limited byearnings stripping some of these information reporting provi sions are aimed at the part of the taxpaying population that tends to have the lowest compliance rates small businesses proposals to withhold taxes on independent contract ors require credit card reporting of payments and require information re porting on corporate services purchased are all aimed at this particular sector it appears that these changes have limited ability to close the tax gap for example the gap arising from the failure to report basis generally the acquisition cost of the asset on capital gains is timated at 11 billion nd misreporting of gain is estimated at 36 for assets where basis is not reported as compared to 13 for mutual funds where net capital gains are reported 20 these differences seem to imply potential gain of several billion dollars the administration estimates in their fy2009 budget however that basis repor ting requirement after 2008 would yield revenue gain that is less than 628 million per year by fy2013 and would provide only 1203 million in cumulative revenue through fy2013 for the first three items in the list above withholdi ng on independent contractors without taxpayer identifica tion number reporting credit card sales and information reporting on payments to co rporations the revisions would yield respectively 70 million 2027 million and 886 million for fy2013 they would yield respectively 248 million 5735 million and 2849 million cumulatively through fy2013 note that full withholding on payments to independent contractors would yield more revenue pe rhaps considerably more information reporting on sales of tangib personal property reporting proceeds of auctions included in the fy2008 budget would raise 220 million in 2012 and 233 million through 2010 the administration also proposed in the 2009 budget increased reporting on nonwage payments by governments yielding 27 million by 2013 and 248 million through fy 2013 all of the administrations fy2009 compliance provisions which include most of the significant items on the list above would yield slightly 105 billion through 2010 the provision enacted in the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2006 which required withholding on i ndependent contractor payments by governments had onetime increase of 6 billion reflecting timing effects but afterwards raised about 200 million year it is possible that expansion to withholding on all independent contractors would yield more revenue but it would likely be controversial proposal since it would affect many taxpayers both payers and recipientshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs15 21 for general

business purpose th tax benefits are disallowed several bills that were introduced in the 109th congress would have codified the economic substance doctrine for instan ce provision in s 2020 was projected to eventually gain about 25 billion in revenue annually hr 3970 chairman rangels tax reform proposal introduced in the 110th congress would also have included the economic substance doctrine with 10year gain in revenue of 39 billion these changes would have recognized th doctrines in the tax law itself and provided several specific guidelines fo r example if court found the economic substance doctrine to be relevant the bill provided that the taxpayer must meet both the objective test of economic substance and the subjective test of having nontax business purpose to keep the tax benefit requiring both is referred to as conjunctive rule while requiring eith er is referred to as disjunctive rule this legislation sought to strengthen the rule and to bring more uniformity to court decisions some court cases have re quired both aspects to be met and others only one the bill also set out specific rules for determining when the taxpayer meets the economic substance test of demonstrating profit potentia l by requiring that the return outside the tax benefits exceeds the ri skless rate of retur n the bill would also require that the transactions must be reasonable means

government affairs us senate tax haven abuses the enablers the tools and secrecy august 1 2006 23 proposals made by the chairman and ranking member of that committee are summarized in testimony of robert mcintyre before the senate budget committee january 23 2007there has been controversy about how much revenue codifying the economic substance doctrine would actually raise and the revenue estimates have varied over time earnings stripping reducing us tax with debt or other deductible payments to related firms is referred to as earnings stripping because of the potential for abuse the current tax code has restriction on deductibility of interest for thinly capitalized us firms with more than 60 of assets held in debt and with more than 50 of earni ngs paid in interest hr 2896 in the 108th congress would have tight ened the general earnings stripping rules by eliminating the asset share test ie disallowing interest based only on the interest as share of income and lowering the interest share to 25 for ordinary debt and 50 for guaranteed or 30 overall this provision would have raised about 27 b illion over 20042013 and would have brought in almost 400 million annually by 2013 some interest in earnings stripping veloped from concerns about corporate inversions corporate inversion occurs when us company sets up foreign incorporated firm to become the parent corporation making the current us firm the subsidiary corporation proposals to pe nalize corporate inversions have been considered in number of previous congre sses but some have not been enacted provision considered but not adopted in 2005 would have raised revenues by about 50 million annually international tax shelters earnings stripping and corporate inversions can be used as tax shelters by shifting inco to low tax countries there are numerous ways to accomplish this income shifting by shifting debt to high tax countries by shifting intangible income such as that related to innovations and marketing and through intercompany pricing there ar many possible legislative responses to these tax sheltering activitie s although the revenue cons equence of each is likely small22 robert mcintyre23 testifying before the senate budget committee summarized the recommendations that came out of that committee along with some additional revisions that he suggested among them is proposal to tax currently the income of foreign subsidiaries of us compan ies this proposal would have policy implications beyond reducing tax shelter opportunities under current income tax law this income is not taxed until repatriated estimates suggest that taxing this income now rather than waiting until it is repatriated could result in revenue gain of around 6 billion per year another proposal to curtail this form of tax sheltering activity is to provide an apportionment form ula for allocating profits allocate profits based on physical assets employment sales or some combination httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs17 summing up tax gap issues the irs estimates that there is significant tax gap but the legislative measur that could be unde rtaken to close that gap appear limited for many measures there are estimates of the revenue that could be generated the reve nue estimates that have been done tend to suggest only small revenue gains when assessing provisions aimed at reducing the tax gap it is critical to differentiate between potential collections as measured by the tax gap estimates and the amount of revenue that might realistica lly be collected through provisions aimed at increasing tax compliance conclusion addressing the growing reach of the amt through repeal or through some form of temporary patch is major fiscal challenge the cost of addressing the amt is large there is shortage of potential wa ys to pay for these revisions whether it be through revisions to the amt itself raising income tax rates broadening the income tax base or some combina tion of all of these options although there is much discussion of the tax gap and the potential re venue associated with closing that gap revenue estimates of gains fro m legislative proposals where they do exist suggest attempts to close the tax gap are unlikely by themselves to raise adequate revenues to address the amt problemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs18 24 the issues surrounding the debate at that time are discussed in crs report 9016 can capital gains tax cut pay for itself by jane g gravelle this archived report can be requested from the congressional research service it is also reprinted in tax notes vol 48 july 9 1990 pp 209219 25 the administration also had an estimate that was somewhat higher than that of the jct and cbo but did not come from explicit estima ting equation it is not clear how the value was chosen 26 holding all other variables constant under this formula g aebt where g is gains is constant reflecting other variables and fixed amounts b is the coefficient of the realizations response and the elasticity is bt appendix capital gains realization response in the late 1980s there was debate bout the magnitude of the capital gains realizations response this response is usually characterized as an elasticity the percentage change in realizations divide d by the percentage change in tax rates empirical studies had produced widely ranging estimates there were two types of empirical studies times series studies that examined aggregate changes in capital gains realizations over time as tax rates changed and crosssection or panel studies that compared many indivi duals realizations within time period the time series studies yielded much smaller and less vari able estimate of the realizations response than did cross sections studies24 there were difficulties with both types of studies for example time series studies confronted difficulties in controlling for other factors such as falling stock transaction costs and changes in potential r ealizations the cro ss section and panel studies also had some significant limitations perhaps the most serious of these potential problems was the likelihood that much of the response might reflect transitory effect high income taxpayers who tended to have va riable income would time their realizations to coincide with periods when tax rates were low so that the relationship between high r ealizations and low tax rates may have merely been timing response and did not reflect re sponse to permanent change the seriousness of this problem and the variab and in some cases extremely large elasticities in these studies led the joint committee on taxation jct and congressional budget office cbo to rely on their own time series estimates for their revenue estimating and forecasting purposes25 most estimates of capital ga ins realizations respons were made using non linear forms popular one and one us ed by jct and cbo was semilog function where the elasticity percentage change in realizations divided by percentage change in tax rate ro proportionally w ith the tax rate26 at tax rate of 022 which is roughly the midpoint betw een the 15 capital gains tax rate and the top amt rates at the time the jct timate of elasticit was 076 but after accounting for portfolio response was 070 the firstyear response was 70 larger at 120 so that at least for cut in th capital gains tax realizations would be expected to rise so much the first year that projected revenue would increase httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs19 27 crs report 91250 limits to capital gains

gains realizations of the rich and sophisticated the american economic review papers and proceedings vol 90 may 2000 pp 276282 this study also reported ve ry large 17 elasticity however discussions with researchers at the cong ressional budget office where this research was performed indicate subsequent concerns that this meas ure is reflecting transitory effects subsequent to the adoption of this asticity number of studies and events suggested that the elasticity estimates shoul d be lowered first the importance of transitory responses was highlighted by the huge surge of realizations that were eventually documented following the propos ed capital gains rate increases in the 1986 tax reform act this observation incr eased concerns about transitory effects in cross section and panel studies s econd study that us ed the limits to the behavioral response since realizations can never exceed accruals suggested elasticities that were likely to be under 0527 third burman and randolph published major new study using cross section data that controlled for transitory effects by using the variation in state tax rates to m easure the permanent re sponse to differential tax rates28 they found very low permanent elasticity of 018 at 16 average tax rate number that was not statistically significant this measure implied an elasticity of 025 at 22 rate usin g the semilog estimating function when weighted by population they found sm aller elasticity 006 with 12 average marginal tax rate implying 011 elasticity at 22 rate they found transitory elasticity of 64 finally as data were added to the aggr egate time series in cbos continuing studies the elasticities fell and are currently at 046 at 22 rate subsequent study by auerbach and siegel confirmed the relatively low elasticities in the burman and randolph study finding an elasticity of 033 and also finding elasticities at virtually zero fo r very wealthy and very sophisticated taxpayers29 the elasticity makes great deal of difference for the share of the static revenue gain from capital gains that is estimated to be collected measuring all elasticities at 22 percent rate with the jcts 070 elastic ity only 27 of the static revenue gain from moving the tax rate from 15 to the t op rate of 28 would be collected with cbos 046 elasticity 49 would be coll ected burman and randolph found that 71 would be collected with the 025 elastic ity and 86 would be collected with the 011 elasticity this realizations elasticity of course only app lies to capital gains in the aggregate 22 of the total of capital gains and dividends reflects dividend payments thus if this share also app lies to the amt the total shares collected would begin at 43 for the 070 jct asticity 022 plus 078 times 027 by 60 if one assumes the cbo elasticity and 77 and 89 for the two burman and randolph measures httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33899crs20 these calculations apply only before 2011 or assume that the dividend and capital gains tax benefits dopted in 2003 will be made pe rmanent if one assumes that the dividend and capital gains relief acted in 2003 will expire then there will be revenue gain from dividends at all and the capital gains tax rate will begin at higher level of 20 in that case the share of static revenue collected will be smaller for example 22 at the original jct elasticity and 46 at the cbo elasticity but about the same for the bu rman and randolph measures the absolute value of the static gain would also be smaller than under the assumption that these provisions are made permanent but tota l federal revenues w ould be larger
