congresses maggie mccarty domestic social policy division may 16 2007 abstract the section 8 housing choice voucher program has come under increasing criticism from the administration and congress for its cost and its complexity recent changes in the way the program is funded have largely addressed concerns at the federal level about spiraling costs however the new funding structure has not reduced budget pressures for the local public housing authorities phas that administer the program noting these concerns the administration has argued in each of the past several years that the existing section 8 voucher program should be dismantled and replaced with new broaderpurpose grant program thus far lowincome housing advocates and pha groups have generally opposed the administrations reform initiatives although both have begun to call for some type of reform to lessen the administrative burdens on phas and to help them better administer their voucher programs in budgetconstrained environment the administrations reform proposals have changed over the years and they have diﬀered substantially from the reform proposals supported by pha groups and lowincome housing advocates

substantially from the reform proposals supported by pha groups and low income housing advocates despite thei r differences each proposal would alter several key features of the current program which are discussed below administration the current section 8 hous ing choice voucher progra m and its approximately 2 million vouchers are administered by more than 2500 local phas across the country phas vary greatly both in their size and their capacity some administer as few as 10 vouchers while one pha the new york city housing authority administers almost 90000 lf of all phas administe r 250 or fewer vouchers2 some phas have fulltime director and large staff others have one person serving parttime as director and staff this heterogeneity has been criticized by some researchers housing

direct news section 8 may 29 2003 attachment c 4 the actual calculation of the value of voucher is more complicated than presented here see later discussions under the headings t enant rent and calculation of income 5 while new vouchers often referred to as incremental vouchers have been funded since 2002 congress has funded new tena nt protection vouchers ever year tenant protection vouchers are provided to families that had b een receiving other forms of housing assistance but are losing that assistance through fau lt of their own such as when public housing is demolished or when the longterm contract on projectbased section 8 property is expiring while the addition of new tenant protection vouchers does increase the number of families receiving vouchers it does not necessarily increase the number of families receiving housing assistance since the familie s that receive them had been previously assisted through another programhousing programs should be administered on regional level they point out that most other social service programs rving the lowincome population such as temporary assistance for needy families child care assistance and food stamps are administered at the state level if the voucher program were administered at the state level they contend it might be eas ier to coordinate it with other services the organizations representing phas have disagreed arguing in favor of the current locally driven and focused system phas have important local connections with entities ranging from landlords to local zoning boards connec tions that states they contend would not have3 furthermore they have expertise in administering federal housing assistance for the poor bot h through the voucher program and the federal public housing program eligible uses of funds todays voucher program provi des defined subsidy called voucher that family can use to help pay its housing costs in the private market that voucher pays roughly the difference between rent and the tenants contribution4 in some cases families can use their vouchers to help pay fo r mortgage but only if their local pha chooses to run homeownership voucher pr ogram the bulk of pha funding which comes from hud is used to renew vouchers funds have been provided for new vouchers since 20025 phas earn administrative fees which they can use for other purposes such as providing supportive rvices downpayment or security deposit assistance or housing search assistance this system is governed by hundreds of pages of regulations and guidance that make the program some argue overly prescriptive and difficult to administer the administration and phas agree that the current structure limits the ability to undertake innovative initiatives reflecting this concern the bush admin istration has proposed redefining the concept of voucher by instead providing funds that could be used for rental assistance homeownership assistance nd supportive services as defined by the grantee voucher would longer have uniform meaning and phas could provide more or less generous assistance to families at their discretion outside of most current federal rules ie quality standards portability income targeting incomebased rent etc such reform would be cons istent with the 1996 welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33270crs3 6 the formula is actually more complicated families must pay the higher of 30 of adjusted income 10 of gross income the amount of welfare benefits designated for housing costs or pha minimum rents whi ch can be higher than 50 monthreform law that abolished the aid to families with dependent children afdc program and replaced it with broaderpurpose temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant critics of this type of administrative flexibility at the p level contend that many of the current rules governing th voucher program are designed to protect voucher recipients they worry that th needs of lowincome families could go unmet if federal rules are abandoned especi ally if funding is constrained and phas are forced to make difficult tradeoffs some further contend that without strong oversight broad block grants could be open to waste fraud and abuse tenant rents under the current rules of the voucher program families are required to pay roughly 30 of their adjusted incomes toward rent6 it is generally accepted that housing is affordable for lowincome familie s if it costs more than 30 of their adjusted gross income on the assumption that lowincome families need the full remaining 70 to meet their other needs however this figure is somewhat arbitrary for some familie s with little work transporta tion medical child care or other outside costs 40 or even 50 of income might be reasonable contribution toward housing costs in fact the curre nt voucher program allo ws families to choose to pay up to 40 of their incomes towa rd housing cost s initially and even greater amounts upon renewal of lease for other families with high expenses for work transportation medical child care or other outside costs some percentage lower than 30 might be the most reasonable contribution critics of the current rent calculation including the bush administration and some pha groups have argued that phas should have the flexibility to modify the existing incomebased rent system or adopt new systems partially or fully decoupled from income such as flat or tiered rents under flat rents families pay pha determined fixed belowmark et rent based on unit size regardless of their incomes as incomes change rent would stay the same current law permits phas to set flat rents for public housing families are permitte d to choose to pay flat rents but must be permitted to switch back to incomebased rents under tiered rents phas set different flat rents for broad tiers of income families pay the rent charged for their income tier and only fluctuations in income that move them from one tier to another would change their rent unless flat or tie red rents were set low the change would generally result in shallower subsidies paid to families shallower subsidies would allow phas either to save money or rve more people with the same amount of money depending on the author ity provided by hud and congress another argument in favor of moving fro m an incomebased rent to flat rent concerns administrative ease the current complicated rent calculation paired with the difficulty of verifying the incomes of tenants has led to high levels of error in the subsidy calculation according to hud 2001 quality control study 60 of allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33270crs4 7 for more information see the national hous ing law projects earned income disregard packet for public housing voucher program and other hud programs available at httpwwwnhlporghtml pubhsgeid_packethtm 8 summarized from 24 cfr 5609rent and subsidy calculations contained so type of error hud has estimated an annual 2 billion in subsidy over and unde rpayments in the section 8 voucher program these errors have led the government accountability office gao to designate the section 8 program high risk program meaning that it is particularly susceptible to waste fraud and abuse beginning with the fy2003 consolidated appropriations act pl 1087 hud was given access to the national directory of new hires database that may allow phas to better verify income data there has been some improvement 2003 qua lity control study released in 2004 found 37 reduction in erroneous payments from 2001 although 40 of subsidies were still erroneously calculated adopting flat or tiered rents could substantially reduce if not eliminate errors in rent calculations another argument in favor of fl at rent structur involves the work disincentives inherent in th current calculation since re nt goes up as income goes up families have disincentive to increas earnings andor an incentive to hide income families therefore face an eff ective 30 tax on any increase in earnings to get around this problem in the public housing program c ongress has instituted mandatory income disregard however such mandatory disregard exists in the voucher program except in the case of certain disabled recipients7 if phas choose to disregard increased earnings they must pay the difference out of their own budgets or face sanctions from hud for not accurately calculating subsidies under flat or tiered rents families can gene rally increase their earnings without facing changes in their rents lowincome housing advocates generally support incomebased rents over flat rents flat rents are not as responsive to changes in family income as incomebased rents and their adoption could result in some families paying much more toward rent than is generally considered affordable 30 of income calculation of income under the current voucher program rent is based on familys annual adjusted income the current system for calculating income has been criticized as cumbersome and prone to errors annual income for the purpose of rent determination is ll amounts that are anticipated to be received by all member s of household during the subsequent 12 months with some exclusions such as foster care payments8 anticipating low income families future incomes can be very difficult as their employment is often variable the composition of family may also be variable with members joining or leaving the household over the course of year further phas are expected to verify families incomes using thirdparty sources which can be timeconsuminghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33270crs5 9 see 24 cfr 982516 10 see 24 cfr 5611 for list of deductions 11 see government acc ountability offi ce gao progress and challenges in measuring

the total amount of income has been determined the family may qualify to have certain amounts deducte d from total income such as 480 per dependent 400 for elderly and disabled households and reasonable child care expenses disability expenses and certain medical expenses of the elderly or disabled10 the complexity of the income determination system is major factor behind the high rates of error in rent determination many of the current requirements are regulatory rather than statutory and pha groups have called on hud to simplify the process hud has stated that it is looking at ways to improve the income calculation process11 although major administrativ changes have been made eligibility the current voucher program sets initial eligibility for assistance at the very lowincome level 50 or below of area median income ami with requirement that 75 of all vouchers be targeted to extremely lowincome families 30 or below ami12 the administration has advocated raising eligibility levels and loosening targeting requirements they argue that both penalize working families by limiting their eligibility for assistance further serving higher income families could result either in cost savings or the ability to serve more families with the same amount of money lowincome housing advocates generally support retaining current income eligibility and targeting requirements they argue that the lowest income households face the heaviest rent burdens and are the most in need of assistance work requirements and time limits the voucher program does not currently have time limits or work requirements families that receive voucher assistance can retain that assistance until either they choose to leave the program they are fo rced to leave the program due to non compliance with program rules or insufficien t funding or their income rises to the point that 30 of their income equals their housing costs at which point their subsidy is zero the public housing program does have mandatory eighthour work or community service requirement for nonelderly nondisabled tenants however most public housing resident s are exempted and it is unclear how thoroughly the provision has been implemented13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33270crs6 13 continued by maggie mccarty 14 see crs report rl30797 trends in welfare work and the ec onomic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children

cityscape journal of policy development and research volume 6 number 2 2003 16 department of housing and urban development performance and accountab ility report fy2004 p265some have advocated tting time limits for receipt of voucher assistance and making work requirement for ongoing ligibility they argue that under the current system families have incentive to increase their incomes or work efforts and leave the program this concern is exacerbate d by the fact that many communities have long waiting lists for assistance and ce new vouchers have not been funded for several years turnover in the current pr ogram is the only way to bring in new families adopting work requirement in the voucher program may help encourage non elderly nondisabled househol ds that are not currently working to go to work although it may not increase their income s research based on the 1996 welfare reform changes pl 104193 indicates th at for many poor families increases in work do not necessarily translate into great er total income and most households need work supports such as child care and tran sportation assistance in order to make them successful in becoming financially selfsufficient14 such supportive services are not currently part of the voucher prog ram and would require additional funding furthermore there is evidence that families with children those most likely to be affected by work requirements and time limits leave the program relatively quickly according to hud research from 2003 the median length of stay for families with children is two and half years15 further it is unclear how low income families would meet their housing co sts after leaving the program if their incomes had not risen significantly hud conducted research looking at families with children who left the voucher prog ram over fiveyear period and found that less than 1 of them had incomes sufficient to afford an apartment at the fair market rent in their community16 another option would give incentives to families to increase their work efforts and therefore their incomes nonelderly nondisabled fa milies could be encouraged to find and increase work through expansions in the family selfsufficiency program which provides work supports and deposits tenant rent increases resulting from work into escrow accounts on their behalf lowincome housing advocates generally support expanding the fss progra m which encourages work and increases in earnings however expanding fss would not result in cost savings since as families incomes rise their rent increas are deposited in an escrow

of voucher is equal to roughly the difference between the rent capped by maximum set by the pha and called the payment standard and the tenants contribution toward the rent 30 of the nants income phas costs fluctuate as tenants incomes and market rents increased or decreased and each year hud would ask congress for funding sufficient to c over what hud anticipated it would take to fund phas costs due partly to changes in the rental market and partly to changes in the rules of the voucher program such as increases in the payment standard phas actual costs began rising rapidly in 2002 and 200317 this raised concerns for both the administration and congress partly in response to these cost increases the administration proposed potentially costsav ing changes in both the way that phas received funds and in the underlying factors th at led to the cost growth including the amount tenants were asked to contribute toward rent and the maximum payment standard as part of each of their reform proposals congress reacted by changing only the way that phas receive their funding rather than being reimbursed for their actual costs phas in recent years have received budget based on what they received in the previous year18 this new funding formula has led to problems for many phas whose actual costs are still driven by the difference between rents and incomes in their communities while their funding is capped as result some p groups have called for either change back to an actual cost funding formula or changes to the structure of the voucher program that would allow them to better control their costs reform proposals every year since 2003 the president s proposed eliminating the section 8 voucher program and replacing it with new initiative bills to enact the presidents reform

ongoing rental assistance adoption of fvp would have eliminated caps on on how much families could be required to contribute towards rent increased income eligibility to 80 or below of ami and eliminated any targeting requirements the house financial services committee in their views and estimates of the presidents fy2005 budget was critical of the presidents fvp proposal the chairman of
