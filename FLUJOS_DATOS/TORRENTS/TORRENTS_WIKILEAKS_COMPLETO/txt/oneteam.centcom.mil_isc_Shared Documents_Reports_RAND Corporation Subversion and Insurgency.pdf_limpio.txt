and insurgency1 americans are politically naïve and it is diﬃcult to make them realize that they face oppo nents who do not play by the rules guenter lewy 1987 to totalitarianism an opponent is by deﬁnition subversive democracy treats subversives as mere opponents for fear of betraying its principles jeanfrançois revel 1984 introduction persistent insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq and the emergence of what some analysts journalists and politicians have described as the global jihad have helped renew interest in the question of how insurgents employ subversion in iraq according to the us defense intelligence agency the new government is threatened by subversion and inﬁltration of emerging government institutions and security and intelligence services jacoby 2005 p 8 more broadly international jihadis are using violence and subversion to establish totalitarian empire that denies all political and religious freedom according to the national secu rity strategy of the united states of america white house 2006 john mackinlay 2005 pp 5 152 argues that the subversion of vulnerable muslim populations is critical component of the complex insurgency being waged by osama bin laden and others within the jihadi ﬁrmament but despite this renewed recognition that terrorists and insurgents employ subversion and general agreement with the late j bowyer bells 1994 p 135 assertion that armed rebels of all varieties are practiced subversiveslittle systematic attention has been devoted to the topic in recent years for decades scholarly and policyoriented research on the topic has been nonexistent perhaps the lack of analytical focus can be explained by the terms lingering coldwar era connotations of rampant political paranoia repression and the relentless an earlier version of this paper subversion and terrorism understanding and countering the threat appeared in the memorial institute for the prevention of terrorisms mipt terrorism annual 20062 subversion and insurgency hunt for internal enemies indeed during the cold war american policymakers sometimes described the threat of communist subversion in overheated language that bordered on the comical as us secretary of state dean rusk did in april 1962 when he declared that urgent action was required before the enemys subversive politicomilitary teams ﬁnd fertile spawning grounds for their ﬁsh eggs quoted in william rosenau 2005 p 88 whatever the reason for the current inattention it would be useful to explore the subver sive challenge in more depth subversion is an important element of the insurgent repertoire and if the us armed forces the intelligence community and civilian agencies expect to wage eﬀective counterinsurgency in iraq and afghanistan they will have to develop more sophisticated approaches to counter subversion the problem is not limited to these two countries of course as the global war on terrorism evolves into the long war it seems obvious that the united states and its friends and allies will necessarily encounter other insurgent adversaries and those adversaries will likely employ subversion 1 as ﬁrst step in developing more complete understanding of subversion and what is required to counter it this paper will begin with discussion of deﬁnitions of subversion next it will use set of case studies to explore in more depth the elements of subversion identiﬁed in the section on deﬁnitions the paper will go on to present set of preliminary ideas for combating subversive activities in the context of the emerging long war against violent islamic extremism the paper will conclude with brief discussion of how us support for countersubversion within authoritarian regimes can conﬂict with other important us foreign policy objectives such as the promotion of human rights indeed widespread domestic and international criticism of us internal security assistance to repressive but nominally prowestern governments helped end most us aid to foreign police forces by the mid1970s 2 several caveats are in order however first this paper is intended to serve as reintro duction to the subject of subversion it is not intended to be comprehensive or deﬁnitive and additional research is required second while some deﬁnitions identify propaganda as component of subversion propaganda will not be considered explicitly since terrorist and insurgent use of such techniques has already been covered extensively in relatively recent academic and professional military literature 3 while terrorism and insurgency share some signiﬁcant features eg both are forms of violence employed by nonstate actors to further political objectives tucker and lamb 2006 p 1 they are of course distinct phenomena as many analysts have noted terrorism is tactic strategy while insurgency is politicalmilitary one 4 however the line between terrorism 1for more on what the us department of defense dod is calling irregular warfare see dod 2006 2for more on this point see us congress 1976 3see for example weimann 2004 and schleifer 2003 4the term terrorism as used in this paper is taken from the us department of state dos 2005 deﬁnition which categorizes it as premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents insurgency is deﬁned as protracted politicalmilitary activity directed toward completely or partially controlling the resources of country through the use of irregular military forces and illegal political organizations this deﬁnition was used by the us central intelligence agency during the 1980s and it remains useful see byman et 2001 p 4 subversion and insurgency 3 and insurgency is easily blurred since most insurgent groups also engage in terrorism to greater or lesser degree armed political movements that clearly meet most deﬁnitions of insurgency such as the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte the communist party of the philippinesnew peoples army and the fuerzas armadas revolucionarios colombia revo lutionary armed forces of colombia have been designated by the us state department as foreign terrorist organizations the term terrorist is both normative and political label and governments will often attempt to condemn their opponents as terrorists since the public relations victory achieved by this linguistic sleight of hand can be crucial in any ensuing struggle for popular support as conor gearty 1992 p 15 has observed insurgent on the other hand connotes at least some measure of legitimacy which explains why incumbents typically refuse to describe their adversaries as such 5 the three groups considered in the case studiesthe ltte the national liberation front for the liberation of vietnam nlf better known as the viet cong and the frente farbundo martí liberación nacional farbundo martí national liberation front or fmln in salvadorare organizations to which both terms have been applied third this paper does not consider the subversive activities of qaeda and other salaf istjihadi movements in the depth they deservea shortfall the author hopes to redress in subsequent research the inﬁltration of mosques schools and other islamic institutions the use of the internet and the radicalization and recruitment process in western europe and elsewhere are novel forms of subversion that are clearly distinct from coldwar era subversive phenomena and as such require further research that said the following analysis will touch on the subversive activities of islamist preaching and proselytizing dawa organizations such as hizbuttahrir ht which spread extremist ideology through missionary activities algemene inlichtingen veiligheidsdienst aivd 2004 p 27 while ostensibly nonvio lentand thus falling outside any strict deﬁnition of insurgencyht with its transnational operations extremist ideology and clandestine structure serves as an important recruiting ground for violent islamist extremist groups khamidov 2003 p 6 6 finally it should be mentioned that the cases below although focused on nonislamist groups provide insights that are useful when developing strategies and tools for countering jihadi subversion that subversion has novel features as mentioned above however it is essential to avoid the pitfall of assuming that qaeda and other elements of the jihadi nebula are utterly unique phenomena the likes of which humanity has never before encountered among other things such an assumption can lead national security planners to the conclusion that every counterinsurgency campaign must begin novo there are timeless principles of countersubversion to be sure but there are elements of earlier subversive campaigns that might help inform policymakers as they think about countering subversion in the context of the long war the viet cong the fmln and the ltte represent the upper end of subversive capabilities understanding how such movements employed subversionwhile recognizing 5for more on this point see kilcullen 2005 pp 604606 6al qaeda has also reportedly inﬁltrated dawa groups such as jamaat altabligh there are grounds for concern that in the horn of africa some tablighs harbour militant agendas and that extremist groups may inﬁltrate tabligh as cover for their movements and contacts international crisis group icg 2005 p 18 4 subversion and insurgency that it will take diﬀerent forms among todays violent islamist extremistswill better prepare us for contemporary counterinsurgency challenges deﬁning subversion subversion like terrorism and insurgency has universally accepted deﬁnition spjut 1979 p 254 for scholars such as charles townshend 1993 p 116 the term is so elastic as to be virtually devoid of meaning and its use does little more than convey the enlarged sense of the vulnerability of modern systems to all kinds of covert assaults indeed during the cold war the british security service mi5 deﬁned subversion as generalized intention to overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political industrial or violent means uk security service 2005 among american oﬃcials subversion was an equally imprecise term most often used when describing real or more fanciful clandestine eﬀorts by communists typically to undermine the united states and its friends and allies 7 for moscow too subversion was something only ones adversary employed but in real ity of course both superpowers used subversion throughout the cold war8 in the case of the united states examples include central intelligence agency cia support to the congress for cultural freedom ccf an organization of some of the worlds leading intellectuals and artists that promoted liberal democratic alternatives to soviet totalitarianism 9 secret marshall plan for the mind that distributed millions of copies of western books in the soviet union and throughout the warsaw pact countries matthews 2003 and covert assistance to trade unionists politicians journalists military oﬃcers and others in chile opposed to president salvador allende who was overthrown in 1973 coup détat 10 soviet subversion was even more extensive and included the destabilization of democratic governments in central and eastern europe during the late 1940s covert support for liberation movements opposed to prowestern regimes eg to the frente sandinista liberación nacional in nicaragua during the 1960s and 1970s and secret ﬁnancial aid to prosoviet political parties such as the congress party in india andrew and mitrokhin 2005 particularly chapters 3 17 and 18 passim within american and british military institutions today the term has diﬀerent connota tions for dod subversive activities are those actions designed to undermine the military economic psychological or political strength or morale of regime that do not fall into the categories of treason sedition sabotage or espionage dod 2001 the british army contributes useful reﬁnement by identifying subversion as those activities short of the use of 7see for example us congress 1963 8among us national security oﬃcials such denials were intended for public diplomatic and political consumption behind closed doors policymakers explicitly acknowledged that the us government used subversion during the truman administration for example the national security council deﬁned covert action to embrace subversion against hostile states including assistance to underground resistance movements guerrillas and refugee liberation groups and support of indigenous anticommunist elements in threatened countries of the free world dos 1948 9for an interesting if tendentious account of the ccf see saunders 1999 10see for example us congress 1975subversion and insurgency 5 force that are intended to erode the strength of the state british army 2001 p a32 under this deﬁnition subversion can have violent manifestationseg fomenting riotsand is typically employed as part of broader armed terrorist or insurgent campaign but it is essentially not martial in nature in eﬀect subversion might be seen as form of nonviolent terrorism 11 frank kitson 1971 p 3 the british counterinsurgency practitioner and theorist deﬁned subversion with characteristic directness as all illegal measures short of the use of armed force taken by one section of the people of country to overthrow those governing the country at the time or to force them to do things they do not want to do although kitson and other authors claim that subversion is sometimes employed in the expectation that such nonviolent actions on their own will lead to governments downfall kitson 1971 p 83 thompson 1967 p 28 examples of regime change by subversion alone are diﬃcult if not impossible to ﬁnd more typically terrorists and insurgents employ doubleedged sword with subversion forming one edge and the armed struggle the other subversion sometimes precedes armed conﬂict this was certainly the case with maoist insurgencies during the cold war analysts recognized the importance of identifying and counteracting subversion during the early stages of an insurgency since the failure to do so would give the movement time advantage that would be diﬃcult and costly for the incumbent power to overcome jones and molnar 1966 p 61 as such popular insurgent organizations matured and their mass base expanded subversive activities typically became more overt with riots and other physical manifestations forming larger part of the movements seditious repertoire the current insurgency in iraqs anbar province has followed diﬀerent pattern contrary to classic maoist doctrine there was protracted period of subversion in anbar before insurgents and criminals took up arms relatively soon after the downfall of the saddam hussein regime in 2003 however it is worth noting that while most insurgent movements use subversion far fewer number of terrorist groups employ it lack of manpower is part of the explanation small terrorist entities simply lack the personnel to engage in such activities in any substantial way during the 1980s leftwing european terrorist groups such as 17 november the rote armee fracktion red army faction or raf and action directe each had fewer than 50 fulltime members and the islamist groupuscules that carried out the 2004 madrid railway station bombing and the 2005 attacks on the london transport system were even smaller terrorists may also be more predisposed to violent as opposed to nonviolent or less than violent political behavior while the subject of terrorist motivation is beyond the scope of this paper 12 it should be mentioned in passing that violence appears to occupy much more prominent place in the terrorist mentalité than it does in the insurgent worldview analysts have detected among individuals who become terrorists burning desire to escape the words 13 and accel erate history through violent action as one member of the weather underground said we are tired of tiptoeing up to society and asking for reform we are ready to kick it in the balls 11the phrase is from selznick 1952 p 238 12for more on individual and group motivations see reich 1998 and hudson nd 13the phrase is from leites 1979 p 32 in della portas 1988 study of italian leftwing terrorism she notes that previous experience in violent political activities predisposes individuals to involvement in terrorist groups 6 subversion and insurgency quoted in della porta 1988 p 34 finally blooddrenched attacks are more likely than sub version to draw the medias gaze and with it the allimportant attention of wider audience both domestic and international 14 forms of subversion in addition to fomenting riots what other activities might be characterized as subversive sub versive actions can be grouped into three interrelated categories 1 establishing front groups and penetrating and manipulating existing political parties 2 inﬁltrating the armed forces the police and other institutions of the state as well as important nonstate organizations and 3 generating civil unrest through demonstrations strikes and boycotts these categories will be discussed in turn below and will be explored more fully in the case studies front groups to gain public credibility attract new supporters generate revenue and acquire other resources terrorist and insurgent groups need to undertake political activities that are entirely separate or appear to be entirely separate from the overtly violent activities of those groups sometimes this is achieved by inﬁltrating political parties labor unions community groups and charitable organizations working in and through existing organizations which provide façade of legitimacy that might otherwise be unobtainable terrorists and insurgents can bolster political allies attack government policies and attract international support for those situations in which inﬁltration is too diﬃcult terrorists and insurgents may establish their own front groupsthat is organizations that purport to be independent but are in fact created and controlled by others front groups notes john thompson 2003 can draw the sting of disapproval away from the cause and redirect it against the state or institution that the terrorists are attacking during the cold war front groups were established by many insurgent and terrorist groups including the fmln the viet cong and sendero luminoso shining path today groups as diverse as qaeda the kurdistan peoples congress formerly known as the partiya karkaren kurdistan lashkaritaiyibah in jammu and kashmir and the ltte oper ate through political social and charitable fronts gunaratna 2004 p 95 foreign broadcast information service fbis 2002 workers party nd sinn fein the socalled political wing of the provisional irish republican army and arguably the most famous terrorist front in modern times continues to serve as the respectable public face of irish republican terrorism inﬁltration terrorists and insurgents who penetrate state institutions can derive at least ﬁve signiﬁcant beneﬁts the ﬁrst is information inﬁltrating organs of the state particularly the security forces can help generate invaluable information about the governments capabilities intentions and weaknesses such inﬁltration therefore might be considered form of intelligence collection 14as mccormick 2003 p 496 observes in political sense at least terrorists begin to disappear when they drop oﬀ the headlines subversion and insurgency 7 against the state second penetration can give terrorists and insurgents opportunities to plant false information redirect the states potentially lethal gaze force the authorities to misallocate resources and otherwise derail the states campaign this too is type of intelligence operation like counterintelligence ci carried out by government intelligence services it secretly aims to disrupt the organization and operations of enemy forces third successful inﬁltration may lead to opportunities to steal government funds weapons equipment and other resources fourth penetration allows insurgents and terrorists to talent spot potential recruits and identify candidates for blackmail or bribery finally inﬁltration can contribute to the terrorist and insurgent strategy of weakening and delegitimizing the incumbent power 15 just as inﬁltrators can help derail the states counterterrorist or counterinsurgency campaign so too can they degrade the states ability to provide key public services by misdirecting resources stealing funds and spreading false and divisive rumors among those in the government workforce inﬁltration of government institutions has been tactic of revolutionaries at least since the time of lenin who concluded more than century ago that unless the revolution assumes mass character and aﬀects the troops there can be question of serious struggle that we must work among the troops goes without saying lenin 1900 16 but the tactic is by means conﬁned to marxistleninist groups qaeda reportedly claims to have inﬁltrated key government agencies within the united arab emirates lathem 2006 and in bangladesh the radical jamaateislami party which sponsors network of 15000 guerrillas has ﬁlled the countrys armed forces security services and civilian agencies with its sympathizers harrison 2006 p 15 in iraq as mentioned above insurgents have reportedly inﬁltrated the armed forces the police and intelligence services inspectors general 2005 p 22 insurgents 2005 such penetrations can have deadly consequences an insurgent mortar attack on an iraqi national guard base north of baghdad in october 2004 killed four and wounded 80 according to press account schmitt and shanker 2004 p 1 the attack came at the exact time guardsmen were mustering for ceremony which is seen by experts as an indication that those ﬁring oﬀ the mortars held inside information finally it must be mentioned that insurgent inﬁltration is not limited to state institu tions as again demonstrated today in iraq in anbar province insurgents have systematically inﬁltrated universities where they reportedly occupy top academic and administrative positions iraqs oil industry the countrys most important economic sector is also thoroughly penetrated by the insurgents who have gone so far as to establish aﬃliated front companies to rake oﬀ illicit earnings civil unrest as with inﬁltration fomenting riots organizing strikes and staging demonstrations can have corrosive eﬀect on the power presence and capabilities of the state such unrest is ﬁrst and foremost an aﬀront to governmental authority and the failure to suppress it can have damaging political repercussions for the state by demonstrating that it is incapable of living up to its 15for more on delegitimization as strategy see harmon 2001 16there is an obvious parallel here between bolshevik subversion and the subversive activities of such dawa organizations as ht8 subversion and insurgency fundamental responsibility to maintain public order17 at the same time however overreaction by the security forces can play into the hands of terrorists and insurgents by seeming to conﬁrm the oppositions claims about the fundamentally repressive nature of the state the death of demonstrator at the hands of the berlin police in 1967 helped radicalize generation of german young people who came to believe that the federal republic of germany was the nazi regime reborna key component in the ideology of subsequent terrorist groups most notably the raf 18 civil unrest can prove useful in variety of other political and operational ways large scale discord can deplete the resources of the state by forcing the authorities to deploy additional police pay overtime and in some cases send troops into the streets with the security forces otherwise occupied insurgents and terrorists gain respite from the incumbents campaign against them us marine corps intelligence activity nd 1999 additionally the greater presence of the security forces in response to unrestin the form of patrols roadblocks and searchescan help the cause of the terrorists and insurgents by seeming to conﬁrm the oppositions inevitable charge that the state has militarized the conﬂict and is now at war with people strikes can cause serious economic damage as carlos marighella observed in his mini manual of the urban guerrilla 1969 perhaps the most widely read revolutionary howto manual of the 1960s strikes although they are of brief duration cause severe damage to the enemy by disrupting daily life occurring endlessly one after the other in true guerrilla fashion even less violent forms of unrest such as worker absenteeism passive resistance boycotts and deliberate attempts to cripple government agencies by overloading the system with false reports can have powerfully disruptive eﬀects both economically and politically molnar 1963 p 102 according to one scholar associated with ht regime could be brought down through acts of civil disobedience such as strikes noncooperation with the authorities or demonstrations quoted in icg 2003 p 7 case studies in subversion although virtually every insurgent group and some terrorists employ subversive tactics three organizations in particular are worth particular attention given the high degree of emphasis they have devoted to these covert and clandestine activities these cases are not intended to be representative instead they illustrate the high end of subversive capabilities one group is contemporary the two others are from the cold war era and while none is islamist the 17such actions are part of strategy for discrediting disarming and demoralizing the establishment according to clutterbuck 1973 p 275 18for more on this point see varon 2004 p 39 and becker 1977 pp 4243 subversion and insurgency 9 three cases can generate insights that might be useful in the context of the campaign against qaeda and other jihadi groups viet cong the proselytizing program the communist opposition in south vietnam embraced strategy that employed both violent and nonviolent methods in an interconnected way what douglas pike 1966 p 85 termed the nlfs violence program included terrorism guerrilla warfare and conventional military operations the nlfs political struggle included range of actions intended to build support among the vietnamese people mobilize the population and weaken the ability of the saigon government to prosecute the war for the nlf however the political struggle was by means secondary to the armed campaign rather these two elements were conceptualized as equal and complementary components of the overall campaign against the saigon regime cia 1966 p 14 particularly signiﬁcant in terms of subversion were the front associations of farmers teachers students and other sectors of vietnamese society that allowed the nlf to exert control over the population weaken the family and other social institutions and oﬀer new form of security and belonging which would be provided by the revolutionary movement us information service 1967 p 21 front groups further aided the political struggle by spreading antigovernment rumors and mounting demonstrations intended to disrupt tax collection conscription or army of the republic of vietnam arvn operations against the viet cong us information service 1967 p 20 what the nlf termed the binh van or proselytizing program aimed at suborning arvn and civilian government personnel was key feature of communist subversion in south vietnam according to the us information service 1967 pp 256258 from its beginning in 1961 the program worked to encourage unit and individual desertions from the arvn create discord between arvn forces and government personnel and their us advisorslower the morale of troops and civil servants and encourage them to perform their duties in lackadaisical fashionpromote pronlf activities and sentiment within government agencies and the armed forcescreate an antiwar movement among the us troops to weaken their ﬁghting spirit and make them fear protracted war south vietnam liberation armed forces nd 1971 what techniques and tactics did the binh van program employ proselytizers used spec trum of appeals ranging from the targets sense of nationalism to antius sentiment to the supposed inevitability of the nlfs victory pike 1966 p 258 these appeals were conveyed through leaﬂets and radio broadcasts but direct persontoperson communication was more important pike 1966 p 264 describes what he terms classic binh van struggle 10 subversion and insurgency it typically would involve sharptongued old woman buttonholing young and igno rant private in the market place of small village berating him because of the killing and destruction of the war and in general making him feel alien miserable and unpatriotic blackmail and other forms of coercion sometimes played role soldiers and civil ser vants would be entrapped in crime and then induced to serve as an nlf agent pike 1966 p 260 promises of leniency and monetary rewards were oﬀered to encourage desertion or defection arvn defectors and captured troops using pamphlets letters and loudspeakers urged their former comrades among saigons puppet troops to join the revolution quang da 1972 p 4 families of soldiers were also key targets for nlf proselytizers in the words of one nlf document nlf binh van nd 1968 the families of the enemys soldiers had to be convinced of the revolutions righteousness to lower troop morale family members were encouraged to write to their sons in the arvn about death disease and destruction on the home front the overall eﬀectiveness of binh van is diﬃcult to judge although pike 1966 pp 267 268 concludes that the program failed to achieve its ultimate goal of degrading saigons ability to wage war against the viet cong we do know that tens of thousands of nlf members and supporters penetrated police and paramilitary forces the intelligence services the civil service and the arvn prados 2002 p 139 and that these institutions were plagued by low morale corruption and incompetence whether these deﬁciencies were function of nlf subversive actions or were simply byproducts of more systematic problems within south vietnam is hard to assess but given the size of the binh van eﬀort and the competence and sheer fanaticism of nlf cadres it seems safe to conclude that subversion had some corrosive eﬀect on saigons war eﬀort the fmln activating the masses salvadors fmln an umbrella organization composed of marxistleninist political parties and guerrilla armies employed many of the same subversive tactics used by the viet cong 19 as with the nlf the fmln throughout the 1980s employed twoprong strategy against the usbacked government designed to weaken the regime militarily and politically and ultimately force it to collapse fmln military operations were intended to demonstrate the feebleness of the salvador armed forces and thus the pointlessness of american security assistance cia 1984 p 17 alongside the armed struggle was sophisticated political campaign intended to activate the masses and garner international support for the fmln and international condemnation of the salvador government as in vietnam front groups of peasants workers teachers and students were employed widely these fronts in the words of 1987 state department study dos 1981 p 5 functioned as manpower pools for the guerrillas and were used to stage demonstrations disseminate propaganda and occupy public 19fmln leaders in fact made close study of vietnamese struggles against the french the japanese and the americans manwaring and prisk 1988 pp 162164subversion and insurgency 11 buildingschurches foreign embassies and government oﬃcesas well as to augment guer rilla units they did so as part of the fmlns strategy to isolate the government domestically and internationally and to gain political and ﬁnancial support for the insurgency cia 1986b p 7 the fmlns use of subversion diﬀered from the nlfs in several interesting respects first given the relatively more industrialized nature of the salvadoran economy inﬁltration of labor unions and the creation of labor fronts were far more important elements in fmln strategy factions and disarray within democratic trade unions made them vulnerable to penetration by the fmln and its supporters during the mid1980s unions dominated by or sympathetic to the rebels engaged in frequent work stoppages and organized major demonstrations against government ministries and privatesector ﬁrms cia 1986a pp 1314 more than 100 work stoppages and strikes took place in 1985 alone according to us government estimate cia 1986b p 3 and while the nlf relied on international front groups to raise funds and build support abroad for the revolution the fmlns use of foreign support networks was more formalized and gave the insurgency considerable strategic depth in the united states the committee in solidarity with the people of salvador cispes was reportedly founded at the urging of farid handal brother of jorge shaﬁk handal the general secretary of the communist party of salvador an fmln component organization to agitate on behalf of the insurgency arnold 1987 p b7 the fmln also recognized the importance of the international human rights movement and exploited the real vulnerability of the salvadoran government to charges that it systematically murdered and otherwise abused its political opponents human rights organizations created or inﬁltrated by the fmln functioned as bullfrog chorus that repeated charges of governmental abuses leveled by fmlncontrolled student and labor groups cia 1986b p 6 human rights activists linked to the fmln maintained extensive ties to sympathetic trade unionists clergy students and politicians in north america western europe and latin america and they were successful in persuading dutch german and greek parliamentarians to publicly criticize the salvadoran governments admittedly abysmal human rights record cia 1986b p 6 finally the fmln was innovative in its use of domestic and international humanitarian and other nongovernmental organizations ngos to generate ﬁnancial resources donations from western ngos to fmln fronts were major source of insurgent funds cia 1989 p 16 money from legitimate aid projects focusing on food construction medical care and agricultural development was skimmed by individuals deemed politically reliable by the fmln and then transferred to the guerrillas donors of course were never told that portion of their contributions were destined for the fmln us defense intelligence agency 1990 section 6 as in the case of the nlf it is diﬃcult to assess the overall eﬀectiveness of the fmlns subversion campaign american intelligence reports from the time suggested that despite widespread inﬁltration of trade unions fmln control was hardly total as demonstrated by the fact that the insurgents were never able to call general strike cia 1989 p 11 the gradual improvement of the governments human rights performance during the late 1980s undermined the credibility of fmlncontrolled human rights groups cia 1986b p 6 that said other aspects of the fmlns subversive campaign must be judged success front groups 12 subversion and insurgency operating outside of salvador appear to have helped generate considerable international support for the fmln and they helped reduce the international standing of the salvador government in addition front groups made notable contribution to insurgent resources by attracting donations from abroad and diverting to the fmln the ltte subversion on five continents the operational sophistication of the tamil tigers is remarkable the lttes cadre of suicide bombers the socalled black tigers have raised suicide terrorism to an art form having murdered sri lankan president ranasinghe premadasa in may 1991 and the indian former prime minister rajiv gandhi two years later but as remarkable as the lttes military capabilities are the depth and sophistication of the tamil tigers subversive activities are even more impressive and are probably without parallel among contemporary insurgent and terrorist organizations ltte subversion takes place across ﬁve continents and includes staggering number of front groups including the tamil rehabilitation organization bell 2005a the world tamil association the world tamil movement wtm and the federation of associations of canadian tamils fact dos 2003 p 114 in south africa the ltte has inﬁltrated legitimate tamil diaspora groups including the natal tamil federation and the south african tamil federation it has established network of sympathetic tamil organizations across the country gunaratna 1999 and ltte operatives have reportedly inﬁltrated south african military units and intelligence services gunaratna 2001 ltte front groups serve three purposes as tools for hounding critics of the ltte through demonstrations mobs and harassing phone calls emails and letters as transmission belts for spreading ltte propaganda within tamil diaspora communities and among wider nontamil audiences and for fundraising during the late 1990s the ltte raised an estimated 15 million month in the united kingdom canada and australia alone byman et 2001 p 50 however the ltte has relied on other sources of funds beyond tamil diasporas as with the fmln the tamil tigers skim money donated to fronts and lttedominated ngos that provide social services and other support to tamils in sri lanka and in the diaspora byman et 2001 p 51 it is part of the ltte modus operandi to siphon oﬀ funds that are intended for rehabilitation programs in sri lanka according to the canadian immigration and refugee board quoted in bell 2005a through cispes the fmln sought to inﬂuence politics and policy within the united states by lobbying members of congress generating favorable press coverage and mobilizing public support in canada home to one of the worlds largest overseas tamil populations the ltte has mounted an even more sustained and sophisticated campaign to shape the political environment through its fronts the tamil tigers have made major eﬀort to cultivate politicians including members of parliament parliamentarians have attended proltte rallies staged by the wtm bell 2005b p 57 in july 2000 maria minna the minister for international cooperation and ﬁnance minister paul martin who later served as prime minister attended tamil new years celebration in toronto organized by fact group designated as subversion and insurgency 13 an ltte front by the canadian security and intelligence service csis maccharles 2001 p a0620 as with the other two cases examined in this paper it is diﬃcult to make deﬁnitive judgment about the overall eﬀectiveness of ltte subversive activities although reportedly urged by csis to ban ltte martins liberal government repeatedly refused to do so but whether this was function of tamil tiger subversion or product of some other concern eg civil liberties is hard to say bell 2006 however as in the case of the fmln the ltte clearly has employed front groups to attract and divert donations to the insurgency preliminary policy recommendations subversion is perhaps most closely associated with coldwar era massbased marxistlenin ist groups while it is certainly true that communists from the time of lenin onward have used subversion wide variety of other violent underground movements continue to employ these tactics these range from ethnonationalist terroristssuch as euzkadi ta askatasuna basque fatherland and liberty which has operated hundreds of political front groups in spains basque region tremlett 2003 p 13to jihadis who have used muslim ngos such as the international islamic relief organization inc to covertly fund terrorist activities us congress 2005 p 17 islamicaegean 2000 there are indications that elements within movements like the muslim brotherhood and ht which serve as terrorist recruitment pools and as covert transmission belts for radical ideologies are attempting to inﬁltrate the civil service the judiciary student groups and such private companies as international business machines in britain and elsewhere aivd 2004 pp 4041 zeyno baran 2005 p 72 and malik 2005 p 10 inﬁltration of government ministries and the security forces the use of front groups and fomenting civil unrest are likely to remain key elements of the subversive repertoire of the terrorist and the insurgent indeed even within the united states itself terrorist inﬁltration of police forces poses very real threat according to the deputy chief of the angeles police department berkow 2004 21 in sum subversion cannot be dismissed as cold war problem irrelevant to the global war on terror or the long war developing more complete understanding of how terrorists and insurgents use subver sion is an obvious ﬁrst step in developing more eﬀective responses more research is needed since the systematic study of subversion has long been neglected for the reasons argued in this paper subversion is likely to remain an important element of insurgency but additional research is required to more fully understand subversion as it is evolving in the 21st centuryfor example how do insurgents employ the internet for subversive ends what role may islamic institutions such as mosques schools and cultural centers be playing in underground struggles and how are prisons as prime recruiting grounds functioning as hothouses of subversion statesponsored subversion as discussed above was feature of the cold war but as 20the government of martins successor stephen harper designated the ltte as terrorist group on april 10 2006 21in addition violent rightwing extremists have been inﬁltrating the us armed forces according to the southern pov erty law center holthouse 2006 and barry 1999 quoted in holthouse 2006 14 subversion and insurgency irans ongoing support for shia violence in iraq shows it remains an instrument of statecraft exploring how and why states engage in subversion and how it diﬀers from state sponsorship in earlier periods should be part of this research agenda in short it is essential for analysts and policymakers to reconsider subversion and to do so in way that is not constrained by maoist or cold war conceptual straightjacket in which subversion is directed exclusively against the state in the meantime policymakers should consider how three core countersubversive capabil itiesci police capacity and public information strategiescould be enhanced regardless of how insurgent use of subversion evolves over time these tools are ones that any government facing nascent or fullblown insurgency will want to have as part of its countersubversion repertoire while considering these measures us government oﬃcials must be alert to the tensions that will inevitably arise between promoting eﬀective countersubversion abroad and american values particularly human rights strengthen counterintelligence qaeda operatives according to published accounts have penetrated the security services of several middle eastern countries bowers 2005 p 1 iraqs armed forces appear to be heavily inﬁltrated and given the prominent internal security role of the military in many developing countries it seems likely that terrorists and insurgents will continue to view this institution as an enticing target for subversion in iraq and the wider muslim world and in those nonmuslim countries with signiﬁcant muslim populations the penetration of key economic sectors educational institutions and charitable organizations is likely to remain an important insurgent objective countersubversion is branch of ci 22 unfortunately the us ci capacity developed during the cold war has atrophied within agencies such as the cia the federal bureau of investigation and dod ci has long been viewed as professional backwater for many people ci like the term subversion has unfortunate connotationscoldwar style paranoia the wilderness of mirrors and the relentless search for the enemy within both real and imagined in recent years ci has been starved of resources relative to other intelligence activities and as result according to the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction the silbermanrobb commission us ci remains fractured myopic and only marginally eﬀective the commission 2005 p 486 in the words of one senior us intelligence oﬃcial counterintelligence is not priority gertz 2006 p 1 ci includes variety of missions beyond countersubversion such as penetrating and dis rupting hostile intelligence services but ci provides an invaluable set of tools and tactics for identifying monitoring and neutralizing the subversive activities of terrorists and insurgents the revival of the countersubversion component of ci should include the development of doctrine which was virtually nonexistent even during the cold war with the exception of few 22countersubversion according to dod 2001 is that aspect of counterintelligence designed to detect destroy neu tralize or prevent subversive activities through the identiﬁcation exploitation penetration manipulation deception and repression of individuals groups or organizations conducting or suspected of conducting subversive activitiessubversion and insurgency 15 military manuals which were typically little more than laundry lists of tasks and objectives with little explanatory power new countersubversion doctrine could of course be used to train us personnel both military and civilian but it could also serve as the foundation for country or regionspeciﬁc manuals for assisting internal security personnel abroad build police capacity subversion is far more than just an intelligence problem welltrained professional police attuned to local conditions and capable of building and maintaining strong relationships with the public can play an invaluable role but if police are to be eﬀective they will also have to be trained to identify patternsto connect the dots to use the post911 clichéso that subversive activity can be spotted and neutralized eﬀective countersubversive policing creates detailed picture of community in way that allows anomaliesthe arrival of outsiders the inﬂux of large amounts of cash or the change in leadership of community groupto be detected in this respect countersubversive policing is form of community policing that identiﬁes emerging threats and works to neutralize them with the aid of local individuals and groups 23 countersubversive policing also entails criminal investigation but as dennis j duncanson 1971 p 18 concludes uncovering and neutralizing subversion goes well beyond routine detection there is farreaching conspiratorial network available to cover the culprits traces wit nesses and informants are frightened to speak without elaborate precautions while the detectives themselves may be exposed to the same perils as the people they are trying to free from fear improving police intelligence capabilities will also be crucial traditional police intelli gence focuses on building cases and ultimately making arrests eﬀective countersubversion on the other hand requires police oﬃcers to think more like intelligence personnel by moving beyond prosecutorial mentality and putting greater emphasis on understanding and disrupting subversive activities and organizations in addition good professional relationships between the police and intelligence services will also be crucial here the british special branch sb model may prove relevant in britain the sb sometimes termed political police serves as bridge between the mi5 and the conventional police among other things sb oﬃcers can translate intelligence information and requirements into terms that make sense to the cop on the beat at the same time sb can put police information into form that is useful to intelligence analysts 24 sb played leading role against anticolonial insurgencies in africa asia and the middle east and it could serve as template for building countersubversive police capabilities against new adversaries 25 23for more on the police role in counterterrorism see howard 2004 24for more on sb see ensum 2002 25for more on the sb role in the malayan emergency see sunderland 1964 16 subversion and insurgency develop public information strategies some aspects of countersubversion require covert or clandestine approaches eg develop ing human sources within the organizations engaged in subversion however in many cases exposing and publicizing subversive activities can do much to help neutralize them as kitson 1971 p 199 reminds us the once mysterious processes used by the organizers of subversion to turn section of people against its government have long ago been exposed for all to see since many of its leading practitioners have written at length about their tradecraft the ability to remain invisible is arguably the most powerful weapon at the disposal of the terrorist and insurgent this is particularly true during the early stages of the conﬂict when the state has an enormous material superiority but typically is unable to see the opposition losing that invisibility and being exposed to the gaze of authorities can be lethal for an underground movement committing terrorist acts and maintaining what gordon mccormick 2003 p 496 terms violent presence is essential for attracting recruits and resources and for sustaining the group over time but it brings with it the danger of exposure subversion is form of deception donations are solicited on false pretexts individuals are misled as to front groups true purpose and moraleshattering lies are spread within military units and government ministries public education campaign that exposes such deceit could do much to undercut the nonviolent elements of the insurgent or terrorist campaign 26 civil liberties and countersubversion distinguishing subversion from legitimate expressions of political dissent is problem only for democracies for totalitarian regimes all opposition is inherently subversive revel 1984 p 4 to build thorough understanding of the subversive underground ci operations will necessarily be directed against wide range of antigovernment groups some of which will be aversely aﬀected by these intelligence forays spjut 1978 p 64 countersubversion also entails more than simply identifying subversives and subversive activityit may very well require repression spjut 1978 p 61 according to robert thompson 1967 p 84 it is not the aim of the intelligence organization merely to penetrate the insurgent movement its aim inside its own country must be the total eradication of the threat and in the judgment of david galula 1964 p 68 intelligence operatives should inﬁltrate subversive organizations to disintegrate them from within for democratic states facing substantial subversive threats within its borders eg the netherlands the requirements of vigorous countersubversion campaign will create painful dilemmas and undemocratic consequences since countersubversion will almost certainly collide with the rights of free speech free association and related liberties in the case of authoritarian regimes facing serious subversive threats eg egypt pakistan and saudi arabia their rulers are likely to dismiss humanrights objections to their operations on the ground that such actions are essential for national survival but the united states should not dismiss such criticisms as mere expressions of woollyheaded ﬂabby liberalism although the united states is 26a similar point is made in hosmer and tanham 1986 p 11 subversion and insurgency 17 eager to build capacity in the socalled frontline states policymakers must also be alert to the fact that repression in lessthantotalitarian states at least can help fuel rebellion crenshaw 1995 p 19 27 finally us oﬃcials must be alert to the possible reemergence of chronic cold war problem namely the negative political consequences created by american support for repressive regimes in their foreign policies as at home democratic states must reconcile civil liberties and the requirements of countersubversion conclusion in the decade following the end of the cold war insurgency and counterinsurgency lan guished in obscurity of concern to only handful of military and civilian specialists insurgency and counterinsurgency never vanished from the worlds strategic landscape of course but policymakers and analysts were preoccupied with other national security challenges such as nuclear proliferation ethnic conﬂict and the rise of chinese power the outbreak of insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq and the wider post911 campaign against violent islamist extremism have aroused longdormant interest in insurgency and counterinsurgency searching for answers on library shelves military oﬃcers policy analysts and academic experts have dusted oﬀ the classic texts of david galula frank kitson and robert thompson and have reached even further back to reexamine t lawrences seven pillars of wisdom charles wil liam gwynns imperial policing and c callwells small wars these texts continue to have much to oﬀer todays practitioners scholars and analysts this is as true in the case of subversion and countersubversion as it is with other aspects of insurgency and counterinsurgency discussed in the classic works kitson 1971 p 78 for example stresses the importance of psychological operations since wars of subversion and countersubversion are fought in the last resort in the minds of the peoplea conclusion as true today as when it was written in 1971 but while these texts remain useful it is important to avoid the trap of seeing them as skeleton keys of insurgency and counterinsurgency that is as tools directly applicable at all times and in all places subversion is an enduring feature of insurgency but like other aspects of the phenomenon it has changed since the end of the cold war it will be the task of practitioners and analytical specialists to identify the nature and scope of those changes and what will be required to wage eﬀective countersubversion in the future 27karagiannis and mccauley 2006 p 321 note that repression is most likely to encourage social movement to adopt violent methods where the movement is excluded from institutional politics and suﬀers indiscriminate and reactive state repression emphasis in
