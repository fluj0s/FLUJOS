oversight and implementation and numerous products cited in that report the clean water act consists of two major parts one being the provisions which authorize federal financial assistance for municipal sewage treatment plant construction the other is the regulatory requirements that appl to industrial and municipal dischargers the act has been termed technologyfo rcing statute because of the rigorous demands placed on those who are regulated by it to achieve higher and higher levels of pollution abatement unde r deadlines specified in the law early on emphasis was on controlling discharges of conventional pollutants eg suspended solids or bacteria that are biode gradable and occur naturally in the aquatic environment while control of toxic pollu tant discharges has been key focus of water quality programs more recently prior to 1987 programs were primarily directed at point source pollution wastes discharged from discrete sources such as pipes and outfalls amendments in that year authorized measures to address nonpoint source pollution stormwater runoff from farm lands forests construction sites and urban areas now estimated to represent more than 50 of the nati ons remaining water pollution problems under this act federal jurisdiction is br oad particularly rega rding establishment of national standards or ffluent limitations certain responsibilities are delegated to the states and the act em bodies philosophy of federal state partnership in which the federal government sets the agenda and standards for pollution abatement while states carry out daytoday activities of implementation and enforcement to achieve its objectives the act embodies the concept that all discharges into the nations waters are unlawful unless specifically authorized by permit which is the acts principal enforcement tool the law has civil criminal and administrative enforcement provisions and also permits citizen suit enforcement financial assistance for c

appropriations to suppor t the law generally expired at the end of fy1990 september 30 1990 programs did not lapse however and congress has continued to appr opriate funds to carry out the act since the 1987 amendments although congress has enacted several bills that reauthor ize and modify number of individual provisions in the law none co mprehensively addre ssed major programs or requirements background the federal water pollution control ac t of 1948 was the first comprehensive statement of federal interest in clean water programs and it specifically provided state and local governments with techni cal assistance funds to address water pollution problems including research wa ter pollution was viewed as primarily state and local problem hence there were federally required goals objectives limits or even guidelines when it came to enforcement federal involvement was strictly limited to matters invol ving interstate waters and only with the consent of the state in which the pollution originated during the latter half of the 1950s and well into the 1960s water pollution control programs were shaped by four laws which amended the 1948 statute they dealt largely with federal assistance to municipal dischargers and with federal enforcement programs for all dischargers during this period the federal role and federal jurisdiction were gradually extended to include navigable intrastate as well as interstate waters water quality standards became feature of the law in 1965 requiring states to set standards for interstate waters that would be used to determine actual pollution levels and control require ments by the late 1960s there was widespread perception that existing enforcement procedures were too time consuming and that the water quality sta ndards approach was flawed because of difficulties in linking particular discharger to violations of stream quality standards additionally there was mounting frustration over the slow pace of pollution cleanup efforts and suspicion that control t echnologies were being developed but not applied to the problems these percepti ons and frustrations along with increased public interest in environm ental protection set the stage for the 1972 amendments the 1972 statute did not continue the ba sic components of previous laws as much as it set up new ones it set optimistic and ambitious goals required all municipal and industrial wastewater to be treated before being discharged into waterways increased federal assistance fo r municipal treatment plant construction strengthened and streamlined enforcement and expanded the federal role while retaining the responsibility of states fo r daytoday implementation of the law the 1972 legislation declared as its obj ective the restorati on and maintenance of the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters two goals also were established zero discharge of pollutants by 1985 and as an interim goal and where possible water quality that is both fishable and swimmable by mid1983 while those dates have passed the goals remain and efforts to attain them continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30030crs3 overview the clean water act cwa today consists of two major parts one being the title ii and title vi provisions which authorize federal financial assistance for municipal sewage treatment plant construction the other is the regulatory requirements found throughout the act th at apply to industrial and municipal dischargers the act has been termed technologyfo rcing statute because of the rigorous demands placed on those who are regulated by it to achieve higher and higher levels of pollution abatement industries were given until july 1 1977 to install best practicable control technology bpt to clean up waste discharges municipal wastewater treatment plants were required to meet an equivalent goal termed secondary treatment by that date municipalities ble to achieve secondary treatment by that date were allowed to apply for casebycase extensions up to july 1 1988 according to epa 86 of all c ities met the 1988 deadline the remainder were put under administrativ or courtordered schedul requiring compliance as soon as possible however many cities c ontinue to make inve stments in building or upgrading facilities needed to ach ieve secondary treatment and f unding needs remain high see discussion below cities that discharge wastes into marine waters were eligible for casebycase waivers of th secondary treatment requirement where sufficient showing could be made that natural factors provide significant elimination of traditional forms of pollution and that bot h balanced populations of fish shellfish and wildlife and water quality standards would be protected the primary focus of bpt was on cont rolling discharges of conventional pollutants such as suspended solids bioc hemical oxygen demanding materials fecal coliform and bacteria and ph these pollutants are substances which are biodegradable ie bacteria can break th em down occur naturally in the aquatic environment and deplete the dissolved oxygen concentration in water which is necessary for fish nd other aquatic life the act mandated greater pollutant clea nup than bpt by later than march 31 1989 generally re quiring that industry use the bes t available technology bat that is economically achievable bat level controls generally focus on toxic substances compliance extensions of as long as tw years are available for industrial sources utilizing innovative or alterna tive technology failure to meet statutory deadlines could lead to enforcement action the act utilizes both water quality sta ndards and technolog ybased effluent limitations to protect water quality t echnologybased effl uent limitations are specific numerical limitations established by epa and placed on certain pollutants from certain sources they are applied to industrial and municipal sources through numerical effluent limitations in discharge permits see discussion of permits regulation and enforcement below water qua lity standards are standards for the overall quality of water they consist of the designated beneficial use or uses of waterbody recreation water supply industr ial or other plus numerical or narrative statement identifying maximum concentrations of various pollutants which would not interfere with the designated use the act requires each state to establishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30030crs4 water quality standards for all bodies of water in the stat these standards serve as the backup to federally set technologybased requirements by indicating where additional pollutant controls are needed to achieve the overall goals of the act in waters where industrial and municipal sources have achieve d technologybased effluent limitations yet water quality standards have not been met dischargers may be required to meet additional pollution control requirements for each of these waters the act requires states to set total maximum daily load tmdl of pollutants at level that ensures that applicable water quality standards can be attained and maintained tmdl is both planning process for attaining water quality standards and quantitative assessment of pollution problems sources and pollutant reductions needed to restore and protect river stream or lake based on state reports epa estimates that nearly 34000 us waters are impaired and require preparations of tmdls control of toxic pollutant discharges has been key focus of water quality programs in addition to the bpt and bat national standards st ates are required to implement control strategies for waters expected to remain polluted by toxic chemicals even after industria l dischargers have installe d the best available cleanup technologies required under th law development of management programs for these postbat pollutant problems was prominent element in the 1987 amendments and is key continui ng aspect of cwa implementation prior to the 1987 amendments programs in the clean water act were primarily directed at point source po llution wastes discharged fro m discrete nd identifiable sources such as pipes and other outfalls in contrast except for general planning activities little atten tion had been given to nonpoint source pollution stormwater runoff from agricultural lands forests cons truction sites and urban areas despite estimates that it represents more than 50 of the nations remaining water pollution problems as it travels across land surface towards rivers and streams rainfall and snowmelt runoff picks up pollutants includi ng sediments toxic materials and conventional wastes eg nutrients that can degrade water quality the 1987 amendments authorized measures to address such pollution by directing states to deve lop and implement nonpoint po llution management programs section 319 of the act st ates were encouraged to pursue groundwater protection activities as part of their ove rall nonpoint pollution control fforts federal financial assistance was authorized to support monstration projects and actual control activities these grants may cover up to 60 of program implementation costs while the act imposes great technological demands it also recognizes the need for comprehensive research on water quality problems this is provided throughout the statute on topics including polluti on in the great lakes and chesapeake bay inplace toxic pollutants in harbors and navigable waterways and water pollution resulting from mine drainage the act also provides support to train personnel who operate and maintain wastewater treatment facilities federal and state responsibilities under this act federal jurisdiction is broad particularly regarding establishment of national standards or effluent limitations the environmental protection agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30030crs5 epa issues regulations containing the bpt and bat effluent standards applicable to categories of industrial sources such as iron and steel manufacturing organic chemical manufacturing petroleum refining and others certain responsibilities can be assumed by qualified states in lieu of epa and this act like other environmental laws embodies philosophy of federalst ate partnership in which the federal government sets the agenda and standards for pollution abatement while states carry out daytoday activities of implementation and enfor cement responsibilities under the act which may be carried out by qualif ied states include authority to issue discharge permits to industries and muni cipalities and to enforce permits as of november 2008 46 states had been authoriz ed to administer this permit program epa issues discharge permits in the remain ing states in addition as noted above states are responsible for blishing water quality standards titles ii and vi municipal wastewater treatment construction federal law has authorized grants for planning design and construction of municipal sewage treatment facilities since 1956 act of july 9 1956 or pl 84660 congress gr eatly expanded this grant program in 1972 in order to assist cities in meeting the acts pollution control requirements since that time congress has authorized 65 billion nd appropriated more than 78 billion in cwa funds to aid wastewater treatment pl ant construction grants ar allocated among the states according to complex statutor formula that combines tw factors state population and an estimate of municipa l sewage treatment funding needs derived from survey conducted periodically by epa and the stat the most recent estimate published in 2008 indicated that 2025 billion more w ould be required to build and upgrade municipal wastewater treatment plants in the united states and for other types of water quality improvement projects that are eligible for funding under the act an 8 increase over the previous estimate from four years earlier under the title ii construction gran ts program establishe d in 1972 federal grants were made for several types of projects such as secondary or more stringent treatment and associated sewers based on priority list established by the states grants were generally available for as much as 55 of total project costs for projects using innovative or alternative t echnology such as reuse or recycling of water as much as 75 federal funding was allowed recipien ts were responsible for nonfederal costs but were not required to repay federal grants policymakers have debated the tension between assisting municipal funding needs which remain large and the impact of aid programs such as the clean water acts on federal spending nd budget deficits in the 1987 amendments to the act congress attempted to deal with that appa rent conflict by exte nding federal aid for wastewater treatment construction th rough fy1994 yet provi ding transition towards full state and local government re sponsibility for financing after that date grants under the previous title ii progra m were authorized through fy1990 under title vi of the act grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds or loan programs we re authorized beginning in fy1989 to replace the title ii grants states contribute matching funds and under the re volving loan fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30030crs6 concept monies used for wastewater treatment construction will be repaid to state fund to be available for future construc tion in other communities all states now have functioning loan programs but the sh ift from federal grants to loans has been easier for some than others the new fi nancing requirements have been problem for cities especially small towns that have difficulty repaying project loans statutory authorization for grants to cap italize state loan programs expired in 1994 however congress has conti nued to provide annual ppropriations an issue affecting some cities is overflow discharges of inadequately treated wastes from municipal sewers and how c ities will pay for costly reme diation projects in 2000 congress amended the act to authorize twoyear 15 billion grant program to help cities reduce these wet weather flows authorization for that wet weather grant program expired at the end of fy2003 and has not been renewed permits regulations and enforcement to achieve its objectives the act embodies the concept that all discharges into the nations waters are unlawful unless specifically authorized by permit thus more than 65000 industrial and municipal dischargers must obtain permits from epa or qualified states under the acts national pollutant di scharge elimination system npdes program authorized in s ection 402 of the act an npdes permit requires the discharger source to attain technologybased effluent limits bpt or bat for industry secondary treatment for m unicipalities or more stringent for water quality protection permits specify the control technology applicable to each pollutant the effluent limitations discharger must meet and the deadline for compliance sources are required to main tain records and to carry out effluent monitoring activities permits are issued for more than five years and must be renewed thereafter to llow continued discharge the npdes permit incorporates numerical effluent limitations issued by epa the initial bpt limitations focused on regu lating discharges of conventional pollutants such as bacteria and oxygenconsuming materials the more stringent bat limitations emphasize controlling toxic pollutants heavy metals pesticides and other organic chemicals in addition to these limitations applicable to categories of industry epa has issued water quality criteria for more than 115 pollutants including 65 named classes or categories of toxic chemicals or priority pollutants these criteria recommend ambient or overall concentration levels for the pollutants and provide guidance to states for establishing water quality standards that will achieve the goals of the act separate type of permit is required to dispose of dredged or fill material in the nations waters including wetlands aut horized by section 404 of the act this permit program is administered by the us army corps of engineers subject to and using epas environmental guidance some types of activities are exempt from permit requirements including certain farming ranching and forestry practices which do not alter the use or character of the land some construction and maintenance and activities ready regulated by states under other provisions of the act epa may delegate certain secti on 404 permitting respons ibility to qualified states and has done so twice michigan nd new jersey for some time the actshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30030crs7 wetlands permit program has been one of the most controversial parts of the law some who wish to develop wetlands maintain that federal regulation intrudes on and impedes private landuse decisions while nvironmentalists seek more protection for remaining wetlands and limits on activities that ta ke place in wetlands nonpoint sources of pollution which epa nd states believe are responsible for the majority of water quality impairments in the nation are not subject to cwa permits or other regulatory requirements under federal law th ey are covered by state programs for the management of runoff under section 319 of the act other epa regulations under the cwa include guidelines on using and disposing of sewage sludge and guidelines for discharging pollutants from landbased sources into the ocean related w the ocean dumping act 33 usc 1401 45 regulates the intentional disposal of wastes into ocean waters epa also provides guidance on technologies that will achieve bpt bat and other effluent limitations the npdes permit containing effluent limitations on what may be discharged by source is the acts principal enforcement tool epa may issue compliance order or bring civil suit in us district court against persons who violate the terms of permit the penalty for such vi olation can be as much as 25000 per day stiffer penalties are authorized for criminal violations of the act for negligent or knowing violations of as much as 50000 per day three years imprisonment or both fine of as much as 250000 15 years in prison or both is authorized for knowing endangerment violations that knowingly place another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury finally epa is authorized to assess civil penalties administratively for certain welldocumented violations of the law these civil and criminal enforcement provisions are contained in section 309 of the act epa working with the army corps of engineers also has responsibility for enforcing against entities who fail to obt ain or comply with section 404 permit while the cwa addresses federal enforcement the majority of actions taken to enforce the law are undertaken by states both because states issue the majority of permits to dischargers and because the fe deral government lacks the resources for daytoday monitoring and enforcement like most other fe deral environmental laws cwa enforcement is shared by epa and states with states having primary responsibility however epa has oversight of state enforcement and retains the right to bring direct action where it believes that state has failed to take timely and appropriate action or where state or local agency request s epa involvement finally the federal government acts to enforce against criminal violations of the federal law in addition individuals may bring citizen suit in us district court against persons who violate prescr ibed effluent standard or limitation individuals also may bring citizen suits against the administr ator of epa or equivalent state official where program responsibility s been delegated to the state for failure to carry out nondiscretionary duty under the acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30030crs8 selected
