states pay for cash we lfare for needy families with children but it funds wide array of dditional activities tanf wa s created in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 tanf funding and program authority were extended through fy2010 by the deficit reduc tion act of 2005 dra pl 109171 tanf provides basic block grant of 165 billion to the 50 states and district of columbia and 01 billion to us terr itories additionally 17 states qualify for supplemental grants that total 319 million t anf also requires states to contribute from their own funds at least 104 billion for benefits and servi ces to needy families with children this is known as the ma intenanceofeffort moe requirement states may use tanf and moe funds in any manner reasonably calculated to achieve tanfs statutory purpose this purpose is to increase state flexibility to achieve four goals 1 provide assistance to needy families with children so that they can live in their own homes or the homes of relatives 2 end dependence of needy parents on government benef its through work job preparation and marriage 3 reduce outofwedlock pregnancies and 4 promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families though tanf is block grant there are some strings attached to states use of funds particularly for fa milies receiving assistance ssentially cash welfare states must meet tanf work participati on standards or be pe nalized by reduction in their block grant the law sets standards stipulating that at least 50 of all families and 90 of twoparent families must be participating but these statutory standards are reduced for declines in the cash welfare caseload some families are excluded from the participation rate cal culation activitie s creditable toward meeting these standards are focused on work or are intended to rapidly attach welfare recipients to the workforce education and training is limited federal tanf funds may not be used for family with an adult that has received assistance for 60 months this is the fiveyear time limit on welfare receipt however up to 20 of the caseload may be extended beyond the five years for reason of hardship with hardship define d by the states additionally states may use funds that they must spend to meet the tanf moe to aid families beyond five years tanf work participation rules nd time l imits do not appl to families receiving benefits and services

families tanf block grant provides federal grants to states for wide range of benefits and activities it is best known as the major source of funding for cash welfare for needy families with children however federal law allows tanf funds to be used for other benefits and services that provide economic help to lowinco families with children and support the goals of reducing outofwedlock pregnancies and promoting twoparent families the tanf program was created in th 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 most recently the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 extended funding and authority for tanf program operations through fy20101 at the federal level tanf is administered by the department of health and human services however be nefits and services are pr ovided by the states tanf

to helpachieve the purpose and goals of the tanf block grant rules that apply to states when they use tanf or moe funds toprovide cash welfare to needy families with children rules that apply to states when they use tanf or moe funds for benefits and services other than cash welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32748crs2 3 for current data and statistics on the tanf block grant see crs report rl32760 the temporary assistance for needy families tan f block grant responses to frequently asked questions by gene falk 4 before enactment of the deficit reduc tion act of 2005 pl 109171 tanf included two bonus funds states competed for up to 200 million per year in high performance bonus funds second tanf bonus totaling 100 million per year was paid to the five states with the greatest reduction in outofwe dlock birth ratios that also had decline in abortions both of these bonuses were re pealed by the deficit reduction act of 2005 beginning with fy2006 5 under the law basic block grant amounts for each state are the same as provided for in the original 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 the national total state grant and each states individual grant in the original tanf law is based on the federal share of expenditures in the pre1996 afdc emergenc assistance ea and job opportunities and basic skills jobs training programs the original formula entitled each state to the continuedcertain accountability requirements th at apply to states including requirements that states submit plans and report data to the federal government and provisions of tanf law not directly related to grants to states such as competitive grants for promoting healthy marriage and responsible fath erhood tribal tanf provisi ons and research funds3 federal grants and state funds though tanf is called block grant it has relatively complicated financing system there are three tanf grants to states basic bloc k supplemental and contingency recessionrelated grants4 additionally states are required to spend certain amount of their own funds on sp ecified tanfrelated activities for needy families with children therefore the tanf financial system consists of both federal and state funds additionally there is funding for re search demonstrations and technical assistance for healthy marri age promotion and competitive grants for responsible fatherhood initiatives these funds which may go to other entities as well as to states are discussed in other tanf provisions late r in this report federal grants to states federal tanf grants are entitlements to the states the law entitles each state to specified amount of funding the dr provided an appr opriation in advance for the basic tanf block grant and contin gency funds through fiscal year fy 2010 but provided funding for tanf supplemental grants through only fy2008 pl 110275 extended funding for tanf supplemental grants through fy2009 basic block grant the 1996 welfare reform law entitled states to basic tanf block grant equal to peak expend itures for pretanf programs during the fy1992tofy1995 period5 the mid1990s were period when the cash welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32748crs3 5 continued greatest of the average federal share of expe nditures in these programs for fy1992 through fy1994 the federal share of expenditures for these programs in fy1994 adjusted for states that amended their ea programs in fy1994 or fy1995 or the federal share of expenditures for these programs in fy1995 the fy1994 adjust ment for ea program amendments is the amount by which the federal share of ea xpenditures in fy1995 exceeded that of fy1994rolls were at their alltime high the block grant amount is based on federal expenditures on the cash welfare emergency aid and job training programs for cash welfare families that existed in that period the basic bl ock grant is legislatively fixed that is it does not change when the cash assistance caseload decreases or increases nor is it adjusted for inflation supplemental grants during consideration of legislation that led to the 1996 law fixed funding based on historic expenditures was thought to disadvantage two groups of states 1 those that d relatively high population growth and 2 those that had historically low welfare grants relative to poverty in the state therefore additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of high population growth andor low historic grants per poor person total of 17 states shown in table 1 below qualify for supplemental grants table 1 shows the basic tanf block grant and

health and human services hhshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32748crs5 6 pl 10968 the tanf emergency response and recovery act of 2005 allowed states to draw upon the contingency fund to aid families evacuated from states damaged by hurricane katrina states received 100 federal funding for fam ilies evacuated from hurricanedamaged state to another host state this was temporary measure for the period september 2005 through august 2006 see crs report rs22246 temporary assistance for needy families tanf its role in response to the effects of hurricane katrina by gene falk 7 for example if state was eligible for contin gency funds for three months in fiscal year its proration factor would be onefourth threetwelfth if it was eligible for contingency funds for six months in fiscal year its pr oration factor would be onehalf sixtwelfth state eligible for contingency funds all year would not have its annual entitlement to funds prorated ie it would receive the full amountcontingency funds the fixed basic grant under tanf also led to concerns that funding might be inad equate during econo mic downturns thus tanf includes additional matching contingency funds that can be used to provide additional funding during recessionary periods if certain conditions are met6 to draw upon contingency funds state must both 1 meet test of economic n eed and 2 increase spending from its own funds above what the state spent in fy1994 on cash emergency assistance and job training in tanfs predecessor programs for purposes of the tanf contingency fund state meets the economic need test if its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate averaged over the most recent threemonth period is at least 65 and at least 10 higher than its rate in the corresponding th reemonth period in either of the previous two years or its food stamp caseload over the mo st recent threemonth period is at least 10 higher than the ad justed food stamp caseload in the corresponding threemonth period in fy1994 or fy1995 for this purpose fy1994 and fy1995 caseloads are adjusted by subtracting out an estimate of participants who would have been made ineligible for food stamps under the 1996 welf are law eg noncitizens had it been in effect in those years monthly payments from the contingenc fund are limited to onetwelfth of 20 of states basic block grant and states may receive these monthly payments on an advance basis however the actual amount of contingency funds state is entitled to for the year depends on 1 how much it spends in advance contingency funds and state funds over the fy1994 threshold 2 its medicaid matching rate and 3 the number of months the state was eligible for contingency funds states annual entitlement to contingency funds is calcula ted as the medicaid matching rate times the states extra spending above fy1994 am ounts during the fiscal year prorated by the number of months the state was ligible for contingency funds during the fiscal year7 state that receives more in monthly advances from the contingency fund than it is entitled to for the year must remit overpayments to the federal treasury state may not receive more in contingenc funds for the year than the

fy1994 or fy1995 st ate expenditures in the pre1996 child care programs analysis of combined federal nd state funding or expenditures under the tanf and child care block grants must recognize th at some state spending can be doublecounted or it will overstate the amount of funding ava ilable or the amount of spending from the two block grants the minimum amount of t anf moe funds that cannot be

maintenanceofeffort or moe requirement tanf consolidated and replaced programs that provided matching grants to the states under the pretanf cash welfar program federal funding was generally provided at the medicaid matching rate b etween 50 and 83 to reimburse states for share of their expenditures in the program8 this meant that there were considerable state dollars contributing to the pretanf programs it also meant that the federal and state shares financing these programs varied by state as the medicaid matching rate is higher in states with lower percapita incomes than higher percapita incomes tanf requires states to maintain sp ending from their own funds on tanf or tanfrelated activities states are required in the aggregate to maintain at least 104 billion in spending on specified ac tivities for needy families with children the 104 billion called the maintenanceo feffort moe level represents 75 of what was spent from state funds in fy1994 in tanfs predecessor programs of cash emergency assistance job training and welfarerelated child care spending9 states are required to maintain their own spending of at least that level and the moe requirement increases to 80 of fy1994 spe nding for states that fail to meet tanf work participation require ments discussed below state expenditures under this requirement are often referre d to as state moe funds states failure to meet the moe requirement results in penalty the penalty is reduction in states subsequent years block grant by 1 for each 1 shortfall from the required spending level table 2 shows both federal tanf and

governments to address broad purposes block grants also typically give governmental entities discretion in both fining problems and expending funds to address them10 in general sense tanf meets this definition of block grant but its financing is complex d iscussed above and it does ttach some strings to states use of tanf funds discussed below using federal tanf grants federal tanf grants may be

appropriation bill continuedachieving tanf goals tanf allows states to expend funds in any manner reasonably calculated to achieve its statutory purpose within its state tanf program tanfs purpose is to increase state flexibility to meet specified goals its four statutory goals are to 1 provide assistance to needy families so that children can be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives 2 end dependence of needy parents on go vernment benefits through work job preparation and marriage 3 reduce the incidence of outofwedlock pregnancies and4 promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families the four goals of tanf encompass what is usually thought of as traditional cash welfare assistance to families and work activities for cash welfare families however

receiving assistance within the st ate tanf program versus in separate state programs separate state programs are statefunded programs with expenditures counted toward the tanf mo but the state has made decision to consider as distinct from the state tanf program definition of assistance federal tanf law doe s not define assistance however the department of health and human services hhs defines assistance in regulation as payment to families to m eet ongoing basic needs such as food clothing shelter utilities household goods personal care items and other personal expenses14 generally such

states have broad leeway to define eligibility for tanf cash assistance states determine actual income eligibility standards to determine whether family is needy and can determine other conditions and

performance measures computed in the aggregate for each state which require that specified percentage of families be considered engaged in specified activities for minimum number of hours state that fails to meet tanf work participation standards is penalized by reduction in its block grant the penalty is 5 reduction in the block grant for the first years failure to meet the standard and increased by 2 percentage points each year that is total reduction of 7 in the second year and 9 in the third year etc up to maximum penalty of 21 however the law requires that this penalty be based on the degree of noncompliance he nce actual penalties may be lower than the amounts set in statute further penaltie s may be reduced if state is in recession based on the contingency f unds i

further federal law explicitly allows state to use state moe funds to aid family beyond the time limit tanf penalizes states that have more than 20 of their caseload on the rolls for more than five years the penalty is 5 reduction in the block grant however it is unlikely that state will breach th 20 limit of families because of its ability to assist families beyond five years with state moe

activity comes under the fair labor st andards acts flsa definition of employment for activities covered by minimum wage rules the maximum number of hours of participation allo wed would be the grant divided by the minimum wage in some cases this could result in fewer hours than required to meet tanf participation standards states determine tanf benef it amounts which also often vary by family size moreover most states reduce tanf benefits for other income eg social security and unemployment insurance the reduced benefit may be smaller than needed to comply with both minimum wage requirements and tanf participation standards the may 1997 dol guidance provided th at if state has food stamp workfare program the state may count the value of both tanf and food stamp benefits received by family when dete rmining the maximum number of workfare hours the hhs regulations issued on february 5 2008 provide that workfare recipient may be deemed to meet the core tanf work participati on hours standard if the state has simplified food stamp program that aligns food stamp and tanf work rules and if the maximum number of work fare hours based on both tanf and food stamp benefits is still below that required to comply with tanf work participation standards
