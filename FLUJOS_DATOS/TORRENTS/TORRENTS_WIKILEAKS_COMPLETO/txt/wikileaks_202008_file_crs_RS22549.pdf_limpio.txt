states the district of columbia puerto rico and the us territories population data are from annual population estimates published by the us census th reference date for estimates is july 1 there is twoyear time lag between the refe rence year of the population estimates and the respective appropriation year for example in fy2006 state allotments based on the population aged 60 and olde r were calculated using 2004 estimates for the purpose of determining state allotments the law requires that allotments meet two criteria the first criterion is that states including the district of columbia andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22549crs3 3 guam and the us virgin islands are allotted less than onequarter of 1 of the total grant appropriation and american samoa and the commonw ealth of the northern

unsuccessful attempts to reauthorize the oaa by the 104th and 105th congresses the 106th congress approved the older americans ac t amendments of 2000 hr 782 pl 106501 signed nov 13 2000 the t itle iii funding formula was controversial issue during the six years of congressional debate on reauthorizationpuerto rico receive minimum amount of funds which is defined as half of 1 of the total grant appropriation for the respective fiscal year3 the second criterion is the hold rmless provision prior to the 2006 reauthorization if funding exceeded the fy 2000 amount states received less than their fy2000 allotment plus 20 of the percen tage increase above the fy2000 program appropriation for each of the four programs the latter provision is often referred to as the guaranteed growth provision if funding for given year was equal to or less than fy2000 states received an allotment in pr oportion to their respective fy2000 allotments oaa amendments of 2000 the way in which the aoa distributed title iii funds to states was concern for c ongress in the 2000 reauthorization4 1994 general accounting office now the government accountability office or gao report found that the method aoa used did not distribute funds using th most recent population data5 instead aoa allotted funds to states first according to an amount equal to their fy1987 hold harmless alloca tions with the remainder of the appropriations allotted to states based on their relative share of the populati on aged 60 and over according to the most recently available estimates of state populati on this negatively affected states with fastergrowing older populations since the majority of funds we re being distributed according to population estimates that did not reflect the most recent trends the gao report recommended that aoa re vise its methodology for distributing funds to states in response to these concerns the 2000 r eauthorization resulted in the following changes to the law 1 congress clarified the law to ensure that firs t funds were allotted to states based on the most recent population data6 2 congress created an fy2000 hold harmless requirement thereby ensuring that state would receive less than it received in fy2000 and 3 congress created the gua ranteed growth prov ision ensu ring that all states would receive share of any appropriations increase over the fy2000 level oaa amendments of 2006 the title iii funding formula became major point of contention for the 109th congress during the 2006 reaut horization deba congress revisited the fy2000 hold rmless requirement and g uaranteed growth provision these issues divided members from states with relatively fastergrowing elderly populations from lawmakers repres enting states with relatively slower growth in their older populations highgrowth states argu ed that the holdha rmless provisions in current law provided protections to states whose populations were not increasing as fast as others resulting in an inequitable distri bution of funds that disadvantage highgrowth stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22549crs4 7 guam and the us virgin islands are allotted less than onequarter of 1 of the total grant appropriation and

older americans act programs funding and 2006 reauthorization pl 109365 by carol oshaughnessy and angela napilithe 2006 reauthorization ultimate ly resulted in changes to the law as follows 1 congress changed the formula to ensure th at provided sufficient funds every state receives at least its fy2006 amount creating new fiscal year hold harmless amount and 2 congress phased out the guaranteed growth provision reducing the share of any increase in appropriations by 5 percentage points annually beginning in fy2008 over the next four years the guaranteed growth provisions will be 20 of the percentage increas in appropriations from fy2006 to fy2007 15 of the percentage increas in appropriations from fy2006 to fy2008 10 of the percentage increas in appropriations from fy2006 to fy2009 and 5 of the percentage increase in appropriations from fy2006 tofy2010 in fy2011 the formula will not include the guaranteed growth provision thus the formula will be as follows 1 states will receive an allotment based on their population formula factor 2 states will receive minimum grant amount of at least half of 1 and 3 states will receive less than their fy2006 allotments allocation for nutrition services incentive grants funds for nutrition services incentive grants are allotted to stat based on formula that takes into account the number of meals served by each stat nutrition program in the

provision to update the hold harmless year in the title v formula from fy2000 to fy2006 however the senate bill s 3570 did not in clude this provision the compromise bill hr 6197 enacted into law made changes to the title v formula the following describes the title v formula allocation10 before allocation of funds to states dol is required to reserve funds as follows up to 15 of the total

northern mariana islands and such amount as may be necessary for national grants to public or private organizations serving eligib indians and pacific island and asian americans after these reservations the remaining f unds are divided into two amounts one for all state agency grantees and the other for all national organization grantees the allocation for these amounts is dependent on pr ogram funding if funds for given year are equal to their fy2000 level then amounts t aside for all state agency and all national organization grantees are in proportion to th eir respective fy2000 levels if funds for given year are less than their fy2000 levels then total amounts for the state and national grantees are reduced proportionately if f unds for given year exceed the fy2000 level up to 35 million of the excess is to be distributed as follows 75 of the excess is to be provided for all state agency grantees and 25 of the excess is to be provided to all national organization grantees any fundi ng amount over 35 million that remains is to be distributed 5050 to all state agency nd national organization grantees respectively11 once the national totals for state agency and national organization grantees have been determined the same formula is used to determine the state agency allotment and the national organization allotment for each state each allotment is distributed to states based on formula factor that takes into acc ount 1 states relative share of the total us population 55 years and olde r includes the district of columbia and puerto rico and 2 the relative state per capita income the formula factor is the number of persons aged 55 and older in the state multiplied by the inverse of the states per capita income index the inverse per capita
