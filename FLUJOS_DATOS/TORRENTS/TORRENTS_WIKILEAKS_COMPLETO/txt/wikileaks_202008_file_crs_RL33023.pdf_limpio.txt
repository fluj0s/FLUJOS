publishing and citation archives background and controversy summary controversies about open access publishing and archiving confront issues of copyright and governmental competition with the private sector traditional publishers typically charge readers subscriber fees to fund the costs of publishing and distributing hardcopy andor online journa ls in contrast most open access systems charge authors publication fees and give readers free online access to the full text of articles supporters of the open access movement object to the rising costs of journal subscriptions share peer reviewers reluctance to do free reviews for journals rapidly escalating in price and believe that scientific collaboration advancement and utilization will be hastened by free access to informati on traditional subscriberpays commercial publishers and some scholarly associations object to most open access publishing because it may weaken the publis hing industry and er ode profits critics seek to limit free governmentrun repositories only to articles and citations from federally sponsored research others oppose f ees in the thousands of dollars charged to authors to pay the costs of publishing articles or view as unreliable foundation donations that sustain some open access activities in response to congressional action in 2004 and 2005 the national institutes of health nih implemented policy that requires authors it funds to voluntarily submit copies of their manuscripts to nihs free access electronic database pubmed central pmc as soon as possible after journa l accepts the article for publication but within 12 months the policy allows publisherimposed embargo or delay before allowing free public access to the manuscript many publishers oppose this policy and there is

traditional subscriberpays publishing the publisher who holds the copyright to an article pays most printing and distribution costs and in order to read an article the journal subscriber pays fees whether for hardcopy or online versions sometimes an author is required to pay printing page charges for complex graphics or color presentations open access publishing generally means that the author or publisher who holds the copyright to an article grants all users unlimited free access to and license to copy and distribute work publishe d in an open access journal which may be published initially electronically or in hardcopy users can also make copies for their personal use if author ship is properly attributed4 open access publishing often requires an author to pay for publishing or posting of paper estimates of fees charged vary but generally range from about 500 to 4000 these charges may be paid by individual authors or by institutions pursuant to institutional subscription contracts with open access journals that cover publication charges for all authors affiliated with that institution typica lly open access publishers require that complete version of the work and related materials be deposited electronically in an online database that permits open access distribution interoperability allowing users to extract and use the data in othe r research and longterm

sponsors such as the federal government and that allowing these sponsors to shift support to pay fo r open access publishing will not cost more and will provide more benefits to society for instance asking research sponsors to pay for publication of the research they support may seem to impose new financial burdens on the government agencies foundations universities and companies that sponsor research but these organizations already pay most of the costs of scientific publishing huge fraction of the us 9 billion annual revenue of scientific medical and technology journals comes from subscriptions site licenses and pub lication fees ultimately billed to grants or employers much of the rest is borne by society in the form of increments to university tuitions healthcare costs includi ng drug prices and state and federal taxes that subsidize healthcare libraries and education surely the cost of open access digital publishing cannot in total be more than we are already paying under the subscription and licensing mode l by simply changing the way we support the scientific publishing enterpri the scientific community and public would preserve everything we value in sc ientific publishing and gain all of the benefits of open access51 in opposition some say if the government paid such costs money would be diverted inappropriately from research to publishing some universities say their costs will increase if they need to reimburse researchers to pay author fees for open access journals and if they s till have to pay high costs fo r subscriptions to traditional journals52 in addition some young scientists investigators say that business models that force authors to pay for publication in open access journals could hurt them since they often have smaller gran ts and an authorpays model could amount to tax for productivity 53 another issue is that in some applicationsoriented fields such as medicine engineering computer sc ience management and pharmacy users of journals including open access materials are often private sector parties who read the journals but likely would not be au thors who would contribute to journal publication costs as result

original bill negotiated after faculty moves to boycott elsevier journals if the original bill price were not reduced59 reportedly sometime s sales are increased by publishers forcing libraries to subscribe to more than they want because publishers often bundle journal subscriptions into large contract s often not well matche d with institutional research interests60 this includes bundling together journals that are made available electronically in database systems that access current and archived journals bundling of this sort can force libraries to pay for access to the same journal several times if it is included in more than one database to which the library subscribes61 rising journal subscription costs it is argued are too expensive making it difficult for libraries especially university libraries and the public to afford many journals62 and forcing them to sacrifice spendi ng on other media reportedly rick johnson former director of the schola rly publishing and

contri butions and what w ill happen if foundation contributions are ever reduced it has b een reported that seve ral journals which attempted to provide free access to readers reversed policies due to falling subscription rates and revenues for print journals th journals reportedly included the journal of high energy physics which published online for free for six years it originally did not charge authors fee but ultimately decided to impose subscription fee of about 1000 year for readers67 there is also question of whether if publishing patterns and revenue sources change publishers

to publish their journals reap considerable profits from their share of journal revenues they then use these profits to support societies activities which can include advocacy and ssistance to new resear chers in the field critics of this practice say that these professional associations need to find different business models or alternative ways to ra ise money to support their activities instead of using publishing profits which are base d on payments from subscribers university libraries and in many cases indir ect costs of federally funded rd on the other hand revenues to scientific societies may not decrease since at least according to one professional associa tion the rise of online publishing does not reduce subscriptions to print journals for instance according to the american physical society aps which receives journal publishing profits preprints of articles in physics computer scien ce and mathematics are published on arxivorg an open and publicly accessible archive the editorin chief of the american physical society reportedly said that there has been decline in the subscriber base of journals in those disciplines in fact the contrary is true he sai d he explained aps journals have very liberal copyright policy that gives back to the author the right to post articles on eprint servers even before journal publication they also allow authors to update articles on the servers using the corrected journal form after publication 69 commercial and open access publisher practices proponents of open access ve alleged that some traditional publishers practices limit equitable access to scientific informati on these practices include restrictive licensing terms overriding copy right and fair use practices controls on longterm archival access to electronic content and selective deletions of published articles from data base and epublications70 traditional subscriberpays publishers often disagree and say that they are beginning to adopt some features of open access publishing including but not limited to developing multimedia enhancements allowing authors to selfarc hive their articles and improved content search capabilities journal enhancements some traditional publishers like many open access publishers have taken st eps to enhance the content of journal articles they post online by permitting digital access pe rmitting access

traditional publishers have wide variety of policies regarding free access to the articles they publish the british medical journal bmj for instance allows free access to all readers for all materials in its journal for one week afte r publication after that non subscribers have free online access only to original research articles that were published in the hardcopy journal only paying subscribers can access editorials and news articles published in th journals and articles th at are published only in an online version after year access is free to all bmj materials generally traditional publishers may permit free acce ss to journal articles anyw here from few months to two years after publication proponents of open access have argued that the public or other researchers should not have to wait year or mo re to have access to research findings especially for biomedical research findings that could be used to improve patients health outcome another view is that limited access to the full text of research articles is bad for science such restrictions make it di fficult for researchers to build on the entirety of what has gone before and for readers to check whether they have done so the practice might contribut to citation bias since authors will only reference journals they can access73 still others may find that traditional publishers do not allow electronic access to data in form that other researchers can easily use to verify findings or to compar in other research projects selfarchiving open access publishers require or allow authors to self archive their articles immediately and to make them accessible for free some traditional subscriberpays publishers now allow authors to selfarchive on the authors own website an electr onic version of the preprint of their article or after delay the published journal article there are variety of models for this sometimes with fees charged some traditional publishers allow authors to selfarchive the preprint and then link to the prin ted version after publication american meteorological association some do not allow posting of the article until year or more after publication in the journal american association for the advancement of science some allow posting of an authors article only on an institutional or educational server not the authors personal selfarchive american anthropological association and so forth the policies of hundreds of us and foreign journals associations and publishers are summarized in an inventory published by sherpa british open access project74 critics say that archiving only on the authors website makes it hard to find sets of related articles in particular subjects because articles are more accessible when placed in freely searchable repositories that archive articles in many fields by many authors and which can be searched by index or keyword terms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33023crs18 75 from httpwwwsciruscomcommercial and open access search engines some commercial publishers make available free search engines that allow readers to search for citations or abstracts in sp ecific fields or types of information some of these repositories link to text version which can be viewed for free however most full text articles found through these searches ar not accessible for free costs to read or download an article average 30 per article which users or libraries are required to pay75 an example is scirus search engine limited to science literature managed by elsevier which provides access to short abstracts or excerpts open access bibliographic or citation archives have wide range of policies regarding access to scientific articles open access bibliographic archives generally provide free access to abstracts or citations in multiple fields and often to fulltext manuscripts or articles nihs pubmedmedline is free bibliographic database that the public can use to search for journal articles it gives access to references from millions of articles published in almost 5000 biomedical journals dating back to the 1950s it gives citation and abstract and links to fulltext articles that are available for free via publishers

all their published articles are made available for free pmc also is the repository for articles resulting from nih funded research that are submitted under the agencys public access policy these articles comprise only small part of the pmc database and many nihfunded research ers publish the results of their research in journals that do not contribute article to pmc pmc is discussed in greater detail below in the section on nihs public access policy open access proponents sa that there are multiple benefits to providing free access to articles in online repositories of collections of articles since reader could identify many related pape rs on one topic and would bypass the need to search individual authors websites or to use co mmercial indexing databases that typically charge fee to read an article copyright issues supporters of traditional subscriberpays publishing argue that publishers as copyright holders need copyright protection in order to market journals and sell repr ints which support the costs of publishing and archiving both hardcopy and electronic materials so also say that copyright ownership is required to guarantee researchers accuracy and the authenticity of authorship of an article in open access publishing the au thor of the article retains copyright ownership but access to the ar ticle normally remains free to readers as will be discussed below mixed model is used in the case of nihs public access policy which asks authors to voluntarily submit to pubmed central pmc the peer reviewed version of manuscript accepted fo r publication in journal this should be done as soon as possible but within 12 months of acceptance of the article by the publisher free access to the manuscript is prohibited until afte r journal

publishers decision the agency has the right to utilize the journal article under the government purpose license doctrine ven though nih says it is not exercising this authority in the future other ag

details economic development open access publishing according to many proponents helps promote economic social and technical development and equitable access to scientific knowledge by researchers in countries unable to afford the costs of scientific journals by hardcopy or subscription web access many open access systems also say that they will waive publication charges for au thors from developing counties who cannot afford to pay to have their articles published but some traditional publishers say that scientists in developing countries already have free and ready access to most scientific journals for example many traditional publishers pa rticipate in projects sponsored by the world health organization and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations to provide medical and agricultura l journals to readers in veloping countries at low or cost76 in addition more than 2000 biomed ical journals are accessible online to researchers and health workers in

published in traditional subscriberpays journals and about whether they are of comparable quality the peer review pro cess traditionally invol ves review of quality of the article and selection of articles to be published in journa l usually journal editors or editorial boards make an initial selection of articles to be peer reviewed from among those submitted use panel of expert scientists who

found th at the quality of peer review was lower in open access than in traditionally published journals openaccess journals received fewer submissions and were less selective in choosing among submissions it continued essentially all of the journals reported using editorial review to select and edit submissions but nearly all of the traditional journals used external peer review while only editorial staff members reviewed submissions of about 30 percent of the openaccess journals79 according to another study the most ri gorous peer review as measured by their journals reliance on external review ers was largely by traditional publishers and that in contrast full open access jour nals tended to depend heavily on editorial staff only for peer review except for two subsets of open access journals biomed central bmc and internet scientific publications isp journals which had practices more like traditional journals80 on the other hand study published in 2005 by publishing analysis firm showed that the quality of nearly 200 open access journals was almost as high in specific medical disciplines as the quality of articles in traditionally published journals81 some analysts say that peer review in open access journals suffers from the difficulty of finding enough scientist peer reviewers for both the growing number of open access journals and traditi onal journals there is also the view that editorial boards of open access journals may not filter out unacceptable manuscripts as much as traditional subscriberpays journal boards do thus peer reviewers for open access journals who interact and report primarily electronically may be overwhelmed by the number of articles they are given to review and ultimately there may be delay in the system public

journals permit free acce ss usually immediately to the final version of an article and authors who publish with them do not have to take further steps to satisfy nih public access policy seven of th almost 300 journals accessible via pmc require the author to submit manuscripts at this time nih also initiated new system called the pubmed central nih portfolio project only for nihfunded resear ch which is apparently designed to satisfy nih needs and the demands of some nonprofit publishers although signed agreement is not necessary106 some publishers have signed an agreement for participation with nih according to one publisher it stipulates that published journal articles resulting fro m nihfunded research be made available only for internal use in an nihfunded archive dur ing the embargo period that the embargo period last longer than 12 months and that following the embargo period nih could provide links to the jour nal and could also distribute the article directly through pmc 107

the national library of medicine s freetouse internet repository pubmed central121 in addition according to plos the maximum allowabl delay before articles public release should have been at most 6 ra ther than 12 months particularly since publisher has presented evidence that the free availability of fraction of its journals articles half year after publi cation would adversely affect subscription revenues122 others say that the 12month delay for public access falls short of achieving goals of congressiona l intent and is too lengthy in field as dynamic as biomedicine where patie nts need immediate access123 nih policy has also been criticized by some who say that nih should utilize free access policies that exist in the notforprofit publishing community which they say are more costeffective they suggest that instead of putting articles in pmc nih should create search engine that has the capability to crawl the full texts of existing journals including nonprofit jour nals to

the view that governments should increase access to findings from publicly funde d research to maximize social returns on public investments and presented exam ples and comprehensive pro and analyses of currently used business models of open access publishing and open access archives175 it also summarized the pros nd cons of hybrid business models which distribute publishing costs among au thors and users one example is twopart tariff for author feeswith fe levied for submission and publication serving to reduce the tendency for multiple and speculative submission of papers for publication and enabling journals to cover the costs of quality through support for higher rejection rates such as model might also serve to increase revenue certainty for publishers of open access author pays variant journals and by reducing the cost of publication in th em enable them better to compete for authors with subscriptionbased journals however user resistance would be strong possibility compared with simpler author pays models 176 the report also proposed variations of another hybrid model involving segmentation of journal into subscr iption and open access on an articlebyarticle basis according to the authors preference and willingnessability to pay177 apparently number of publis hers have already adopted such practices and the oecd report concluded such model may be useful way for journal title to migrate from subscription model to an open access model over time with the pace and direction of change dict ated by author preferences178 as noted above there has been considerable

continue to be paid from libraries budgets or will they come from research budgets source that would be more consistent with the view of openaccess proponents that costs of publication should be part of the costs of conducting research or will external granting agencies many of which already pay scientists page charges and colorillustration fees assume the full costs of their investigat ors openaccess publications will libraries continue to serve as intermediaries through which researchers find openaccess informa tion as well as that available only through subscription and how those questions relate not just to academic libraries but to the mission of colleges and universities the time has come for comprehensive review of how best to pay for the dissemination of professors work how will reduced legal barriers to reusing articles stipulation of most formal definitions of open access affect teaching research and other scholarly activities there are of course goodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33023crs51 198 andy gass and helen doyle the reality of openaccess journal articles chronicle of higher education feb 18 2005 p b13precedents for having few or legal restrictions on the reuse of scholarly work every article publis hed by an employee of the nih is in the public domain some morerestrictive openaccess licenses now available like the creative commons attribution license in use for articles from our employer nd from biomed central permit users to reproduce scholarly work in any medium for any purpose as long as the author receives proper credit what kinds of educational tools will such licenses make possible for example will we see proliferation of online articles enhanced with explanatory links and info rmational sideba rs which make scientific discoveries more comprehensible to wide audience will such resources be produced by co mmercial enterprises by nonprofit organizations or by networks of volunteers as is the case with opensource computer software will openaccess articles enable more researchers from lessdeveloped countries to work on the frontiers of science given that all credible openaccess jour nals waive publication fees for authors who cant afford to pay them increased availability and therefore knowledge of the litera ture might well allow scientists in the developing world to increase their output of cuttingedge work would that change in turn help resolve the 1090 gap the unfortunate reality that less than 10 percent of the global expenditure on medical research goes to study the predominant health needs of 90 percent of the worlds population most important what kinds of discoveries might result from searchable open archives of p eerreviewed fulltext scientific literature the aggregation of gene sequences in single freely accessible information space genbank has spawned entire fields of research will open access to jour nal articles have similar effect on areas of work that could benefit from mining full texts and figures clearly comprehensive collections of openaccess literature would make it much easier to systematically review published medical studies will openaccess literature lead to frequent discoveries of correlations between phenomena previously thought to be unrelated will it spark more open access to data sets nd databases of laboriously compiled and annotated information the potential for open access to lead to new discoveries is its single most compelling asset though one that is frequently overlooked198
