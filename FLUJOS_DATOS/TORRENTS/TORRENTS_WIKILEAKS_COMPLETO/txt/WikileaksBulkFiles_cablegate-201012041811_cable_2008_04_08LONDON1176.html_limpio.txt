participants disagreed about future trends and the impact of biofuels agreed that action needed to be taken both for immediate social protection and longerterm agricultural investment and that care should be taken not to talk up crisis the uk press release following the meeting included broad range of proposed actions that the uk plans to pursue both domestically and internationally ranging from increased assistance to wto trade deal and improved world bank and imf effectiveness dfid also announced new gbp 455 million 910 million fiveyear assistance package in dfids view the current crisis is being caused by high and rising food prices not shortage of food end summary 2 sbu on april 22 pm brown hosted one and half hour meeting to discuss ways the international community could respond to the growing global food price crisis overseas development institute odi director simon maxwell who was called on to set the stage at the meeting told us he was surprised that the meeting which was originally intended to be small private event was publicized and expanded to include more international players participants included uk government ministers international organizations such josette sheeran from the world food program business academics and others for the full list see paragraph 16 3 sbu pm brown opened the meeting introducing the list of action areas he had asked the japanese prime minister to put on the g8 agenda including short tern measures to deal with immediate hardship and long term structural measures as outlined in paragraph 13 see also wwwnumber10govukoutputpage15321asp uk development secretary douglas alexander concluded the meeting by sipdis emphasizing the need for the international architecture to keep up he noted that this had been key theme at the world bank development committee in washington earlier in april he also expressed surprise there had not been more discussion about concluding wto trade deal as means to address food price concerns food prices and biofuels 4 sbu participants disagreed about likely food price trends and the impact of biofuels uk environment secretary hilary benn noted that the futures market for wheat showed the price falling more than 25 percent from current levels by next year cargills ruth rawling predicted that wheat prices would come down quite quickly noting that there is harvest somewhere on the planet every sixty days except for rice odi estimated that prices would fall back from their current peak to roughly what they had been in the early 1990s see odis discussion paper on the topic at httpwwwodiorgukpublicationsbriefing bp37april08risingfoodpricespdf 5 sbu on the other hand stefan tangermann from the oecd trade agriculture directorate said their modeling showed maize prices for the next ten years would be 60 percent higher than during the past decade and that half of this increase was due to biofuels joachim von braun director general inter food policy institute research ifpri suggested moratorium on maize for biofuels their modeling showed it would reduce maize prices by 20 percent immediately and wheat prices by 10 percent with further reductions because it would discourage speculation 6 sbu others defended biofuels benn wanted to see hard facts and analysis on biofuels mike bushell from agribusiness company syngenta argued against demonizing biofuels rawling argued against rigid mandates and in favor of buyout clauses for biofuels she also noted that flexibility is essential since biofuel targets are fixed in terms of fuel markets not food markets and 25 percent of the fuel market can represent as much as 20 percent of food market causes and remedies 7 sbu maxwell told us the headline messages about social protection in the short run and agricultural investment in the long run were clear to the participants but everything else about causes and remedies was contested paul collier oxford university argued that the main cause was growth in china which one wants to reduce he also pointed to follies that he wanted to undo specifically us biofuels subsidies and the eu refusal to accept genetically modified london 00001176 002 of 004 crops collier wanted to see largescale farming in africa along the lines of the brazilian model for details see colliers april 15 article in the times food shortages think big wwwtimesonlinecouk on april 24 malcolm bruce mp and chairman of parliaments international development committee idc speaking at an idc evidence session dismissed colliers suggestion that african countries adopt the brazilian model as professorial point of view not politicians 8 sbu at the meeting maxwell stressed that the crisis had macroeconomic as well as humanitarian dimensions low income food deficit countries face import bills some 20bn higher this year and food price increases are resulting in doubledigit inflation in many countries donald kaberuka president african development bank also focused on macroeconomic impacts as governments could respond to higher prices by increasing subsidies and wages which would lead to higher budget deficits 9 sbu josette sheeran world food program wfp director made case for the importance of the humanitarian case load she said the additional cost of maintaining wfps operations this year has now risen to 700 million compared to 500 million in february wfp has had to pay up to 1000 per ton for rice she raised concerns about low planting in poor countries constrained in part by high input costs eg planting in kenya is one third down she also said wfp is transitioning from being an agency that deals only with food aid logistics to one that addresses the broader causes and remedies to address hunger itself project which is slowly gathering donor support jacques diouf food and agriculture organization talked about the food summit he is convening from 35 june in rome he said the priority was the current growing season and endorsed sheerans points about the negative impact of high fertilizer and seed prices 10 sbu several participants focused on the need for immediate social protection for those in need phil bloomer from oxfam argued against food subsidies for and in favor of targeted social protection for those in need david mepham from save the children talked about the need to scale up existing social protection programs eg ethiopia but noted that there are countries where the issue is building programs rather than scaling them up bruce was also concerned that small farmers would buy more inputs because food prices were high and then be unable to cover these costs if prices fell he wanted to see some kind of insurance to prevent this outcome 11 sbu kaberuka said the regional development banks were working on harmonized approach to support agriculture speaking in parliamentary committee meeting on april 24 dfid parliamentary secretary of state gillian merron outlined dfid views on the african development banks role to address the food crisis she praised kaberukas participation in the summit noting that it showed willingness to adapt the afdbs role to fit the situation she stressed that the afdb is not set up to lend directly to farmers nor should it be but there is the potential for afdb to play role in agricultural infrastructure projects she said dfid would work with afdb toward this goal messaging 12 sbu maxwell urged participants to get the messaging right so as not to talk up crisis and instead present this as manageable problem with short and long term solutions with implications for the international system tangerman endorsed the point about messaging and said there was danger of talking up the bubble he pointed to recent unhelpful remarks from imf managing director dominique strausskahn about prices going even higher uk food crisis announcement 13 u uk statement apparently not coordinated with the other participants following the meeting said it had addressed the short and longerterm factors causing increased food prices at home and abroad and possible policy solutions it noted the following issues were discussed at the meeting we will work in the g8 for an international strategy an international strategy will need to include more and better support for agricultural and rural development in the poorest countries more and better research into methods for increasing yields and productivity review of the wider economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production london 00001176 003 of 004 commitment to increase social protection programs which take people out of longterm dependency on food aid consideration on how to maximize the effectiveness of imf and world bank support and reform of relevant international institutions we will increase support to the poorest in addition to the gbp 50 million per year we already spend on social protection and safety net programs in africa the uk has today pledged an extra gbp 30 million to support the world food program and extra gbp 25 million to ethiopia for their national safety net program we will work to encourage other donors to make additional humanitarian assistance available and monitor the need to step up support we will work together to address domestic price rises the government has called on consumer groups food producers manufacturers and retailers to consider how we can collectively meet the challenges posed by the global food crisis we will increase research into improving yields the uk has today announced new funds for agricultural research over the next five years this will be critical if agricultural production is to keep pace with increased demands for food we will work to achieve successful wto deal including substantial aid for trade package to help build the trading capacity of the poorest countries the wto round offers major opportunity to increase trade flows in agricultural and other goods particularly for developing countries we want wto deal which reduces significantly reduces agricultural tariffs and trade distorting subsidies high transport costs also push up local food prices and restrict trade in africa we will work within the eu to further reform the eus common agricultural policy cap through the cap health check and the eu budget review it is estimated that the cap costs uk consumers gbp 35 billion 2005 through higher prices reductions in eu agricultural tariffs and cap reform would reduce the cost of food to eu consumers and increase the capacity of developing countries to produce and export agricultural commodities we will review our approach to biofuels we need to look closely at the impact on food prices and the environment of different production methods and to ensure we are more selective in our support if our uk review shows that we need to change our approach we will also push for change in eu biofuels targets dfid assistance 14 u also on april 22 dfid announced gbp 455 million 910 million fiveyear aid package to address rising global food prices the package is designed to address both short term needs and long term solutions the uk aid package includes 60 million in support of recent appeals by the world food programme for countries most at risk 800 million gbp 400 million over five years devoted to agricultural research that will double dfids current spend and help poor countries grow more food for themselves and 50 million gbp 25 million this year to boost the incomes of the poorest people in ethiopia 15 u in dfids view the current crisis is being caused by high and rising food prices not shortage of food the solution is to improve access to food for poor people prices are rising because of increasing demand for food due to population growth and increasing oil prices and their impact on the cost of food production processing and distribution 16 u participants at the april 22 event were prime minister gordon brown rt hon douglas alexander mp secretary of state for international
