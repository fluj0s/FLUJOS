of illinois naming the secretary of defense and each of the brac commissioners as defendants his complaint in part claimed that the distribution of aircraft from springfield to ft wayne constituted realignment withdrawal or relocation of illinois air na tional guard units and that this violated various provisions in both title 10 armed forces and title 32 national guard of the united states code he asked that the court declare that the realignment of the 183rd fighter wing as proposed by defendant rumsfeld without the consent of the governor of the state of illinois is prohibited by federal

these actions7 requested funding for brac accounts the appropriation request for fiscal year 2006 is split between two base realignment and closure brac accounts one for 1990 and one for 2005 the brac 1990 account is the consolidati on of what had been four separate accounts one for each of the previous brac rounds because all of the recommended brac actions from those r ounds were completed in 2001 the brac 1990 account is devoted to funding the c ontinuing environm ental remediation required on the federal property deemed excess during those rounds but not

account for fy2006 the house supported that request and the senate increased it to nearly 403 million the amount enacted was slightly less than 255 million the brac 2005 account will fund the many realignment and closure actions to include the movement of units nd equipment the construction of new infrastructure at receiving installations and the realignment and closure of property deemed excess in the curre nt brac round the implementation of all enacted brac actions in the 2005 round must begin not later than two years and be completed not later than six years from the date of enactment during previous brac rounds appropriations tended to rise sharply during the first few years peaking during the third or fourth year they then gradually fell off as movement and construction activity was replaced by envi ronmental remediation and land transfer to other agencies and local redevelopment authorities the brac 2005 appropriations account was established to fund the first year of realignment and closure activity the president made his first appropriation request of 188 billion the house appr oved an appropriation of only 157 billion and the senate committee on appropriations recomme nded only 150 billion in its report to the senate srept 109105 the committee noted that the presidents funding request had indicated his intention to retain some of the requested funding as unobligated at the end of the fiscal ear the committee cited this as its rationale for reducing the appropriation th conference recommended 150 billion environmental remediation on closed military bases significant portion of land rendered surp lus during previous brac rounds remains the property of the department of defense the principal reason for this is the departments enduring responsibility for property cl eanup prior to transferring title in its report hrept 10995 the house discussed the current situation at the former ft ord where large tracts remain in dod hands but where the department has begun to take an innovative approach to speeding the transfer of remaining property the committee is aware that the army and the reuse authority at the former fort ord have begun discussions to develop creative means to transfer the remaining surplus land at the base to the reuse authority prior to the completion of clean up activities at the site the committee encourages the army and the reuse authority to explore the use of an environmental services cooperative agreement such an arrangement would allow the army to transfer the land immediately but guarantee the reuse authority access to funds to pursue clean up through third parties attempt to reopen the airfield at malmstrom air force base montana malmstrom air force base in montana had once hosted both an intercontinental ballistic missile wing and an air refueling wing of kc135 tanker aircraft the 1995 brac commission reco mmended that all fixedwing aircraft flying operations at malmstr

redirected recommendations made durin g earlier rounds for example during the 1995 brac round the secretary of fense recommended that the commission change the receiving sites for squadrons and relate d activities at nas naval air station miramar specified by the 1993 commission from nas lemoore and nas fallon to other naval air stations primarily nas oceana virginia nas north island california and nas fallon nevada subsequent reconsider ation was not possible in the 2005 round so the commission drafted severa l conditional recomme ndations the two most significant of these concerned cannon air fo rce base near clovis new mexico and naval air station oceana in virginia beach virginia cannon air force base new mexico cannon air force base occupies more then 4500 acres of open land near the town of clovis in eastern new mexico approximately 2400 military and 400 dod civ il service employees work at the installation supported by an estimated 2000 indirect civilian workers the base hosts the 27th fighter wing an active duty f16 unit composed of the 522nd 523rd 524th and 428th fighter squadrons it and the nearby melrose air force range support the operations and training of active duty air force air national guard and other us and allied aircrew the secretary of defense recommended th at cannon be closed and its aircraft be distributed to other units actions that would eliminate approximately 20 of the local employment base instead of including this recommendation in its own list the brac commission realigned cannon directing the air force to redistribute the aircraft based there according to its own master allocation plan but keeping the base open by retaining an enclave on the site and instructing the secretary of defense to seek other newlyidentified missions with all military services for possible assignment to cannon the recommendation was conditional in the sense that should new mission be identified nd assigned by december 31 2009 cannon shall be closed during

task to conduct thorough st udy of matters relating to the military facility structure of the united states overseas in this the commissions effort paralleled in part department of defense examination of its installations worldwide11 the commission was also enjoined to submit to the president and congress report which shall contain detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the commission together with its reco mmendations for such legislation and administrative actions as it c onsiders appropriate and the report shall also include proposal by the commission for an overseas basing strategy for the department of defense in order to meet the current and future mission of the department during the period of the obc study the president announced that between 60000 and 70000 military personnel based in overseas garrisons would over the ensuing decade be redeployed to garrisons located within the united states and its territories the military services were continuing the process of organizational transformation while the dod was drawing up its list of recommended actions for submission to the brac commission after weighing these and other factors the obc stated the commission found that the overseas ba sing structure cannot be viewed in isolation from myriad of other secur ityrelated considerations its feasibility and effectiveness can only be evaluated in context with all other aspects of national security mentioned elsewhere in this report we believe that at some time too much activity in too short time threatens to change transformation into turbulence we have concluded that we are doing too much too fast and reordering of the steps is necessary we call therefore for process of deliberation and review to accompany the zeal and aggressiveness to act12 the report highlighted several issues of potential interest to congress including the ability of us military bases to absorb the influx of personnel and their families from

other emergency supplemental appropriations enacted since september 11 2001 these requests highlight several matters some of which may be of interest to congress such as whether the 22 billion in funding in support of military operations in iraq and afghanistan signals longerterm us presence in the region or is primarily for short term improvements to facilities for us troops whether congress has received sufficient information to evaluatethese projects whether current authorities that give dod additional flexibility to fund unanticipated needs in military construction give congress adequate tools for oversight or whether dods decisions to rely primarily on supplemental rather then regular military construction funding and military construction rather than operation and mainte nance funding for projects in iraq and afghanistan are appropria and ensure congressional oversight15 military forces of us central command centcom operate from installations in iraq and afghanistan

partment of defense undertook an initiative to eliminate substandard housing for military personnel this initiative took two distinct paths increasing the housing allowance paid to service personnel who reside in commercial housing owning or renting apartments and houses and upgrading governmentfurnished housing at military installations the original target date of 2010 for ensu ring adequate housin g for all was later revised forward to 2007 for personnel sta tioned within the united states and 2009 for personnel stationed overseas20 this was possible because the department has been able to gradually increase the housin g allowance paid to troops the basic allowance for housing making offbas commercial housing affordable for greater percentage of active duty personnel the department has also been able to effectively utilize number of special authorizations granted by congress to enter into publicprivate partnerships with commercial real estate developers to improve increase
