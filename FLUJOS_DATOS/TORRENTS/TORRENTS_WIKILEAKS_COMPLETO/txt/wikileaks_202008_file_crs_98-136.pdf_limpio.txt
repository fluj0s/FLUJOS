reauthorization liability provisions of leading congressional proposals summary congress is currently seeking to reauthorize and amend the superfund act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla this report targets the liability issues addressed in the two house committeereported bills hr 1300 and hr 2580 and the house committee on commerces minority substitute offered by representative towns senate bills are not covered at this time because the senate has decided to wait until the house acts cercla creates stringent liability scheme so that persons associated with sites contaminated by hazardous substances bear their share of cleanup and associated costs whenever hazardous substance is released or threatened to be released from facility potentially responsible parties prps include the generators of the substance transporters who selected the disposaltreatment facility and the owners or operators of the facility both now and when the hazardous substance was disposed of several exemptions from liability are provided eg for innocent purchasers who made due diligence inspection of the site prps are liable for response cleanup costs natural resource damages and costs of federal health assessments the liability standard is strict joint and several and retroactive this liability scheme flowed from two policy choices made by the congress that enacted it adoption of the polluter pays principle and correlative decision that in light of the many contaminated sites disbursements from the newly created superfund at each site should be as low as possible these choices dictated an expansive liability scheme that maximized the chance of finding prps able to fund cleanup at most sites with the passing of time however issues have arisen as to this schemes high transaction costs for litigation studies oversight and its inclusion of prps who in the view of some should not be held liable none of the bills would repeal the existing liability scheme outright but all contain nonbindin g nonlitigation alternative through which prp can avoid the scheme at sites with multiple prps which is most neutral allocator would assign each prp percentage of the overall liability which the prp can accept or reject acceptance has certain advantages such as avoidance of possibly large transaction costs and protection from further liability in addition all the bills would add to or clarify the current categories of liability exempt parties addressing minimis and micromis contributors to site small businesses municipalities and municipal waste codisposal landfills and nonprofit institutions among others importantly the bills all would expand upon epas longstanding initiative to encourage brownfields development eg by

96019675superfund act reauthorization liability provisions of leading congressional proposals continuing debate begun in the 103rd congress the 106th congress now has before it several bills that seek to reauthorize or amend the superfund act this report deals with one set of issues those involving the acts liability scheme as addressed by the major house bills and house democratic substitute senate bills are not covered at this time since the senate has decided to wait until the house of representatives passes bill the superfund act has three main purposes conveniently indicated by the statutes formal name the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercl a1 first response the act authorizes federal response ie cleanup to releases or substantial threats of release of hazardous substance s and pollutants and contaminants into the environment second compensation cercla creates hazardous substance superfund to pay costs of cleanup not allocable to solvent responsible party third liability the act creates broad and stringent liability scheme so that persons linked to hazardous substance contamination bear their share of cleanup and other costs the last of these three components liability lies at the very heart of the act cercla is often referred to as liability driven or litigation driven statute other federal environmental statutes affect the private sector through prospective rules of general application clean air act auto emission standards for example only when the rules are violated do questions of liability in the form of penalties arise cercla is quite different it prescribes few rules of general application rather the act operates chiefly by imposing liability for the costs of cleanup among other things based on past or current status thus liability issue and the likelihood of litigation arises almost every time the superfund act is applied not merely when some regulation is transgressed this report 1 describes the existing cercla liability scheme 2 explains why it seemed to make sense to the congress that first enacted it but now provokes some dissatisfaction and 3 sets out the major proposals in the house of representatives for modifying the liability schemehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs2 242 usc 9606 9607 respectively determination as to who is responsible party may also be made under 104 in connection with government cleanups 42 usc 9604 3the quoted terms are all defined and defined quite broadly in cercla section 101 and in case law for example release includes not only the obvious spilling leaking pumping pouring and so on but also the mere abandonment or discarding of closed receptacles containing hazardous substances cercla 10122 4oswer directive 920101a 1989 5hereinafter references to releases in this report should be read to include threatened releases 6 cercla 107a3the existing cercla liability scheme the cercla liability scheme is set out principally in sections 106 and 107 of the act2 and is unaffected by whether the site is one of those targetted for permanent cleanup by the national priorities list npl section 106 governs abatement orders when epa determines that there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment because of the actual or threatened release of hazardous substance from facility3 it may either issue an administrative order or seek court order either type of order commands affected parties to take appropriate measures to abate the danger in contrast section 107 is for recovering from responsible party when the cleanup is done by others other private parties or the government it states who is liable for what most of the cercla liability debate revolves around the desired reach of section 107 and its liability standard since 1989 epa has followed an enforcement first policy under which it seeks to have the responsible parties at site do the cleanup as opposed to cleaning up itself using superfund money then filing cost recovery actions against such parties4 who is liable for what and to whom who is liable cerclas universe of potentially responsible parties commonly called prps is quite broad the following entities are liable under section 107 when there is release or threatened release of hazardous substance into the environment from facility5 arrangers often called generators in the words of cercla any person who arranged for disposal or treatment or arranged with transporter for transport for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person by any other party or entity at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity 6 almost always the arranger is the entity that generated the hazardous substance for this reason the word generator is commonly used in place of arranger though it is not found in cerclahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs3 7 cercla 107a4 8 cercla 107a12 the owneroperator category of prps also expressly extends to the current owner or operator of vessel term excluded from the definition of facility id at 1019 9 see eg united states v hardage 663 f supp 1280 wd okla 1987 thus for example section 106 orders can be issued to past generators since past generators are liable under section 107 10 cercla 10135ai 10135b 11 from the outset cercla section 10120 exempted holders of security interests in contaminated facility typically lenders from owner or operator liability as long as they do not participate in the facilitys management epa regulations seeking to clarify and expand the existing case law on this liability exemption were judicially invalidated however as beyond the agencys authority congress responded by codifying the epa regulations through the asset conservation lender liability and deposit insurance protection act of 1996 pub law 104208 title ii 25012505 provisions relating to holders of security interests were inserted into cercla section 10120 provisions related to fiduciaries were added as new cercla section 107n 12 cercla 119transporters who selected the facility in the statutes words any person who accepts any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities selected by such person 7 owners and operators that is person who owns or operates the facility from which there is release both the current owneroperator and the owneroperator at the time the hazardous substance was disposed of8 these prp categories apply to governments federal state and local corporations and individuals alike thus municipality that operates trash disposal site that accepts hazardous waste is covered note too that section 107 is viewed by most courts as delimiting who can be held liable under section 106 as well9 so any entity that can be required to reimburse others for cleanup costs they incurred can also be ordered to perform the cleanup itself when there is an imminent and substantial endangerment cercla carves out several exemptions from the basic liability scheme these carveouts however are often qualified do not apply in all circumstances may only limit cercla liability rather than eliminate it and do not necessarily affect any liability the prp has under other federal statutes or state law they include innocent purchasers who undertook due diligence inspection of the site before acquisition10 lenders and fiduciaries11 response action contractors12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs4 13 cercla 10135aiiiii 14 cercla 107j 15 cercla 107i 16 note that cercla liability is not as broad as cercla response authority liability imposed under section 107 requires the release of hazardous substance authority to respond to release under section 104 includes hazardous substances and pollutants or contaminants 17key tronic corp v united states 511 us 809 1994 key tronic held that legal fees pertaining to private plaintiffs activities in identifying other prps are necessary cost of response under cercla 107a4b hence recovera ble in contrast litigationrelated attorney fees incurred by private parties are not response costs and so are not recoverable the united states recovers its attorney fees under the explicit reference to enforcement activities in cerclas definition of response cercla 10125 18 damages is used here in the strict legal sense of the word meaning monetary compensation it does not refer to the damage or injury itself thus it is not redundant to speak of damages for injury to natural resources there is liability under cercla for harm to natural resources clearly identified as an irreversible commitment of natural resources in an environmental analysis where the decision to grant permit or license authorizes that commitment cercla 107f1governments that acquired facility by escheat or other involuntary acquisition and persons who acquired by inheritance13 federally permitted releases14 and application of federally registered pesticide15 cercla also declares that if not prp person is not liable under cercla for providing cleanup assistance in accordance with the national conting ency plan ncp or as directed by an onscene coordinator but may still be liable for common law negligence similarly again if not prp state and local governments are not liable under cercla for their emergency actions but may still be liable for gross negligence or intentional misconduct for what are prps liable section 107 says that prps are liable for three types of consequences of hazardous substance release16 response chiefly cleanup costs whether incurred by the united states state or indian tribe if not inconsistent with the ncp or by any other person if consistent with the ncp response costs include share of epas administrati ve and enforcement costs plus privateparty legal costs closely linked to the actual cleanup17 natural resource damages as cercla puts it damages for injury to destruction of or loss of natural resources18 the assessment of natural resource damages by the natural resource trustee the designated official charged with acting on behalfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs5 19 cercla 107f2c 20 cercla 107c 21 cercla 107c3 22 cercla 106b1 23 id the development of natural resource damages regulations under cercla was delegated to the department of the interior see 43 cfr part 11 under the oil pollution act of 1990 the development of virtually identical regulations was delegated to the national oceanic and atmospheric administrationof the public to recover damages acts as rebuttable presumption if the assessment was done in accordance with the natural resource damages regulations19 health assessments costs health assessments are carried out by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry in the public health service under cercla section 104i liability includes interest ceilings on particular prps liability per incident are imposed based on the type of prp vessels depending on size and whether hazardous substance is carried as cargo or residue motor vehicles aircraft pipelines and rolling stock and other facilities and incineration vessels20 these liability limits do not apply under certain circumstances eg when the release resulted from willful misconduct within the privity or knowledge of the prp moreover as practical matter the limits have had scant application since courts have viewed each discrete release as separate incident stiff penalties are provided for prp who fails without sufficient cause to comply with section 106 or section 104 cleanup order such prp may be liable for civil punitive damages equal to three times the costs incurred by the fund as result of the prps failure to act21 in addition to those costs fines of up to 25000day are authoriz ed if the failure to comply without sufficient cause is willful22 to whom is the prp liable prps liability for response costs is generally to the entity government or private that incurred them prp liability for natural resource damages is to the government entity federal state or indian tribe with jurisdiction over the natural resource23 private parties may not bring suits for natural resource damages the liability standard the liability standard in any liability scheme defines what must be part of the complaining partys case in formulating that standard the legislature makes policy decision how should the interests of plaintiff and defendant be balanced in the superfund act congress created very broad liability standard that seeks to promotehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs6 24strict liability has been the general liability rule in federal environmental statutes since enactment of the clean air act and clean water act in the early 1970s successful recoveries by public and private parties when they incur cleanup costs and to encourage cleanups by the prps themselves the cercla liability standard has three key elements it is strict as customarily used in the law strict liability means that plaintiff may prevail by proving only two things 1 the defendant did the act of which it is accused and 2 that act caused the plaintiffs injury importantly the plaintiff need not show as it must in negligence case that the defendants conduct was less careful than it should have been ie that it fell short of the appropriate standard of care in effect strict liability makes the defendant an insurer against any injury it causes24 cercla in its variant of strict liability dispenses with certain aspects of causation as part of plaintiffs case instead the act attaches liability based on status categorie s eg arranger or transporter regardless of whether particular defendants substance at site can be shown to have caused the particular release that provoked cleanup however the united states is not relieved of having to show causation between the release and the incurrence of response costs joint and several joint and several liability is common law tort standard used when more than one party contributed to the plaintiffs injury but there is reasonable basis for allocating liability among them under it liability for plaintiffs entire injury can be imposed on any one tortfeasor or any combination of the aggregate in this way the plaintiff is made whole expeditiously and the burden of who should pay what share of the total liability is shifted to the defendants to resolve on their own under the superfund act joint and several liability is triggered whenever it would be used under the common law of tort thus joint and several liability is not applied automatically though it is used in the large majority of cleanups since courts usually conclude that the common law precondition reasonable basis for allocating liability is met as result the cercla plaintiff such as the federal government is often free theoretically to seek recovery of all its site costs from fraction of the total number of prps at the site notwithstanding there is small minority of cases where basis for allocating liability among prps is found by the court so joint and several liability is rejectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs7 25 cercla 122e3 26 cercla 122b1 nonsettling prps are often called recalcitrants 27 orphan share funding through compromise of the governments cercla claims against the prp is government favorite since it does not draw from appropriated funds epa recently asserted that in fy 1996 it offered over 57 million in orphan share compensation to potentially settling parties and continued that practice this past fiscal year at every eligible negotiation superfund reauthorization and reform legislation hearing on hr 2727 before the subcomm on water resources and environment of the house comm on transportation and infrastructure 105th cong oct 29 1997 statement of carol browner epa administrator emphasis in original 28cercla 113f1the theoretical harshness of joint and several liability is softened by several mechanisms in cercla nonbinding epa allocations of responsibility25 mixed funding using superfund money to reimburse prps who clean up pursuant to settlement with epa for the share of cleanup costs attributable to non settlor prps26 orphan share funding using superfund money or more frequently compromising government claims for costs it has already incurred in recognition of prps that are insolvent or defunct27 and contribution actions suits by prp seeking reimbursement for portion of its cleanup costs from other prps28 the frequent use of minimis settlements entered into on proportional contribution basis plus premium and the threat of micromis settlements also reduce the impact of joint and several liability see discussion below under exemptions from liability the executive branch has long regarded joint and several liability as the essential stick for encouraging prps to settle with the governm ent the executive branch does not typically seek to assign liability shares to individual prps preferring to seek proportionate share of liability from the settling prps collectively the settling prps may then on their own work out mutually acceptable allocation of liability the department of justice asserts that where helpful to achieve settlement the united states in some cases assists prps in resolving allocation issues retroactive the liability imposed by cercla extends to conduct occurring prior to the original enactment of cercla in 1980 thus company disposing of hazardous substance in 1970 or in theory 1870 may find itself liable under cercla for government cleanup costs being incurred now even though such disposal complied fully with applicable laws at the time some courts dispute that such liability is truly retroactive noting that the liability is for cleanup costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs8 29cercla 10132 30see eg 126 cong rec 31965 dec 3 1980 statement of rep florio house floor manager that the terms joint and several liability have been deleted with the intent that the liability of joint tortfeasors be determined under common or previous statutory law 31 cercla 107b 32 cercla 113g 33cercla 122g5 34cercla 122e3 35cercla 122g occurring after enactment but the term is so often employed that we adopt it here it may come as surprise that none of these elements of cercla liability is stated in the statute in so many words rather their origins lie in cerclas express incorporation of the liability standard in clean water act section 31129 cerclas structure legislative history and case law or some combination for example the controversial joint and several component was present in early versions of the bills that contributed to the enacted cercla but was deleted as part of lastminute senate compromise those members who opposed express inclusion of joint and several liability compromised by accepting floor statements that the bill contemplated use of joint and several liability whenever the common law would employ that standard30 regardless of their source the elements of cercla liability are today well settled cercla allows few general defenses to its liability regime prp may escape liability only by making the difficult demonstration that the hazardous release was caused solely by an act of god act of war or act or omission of third party who is not an employee or agent of the prp and has direct or indirect contractual relation with the prp31 the lastlisted defense for third parties covers releases caused by vandalism assuming the prp took precautions against such occurrences there is also statute of limitations that may be asserted as defense32 for example an initial action for recovery of remedial action costs must be brought within six years after construction of the remedial action began because litigation exhausts time and money cercla seeks to encourage parties in costrecovery litigation to reach settlement incentives to settle in the act include protection for parties that have resolved their liability to the united states from contribution actions as to matters addressed in the settlement brought by non settlors33 nonbinding epa allocations of responsibility for cleanup costs34 and an early cashout provision allowing innocent landowners who failed to do due diligence inspection prior to acquiring the property and minimis contributors to resolve their response cost liability by expedited settlement35httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs9 policies underlying the liability scheme and why some want to modify it the existing cercla liability regime seemed to the congress that enacted it in 1980 to be dictated by two fundamental policy choices made by that body at least so the legislative history suggests congress first policy choice was adoption of the stilldebated polluter pays principle the congressional thinking appeared to be that morally blameworthy or not whether occurring after cerclas enactment or before the conduct that led to the release of hazardous substances is the proper locus of liability for the resultant cleanup costs those that benefitted economically from the contaminationcausing conduct many members believed should be asked to bear the costs not the general taxpayer viewed from this policy perspective the superfund act is simply burdenshifting statute not with an exception or two punitive one hence one might argue it is inappropriate to judge it by the standards of fairness associated with punitive liability regimes the second policy choice embodied in cercla liability flows from two congressional realizations the first was that the cleanup of hazardous waste sites would be costly the second was that at sizeable fraction of sites particularly the many abandoned ones there was an inadequate paper trail to link dumpers to the site even where the necessary linkage could be established many parties were insolvent or long since dissolved it was clear then that unless broad and government friendly liability scheme were used prp source of cleanup funds would exist at many sites that in turn would mean that the lions share of cleanup costs under the new statute would be borne by the superfund largely industry financed or by the taxpayer to forestall that eventuality congress adopted liability scheme designed to maximize prp funding so if the cercla scheme is rooted in such apparently sensible policy precepts why is it today so controversial several reasons suggest themselves key one is the huge transaction costs especially attorney fees often expended to resolve the liability of each prp at site cercla relegates this critical determination often involving millions of dollars to the prps themselves though nonbinding epa allocations of responsibility are occasionally used the prps are essentially on their own in working out mutually agreeable allocation and some have argued though government studies do not support the contention that such squabbling among prps over liability is prime reason for the typically lengthy period of time between site identification and cleanup completion other reasons for the controversiality of the acts liability system are variations on the theme of overinclusiveness first contrary to the rationale that those who benefitted from use of hazardous chemicals should shoulder the consequences some entities swept into the cercla liability net have never generated hazardous waste in more than trivial quantities or benefitted therefrom for example one who sends ordinary household trash to disposal site may in theory be hauled into court underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs10 36as later discussion shows this might happen through contribution action not through epa enforcement 37the clinton administrations superfund legislative reform principles enclosure to letter from carol browner epa administ rator to hon john chafee chairman sen comm on environment and public works may 7 1997 38 epa fy 1998 superfund reforms strategy oerr directive 9200028 nov 13 1997 orphan share funding and micromis settlements were the two administrative reforms in cercla enforcement stressed by epa in recent congressional testimony see eg superfund reauthorization and reform legislation hearing on hr 2727 before the subcomm on water resources and environment of the house comm on transportation and infrastructure 105th cong oct 29 1997 statement of carol browner epa administratorcercla based on testimony that such trash contains trace quantities of hazardous substances36 second arguable example of overinclusiveness stems from the acts impact on small businesses due to both liability itself and the high transact ion costs often incurred to determine it third instance is the acts failure to give special consideration to those willing to buy contaminated land in order to economically revitalize it the brownfields issue fourth is the nonexemption of several entities whose current inclusion arguably offends sense of fairness municipalities that sent only municipal waste or sewage sludge to solid waste landfill religious educational and other charitable institutions recyclers owners of land contaminated by migrating hazardous substances released on other property and so on major house proposals in the 106th congress key point of difference between the administration and many in congress has been how far to modify existing cercla liability supporters of some pending superfund bills assert that considerations of fundamental fairness call for numerous exceptions in the reach of cercla liability by contrast the administration and its allies in congress have sought to hold such retrenchments to minimum37 they assert that those responsible for the contamination should pay for the cleanup at least if they are financially able new statutory exemptions are sought only for very small volume contributors generators and transporters of municipal solid waste and bona fide prospective purchasers epa has deflected some of the legislative pressure to amend cercla through use of administrative reforms in the acts enforcement epa guidance for example calls for greater use of the superfun d to pay the orphan share of site cleanup costs meanin g less liability for prps and expanded accommodation of micromis prps38 epa argues that the pending bills are based on criticisms of the superfund program as it once was not on the faster fairer more efficient program it claims to have brought about through its reforms currently two committeerep orted house bills and house committee on commerce minority substitute seem most likely to supply the substantive ingredientshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs11 of any floor debate on superfund act reauthorization the first bill is hr 1300 as reported from the house committee on transportation and infrastructure the second is hr 2580 as reported from the house committee on commerce the commerce committee minority substitute an expanded version of the democratic caucus brownfields bill hr 1750 is entitled substitute to the amendment in the nature of substitute offered by mr towns the cercla liability reforms proposed by these bills address the following key areas in the interest of brevity discussion of the bills and towns substitute includes key features only because the bills and substitute contain many differences even when addressing the same matter the reader with an interest in particular liability reform should consult the actual text of these documents allocation among multiple parties most superfund sites have more than one prp sometimes many more than one the allocation of cost liability among these prps is likely to be matter of great interest to them since the average cleanup cost at an npl site is 20 million according to epa needless to say however the combination of high stakes and the acts absence of guidance as to who should pay for what virtually invites litigation to reduce the volume of liabilityshar litigation and direct more prp dollars into actual cleanup hr 1300 and hr 2580 propose in nearidentical language non litigatio n nonbindingontheprps alternative for allocating liability prps who accept their allocation can pay up and be protected from future liability including contribution suits from other parties the hr 1300hr 2580 proposal states that the purpose of an allocation under the bills is to determine an equitable allocation of the costs of removal or remedial action at facility on the national priorities list that is eligible including the share to be borne by the trust fund the bills make it mandatory on the president epa in most cases to initiate the allocation process at certain npl facilities ie where the cleanup is not the subject of decree or administrative order as of date of bill introduction there are unrecovered costs of over 2 million and there are response costs attributable to the trust fund the president may in his discretion initiate an allocation for other response actions at npl facilities for mandatory allocations the president must ensure an equitable allocation of liability by neutral allocator selected by the parties under procedures agreed to by the parties initiation of an allocation process triggers moratorium on litigation seeking recovery of response costs at the site which lasts until 150 days after issuance of the allocators report the allocation process does not alter the cercla liability scheme but merely offers prps an alternative to it the allocator shall determine the share of response costs to be allocated to the fund the share of liability for which generator transporter or owneroperator at the time of disposal can be identified shall be divided pro rata among the prps and the fund sharehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs12 39 epa revised guidance on cercla settlements with micromis waste contributors june 3 1996prps may submit to the allocator private allocation which the allocator must accept if the bills criteria are met the president shall accept an offer of settlement based on the allocation unless the epa administrator and the attorney general reject the allocators report governmental agencies that are prps shall be subject to the allocation process just as any other prp the towns substitute contains liability allocation procedures relief from liability the debate over whether to add to the exemptions from liability already in cercla echoes some of the themes noted before for example some argue that adding more exemptions to cercla erodes the polluter pays principle others contend that the principle is better served by targetting those who own and operate contaminated facilities rather than the larger universe of prps under the current statute more broadly the conflict is between the desire not to burden certain societal activities versus the need to retain large pool of prps to supply cleanup funding businesses likely not to be covered by an exemption see this as matter of fairness as well as with the acts existing carveouts the bills and towns substitute impose many qualifications on eligibility for the new exemptions generally the prp must not have impeded the respons action or natural resource restoration must have substantially complied with information requests from epa and so on we do not mention these cooperativenessoriented conditions for liability exemptions in each case below minimis micromis the minimis provisions in cercla refer to parties whose contribution to contaminated site is minimal both as to amount and toxicity as noted cercla allows such prps the opportunity to settle with epa on expedited terms in advance of other prps the hope is that speedy exit from the complex settlement negotiations that cercla often entails may hold the small prps transaction costs to minimum for the smallest of the small contributors of hazardous substances to site epa may exercise its enforcement discretion to enter into micromis settlements39 they are not mentioned in the act such settlements are contemplated for use chiefly where contributors of larger amounts of hazardous substances who are being pursued by government as prps bring contribution actions against contributors of minuscule amounts against whom the government likely would never enforce on several occasions such largeamount contributors have sued hundreds of small businesses towns schools and nonprofit organizations little league symphony orchestras etc arguing that the ordinary trash they sent to disposal site contained hazardous substances requiring that they be brought into the prp negotiations at the site by entering into micromis settlement for zero dollars epa gives the micromis contributor protection against such contribution actions httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs13 in practice the availability of micromis settlements is regarded mostly as deterrent and the relative infrequency of the devices actual use is regarded by the administration as an indicator of its success notwithstanding some have suggested that for micromis contributors there should be settlement negotiations at all rather they should be removed from the cercla liability regime altogether hr 1300 and hr 2580 have identical minimis provisions as under the present act qualifying prps are not exempted from liability but rather are entitled to expedited settlement with the united states key difference from the current act is that terms in the current act that give the president unreviewable discretion as to whether to offer minimis settlement are removed by the bills the bills also define how great prps contribution of hazardous substances can be and still be minimis unless epa sets different threshold the towns substitute does not address minimis contributors hr 1300 and hr 2580 are also identical as to micromis contributors transporter or arranger is completely exempt from cercla liability at npl facilities if more than 110 gallons or 200 pounds of materials containing hazardous substances are attributable to such person and the arrangingtransporting took place before the bills enactment the exemption is unavailable however if the president determines the material contributes significantly to the costs of response at the facility the towns substitute uses the same quantitative ceiling for micromis contributors but gives epa authority to change the ceiling up or down also the substitute makes the exemption unavailable where all or part of the disposal or treatment occurred after september 1 1999 an important difference is that under the towns substitute the determination that the materials contribute significantly to response costs is in epas sole discretion meaning not judicially reviewable the standard in the committeereported bills above appears to impose greater evidentiary burden on the united states and confer judicial reviewability the same standard also is used elsewhere in the bills small businesses liability for cercla cleanup costs may be especially onerous for small businesses the present statute makes special provision for the smallbusiness status of prp hr 1300 and hr 2580 are nearly identical each provides that as to actions before the bills introduction date small business shall be liable as transporter or arranger for response costs or natural resource damages at an npl facility small business is defined to mean business that on average over the last three years has more than 75 fulltime employees and more than 3 million in gross revenues the exemption is unavailable if the hazardous substances attributable to the small business contributed significantly to response costs hr 1300 and hr 2580 also provide relief to small businesses through their municipal solid

cercla treats municipality differently than other prps and municipal solid waste msw differently than other potentially hazardous substance therein lies problem the quantity of msw and sewage sludge sent to dump may be quite large and inevitably contains some hazardous waste because courts have often fallen back on volumetric contribution as the basis for allocating cercla liability municipalities are an inviting target for thirdparty actions by corporate prps corporate prps assert in such litigation that their admittedly more toxic contribution to the site being cleaned up was nonetheless in far smaller quantity than that of the municipal prp therefore they have argued the municipality should bear the lions share of liability while not differentiated in cercla epa has adopted lenient enforcement policy toward municipal prps and msw40 under it epa will not notify municipalities or private parties that they are prps if the msw they generated or transported contains only household hazardous wastes unless truly exceptional situation exists this policy leaves municipality vulnerable to epa enforcement chiefly where it is or was the owner or operator of the site41 or where the waste contains hazardous substances from nonhousehold sources word about codisposal landfills prior to the advent of federal regulation of hazardous waste in 1980 under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra42 it was common practice for landfills to accept both municipal trash and hazardous waste these prehazardous waste regulation facilities known as codisposal landfills raise some of the same issues as solid waste landfills at codisposal landfills there are many contributors possibly thousands of waste containing only small amounts or low concentrations of hazardous waste these parties are tempting thirdparty defendants from which contributors of more toxic wastes can seek contribution for cleanup costs epa has sought to blunt the threat of such contribution actions at codisposal landfills by offering nonde micromis generators and transporters of municipal solid waste the option of cashing out at 530 per ton of waste sent to the site43 recall that micromis contributors may often settle with epa for zero dollars importantly such settlement allows epa to confer contribution protection on the settlor hr 1300 and hr 2580 are identical in how they treat persons including municipalities in their capacity as arrangers and transporters of msw and sewagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs15 sludge such persons are not liable for response costs or natural resource damages at an npl landfill if the arranging or transporting occurred prior to enactment of the bill liability may be imposed on persons in the business of transporting waste however if the material transported contributed significantly to response costs as for arranging and transporting msw and sewage sludge after bill enactment the aggregate liability of all arrangers and transporters at the npl landfill shall not exceed 10 of response costs special rule exempts homeowners small businesses and small nonprofit organizations from cercla liability for generating and transporting msw in connection with npl landfills msw is defined to include waste materials generated by households and hotelsmotels and also by commercial and institutional sources to the extent the waste is essentially the same as household waste or is collected with other msw and contains only micromi s amounts of hazardous substances the term does not include combustion ash and solid waste from processes involving ores and minerals hr 1300 and hr 2580 diverge however in their treatment of municipalities as owners or operators of facilities that receive msw hr 1300 simply states aggregate liability limits for small population 100000 or less versus large municipalities as to facilities proposed for npl listing before march 25 1999 and response costs on or after that date small municipalities are limited to 10 of total response costs large municipalities to 20 under hr 2580 municipality liable as an owner or operator of landfill listed on the npl on or before september 1 1999 must be offered settlement the settlement shall be offered on the basis of payment or other obligation equivalent to more than 20 of total response costs this ceiling may be increased to 35 if the municipality exacerbated the contamination or received operating revenues from the facility above specified amount the president may decline to offer settlement if there is only msw or sewage sludge at the facility or all other prps are insolvent or eligible for settlement the towns substitute exempts homeowners small businesses and small nonprofit organizations from liability as arrangers and transporters its definition of msw is similar to that in the republican bills except that it does not exempt solid waste from processes involving ore and minerals the towns substitute also ratifies epas msw settlement policy for arrangers and transporters of msw and sewage sludge sent to npl codisposal facilities thus the president is instructed by the substitute to offer settlement to such party on the basis of payment of 530 per ton of msw or sewage sludge contributed for municipality to be eligible for settlement acts giving rise to liability must have occurred less than 2 years after enactment of the substitute prp shall be ineligible for settlement if the facility contains only msw or sewage sludge under certain conditions persons who sent msw together with other hazardous substances may be eligible for the perton settlement rate as to the msw or sewage sludge sent as for municipal owners and operators the substitute provides for settlements based on payment or other

organizations existing cercla treats charitable institutions just as any other prps this has discouraged such institutions from accepting donations of property that might contain hazardous contamination once the institution acquires such site it is an owner under cercla and fully subject to section 107 liability moreover the liability of the institution is not limited by cercla to the value of the donated facility but could easily be far greater hr 1300 and hr 2580 are identical on this matter each would limit the owneroperator liability of charitable organiza tions those described under section 501c3 of the internal revenue code to the lesser of the fair market value of the donated facility and the actual proceeds of the sale of the facility to invoke this liability exemption however the organization would have to show that the facility was acquired after the hazardous substances were disposed of and that it did not contribute to the release the towns substitute does not address this issue recyclers existing cercla treats recyclers just as any other prps given the social desirability of recycling some argue that recyclers should be subject to more lenient liability standard than other prps hr 1300 and hr 2580 are nearly identical in their treatment of recyclers with the exception of hr 1300s inclusion of used oil each bill provides that person who arranged for the recycling of recyclable material or transported such material shall not incur arranger or transporter liability under cercla recyclable material is defined to mean scrap paper scrap plastic scrap glass scrap textiles scrap rubber scrap metal spent batteries and for hr 1300 used oil the liability exemption does not apply however if the person had an objectively reasonable basis to believe that the material would not be recycled or would be burned other than used oil the person had reason to believe that hazardous substances had been added to the material or the person failed to exercise reasonable care as to the management and handling of the material the towns substitute is very similar to the above bills used oil is not covered late development that moots almost all of the recycler provisions in the bills and substitute is the enactment of public law 106113 on november 29 1999 this law contained rider added by senator lott which is almost identical with the recycler section of

component of scrap rubber construction contractors current cercla affords special treatment to construction contractors whose activities trigger releases of preexisting contamination at site hr 1300 and hr 2580 exempt construct ion contractors from liability for cleanup costs and natural resource damages where the contractor can show that he did not know or have reason to know of the hazardous substances at the facility and exercised appropriate care as to the discovered substances the towns substitute does not address this issue contiguous property owners cercla does not exempt landowner from liability merely because the contamination on his property arrived there from elsewhere with complicity on the landowners part at least in theory homeowner who has the misfortune to live near hazardous dumpsite may become prp when contaminated groundwater from the dumpsite migrates onto his property epa policies state that the agency will not seek to impose cercla liability on residential homeowners unless their activities led to the release45 and on owners of land above aquifers contaminated by subsurface migration from outside the property46 hr 1300 hr 2580 and the towns substitute all contain exemptions differently worded for owners and operators of property contiguous to real property under other ownership from which there is release of hazardous substances hr 2580 and the towns substitute also confer the exemption on those similarly situated to the contiguous property owner while hr 1300 extends to any property onto which release has migrated covered parties are exempted only if various conditions are met such as depending on the billsubstitute the owner did not cause the release is not affiliated with any person at the facility where the release occurred fully cooperates with those conducting the cleanup etc brownfields development epa defines brownfields as abandoned idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination47 many such sites are located in the urban core and are well served by infrastructure the current cercla however contains provisions easing liability for persons who buy such sites with the socially desirable goal of upgrading them the result is that capital investment is steered away from such desolate closein sites termed brownfields and toward pristine outlying areas greenfieldshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs18 48 60 fed reg 34792 1995 49 62 fed reg 4624 1997while the statute is silent epa has undertaken several liabilityrelated initiatives to encourage brownfields development most directly on point the agency has allowed expanded use of prospective purchaser agreements48 these constitute action assurance by epa that it will not enforce against someone who wants to buy contaminated property for cleanup or redevelopment there must be clear benefit to epa often obtaining cleanup funding not otherwise available andor to the community in entering into the agreement another initiative is the epa comfort letter notification to the prospective buyer of brownfield such as closed military base as to epas enforcement intentions there based on information then known to epa49 comfort letters are not binding assurances however as the prospective purchaser agreements are they are solely informational the above epa policies however constrain only epa they provide assurance that other parties may not sue under the act in some cases however epa may consider minimis settlement with buyer to protect himher from contribution suits expanding on epas prospective purchaser policy hr 2580 and the towns substitute would exempt bona fide prospective purchasers from presentow ner liability bona fide prospective purchaser is one who buys facility after bill enactment and after all active disposal of hazardous substances who made all appropriate inquiry into the previous uses of the facility provided all required notices as to any hazardous substances discovered exercised appropriate care cooperates with any authorized cleanup and is not affiliated with any prp at the facility where federal response action increases the market value of bona fide purchasers facility the united states obtains windfall lien against the facility for its unrecovered response costs the innocent landowner provisions in the bills and substitute also can be thought of as facilitating brownfields development innocent landowner provisions differ from prospective purchaser provisions above in that with the former the pre purchase all appropriate inquiry cannot reveal any hazardous substances both bills and the towns substitute would clarify the meaning of all appropriate inquiry precondition for invoking the innocentpurchaser exemption in the current act response action contractors soon after cercla was enacted in 1980 it was realized that the response action contractors racs who clean up contaminated sites could conceivably be regarded as prps eg as operators or transporters exposing them to cercla liability obviously this was disincentive to companies coming forward to do the cleanup work in the 1986 amendments to cercla provisions were added to soften the liability exposure of racs new section 119 says that under cercla or any other federal law racs are subject only to negligenceintentional misconduct standard not strict liability as under cercla moreover under certain circumstances the president may indemnify racs for negligent conduct but not grossly negligent or intentional misconducthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98136crs19 hr 1300 and hr 2580 contain very similar modifications to the liability provisions of section 119 both would expand the negligenceintentional misconduct standard to preclude the use of stricter standard under not just federal law but state law as well the federal liability threshold however would not apply where the state has enacted law determining the liability of racs hr 1300 but not hr 2580 imposes statute of limitations on claims against racs namely six years from completion of the racs work the towns substitute does not address this issue inability to pay current cercla does not explicitly note prps ability to pay as factor to be considered in assessing the dollar amount of liability both the bills and the substitute would make prps limited ability to pay consideration under cercla by making it circumstance authorizing an expedited settlement the other circumstance being the minimis contributor as well both bills and substitute stipulate that the party seeking expedited settlement must be natural person small business or municipality and can demonstrate an inability or limited ability to pay response costs hr 1300 and hr 2580 define small business to mean business that employs more than 100 persons the towns substitute appears not to define small business for purposes of this abilitytopay provision though as noted above it is defined elsewhere
