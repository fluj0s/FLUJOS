prevention suicide and life threatening behavior vol 36 issue 6 pp 61437 december 2006in order to prevent suicide an individual who has positive screen will need to see mental health professional and receive appr opriate care there are number of issues with schoolbased screening programs ability to effectively identify all students who may be suicidal these issues are outlined below first when screening program is implement ed in school setting it misses large section of the youth population including yout h who are in the juvenile justice system those who miss school on the day of the sc reening and those who have dropped out these youth who are not screened are believed to be at higher risk for suicidal behavior second screening programs provide informa tion about childs suicidal ideation9 on the day of the screen they miss child who was considering suicide in the days prior to the screen or child who develops suicidal t houghts during the days following the screen third screening tools vary in their performance as measured by screens sensitivity10 and specificity11 preliminary research findings question the feasibility of screening tool being sensitive enough and specific enough to be costeffective in the general population12 screening tool that has high sensitivity tends to have low specificity in other words while it may capture all those i ndividuals who have significant mental and emotional problems it will give false positive result to many other individuals who do not have such problems conversely scr eening tool with high specificity but low sensitivity will miss many individuals with sign ificant problems list of tested screening tools and their reported sensitivity and specificity is in table 1 below table 1 sensitivity and specificity

mission passive parent consent involves screening child unless parents send re sponse denying permission to the school to screen their child in general most communities have accepte d screening programs conducted with active parental consent however it has been observed that requiring active parental consent leads to screening 50 60 of youth requi ring passive parental consent leads to screening 8090 of youth requiring active consent lowers the screening rate primarily because of youth not showing notice to their parents mental h ealth in general and psychological testing specifically are cultural issues due to privacy concerns and stigma around mental illness some parents and groups are reluctant to allow schools to screen their children for suicidal ideation aside from addressing th concerns proponents note that screening program that requires active consent builds community support for the issue and builds the necessary infrastructure to ensure that child who screens positive receives followup care moreover community ownership and involvement reportedl increase the chances that program will be sustained af ter initial grant funds are exhausted13 some parents also are concerned about unnecessary medica tion of children with psychotropic drugs due to the limitations caused by the selection bias and the screening tool itself some experts question the usefulness of screen ing programs that are not part of comprehensive public health approach to icide prevention such an approach involves recognizing and decreasing risk factors enhancing protective factors and providing mental health services and followup care to individuals who screen positive for suicidal ideation does the federal government promote screening of youth for suicide the federal government does not mandate mental health screening for children however recent presidential commission on mental health r ecommended targeting screening in highrisk settings with active parental consent samhsa funds youth suicide prevention programs including screening through the garrett lee smith grants and makes grants to local education systems to evaluate and identify evidencebased practices for facilitating treatment for atrisk youth presidents new freedom co mmission on mental health in its july 2003 report the presidents new freedom commissi on on mental health concluded that the us mental health care system is fragmente d and inadequate and beyond simple repair14 the commission recommended wholesale tran sformation of the na tions approach to mental health care one

position on mental health screening in letter to the washington times16 the commission did not call for mandatory universal mental health screening for all children recognizing the need to bala nce suicideprevention and access to medical care with the rights and responsibilities of parents and being aware of the devastating impact of youth suicide the commission proposed broad screening only in settings where many children are known to have untr eated behavioral problems beyond this the commission promoted programs that provide voluntary screening only with parental consent the commissions final report includes the following language relating to mental health screening for children the commission supports implementing systematic screening procedures to identify mental health and substance use problems nd treatment needs in all settings in which children youth adults or older adults ar at high risk for mental illnesses recommendation 43 clearly school mental health programs must provide any screening or treatment services with full attention to the confid entiality and privacy of children and families recommendation 42 in this final report whenever child or children is used it is understood that parents or guardians should be included in the pro cess of making choices and decisions for minor children this allows the family to provide support and guidance when developing relationships with mental h ealth professionals community resource representatives teachers and anyone else th individual or family invites footnote to executive summary the commission cited columbia universitys teenscreen program as model for early intervention teenscreen identifie s and connects children suffering from mental illness or who may be at risk for suicidal behavior with treatment providers in their area the program is used in variety of settings including juvenile detention facilities high schools juvenile shelters nd youth dropin centers to screen children who

both the house and nate appropriati ons reports for the first time included language that specifically addresses mental health screening the house report did not include specific do llar amount for screening but noted that samhsa is overseeing very promising pilot study utilizing evidencebased19 screening techniques and tools to screen and identify teenagers who are at risk20 the house report urged samhsa to evaluate the effectiveness of the study and report on concrete steps being taken to promote early screening and detection prog rams available in schools the senate report also recogniz ed the pilot study adding that several promising screening techniques to identify youth at risk exist but they need further testing unlike the house the senate included 45 million for testing the use of screening mechanisms and identifying evidencebased practices21 the fy2005 conference report provided 2 million to make grants to local educational systems to further test the use and identify evidencebased practices for facilitating treatment for teenagers suffering from mental emo tional or behavioral disorders22 in fy2006 the house and senate appropr iations reports include d level funding to c ontinue testing these programs23 in fy2007 the appropriations committ ees recommended that samhsa use its suicide prevention funds to continue developing and sting evidencebased interventions including screening24 in fy2008 the appropriations committees recommended that samhsa strengthen its effort s to assist local educational systems and nonprofit entities to imple ment mental health screening programs25 conclusion federally funded screening pr ograms currently require ac tive parental consent on the one hand this policy may decrease the numbe r of children who are screened on the other hand involving parents before the scre ening program makes it more likely that child who screens positive will receive follow up care from mental health professional implementing an effective schoolbased screen ing program requires car eful consideration of the issues outlined above while observe rs generally acknowledge the value of early identification referral and trea tment of suicidal child ther are also concerns about the effectiveness and costefficacy of relatively lessfocused effort instead of universal screening program recent studies have r ecommended selective screening program that targets children who are known to be at high risk for suicide
