management evmfor overseeing the cost schedule and performance of major capital investments during the investment process eg information technology systems structures weapons systems evm provides metrics to help inform assessments of whether capital investments are on track from three perspectives the investments planned cost time schedule and functionality variance from projects planned cost schedule and functionality might occur due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of project poor planning or implementation or sometimes simply bad luck although evm attempts to address several significant monitoring and evaluation issues other evaluation techniques are typically necessary in order to understand why variance from the planned cost schedule or functionality might be occurring in addition other evaluation methods are typically more useful in assessing other significant questions such as whether project is worth undertaking or continuing and after the investment process is completed whether an investment might be having an impact on achieve ment of an agencys mission or the success of public policy compared with what would have happened without the investment evm may be of increasing salience in executive branch practices and implicitly or explicitly in presentations to congress this report begins by putting evm within broader context of risk management and how capital investments are often evaluated and monitored throughout their life cycles next the report provides an overview of evm terminology and concepts by using an example and illustrating few potential oversight issues and caveats the report concludes with some potential oversight questions for congress the report will be updated periodically

investments include development and acquisition of major capital assets such as equipment eg hardware for weapons systems satellites and information technology it structures eg the capitol visitor center intellectual property eg software and combinations thereof capital investment can play critical role therefore in the accomplishment of agency missions and the success of public policies congress has often taken strong interest in the performance cost and schedule of major capital investments in addition congress has taken strong interest in establishing and maintaining accountability mechanisms to ensure that the president office of manage ment and budget omb and agencies fulfill statutory duties accomplish prescribed public policy goals report transparently and fully and act as careful stewards of public resources 1 earned value management evm which is the subject of this report is management technique that provides metrics to help inform assessments of whether capital investment is on track from three perspectives planned cost time schedule and functionality the latter concept often referred to as performance technical performance capability scope of work or planned value using these three perspectives evm compares the planned cost schedule and functionality against an ideally accurate measurement of what is actually happening 2 frequently evm metrics serve to raise potential issues that require further investigation or study rather than provide the full picture of projects progress and status evm may be of increasing salience in executive branch practices and implicitly or explicitly in presentations to congress evm might also be used as an oversight tool for congress this report provides an overview of evm terminology and concepts by using hypothetical example and illustrating few potential oversight issues to place evm in context however it is necessary to discuss first the risks associated with major capital investments how capital investments are often evaluated and monitored throughout their life cycles and how evm appears to be increasingly adopted by executive branch agencies after providing the hypothetical evm example and some related caveats the report concludes with potential oversight questions for congress regarding evm

the planning and implementation of major capital investment are not simple tasks consequently major capital projects in both the public and private sectors are considered to be inherently risky for purposes of capital asset investment risk might be described as the 1 for example see us congress senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs subcommittee on federal financial

opportunities will not be exploited unless project is carefully managed risk might increase substantially in both of these senses adverse events that might occur include schedule delays cost overruns and performance shortfalls or failures favorable opportunities that might not be pursued or noticed could include chances to complete project more quickly at less cost and with better than planned performance in achieving the mission or one or more goals in response agencies must make substantial efforts to plan effectively and manage risk in order to achieve successful outcomes given the complexity and inherent risk of major capital investments however it should be noted that problems cannot always be avoided even in wellplanned and implemented projects many stakeholdersincluding congress the president agency employees and the publicoften take strong interest in the performance cost and schedule of major capital investments the interest stems directly from the missioncritical nature of many investments furthermore interest in specific capital investments can become heightened when something has gone wrong indeed the consequences of poorly managed capital investment project can be significant and when investments in major capital assets fail they can fail spectacularly 3 journalists inspectors general igs and the government accountability office gao are sometimes the first actors to disclose publicly that major capital investment by the us government has gone awry nonetheless such disclosures are often lagging indicators of problems rather than leading or coinciding indicators furthermore capital investment problems themselves can be lagging indicators of more fundamental problems with management capacity transparency and accountability 4 3 many years and millions of dollars can be wasted on larg project with little or nothing other than frustration to show for the effort for example the federal bureau of inve stigations fbis virtual case file vcf it project part of the fbis trilogy it investment initiative was abandoned in 2005 after 170 million was spent see chris strom fbi solicits proposals for new information system govexeccom aug 9 2005

modernization project report 0507 feb 2005 available at httpwwwusdojgovoigr eportsfbia0507finalpdf ev when project has not necessarily failed preventable cost schedule and performance problems can also have unwelcome consequences adverse events like these can hamper an agencys ability to accomplish its public policy mission and goals as intended by congress waste funds disrupt the strategies and plans of stakeholders eg nongovernmental organizations or state and local governments and reduce public confidence in governments stewardship of tax dollars 4 major capital investment problems can result from many factor s including the inherent complexity and uncertainty of project poor planning or implementation during the investment process for new or existing capital asset or sometimes simply bad luck for example some deviations from the planned cost schedule or functionality are not necessarily reflective of mismanagement but rather an inevitable result of projects complexity and uncertainty other deviations might be characterized as management problems however long before project starts insufficient research and planning can ensure future difficulties an agency or official might not complete the necessary research and planning to understand fully the changes that need to be made perhaps or in what sequence the changes should be pursued the research and planning might be insufficient at root because of an omission of an important consideration insufficient resources lack of involvement or cooperation among stakeholders systematically poor management or superiors pressure or decision to proceed against project managers or executives recommendation implementation problems might also surface once project has begun potential implementation problems include insufficient coordination top management attention or discipline analytical capacity resources skills cooperation or oversight problems can also result from unforeseen events like major changes in circumstances or technology that might render project obsolete before it is finished still other events that cause problems might be foreseeable but plausibly judged so unlikely that they need not be factored into decision making distinguishing among potential causes of problems eg uncertainty poor management bad luck can be challenge however requiring further investigation and evaluation

the planned versus actual progress regarding the planned cost schedule and functionality of major capital asset evm attempts to address several significant monitoring and evaluation issues evm does not however address all important monitoring and evaluation issues that could contribute to an assessment of an investments status and progress therefore evms use as management and oversight tool for major capital investments arguably should be considered within larger context variety of techniques can be used to monitor and evaluate major capital investments prospectively concurrently and retrospectively furthermore these activities can occur throughout the life cycle of capital assetthat is during initial planning the acquisition or development process and operational use as well as after disposal 5 because evm is intended to inform assessments of whether capital investment is on track with respect to planned cost schedule and functionality evm takes place primarily during the acquisition process for new asset or modification of an existing asset but can also occur during planning figure 1 provides illustrative lists of capital planning and programming activities that agencies often undertake during each of the four phases of capital investments life cycle the figure also shows corresponding lists of the monitoring and evaluation activities including evm that are often used to support the agency activities6 5 in capital investment context monitoring and evaluation efforts are used to address several challenges including 1 identifying analyzing and proposing investment opportunitie s that could improve performance of policy or agency mission 2 managing risk during the capital investments planning acquisition and development and operational use 3 facilitating learning improvement and achievement of required functionality during operational use in support of policy or agency mission and 4 providing for transparency and accountability in achieving all of the above 6 the phases are described according to ombs perspective in us executive office of the president office of management and budget circular a11 part 7 planning budgeting

project risks are not new nor are efforts to mitigate risks of major capital investments and prevent failures for example the first edition of ombs capital programming guide for agencies was published in 1997 before then congress had enacted statutory provisions that were related to major capital investments including among others provision amending the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 41 usc 263a which now declares that it is the policy of congress that the head of each executive agency should achieve on average 90 percent of the cost performance and schedule goals established for major acquisition programs of the agency7 provisions to require the secretary of defense and heads of all executive agencies to establish cost performance and schedule goals for major acquisition programs8 and the clingercohen act of 1996 pl 104106 later codified and 7 this language was originally enacted in somewhat different form in title v of the federal acquisition streamlining

omb has issued number of requirements and directions to executive agencies that specifically concern evm for example omb included in its circular a11 an annual document that communicates budget formulation and execution re quirements to agenciesdetailed directions for agencies to use evm for major capital assets part 7 among other things the circular directed agencies to submit an exhibit 300 capital asset plan and business case summary for each major investment as part of their annual budget submissions to omb for the white houses use when formulating the presidents annual budget proposal for congressional consideration the circular also said that an exhibit 300 is designed to coordinate ombs collection of agency information for its reports to the congress required by the federal acquisition streamlining act of 1994 fasa title v and the clingercohen act of 1996 10 the circular defined evm as follows citing an i ndustry standard to which agencies would be expected to adhere earned value management evm is project investment management tool that effectively integrates the investment scope of work with schedule and cost elements for optimum investment planning and control the qualities and operating characteristics of earned value management systems are described in american national standards institute ansielectronic industries alliance ia standard7481998

management systems is available at httpwwwacqosdmilpm i1 citing room for improvement in the execution of our it projects omb has also provided directions concerning major it capital investments to agency chief information officers in an august 2005 memorandum11 the memorandum stated that at the time agencies were already required to meet four principal criteria for it capital investments the criteria included along with two others 1 the establishment and validation of performance measurement baseline with clear cost schedule and performance goals 12 and 2 the management and measurement of

earned value management system compliant with the ansi standard cited in circular a11 the memorandum also added new expectations for agencies including directions to 1 ensure that cost schedule and performance goals for new major it projects are independently validated for reasonableness before beginning development and 2 provide for all ongoing major it projects with development efforts for independent validations of thencurrent cost schedule and performance baselines by march 31 2006 and submission of proposed changes of baselines for omb approval 13 evm requirements have also been added to executive branch acquisition regulations on july 5 2006 three agencies promulgated final rule on behalf of the civilian agency acquisition council and the defense acquisition regulations council to amend the federal acquisition regulation far the stated purpose of the change was among other things to implement earned value management system evms policy in accordance with omb circular a11 part 7 and the supplement to part 7 the capital planning sic guide and help standardize the use of evms across the government for those parts of an acquisition where developmental effort is required 14 the far changes required agencies to use an evms for certain major acquisitions for development15 in accordance with circular a11 and potentially also for other acquisitions in accordance with individual agency procedures the new regulations also specified that the qualities and operating characteristics of an earned value management system are described in the ansieia standard 748 that was cited by circular a11 see the extended circular a11 quotation above under the regulations agency contracting officers were directed to at minimum require contractors to submit evms monthly reports for those contracts for which an evms applies in addition omb says it has used evm data to determine agency scores under the george w bush administrations initiative concerning the management of agencies in the executive branchthe presidents management agenda pma 16 although the pma s standards are publicly available pma evaluation practices have not been fully transparent outside of omb and 13 the memorandum explained what was meant by independent as follows an independent assessment may be performed by qualified source provided such source is not involved in the projects development implementation management or direct supervision provided they are qualified such source may include the agency inspector general current independent verification and validation reviewers or any other source internal to the agency or outside the agency including another agency agencies currently using integrated baseline reviews ibrs may substitute an ibr for an independent assessment reasonable baselines are accurate relevant timely and complete an ibr has been defined as joint governmentcontractor review to assess the realism and accuracy of the integrated performance measurement baseline

it appears that the bush administration and most executive branch agencies are widely adopting evm for major capital assets for purposes of budgeting management and reporting specifically as noted above evm has been formally adopted in requirements for preparation of the presidents annual budget proposal agency contract management and formal scoring criteria under the administrations pma initiative it appears therefore that evm metrics will be presented either implicitly or explicitly to congress in variety of venues sometimes packaged along w ith the presidents views and representations about budgetary and management priorities due to the substantially public nature of the budget process the metrics will similarly be presented either implicitly or explicitly to the public at large some of whom play significant role in the budget process through provision of information and opinions to elected officials it appears therefore that potential ongoing issue for congress will be judging whether underlying evm metrics are fully forthrightly timely and transparently reported in addition it appears that corresponding issue for congress might be understanding interpreting and scrutinizing evm metrics as potential inputs to congressional oversight appropriations of funds and authorization or reauthorization of agency and presidential activities in each of these situations evm information might be relevant to informing congresss assessments of whether acquisitions of major capital assets are on track with respect to planned cost schedule and functionality and in turn inform subsequent decision making with these considerations in mind the following tables and corresponding text present hypothetical example of evm metrics being applied to the development and acquisition of major capital asset the purpose of explaining how evm works through an example here is to give concrete illustrations of the types of basic analyses that can be performed with evm as well as to illustrate how evm can be used to identi fy potential topics for followup investigation and study eg perhaps with congressional oversi ght or complementary evaluations included in figure 1 the type of asset described here could be any of those described at the beginning of this report including weapons system satellite structure it system etc the example presented here is adapted from an example that has been published in variety of forms for number of years in federal government websites and publications 18 but also draws on other 17 for discussion see crs report rl32388 general management laws major themes and management policy options by clinton t brass section titled making and measuring progress pp 1926 18 the department of defense dod has maintained website on evm for many years including brief illustrative explanation of earned value available at httpwwwacqosdmilpmfaqsevbasicshtm this reports adaptation draws some material verbatim from the dod website ombs circular a11 and capital programming guide have also included nearly identical example for number of years app 3 of the capital programming guide and some previous versions

capital investment called project b the project has six work units represented by the letters through f which are interrelated but distinct subcomponents of the project20 for simple example relating to structure work units might include concrete framing roofing electrical plumbing and interior collectively work units through f are also referred to as the projects work breakdown structure wbs21 in this example project b has been underway for period of time already and all the work units were planned to be successfully completed by the time of this evm report the original plan for project bs costs schedule for completion and functionality is referred to as the projects baseline identified here as b 1 see table 1 22 later in the life of the project it is possible that the project could be rebaselined baselined again with new cost schedule and functionality plans in order to for example conform to management decision or reflect new circumstances23 t able 1 baseline plan of w ork units

work units af are planned to be completed at an overall cost of 100 for the time period covered by this report 24 each work unit is listed with its own planned budgetthat is the amount of money that is planned to be spent to successfully build and complete the functionality planned for the work unit work unit d therefore is planned to be successfully completed within the time period covered by

somewhat from project to project agency to agency and type of asset to type of asset therefore the terminology and practices presente d here will not necessarily refl ect terminology and practices for specific agencies projects or types of assets the underlying concepts however presumably apply across the board exact definitions of terms are available from variety of sources including circular a11 the dod website and the ansieia748a1998 earned value management systems standard 20 depending on many factors major capital investments work units might be called modules useful segments components or other terms some of these terms might have special definitions in some circumstances 21 the work breakdown structure might also subdivide the work units listed here into smaller components 22 the baseline is also some times referred to as the performance measurement baseline pmb 23 because project can be rebaselined by changing the plan for cost schedule and functionality it is typically always important to be clear regarding what baseline is the subject of discussion and also the reasons why project might have been rebaselined 24 the sum of all budgets established for the contract is sometimes referred to as budget at completion bac

that this report will also generically call metric other metrics will be introduced as this section progresses in sense when the agency that is paying for project b and the agencys contractor agree to plan that 25 will be spent to successfully complete work unit d it could be said that the functionality that corresponds to work unit d has taken monetary value of 25 assigning work unit ds functionality quantitative value denominated in dollars according to the planned budget for that functionality in turn will allow quantitative representation of how much of work unit d may have been completed at any given point in time as explained below g7g161g153g149g138g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561 g7g138g155g151g142g141g561g24g138g149g158g142 g561g138g151g141g561

in table 2 shows the same planned value that was portrayed in table 1 for project b and its constituent work units according to the projects planned baseline b 1 note that the planned value for project bs various work units continues to sum to 100 the overall cost of the contract to the agency the second row is new this row is intended to show how much functionality has actually been successfully developed by the date this evm report was produced work unit for example is shown with an earned value denominated in dollars of 10 this means that the functionality that was planned for work unit has been successfully completed or earned and becomes earned value 26 not merely value that was planned as work is successfully performed therefore it is earned on the same basis as it was planned stated differently work unit has earned the full functionality that was planned and the work unit and overall project are therefore credited with 10 of value that has been earned for purposes of work unit looking across the table one sees similar situations with work units b c and in each case the functionality that was planned for these work units has been successfully and fully developed or earned work units d and f however are another story table 2 shows that work unit d was partially but not fully completed and also that work unit f was never started only 10 worth of functionality out of work unit ds planned value of 25 has been accomplished in other words only 40 of the work associated with work unit d has been successfully completed and 60 of the work has not been successfully completed as result work unit d is said to have schedule variance of 15 10 earned value minus 25 planned value equals 15 schedule variance with evm the term variance therefore implicitly means difference from the relevant plan or baseline the variance is denominated in dollar terms because dollars ie dollars of planned value represent the functionality that is planned to be developed and eventually either delivered 25 the term planned value is sometimes referred to as budgeted cost for work scheduled bcws 26 the term earned value is sometimes referred to as budgeted cost for work performed bcwp

15 behind schedule compared with the baseline b 1 planned value of 25 or equivalently expressed in percentage terms work unit d is 60 behind schedule because work unit f was never started work unit f has schedule variance of 20 and is 100 behind schedule when work units through f are summed out of the planned value of 100 for project b only 65 of the planned functionality has been successfully developed thanks to work units d and f falling behind schedule overall project b is therefore said to have an earned value of 65 35 lower than the projects planned value and is said to have schedule variance of 35 or in percentage terms 35 schedule variance ie 35 behind schedule compared to what was planned to be accomplished the 35 schedule variance might also be understood as shortfall in the functionality that had been planned to be delivered within the time period of the evm report an explanation of why work units d and f were not successfully completed however is not captured with evm data to construct such an explanation other evaluation and monitoring methods from figure 1 might need to be explored in addition it would probably be possible to use qualitative and quantitative information from individuals involved in the project and potentially also from stakeholders to construct interpretations of what might have caused the slip in schedule as gao has cautioned it is important to understand that variances are neither good nor bad they are merely measures that indicate that work is not being performed according to plan and that it must be assessed further to understand why 27 the schedule variance metric discussed above ie the difference between planned value and earned value only captures part of the overall story of project b whether the project is on schedule or behind schedule one has yet to look at whether the project is on track with regard to its actual cost in comparison to the baseline b 1 the question of whether project b is on track with its planned cost is the subject of table 3 below g7g161g153g149g138g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561 g3g140g157g158g138g149g561g5g152g156g157 g561g138g151g141g561

compared to the baseline for each work unit the table compares the value of the functionality that was successfully delivered earned value which was discussed above with the amount of money that was actually spent to achieve that functionality actual cost the first of the two new metrics 28 by subtracting the actual cost from the earned value one calculates the second new metric cost variance 27

understanding cost variance for individual work units and also the overall project in table 3 the first row of evm data shows that work unit was successfully delivered creating earned value of 1029 the second row of evm data shows that the actual cost of work unit was only 9 or 1 under the earned value subtracting the 9 actual cost from the 10 earned value results in 1 cost variance positive number for cost variance therefore means something was delivered under budget work unit c similarly came in under budget as shown by its positive cost variance work units b d and by contrast show that cost overruns have occurred30 negative cost variance means that work unit or portion of work unit was delivered over budget more money was spent for the work successfully accomplished than was planned to achieve the full functionality that was delivered for work unit b represented by the work units earned value the actual cost was 22 considerably higher than the original budget planned value the cost variance for work unit b is 7 representing cost overrun in percentage terms the cost overrun can be calculated by dividing the cost variance ie 7 the excess amount spent over the budgeted amount by the earned value ie 15 the value of the functionality that was delivered the cost overrun was therefore nearly 47 for work unit d the picture looks even worse in developing the functionality represented by 10 of earned value only portion of the hopedf or functionality represented by 25 in planned value the actual cost was 30 that is only 40 of work unit ds planned functionality was delivered successfully but at cost that exceeded the budget for the entire work unit work unit ds cost variance is 20 10 earned value minus 30 actual cost or 200 the intuition behind the 200 figure is as follows only portion of work unit d was successfully delivered ie 10 out of work unit ds overall planned value of 25 was successfully delivered becoming 10 in earned value 31 looking at work unit d overall the portion of the work units functionality that was delivered successfully ended up costing three times more than what was planned 30 actual cost instead of 10 which is 200 overrun for that portion of work unit d that was successfully completed32 29 recall that in tables 1 and 2 work unit was planned to be delivered at cost of 10 and therefore had planned value of 10 full delivery of that functionality would therefore result in 10 of earned value 30 however simply because cost overrun has occurred does not necessarily mean the work unit or project was mismanaged as discussed earlier in this report many factors might cause problems cost overruns schedule slips and functionality shortfalls or failures for major capital investment 31 stated differently work unit ds overall planned value was 25 and the planned value of the work that was successfully completed was 10 32 200 cost overrun means that costs were triple what was planned 100 cost overrun means that costs were twice what was planned etc

not started money was spent on the work unit resulting in cost variance of zero looking at project b overall in terms of its b 1 baseline the earned value for the major capital investment is 65 nearly twothirds of the planned functionality in achieving 65 in earned value however 91 was spent stated differently the portion of the overall project that was performed successfully ie the 65 earned value was by definition originally planned to cost 65 ie the portion had planned value of 65 but in the end was completed at an actual overall cost of 91 33 these metrics result in an overall cost variance for the project of 26 earned value of 65 minus an actual cost of 91 or exactly 40 26 cost variance divided by the earned value of 65 project b therefore could be said to have experienced 40 cost overrun on the capability that has been successfully delivered the capability that was successfully delivered in the time period of the evm report in turn was substantially less than the capability that was planned to be delivered in the time period 35 the schedule variance which shows schedule slip and corresponding functionality shortfall

evm tutorials often compare evm metrics with an oversight tool that is often considered not useful the spend comparison 34 the typical spend comparison approach whereby contractors report actual expenditures against planned expenditures is unrelated to the functionality that was successfully delivered see table 4 t able 4 spend comparison of w ork units pr oject b 1 work u nits of pr oject b

actual spending which is unrelated to work performed and therefore potentially misleading and not very useful comparison the fact that the overall amount spent was 9 less than planned for this period is not useful for most purposes because the metrics lack comparisons of spending with the functionality that was successfully delivered

aspects of evm comparing the planned cost time schedule and functionality for major capital investment against the actual cost time schedule and functionality of what was successfully delivered many observers emphasize that evm might help facilitate the correction of problems during the investment process for 33 portion of work unit has planned value therefore that is only portion of the work

practitioner perspective the benefits to project management of the earned value approach come from the disciplined planning conducted and the availability of metrics which show real variances from plan in order to generate necessary corrective actions35 another potential benefit of evm from an oversight perspective is to provide picture of the status of major capital investment at snapshot in time evm calculations might enable project managers contractors program managers overseers and outside stakeholders to see quickly and simply whether or not project is on track with its baseline plan negative schedule variance or cost variance indicates schedule slip or cost overrun whereas positive variances indicate project is ahead of schedule or under budget evm metrics might thereby suggest the need for additional analysis in targeted ways to explain the root causes of problems and what could be done if anything to get project back on track 36 or even provide evidence of more fundamental management resource and oversight problems evm metrics do not however necessarily tell the whole story as discussed below g5g138g159g142g138g157g497g561g7g24g15g561g15g142g157g155g146g140g156g561g15g146g144g145g157g561g22g142g149g149g561g17g151g149g162g561g18g138g155g157g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g21g157g152g155g162g561 the story that evm tells can be significant one once the basic jargon and concepts of evm are understood evm provides visually simple picture on periodic basis of whether or not project is on track with plans for oversight purposes evm can thereby flag outliers and signal the potential need to ask further questions the prospect of this scrutiny might in turn provide incentives to omb and agencies to among other things 1 closely monitor the progress of major capital investments and more fundamentally 2 build the capacity eg resources staff skills management attention and discipline and processes for omb and agencies to properly manage investmentrelated activities and evaluations nonetheless without further evaluation of project evm metrics might tell only partial story for example even when evm metrics are accurately captured and portrayed the metrics typically will not reveal why project might be experiencing schedule or cost variances process or implementation evaluation might be necessary to address such questions eg to verify and complement explanations that are provided by contractors in addition other evaluation methods see figure 1 are typically used to assess other significant and sometimes more fundamental questions including 1 whether pr oject is worth undertaking or continuing and 2 after the investment process is completed what impact an investment might be having on achievement of an agencys mission or the success of public policy compared to what would have happened without the investment in addition projects baseline plan and corresponding evm data might not accurately represent the cost and schedule that are most likely necessary for project to achieve particular functionality cost schedule and functionality plans are of course made in the context of complexity and uncertainty which oftentimes can guarantee that capital investment project will not proceed according to plan alternatively estimates of projects costs schedule functionality and benefits might be based on insufficient research and analysis 37 furthermore 35 see httpwwwacqosdmilpmfaqsevbasicshtm 36 large number of other evm metrics are used to manage projects and contracts and are not discussed in this report see the third question and answer at httpwwwacq osdmilpmfaqsfaqhtm for more information 37 independent validation of cost schedule functionality and benefit estimates might bolster the confidence of some continued

perverse incentives38 one project management reference presents humorous and skeptical albeit seriously intended scenario to caution against too quickly accepting evm metrics at face value as accurate representations of the full picture the scenario is worth excerpting at lengthnot as portrayal of what is typicalbut rather as an illustration of an over seer interpreting evm metrics thinking about incentives and confronting the issue of what reasonable plan should be for projects cost schedule and functionality specifically the author posits scenario showing project is quite substantially ahead of schedule and underspent at first glance this looks wonderful but ask yourself how the variance happened there are three possible explanations for how this project manager achieved the results shown 1 actual labor costs were considerably lower than expected andor the people were more efficient than anticipated 2 the project team had lucky break the team had expected to have to work really hard to solve problem but it turned out to be very easy 3 the project manager sandbagged his estimates he padded everything playing it safe if you believe situation 1 you will believe anything it is unlikely that both variances would happen at the same time situation 2 happens occasionally when all the planets are alignedabout once in zillion years you say you bet situation 3 is the most likely explanation the project manager was playing it safe and he would tell you that there is problem after all if he continues along this course the project will come in ahead of schedule and underspent which means manager will give money back to the company problem but is that true first of all i can almost guarantee that the project manager wont give any money back he will find way to spend itby adding bells and whistles to the project by buying unplanned equipment and supplies or by throwing one huge party sane project manager wants to give the money back because he knows that his next project will be cut however suppose the manager did give back the money would that be okay the reason is that the organization would have lost the opportunity to use the money to fund some other project but the money is available it is tied up in the underbudget project if that project were rescheduled and rebudgeted the money would be available to keep the other project going assuming that the return on investment is still justified the question is naturally what is reasonable we certainly cannot expect to have zero variances in project and this is true it all depends on the nature of our commercial sector business welldefined construction projects can be held to very small tolerancesas small as plusorminus 3 to 5 percent research and development projects are likely to run higher tolerances perhaps in the range of 15 to 25 percent each organization has to develop acceptable tolerances from experience 39 continued estimates albeit with additional cost to perform any such

applicable to federal government projects generally much less in specific policy and technology domains is debatable nevertheless his scenario illustrates some of the psychological and implementation phenomena that might be at play in the context of major capital investments in federal government context phenomena like these might be at play with any participating actor eg advocate critic project manager funder contractor overseer at any point in the process of researching proposing funding executing operating and evaluating major capital investments for example who says the budget and planned functionality corresponding to proposed project are accurate what analyses are the judgments based upon are cost and benefit estimates reasonable who might have the capacity and independence to make such an assessment do agencies inspectors general or omb have the staff resources to perform adequately the necessary analytical and monitoring tasks for major capital investments are the president political appointees and career civil service executives making decisions based on or in spite of reasonable and objective analysis and monitoring what are the real reasons project is under or over budget or ahead of or behind schedule ho w much scrutiny is too much what perverse incentives and consequences might be created when project managers make good faith attempts to estimate costs schedules and functionality but variances inevitably occur perhaps due to uncertainty or bad luck bringing high levels of distracting scrutiny to project and its sponsoring agency or agencies questions such as these are difficult to answ er but suggest that answers and corresponding lessons might be learned for specific policy areas and types of investments over time and with experience this observation raises two further questions for each type of actor involved in planning funding implementing evaluating nd overseeing major capital investments eg project managers program managers political appointees career executives congressional staff members of congress and the president what are the necessary prerequisites to learning these lessons from experience that is what capacities and processes need to be in place in order to learn from experience how many of these prerequisite capacities and processes are currently in place

rise to many actual or potential issues for congress issues that are potentially related to evm are significant subset of this larger picture with the increasing emergence of evm as tool for gauging the status and progress of major capital investments potential congressional oversight issues appear likely to continue emerging as well this report culminates with sampling of potential oversight questions for congress that draw on the report and other resources as noted in light of what appears to be more widespread adoption of evm practices for major capital investments by executive agencies and their contractors what might be the advantages disadvantages costs and benefits of legislatively requiring more formal periodic and publicly accessible agency reporting of evm metrics for some

information40 what would be the advantages and disadvantages the usefulness of evm metrics depends upon the quality and reliability of the cost schedule and functionality data that underlie both projects baseline plan and its reports on work performed41 given concerns that have been raised about the quality of agency capital investment business cases that are used to justify budget requests42 as well as concerns that have been raised about the quality of agency project management43 what might be options for congress to cause omb and agencies to improve any deficiencies in the underlying

might be the advantages and disadvantages of requiring independent publicly accessible assessments of the capacity of agencies to manage the capital planning and investment control cpic process eg agency capacity to research formulate plan propose develop report on operate and evaluate major capital investments which is arguably more fundamental as driver of evm data quality would assessments of key capabilities be amenable to systematic oversight through the use of scorecards similar to those used under the bush administrations presidents management agenda albeit with transparency outside the executive branch and independent validation to the extent that omb currently identifies gaps in agency capabilities to what extent do annual budget requests submitted to congress by the president
