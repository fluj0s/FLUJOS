federal trade commission ftc the attorney general and the government accountability office gao section 3 woul d have required the ftc and the attorney general to 1 conduct study of section 7 of the clayton act 15 usc 18 the so called antimerger section in order to determine whether that section should be amende d to modify how that section applies to persons engaged in the business of explorin g

financial and operating data as part of its financial reporting systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22442crs3 10 proposed sections 8a b of the sherman act 11 eg the clayton act is more usually cited as 15 usc 1227 rather than as in section 2 of s 2557 15 usc 12 et seq see eg the listing for the clayton act in the popular name acts of the united states code similarly the sherman act is more usually cited as 15 usc 17 rather than as in section 6b of s 2557 15 usc 1 et seq 12 eg pl 105297 the curt flood act of 1998 which enacted the baseballlaborantitrust measure as 15 usc 27a was editorially re numbered and can now be found at 15 usc 26b section 6 would have created the oil producing and expor ting cartels act of 2006 nopec as an amendment to the sh erman antitrust act 15 usc 17 by inserting new provisions to make illegal and an antitrus t violation actions by any foreign state or any instrumentality or agent of any foreign state to act collectively or in co mbination with any other foreign state or any other person whether by cartel or any other asso ciation or form of cooperation or joint action to engage in certain specified actions with respect to natural gas or petroleum products including those to 1 limit either the production or distribution 2 set or maintain the price of or 3 take any other action in restraint of trade if any of those actions has direct substantial and reasonabl foreseeable effect on us commerce10 pursuant to proposed section 8c of the sh erman act the doctrin of sovereign immunity would not protect any foreign state from the ju risdiction or judgments of us courts in any action brought on account of conduct alleged to be in violation of the foregoing prohibitions proposed section 8d would prohi bit use of the act of state doctrine as courts rationale for declining to make determination on the merits in an action brought under this section the final provisi ons of section 6 would add language to 28 usc 1605a which lists exceptions to the foreign sovereign immunities act to clarify that sovereign immunity does not pply in instances in which an action is brought under section 8 of the sherman act brief analysis technical matters concerning references to existing statutes11 or to statutory provisions several of which have been renu mbered in the past several years including editorial renumbering after enactment12 are best addressed by the senate office of legislative counsel similarly that office mig ht also best provide us code citations to accompany the statutory section references so as to clarify exactly which provisions are being named amended or added in addition that offices familiarity with legislative drafting considerations should enable them to suggest the most advantageous placement of proposed provisions diversion of gasoline to am eliorate regional shortage making it unlawful for any person to refuse to sell ex port or divert existing supplies of petroleum would likely be challenged by those w ho would note that the courts beginning with the supreme courts 1919 decision in united states v colgate co have long acknowledged the right of an individual bus inessman to do business or not with whomever he likes and on whatever terms and conditions he deems acceptablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22442crs4 13 250 us 300 307 with respect to the differe nce between being monopolist not unlawful in itself and unlawfully monopolizing market see crs report rs20241 monopoly and monopolization fundamental but separate concepts in us antitrust law by janice rubin 14 15 usc 1 15 us v grinnell 384 us 563 571 1966 evidence of guilty behavior could be eg predatory pricing by market entity in order to drive competitors from the market in the hopes that he the predator might either secure monopoly position in that market or b maintain an existing one 16 ownership or control of an essential facility has been thought to constitute the one instance in which monopolist might not validly refuse to deal with potential competitor an essential facility exists where necessary component of potential competitors business not merely desirable one is both unavailable from any source other than particular competitor and b cannot be duplicated either at all or other th an at great expense andor time by the potential competitor seeking access to it bottleneck monopoly which phrase was used to describe eg the situation which existed when single telephone company controlled all access to homes is another way to describe an essen tial facility the continuing viability of the essential facilities doctrine in antitrust law was called into question by the supreme court in verizon communications inc v trinko 540 u s 398 411 2004 we have never recognized such doctrine see aspen skiing co v as pen highlands skiing co rp 472 us 585 611 n 44 1985 at t corp v iowa utilities bd 525 us 1133 428 1999 and we find need either to recognize it or to repudiate it here see crs

changes the dynamic of supply dema nd and competition hereinafter referred to as ftc july 2005 report the report which is available at httpwwwftcgovreportsgasprices05050705gaspricesrptpdf counts among those factors continuedin the absence of any purpose to create or maintain monopoly the sherman act does not restrict the long recognized righ t of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business freely to exerci his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal and of course he may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell13 section 1 of the sherman act prohibits c ontracts or conspiracies in restraint of trade14 in other words collusion section 2 prohibits monopolization or attempted monopolization wh ich may entail unilateral g uilty behavior by either wouldbe monopolist in his quest to beco one attempt or an existing monopolist acting to maintain his monopoly position by ot her than the superior product business acumen or historic accident15 which served to create th monopoly in the first place presently absent either the collusion joint action made unlawful by section 1 of the sherman act or the guilty behavior which might constitute violation of section 2 there is not any statutory constrai nt on unilateral business decisi ons and the courts have been reluctant to infer one16 review reporting requirements the federal trade commission has released two reports in july 2005 and ma rch 2006 concerning the gasoline industry the former analyzed in detail the multiple factors that affect supply and demand and thus prices for gasoline 17 the latter an interim repor t was produced in response tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22442crs5 17 continued growing foreign demand especially from

appropriate action on pricing anomalies that might indicate anticompetitive conduct19 oil producing and exporting cartels act of 2006 provisions similar to the nopec provisions of s 2557 an apparent attempt to nullify th courts refusal in 1979 to sanction suit against opec by the international assn of machinists and aerospace workers iam20 would not necessarily accomplish the presumed goal of precluding opecs influence on gasoline prices first pr ovision that would add language to the sherman act to make certain actions unlawful under th at statute may be redundant those actions taken abroad by nonsovereign21 that have the requisite effect on us commerce are already reachable under the us an titrust laws even absent specific statutory authorization as stated by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in 1945 we should not impute to congress an intent to punish all whom its courts can catch for conduct which has consequences within th united states amer ican banana co v united fruit co 213 us 347 357 on the other hand it is settled law that any state may impose liabilities even upon persons not within its allegiance for conduct outside its borders that has consequences w ithin its borders which the state reprehends and these liabilities other states will ordinarily recognize22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22442crs6 22 continued emphasis added the appeals court decided the case after receiving it on transfer from the supreme court because the court did not have the necessary quorum to issue an opinion 23 28 usca 1605a2 the full ac t is codified at 28 usc 16021611 24 illinois brick co v illinois 431 us 720 1977 held that only one who had purchased directly from an alleged pricefixer could sue unl ess he could show that the direct purchaser had passed on the unlawful charge to him 25 iam v opec 649 f2d 1354 1361 9th cir 1981 cert denied 454 us 1163 1982in addition the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia of 1976 contains commercial activity exception to the general rule that foreign state is protected from the jurisdiction of us courts by the doc trine of sovereign immunity23 there is sovereign immunity according to existing statute 28 usc 1605a2 in circumstances in which the judicial action is based upon commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with commercial activity of th foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act cause s direct effect in the united states s 2557 for example would have stated specifically that actions brought pursuant to the sherman act do not trigger s overeign immunity but the provi sion did not define opec as country for purposes of the act such l ack could present problem for two reasons the s 2557 language did not seemingly dd meaningfully to the general commercial activity exception language of fsia the iams unsuccessful attempt to use fsia to sue opec for inter alia price fixing under the antitrust ws is useful illustration it foundered for reasons that do not seem to have been remedied by the bills proposed statutory provisions the dist rict court found that because opec was not country fsia was inapplicable and action could be brought against opec under it further and perhaps more important th court found that the indirect purchaser doctrine24 denied the iam standing to sue 477 fsupp at 56061 congress has not granted indirect purchasers standing under the federal antitr ust laws although several stat have done so with regard to their own antitrust laws although proposed section 8e of the sherman act would allow suits to be brought by the attorney general it would not alter current prohibition on private actions the indirect purchaser doctrine affirming the district courts dismissal of the iam suit the appeals court reasoning was based on nonfsia non antitrust factors and couched in language that does specifically mention the act of state doctrine indicating the questiona ble effectiveness of proposed section 8ds direction that courts not decline based on the act of state doctrine to make determination on the merits in an action brought on this section while the case is formulated as an antitr ust action the granting of any relief would in effect amount to an order from domestic cour t instructing foreig n sovereign to alter its chosen means of allocating and profiting from its own valuable natural resources on the other hand should the court hold that opecs actions are antitrust legal this would greatly strengthen the bargaining nd of the opec nations in the event that congress or the executive chooses to condemn opecs actions25
