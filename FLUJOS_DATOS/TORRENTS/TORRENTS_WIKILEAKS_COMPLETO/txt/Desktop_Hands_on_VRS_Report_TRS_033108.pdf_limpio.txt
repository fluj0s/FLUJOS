6 additional tables32 hovrs performance audit kpmg 3 1 executive summary hovrs is privately owned provider of vide relay services vrs founded in 1990 and headquartered in rocklin california hovrs is the third largest provider of vrs the monthly report of relay service minutes is form submitted by telecommunication relay service trs providers each month to the nati onal exchange carrier association neca trs fund administration to document the minutes of trs services provided in each month the providers receive payment from the trs fund b ased on the minutes of service reported on this form the relay service data request rsdr is form completed by the trs providers each year outlining actual costs for the past two years as well as projected costs for the next two years for providing trs services the provi ders also report on the rsdr the total actual minutes of services provided for the previous two years and pr ojected demand for the next two years the rsdr provides the basis for the trs rate setting process at fcc and neca these forms have direct effect on the amount of trs funds disbursed to hovrs each month for trs services provided the monthly reports of relay service minutes and the relay service data requests for the months of january 2004 through december 2006 submitte d to neca were the focus of this audit the review of the monthly reports of relay serv ice did not identify any differences between the monthly reports provided by hovrs and the monthly reports of relay service minutes obtained from neca and subsequent reimbursement s the monthly reports of relay service minutes provided by neca agreed with the actual reimbursed minutes total for hovrs we reviewed the hovrs call detail records to valid ate the conversation minutes reported on the monthly reports of relay service however we identified several issues in connec tion with the rsdr we found inaccuracies with the actual data both expenses and minutes for periods as they were reported in subsequent years we also found that hovrs documentation and financial records for the actual data did not agree with the amounts submitted on the rsdr we selected limited number of actual expen ses and compared them to their corresponding invoices and receipts this comparison disclosed the following summary of findings validation of 2005 hovrs salaries and expenses identified 240 invoice for monthly gym memberships and day spa massages finding 31a for the seven line items tested in the 2005 rsdr expenses were overstated by approximately 475000 or 10 of total actual costs finding 31a for the six line items tested in the 2004 rsdr expenses were overstated by nearly 850000 or 25 of total actual costs finding 31a hovrs performance audit kpmg 4kpmg conducted this performance audit based on the information provided to us by hovrs as of may 3 2007 2 background hands on video relay service inc hovrs history structure hovrs is telecommunications relay service provider with headquarters in rocklin california which currently only offers the video relay service vrs form of trs founded in 1990 hovrs was built from an american sign lan guage interpreting service to begin offering vrs services under the auspices of the federal communications commisions fcc trs program in 2003 organized as subchapter s corporation under the laws of the state of california hovrs was founded by ron and denise obray with mr obray serving as chief executive officer and president until december of 2006 at that time ed routhier operator of private equity fund succeeded mr obray as president and ceo which coincided with an investment in hovrs by mr routhiers firm providing hovrs with additional working capital hovrs has become the third largest provider of vrs and is close to the second largest in terms of minutes reimbursed management stated that hovrs achieved profitability in 2005 and will remain profitable going forward assuming that mark et conditions remain stable and the current vrs rate continues or increases hovrs curre ntly operates five call centers throughout the united states with an additional center pl anned to be added in phoenix in 2007 2 objective the purpose of the audit is to determine whethe r the relay service data requests rsdr and the monthly reports of relay service minutes th at were certified and submitted by hovrs are i in compliance with applicable laws and re gulations and ii supported by sufficient documentation to warrant reimbursement with tr s funds the scope of audit covers calendar year 2004 2005 and 2006 kpmg reviewed trs providers processes for pr eparation of the monthly report of relay service minutes and the rsdr forms and related inte rnal controls this review was designed to identify gaps in the control environment and processes for maintaining and reporting data kpmg is not offering an opinion on the adequacy of these controls kpmg concluded fieldwork for hovrs on may 3 2007 information received after that date was not considered in the performance audit 3 findings and recommendations 31 data for 2003 2004 and 2005 hovrs relay service data requests are not reliable hovrs could not substantiate expenses reflected on their 2003 and 2004 rsdr reports each year the fcc uses the reported expenses both actual and projected to compute the following years reimbursement rates inaccurate data results in incorrect rates and subsequent payments to the providers hovrs reported inconsistent act ual cost data for 2004 and 2005 on subsequent rsdrs filed with the fcc and neca finding 31b hovrs also could not substantiate actual expenses reported on the rsdr finding 31a hovrs performance audit kpmg 5 we reviewed the actual expenses reported for 23 line items and found the following for 2003 and 2004 22 of the 23 line items selected for audit from the rsdr could not be fully reconciled to hovrs financial records eleven of those line items had at least 100000 or more of difference by year the following are the net expenses that could not be substantiated year total unsubstantiated expenses 2003 850000 2004 475000 hovrs underreported its expenses by 73000 for 2005 on its rsdr hovrs performance audit kpmg 6 criteria according to the fcc regulations governing the trs program trs providers shall provide the administrator with true and accurate data both historical and projected including total trs operating expenses and total trs minutes of use data necessary to determine trs fund revenue requirements and payments as part of the ma ndatory minimum standards for providing trs services1 trs providers are to issue cost allocation ma nual or equivalent guidance that describes the underlying basis for all cost allocations2 costs must be allocated between trs and nontrs services3 and the allocation must be described trs providers are to submit the original signed relay service data request form on the standard format provided on the neca trs website 4 31a hovrs could not substantiate actual rsdr expenses condition kpmg compared three years of rsdr filings to the hovrs financial records the following table is the sample we selected to include 23 line items of actual expenses reported by hovrs on their 2004 2005 and 2006 rsdr rsdr reporting year actual expense year number of tested line items percent of total expenses for year tested 2004 2003 6 71 2005 2004 7 55 2006 2005 10 70 we then requested that hovrs provide us w ith the general ledger detail that supported the balances reported on those line items the documentation invoices and receipts provided for the 23 line items did not agree with the amounts reported on the rsdr table 1 below details the size of these 23 variances 1 47 cfr section 64604 c6iiic 2 neca relay service data request

number of lines zero 0 less than 1000 1 between 1000 and 10000 1 between 10000 and 100000 10 over 100000 11 total lines with variance 23 for the 2005 actual data all ten line items selecte d had variances in the general ledger balances versus the data reported in the rsdr the m of the balances on the rsdr was lower than those in the hovrs general ledger the vari ances are detailed in table 4 in appendix 5 all seven line items selected from the 2004 act ual expense data on the rsdr had variances compared to the general ledger data provided by hovrs5 see table 5 in appendix 5 for the detailed results of this testing the 2003 actual data selection consisted of six line items totaling just over 34 million in the rsdr all six line items had variances when co mpared to the supporting general ledger detail between the actual costs reported on the rsdr nd the general ledger three of the four had more costs then the general ledger and one has less costs fifth item had costs reported on the rsdr but the general ledger had 172397 reco rded sixth line item had over 346000 in costs reported on the rsdr while the general ledge r had nothing recorded the net result of the comparison with the general ledger was that the rsdr expense data for this period was approximately 850000 or approximately 33 higher than the expense recorded in the general ledger the details are provided in table 6 in appendix 5 in addition to tracing rsdr reports to accounti ng records we attempted to trace selected line items to their source documents we found th at for the transactions occurring in 2003 hovrs staff was unable to provide supporting documentation given the significant issues pertaining to these data reported in the findings we determined that the time and effort required in obtaining the missing documentation would not result in any increased assurance over the reliability of the data we requested supporting documentation from th general ledger detail provided by hovrs to validate operating expenses for their vrs progr ams invoices sampled did not adequately support the costs recorded by hovrs for ex ample hovrs corporate credit card payments were sampled and allocations of the payments were provided but credit card statements were provided also invoices could not be tracked in the accounting software by correct invoice number and allocation totals did not agree to the total invoice amount one invoice sampled from employee expenses included monthly gym mberships and massages at day spa for 240 5 note the rsdr requests telecommunications equipment depreciati on and furniture fixture deprec iation as 2 separate expense items hovrs general ledger only reports to tal depreciation expense kpmg attempte d to reconcile the reported depreciation li ne items from the rsdr to the general ledger hovrs performance audit kpmg 8a trial balance summarizing data from hovrs financial system was purportedly the basis for the costs reported on the rsdr cause based on inquiry of the consultant serving in the cfo function for hovrs our testing of hovrs financial records and processes regarding minutes collection and invoicing to neca we determined that the cause of the discrepancy between the data in the rsdr and the general ledger was due to hovrs not successfully closing th financial records prior to submission of the rsdr to neca additionally hovrs personnel did not maintain r ecords of the changes made to the general ledger subsequent to the submission of the rs dr furthermore hovrs personnel stated that the changes to the general ledger during this peri od were not limited to adjusting journal entries but rather also included entry of invoices in th accounts payable records there are certain weaknesses in controls in place to report accurate information on the annual rsdr sent to neca and the fcc by hovrs effect the three years of rsdr data could not be relied upon as accurate since this data was used by neca and the fcc in determining the rates for vrs since july of 2004 the appropriateness of those rates is now called into question to the extent that it was based on data from hovrs the vrs rates that took effect in july 2004 and ju ly 2005 may have been established too high as the hovrs cost data was overstated by approxi mately 850 thousand and 475 thousand respectively for those two periods kpmg recommendations fcc and neca trs fund administration manage ment should develop and institute written policies and procedures for documenting all trs pr ogram expenses incurre d by providers which are able to be recovered via the trs fund this would help ensure proper handling of trs funds also policies and procedures would give provi ders the opportunity to have consistent documented procedures for reporting all allowabl trs related expenses and present additional direction for those expenses which are not allowable hovrs and outside legal counsel should documen t the steps taken when reporting actual and projected cost data via the relay service da ta requests to neca hovrs should document the complete process used by their legal counsel for preparing all reports for neca hovrs management should document all actual total cost s sent to neca and also document the process by which projections are developed along with the neca relay service data request form supporting document should be prepared by hovrs which should detail the source for all costs and all allocations including cross reference fro m line items on the neca reports to the general ledger which should in turn agree with hovrs audited financial statements this would facilitate hovrs managements ability to support all expenses submitted to neca and fcc via their annual rsdr and also that hovrs submitt ed true and accurate data to neca and the fcc hovrs should reconcile the costs for 2004 and 2005 reported in the rsdr to the general ledger in order to explain all reporting inconsistencies the adjustments made to the actual data should be noted along with all supporting documents such as invoices and reallocations with explanations regarding how the costs are associ ated with trs services hovrs management should develop and implement wr itten procedures for providing co st and minutes demand data hovrs performance audit kpmg 9reported on the rsdr hovrs should also institu controls in order to ensure that all information provided to neca via the rsdr is accurate we recommend that hovrs adopt and follow polic to perform final reconciliation of the audited financial statements with the trial balan ce used to report cost data on the rsdr once the audit is complete each year and make any necessary adjusting entries to their general ledger this would help ensure that all actual costs submitted to neca and the fcc are accurate according to hovrs internal financial records 31b hovrs reported inconsistent actual costs condition the rsdr which is filed with neca in februa ry contains actual and projected data for both cost and minutes of use data for all forms of tr s provided by the providers two years of the most recent actual data are presented minutes and costs as well as two years of projected data for the coming years for example the rsdr f iled in february of 2006 contained actual cost and minutes data for 2005 and 2004 and pr ojected data for 2006 and 2007 the data hovrs reported on the rsdr did not agr ee with the actual cost information included in the hovrs accounting system also in one case the actual demand minutes data reported in hovrs rsdr was not in agreement with info rmation for the same period maintained by neca the fund administrator actual minutes reported by hovrs via their 2005 relay service data request was greater than the number of minutes documented by neca for 2005 neca documented total of 1350 246 vrs minutes for hovrs on their summary of relay minutes reimbursed for 2005 while hovrs reported thei r actual minutes as 1489005 for the same period this is difference of 138749 minutes of use since this information serves as th basis for developing the cost reimbursement rates the rates developed by neca for july 2004 going forwar d were not based on correct information and therefore may have been set too high since that time additionally the actual cost data reported fo r 2004 and 2005 on the rsdr sent to neca for 2006 and 2007 reported inconsistent actual costs there are significant changes in the line items which were not explained by hovrs management within the data request table 2 below outlines the variances between the 2004 actual cost s reported by hovrs in certain lettered sections and numbered line items on the rsdrs in 2006 and 2007 table 3 below outlines the variances between the 2005

projections on the rsdr which are used to generate the vrs reimbursement ra furthermore when comparing the actual cost data to the projected cost data there were significant differences for example on hovrs 2005 relay service data request total projected costs for 2005 were 21720423 while actual costs for 2005 reported on the 2006 relay serv ice data request were 1153374 5 this is difference of 10186678 which is directly associ ated with the development of the rates for vrs service see appendix 3 projection analysis charts finally the rsdr submitted to fcc oig duri ng the audit was not in the prescribed neca format and was not certified by hovrs management 6 2004 and 2005 actual cost information in tables 2 and 3 pr ovided to kpmg by hovrs via th 2006 and 2007 rsdrs submitted to neca and the fcc hovrs performance audit kpmg 11cause the changes made to the actual expenses incurre d by hovrs subsequent to the submission of the rsdrs to neca and the fcc were not docu mented within the hovrs accounting system hovrs management had limited working knowledg of the neca relay service data request process and rate setting procedures hovrs mana gement was unable to explain in detail the forecasting methods for preparing and reporting the projected cost data included in the relay service data request each year hovrs did not have documented cost methodology to report cost data used to develop rate for vrs services hovrs management instituted the use of erlang c7 in order to project required staffing levels at the call centers th is projection tool does not account for all the projected costs reported on the rsdr by hovrs onl for those costs associated with staffing video interpreters to meet the projected minute demand hovrs annual rsdr packets were not submitted in the proper neca format as result information provided to neca was not properly certified and signed off according to neca policies hovrs management did not follow the neca rsdr instructions and it is not familiar with the trs program expense submission policies kpmg recommendations hovrs should submit accurate cons istent and supportable actual vrs cost data for 2004 and 2005 to neca and the fcc hovrs should also explain the differences between these revised actual costs for 2004 and 2005 and th actual costs previously submitted fcc and neca management should draft and impl ement policy for developing projected costs and also compare all projections for vrs costs nd minutes to actual vrs costs this could help evaluate the effectiveness of the projections ll projections should be explained by indicators such as previous year actual cost increases industry growth trends and actual minute demand increases this would maintain the validity of the trs rates as they related to both actual and projected costs submitted by the providers each year via the rsdr hovrs should document the cost methodology use to prepare the rsdr as per neca rsdr instructions hovrs should use the spreadsheet template provide d by neca in order to submit all cost and demand data associated with providing vrs this would help ensure that the information in the rsdr is reported consistently with that of the other providers and the neca and fcc can evaluate fairly the cost data incurred by hovrs 5 summary of hovrs management comments kpmg provided hovrs management with the opportunity to comment on the draft performance audit report the comments we received through th eir legal counsel are reprinted in their entirety in appendix 3 generally hovrs manageme nt disagreed with our findings hovrs questioned the accuracy of kpmgs testing of actua l costs and also that portions of the findings are out of the scope of the performance audit kpmg revised the draft report as appropriate 7 erlang c is software package that allo ws hovrs to project relay center costs asso ciated with staffing for the projected minu tes demand and the answer performance and u tilization rates required by neca and fcc hovrs performance audit kpmg 12therefore certain hovrs responses and refere nces in hovrs responses to the kpmg draft report may not longer be applicable it is also noted that hovrs management declined to sign representation letter as requested by the fcc oig 6 summary of kpmgs evaluation of hovrs comments the comments provided by hovrs were evaluate d by kpmg and our responses are included in appendix 4 of this report generally kpmg does not agree with hovrs comments in response to the findings hovrs included multiple exhibits along with their comments kpmg gave hovrs reasonable amount of time ove r sixty days to send the related exhibits before they received kpmgs draft report for co mments kpmg did not evaluate these exhibits for accuracy or use the inform ation provided by hovrs to change the general conclusions expressed in the report these exhibits were not included in the final report because they contained confidential and proprietary

assessing hovrss processes kp mg considered guidance from the following part 64 of the fccs rules and regulations trs fund instructions for reporting comp letion of the monthly report of relay service minutes neca instructions for completion of the relay service data request fcc orders pertaining to the preparati on of the relay service data request the work plan consisted of three phases phase 1 planning the fcc sent an announcement letter to hovrs dated march 5 2007 with an accompanying document request list kpmg reviewed these documents as they were received this phase was also devoted to gathering inform ation relating to the relevant trs processes at neca this information was gathered through the following review of existing documentation review of records from previous inte rviews with selected neca personnel phase 2 site visit kpmg conducted site visit to the hovrs headqua rters in rocklin california during this visit we conducted interviews w ith key personnel involved in the preparation of the reports under audit in addition we collected the information from hovrs and conducted testing of the back up documentation on limited basis after obt aining an understanding of the processes for preparing the reports under audit we documented those processes nd conducted walkthroughs to validate our understanding of those processes and related controls phase 3 reporting this phase was the culmination of all prior ph ases of the engagement and consisted of the following steps prepared written draft report of our findings and recommendations this document served as the output of our revi ew and included all of our findings and recommendations issued final report after review of the draft report by fcc oig personnel we incorporated their comments as appropriate and

management comments hovrs kpmg provided management of hovrs with the opportunity to comment on the report the comments we received through their legal counsel ar reprinted in their entirety in the previous appendix we incorporated technical comments into the report as appropriate the comments provided by hovrs were evaluated and are included in their entirety in appendix 4 in accordance with paragraph 833 of the 2003 government auditing standards the standard further states that comments such as pr omise or plan for corrective action should be noted but should not be accepted as justif ication for dropping finding or related recommendation in accordance with paragra ph 834 of the 2003 government auditing standards kpmg is stating below those inci dents in which it disagrees with managements comments or planned corrective actions hovrs response reference section i summary part arisk of overpayment to hovrs kpmg responds with regard to the review of the monthly reports of relay service minutes and the report was clarified to explain that kpmg did not review hovrs documentation supporting the minutes reported to and subsequently paid by neca however kpmg disagrees with hovrs comment that there is risk of improper payments to the fund the results of our procedures with respect to the supporting docum entation for the reported expense data supports the stated conclusion in the our report part bkpmgs recommendations to neca and fcc the performance audit was focused on the hovrs to assess the risk of improper payments from the trs fund which would include ensuring th at appropriate actions and oversight were performed by the federal components responsib for managing the program and making the appropriate payments accordingly recommendati ons are appropriate to any and all components involved with the program to reduce the risk of improper payments from the trs fund part chovrs controls kpmg does not agree with the comments pr ovided by hovrs with regard to hovrs processes for actual expense reporting to neca the data collection processes calls for trs providers to provide neca with true and accura data necessary to determine trs fund revenue requirements and payments in accordance with part 32 of the communications act other historical andor projected information reasonabl requested by the administrator for purposes of computing payments and revenue requirements aud its of this data are to assure the accuracy and integrity of fund payments 9 furthermore when the current vrs compensation rate was established the fcc used actual cost data and projections submitted by the vrs providers in order to institute reasonable rate for the service10 hovrs comments with regard kpmgs misunde rstanding of the fcc rate setting process and fccs lack of reliance on the actual costs submitted by hovrs with regard to fcc vrs rate setting process are not correct we have confirmed with the fcc that actual costs as well as the 9 47 cfr 64604 c 5iiib 10 fcc 04137 paragraph 174 hovrs performance audit kpmg 28projected costs submitted by the providers were us ed to set the vrs compensation rate therefore the hovrs submission of inaccurate data does have an effect on the compensation rate set forth by the fcc for vrs hovrs also seems to misunderstand the test st eps associated with auditing their accounting systems and actual expenses reported on the rsdr s any variance which was noted comes from data reported by hovrs to neca as actual and all tested line items were sampled from hovrs accounting system information provided to kp mg auditors at the time of the audit the tables presented in the report are the discrepanc ies between the actual expenses and the available documentation line items were also tested and support documentation was requested at the time of the audit hovrs did not provide ade quate supporting documentati on and adequate trial balances matching the audited financial stat ements at the time of the audit the trial balance provided to kpmg was not consis tent with the audited financial statements at the time of the audit kpmg made inquiries about and attempted to test the line items within the trial balances and were unable to do so while onsite hovrs management and personnel could not provide proper documentation at the time of the audit part dhovrs as going concern agree kpmg has deleted this matter from the report section ii certain factual errors part hovrs 2005 minutes were not misreported and are accurate kpmg does not agree with hovrs managements statement that 2005 minutes were reported correctly on the rsdr according to neca rsdr instructions all 2005 actual minutes reported by hovrs are to be reported in the rsdr including subcontractor minutes subcontractors are also required to submit rsdr data but hovrs is also required to report all actual minutes paid to hovrs by the trs fund regardless of subcontractor agreements hovrs did not report the 2005 actual vrs nutes appropriately according to neca instructions and fcc orders during the course of our audit kpmg inquire d about the discrepancy in minutes to hovrs management and at the time of the audit hovr s was unable to provide documentation the only subcontractor information hovrs provided to kpmg was in reference to american sign language interpreting services for 2006 there was information received about subcontracting work for att the informati on provided by hovrs in the att relationship was not produced in timely manner and was therefore not considered section ii certain factual errors part b miscellaneous points b 1 while kpmg understands the concern about the trs funds being federal funds there is question that the trs program is subject to fede ral oversight and management as result the trs providers must comply with fcc rules and policies related to the program and are subject to audit to ensure compliance the trs fund is governed by the fcc and those funds are considered to be federal additionally th telecommunications access policy division tapd is division within the federal communica tions commissions wireline competition bureau 11 tapd administers comprehensive policy for commission oversight over funds used to support 11 httpwwwfccgovwcbtapdwelcomehtml hovrs performance audit kpmg 29universal service tapd is also responsible for the oversight of the interstate trs fund12 and handles all rulemakings and other matters relating to the funding of interstate trs kpmg has however changed the reference of federal funds to trs funds in the final report b 2 hovrs commented that gym memberships and massages are benefit that is extended to employees and is necessary to asl interpreters and asserts that this finding is not notable in discussions with the fcc oig we were inform ed that these expenses were not considered reasonable cost for reimbursement b 3 hovrs also commented that hovrs credit card st atements were available but were in fact not provided to the kpmg auditors during the audit despite requests made to hovrs management and pers onnel while onsite b 4 see kpmg response for section i part c paragraph 4 b 5 kpmg responds to hovrs comments with the following rsdr rule relating to the submission of inconsistent cost data kpmg does not agree with managements statemen t that inconsistencies in cost data are not meaningful neca and the fcc use the actual cost data submitted by providers to ensure that only reasonable costs of providing trs services are reflected in the compensation rates 13 if providers actual cost data changes from year to year and compensation rate has been set on previous data changes should be documented to sure that all changes are reasonable and that set compensation rates are accurate also accordi ng to part 64 trs provi ders shall provide the administrator with true and accurate data both historical and projected including total trs operating expenses and total trs minutes of use data necessary to determine trs fund revenue requirements and payments as part of the ma ndatory minimum standards for providing trs services14 b 6 kpmg does not agree that hovrss rsdrs were properly certified hovrs was requested by kpmg to provide 2004 2005 nd 2006 rsdrs submitted to the fcc and neca for the past three years the rsdrs provided to kpmg did not include certification page signed by an agent of hovrs in addition th rsdrs submitted to kpmg did not follow the scripted instructions set forth on the neca website b 7 see kpmg response for section ii part b 5 section ii certain factual errors part c misunderstanding of fcc ratemaking process and use of estimated expense data kpmg does not agree with hovrs comments wi th regard kpmgs misunderstanding of the fcc rate setting process and fccs lack of reliance on the actual costs submitted by hovrs with regard to fcc vrs rate setting process the actual costs as well as the projected costs submitted by the providers were used to set the vrs compensation rate therefore the hovrs submission of inaccurate data does have an effect on the compensation rate set forth by the fcc for vrs as previously noted kpmg has confirmed this understanding with the fcc 12 httpwwwfccgovwcbtapdtrs 13 fcc order da 061345 section ii 1 14 47 cfr section 64604 c6iiic hovrs performance audit kpmg 30 section ii certain factual errors part d misunderstanding of hovrs accounting system in relation to fcc rules kpmg disagrees with hovrss claim that the oig auditors failed to map hovrs general ledger accounts properly hovrs should be able to support all actual costs reported on the rsdrs hovrs management was unable to provide this detail as per neca instructions to the oig auditors kpmgs response to section i part c addresses the primary concerns with the data reported by hovrs from their accounting system it is further important to note that the auditors do not have the responsibility to map the hovrs general ledger accounts to the rsdr expense cate gories but rather that is managements responsibility hovrs is also to provide neca and the fcc cost methodology which describes all allocations made between trs and non trs services within the company as part of the rsdr submission process hovrs is respons ible for providing supporting documentation to justify the amounts reported and claimed on its re ports to the fcc and its agents for the trs program at the time of our audit the supporting documentation did not support the information reported on the rsdr as discussed in our report the differences noted by kpmg in this report ar not differences relating to annualizing expenses for the purposes of submission to neca kpmg sted the actual costs for example in the 2006 and 2007 rsdr hovrs did not report the same 2004 actual costs and they were not annualized actual costs section iii analysis of 2003 expenses see results in appendix 5 in table 6 and table 7 kpmg does not agree with hovrs management analysis primarily because management discusses annualized expenses versus the actual xpenses as we previously discussed we analyzed actual expenses reported on the rsdr not annualized expenses the results identified net difference of 850 thousand in expenses test ed according to line items on the rsdr and general ledger account detail this testing yielde d an exception rate of 18 from our sample of tested line items therefore of the support documentation requested hovrs was not able to support 850 thousand dollars of reported actual costs section iv analysis of 2004 expenses see results in appendix 5 in table 5 and table 7 kpmg disagrees with hovrs comment that the draft audit methodology suffers from an apparent misidentification of hovrs accounts instead kpmg agrees with the result that the rsdr expenses are overstated by 10 and we reite rate that we reviewed actual expenses not annualized expenses this review included the testing of actual line items and general ledger detail testing section v analysis of 2005 expenses see results in appendix 5 in table 4 kpmg has revised the report to identify more clearly the underreported actual expenses section vi comments on other items kpmg addressed other items in prev ious comments as described below paragraph 1see comment in section ii part b b6 above hovrs performance audit kpmg 31 paragraph 2 kpmg disagrees with hovrs assumpti on that vrs rates are set lower than they should be the audit only assesses hovrs complian ce with neca instructions and fcc rules these rules state that providers are to submit tr ue and accurate data fo r both historical and projected costs in order to set the rates for vrs accordingly paragraphs 3 and 4 kpmg disagrees with hovrs comment which claims failure to interview ceo ron obray kpmg auditors did speak with ron obray ceo of hovrs on may 3 2007 at 2 pm est both mr obray and mr routhier informed kpmg that the information provided by the counsel and by the cfo on the rsdr was accurate section vii comments on kpmg recommendations not withstanding necas and fccs responsibilit for the monitoring and rate setting processes we reiterate that hovrs management has res ponsibility to document the costs reported for the trs program we suggest that cross walk between hovrs general ledger and the rsdr form will provide accurate identification of the appropriate costs section viii comments on additional matters kpmg agrees and has made the appropriate changes in the final report ix conclusion kpmg has made changes deemed appropriate b ased upon managements comments however the evidence developed during the audit does not pport change in the overall conclusions and the recommendations proposed to address the reported issues kpmg did not consider the appendices sent with hovrs management respon which was provided 7 months after our audit fieldwork hovrs performance audit kpmg 32appendix 5 additional tables tables 13 appear in the body of the report table 4 2005 comparison
