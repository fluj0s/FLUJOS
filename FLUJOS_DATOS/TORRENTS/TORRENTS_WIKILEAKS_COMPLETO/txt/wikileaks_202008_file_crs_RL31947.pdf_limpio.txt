from britain and egypt in subsaharan africa for lmost four decades the east african country with population of 35 million people has b een the scene of intermittent conflict since the current conflict erupted more than two million people have died from war related causes and famine in southern sudan and an estimated four million have been displaced the sudanese conf lict is africas longestrunni ng civil war the sources of the conflict are deeper and more complicated than indicated by the claims of political leaders and some observers relig ion is major factor because of the islamic fundamenta list agenda of the current government dominated by the mostly muslimarab north southerners who are christian and traditional believers reject the islamization of the country and favor secular arrangem ent social and economic disparities are also major contributing factors to the sudanese conflict the abrogation in 1983 by then president jaffer nimeri of the 1972 addis ababa agreement which ended the first phase of the civil war in the south is considered major triggering factor in th current civil war although the national islamic front nif government which ousted the democratically elected civilian government in 1989 has pursued the war in southern sudan with vigor previous governments both civilian and military had also rejected southern demands for autonomy and equality analysts point out that northern political leaders for decades treated southerners as second class citizens and did not s ee the south as an integral part of the country southern political leaders argue that under successive civilian and military governments political elites in the north have made only superficial attempts to address the gr ievances of the south without compromising the norths dominant economic political and social status in recent years most political leaders in the north now in opposition to the current government say that mistakes were made in the treatment of the south and that they are prepared to correct them but the political mood among southerners has sharply shifted in favor of separation from the north2 the current government has pursued the military option ggressively economic

organization that promotes cooperation and development formed mediation committee consisting of two organs summit committee of heads of state from ethiopia eritrea kenya and uganda and standing committee composed of their mediators preliminary talks were held in november 1993 and january 1994 and formal negotiations began in march and may of the same year presented at the may meeting the declaration of principles dop4 included the following provisions the right of self determination with national unity as high priority separation of religion and state secularism system of governance based on multiparty democracy decentralization through loose federation or confederacy respect for human rights and referendum to be held in the south with secession as an option th nif government initially resisted the dop particularly its endorse ment of selfdetermination and secularism the sudan peoples liberation movement splm5 the political arm of the souths main armed opposition force the sudan peoples libe ration army spla accepted the dop splasplm the sudan peoples libe ration movement and its armed wing the dan peoples liberation army spla was founded in 1983 after southern troops mutinied to protest the imposition of sharia laws by then president jaffer nimeri the spla received significant military assistance from ethiopia and other african countries and by the late 1980s was in control of all of southern sudan except for the regional capital juba nd other small garrison towns in 1991 however the spla split when senior commanders formed their own faction the factional fighting that ensued almost destroyed the southern liberation movement the spla lost almost all of its garrison towns and was pushed by government forces to the ugandan border by mid1990s the spla began to recover and later recaptured most of the towns it had lost to government forces under the leadership of the americaneducated leader dr john garang the spla now controls large swath of land in southern sudan and has presence in the north as wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs3 the igad peace process began with the view among the mediators that the sudan conflict was havi ng serious repercussions not only in the country but also in the region and then sought to deal with the root causes of the conflict conditions were ripe for talks since both sides were exhausted from years of fighting and some members of the igad committee were seen by khartoum as allies in 1994 however relations between igad member eritrea and sudan began to deteriorate largely due to sudans support for an eritrean opposition group the eritrea islamic jihad meanwhile serious opposition to th dop began to emerge from the nif government the most contentious issues were secularism and selfdetermination which the khartoum government refused to concede in july 1994 the polarization of the tw sides intensified after the khartoum government appointed hardline nif mber to its delegation the khartoum delegation professed the governments commitment to islamic law as part of religious and moral obligation to prom ote islam in sudan and throughout the continent and rejected selfd etermination as ploy to split the country in september 1994 president moi of kenya convened m eeting of the committees heads of state sudans president bashir and the leader of splma the khartoum government walked out of these peace talks rejectin g the dop however military setbacks and intense international pressure forced the government back to the negotiating table in nairobi in 1997 and it formally accepted the dop the return to the igad process was in part in recognition of the gove rnments failed effort to attract other mediators who might have been more supportive of nif positions further meetings in 19971998 sought to narrow divisions between the two sides with the government of sudan formally agreeing to selfdetermination for the south the government of sudan also appeared willing to compromise on some other issues in may 1998 the parties despite some progress earlier disagreed on which territories were considered part of the south the khartoum delegation defined the south as the three provinces of bahr ghazal equatoria and upper nile established at independence in january 1956 the splma argued that southern kordofan province and southern blue nile province and other areas on the margins of the three core provinces were also pa rt of the south there were also serious disagreements on the duration of the in terim period before referendum on self determination and issues re lating to interim arrangemen ts were shelved by the mediators in part to avoid breakdown in the talks the question of religion and state remained unresolved the united states and the european union praised khartoums acceptance of selfdetermination as major step forwar d however some observers characterized the agreement on selfdetermination as small step in the right direction after years of stalled efforts the most contentious nd difficult issues were yet to be tackled by igad mediators including the separati on of religion from politics and interim arrangements prior to the referendum so observers argued that it was too soon to judge whether the concession on selfdetermination represented change in khartoums position or tactical move to buy more time followup meeting between the parties took place in addis ab aba ethiopia in early august 1998 the talks collapsed due to differences on the role of religion in politics the parties also disagreed again on the territorial defin ition of southern sudan for the purpose of referendum in february 2000 the parties met in nairobi but failed to make progresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs4 6alistair lyon egypt libya trying for

egypt and libya in 20006 of all the past peace efforts7 the igad peace process did the most to help narrow the differences between the government of sudan and the splm but igad was never close to resolving the sudanese conflict because of multiple factors perhaps one of the most serious obstacles to peace in sudan was the governments notion that the war could be won and the splma defeated indeed with the split of the splma in 1991 and its loss of allies in the region the nif government had retaken most of the territory that had been under splma control for years by mid1990s however the spla had retaken territories captured by the government once again changing the dynamics on the ground regional dynamics in the conflictprone horn of africa cont ributed to the persistence of the conflict both the government of sudan and th splma relied on the support of regional actors enabling both sides to survive setbacks and creating sort of balance of power between them shifting lliances however ensured c ontinued instability in the sudan the nifs flirtation with international terrorism and radical islam contributed to nif isolation and limited its capabilities for defeating the spla the policies of the united states and its allies focused mo re on isolating sudan than pursuing peace efforts some believe competing regional initiatives such as the one pursued by egypt and libya

significantly increased its development programs in southern sudan and us counterterrorism experts continue thei r dialogue with their counterparts in khartoum these multiple engagements many believe

the government of sudan and the splma with draft sudan peace agreemen t proposal the draft proposal dealt with number of critical issues facing the two parties to the conflict on the issue of selfdetermination the draft proposal altered the longstanding position of igad and its declaration of principles i gad in its dop specifically endorsed self determination for south sudan in contrast the 2002 draft sudan peace agreement proposed pre transition period that w ould last about six months and transition period that would last more than four years the proposal did not address the issue of referendum direc tly and instead suggested that the peoplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs8 of southern sudan shall be consulted this popular consu ltation shall solicit the views of southern sudanese in rega rd to selfdetermination arrangements as set out in this agreement members of the splma legation and their supporters viewed the proposals as unacceptable and total abandonment of their basic right to determine their political future they objected to the proposed government structures and the authority given to the national government and to what they saw as the diminished role for southerners within the proposed framework asserting that southerners would be getting less than what they got in the 1972 addis ababa agreement the government of sudan accepted the proposed draft agreement with few amendments since the draft agreement was similar to the governments previous offers the splma delegation expressed concerns and gave its response to the mediators arguing for shorter transition period and demanding clarity on the issue of self determination the draft proposal was similar to an ear lier proposal presented by the kenyan special envoy in early 2002 according to that proposal selfdetermination would be replaced by selfadminis tration and separa tion of religion and state would be substituted for religious tolerance in addition the proposal called for ceasefire agreement before final political settlement position that has long been rejected by the splma many observers argued then that the illfated proposal was non starter on grounds that the splma w ould not make concessions on these two issues indeed after discussion between president moi and the leader of the splma dr john garang president moi agreed with dr garang that this agreement did not offer anything to southerners the splma and its supporters assumed that was the end of that proposal but the june draft proposal seemed to suggest considering the s imilarities of the two that the earlier thinking was never abandone d by the mediators according to some observers the strategy of the mediators ppeared designed to appease the government and seek concessions from southerners this strategy appeared to presume that the government was stronger and more cooperative than before and that concessions had to made to win the governments acceptan ce without which there could be deal another assumption may have been that if the splma rejected this proposal it would be labeled as the obstacle to peace and would be isolated and marginalized but some analysts argue that this line of thinking achieved quite the opposite results it unified southerners and opened the door for more violence and intransigence hours before the deadline for the signing of the draft agreement the mediators reportedly realized that the omission of self determination from the agreement was serious error and that the draft agreem ent altered igads longstanding support for self determination nd took inadequate account of the government of sudans stated acceptance of the proposal the draft agr eement was rewritten and new phase of negotiations began after series of give and take discussions and intense pressure on the parties especially on the government of sudan the parties reached what some see as potentially historic agreement on july 20 2002 the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation army af ter five weeks of talks in machakoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs9 13 text of the framework agreement is available at httpwwwstategovrpaprsps20028915htm 14text of the

referendum on the political future of southern sudan at the end of the transition period the agreement establishes an independent assessment and evaluation commission to monitor and evaluate the implementation of final peace agreement the machakos protocol also exempts southern sudan from the islamic law or sharia the united states the united kingdom and norway participated as observers in the machakos igad negotiations the framework agreement is seen by the mediators and some observers as major breakthrough in the long stalled igad peace process the government of sudan had favored the earlier draft agreement which neglected self determination for the south and downplayed the separa tion of religion and the state the framework agreement by contrast gave both sides something to take back to their constituencies the government of sudan was able to point to the fact that it could continue its sharia laws in the north while the splma was able to emphasize the agreement on referendum to determine the political future of southern sudan after six year transition period the splm appeared to have made important concessions at machakos paving the way for the framework agreement the splma had long insisted on short transition period two to four years the government had long insisted on ten year transition period the splma accepted longer transition period in order to give unity chance according to members of the splma delegation at the talks th splma also abandoned its long standing opposition to sharia by agreeing to the conti nuation of sharia laws in the north the government of sudans acceptance of refe rendum at the end of the transition period was also seen as an important concession the current igad talks machakos ii the second phase of the negotiations in

in southern sudan based on what they characterized as confidence building measure the splma reversed an earlier opposition and agreed to cessation of hostilities agreement the second phase of the negotiations at machakos focused on wide range of issues relating to power and wealth sharing arrangements15 on the question of the presidency there were significant disagreements between the parties the splma initially proposed rotation of the presiden cy during the interim period the first three years under bashirs presidency w ith the splma in the vice president slot and the reverse for the second half of the interim period the g overnment of sudan rejected the splma proposal the splma then proposed that bashir could keep the presidency for the entire interim period provided that the splma was given the first vice president slot the government was at first receptive to the idea but then rejected the splma proposal arguing that there should be several vice presidents and the president bashir should fill thes slots members of the governments delegation expressed concerns that to give the first vice president slot to the splma would be risky since in the event the president were incapacitated the first vice president splma would assume the presidency the splm agreed to the proposal of creating several vice president slots but insisted that the first vice president slot with genuine pow ers should be given to the splm there were also disagreements on power sharing arrangements in the executive legislature the civil service and the judiciary both the government of sudan and the splma agreed on splma pa rticipation in all these government structures the splma argued that due to historical injusti ces southerners should get 40 of the seats in the lower house and 50 in the upper house the splma accepts the fact that southerners may onl represent third of the population while pointing out the absence of reliable popul ation census the splma argues that it is important to maintain 5050 repres entation in order to avoid abuses of power by the majority in the upper house th government contends that southerners represent less than 20 of the population nd thus do not deserve to have 4050 of the seats in the legislature the mediat ors have proposed 33 representation for the splma in the executive cabinet and the civil service the splmahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs11 16 sources for this section are internal igad documents interviews with spla us and igad officialsdemanded 40 of the positions in all levels while the g overnment of sudan offered 20 negotiations on the status of the nationa l capital were also contentious there is agreement that the national capital would continue to be khartoum but the splma insists that the national capital which has large population of nonmuslim southern sudanese should be secular and not bound by the sharia laws of khartoum state at machakos i both sides agreed that the south would be exempted from sharia and the north could have sharia but the status of the capital was not discussed as counterproposal the splma suggested that an enclave in khartoum should be sharia free and the re st of the capital could continue to have sharia the government rejected the spl ma proposal and charged that discussion on this issue could unravel agreements reach ed at machakos i observers note that while on the surface disagreement on this issue seems minor the influencing factors behind the disagreement are very serious at the core of this debate is the role of religion in politics the very same issue that led to the second phase of the civil war after then president nimeri impos ed sharia in the south in 1983 on wealth sharing there was general agreement that more funds should be allocated for southern sudan there we re significant disagreements however on ownership of natural res ources economic policy and on revenue sharing the government of sudan maintains that all unregistered land belongs to the state while the splma contends that land belongs to the community the splma argues that because of historical neglect of the south significant share of revenues especially oil revenues should go to the south the splma demanded 60 of the revenues from oil while the government of suda n offered 10 the government contends that the national government will require significant funds to finance reconstruction and development of the entire country during the transition period another contentious issue was the sudanese banking system and the recent introduction of new currency in southern sudan by the splma the splma argues that the current banking system is based on islamic laws and is incompatible with the economic system in southern sudan

negotiations were sta lled because the parties could not agree on allocation of parliamentary seats civil rvice positions for sout hern sudanese share of revenues from oil and other resources and power sharing arrangements in the executive during the recent talks the parties agreed to move away from percentages and agreed on formula of equitable power and wealth sharing arrangements while there appears to be broad understanding and agreement about the formula the prospects for misinterpretations are substantial the mediators appear eager to reach agreements wher possible and avoid contentious issues leaving unresolved issues for later da the limited success on power and wealth sharing issues hinges completely on the idea of equitable sharing of power and wealth the real challenge is likely to come when the parties begin to discuss what equitable means to each side the splm asserts that decades of neglect of and discrimination against the south should be compensated by giving southerners more than what they have been offered in the past the government of sudan argues that other sudanese communities also deserve attention the mediators hope to bridge the gap between the two sides once they secure agreement on the key issues of power and wealth sharing the national capital the marginalized areas of the nuba mountains abyei and southern blue nile and final security arrangements the parties have begun discussion on the marginalized areas after days of wrangling over the compositi on of the delegations and agenda for the talks the government of sudan insisted that members of the delegation of the other side should consist of and should be led by people from the respective areas members of the splm delegation argued th at the government of sudan should not dictate the makeup of the splm delegation si nce the movement is not dictating the composition of the governments delegation the splm later agreed to the governments demand the delegations then adopted an agenda for the talks after they agreed to discuss the three areas in three subcommittees for the regions consisting of eight individuals from each side the mediators and some observers ar cautiously optimistic about the talks although the optimism seems to reflect simply the fact that the talks are ongoing and have not collapsed17 there has not been major breakthrough in the talks since the parties signed the framework agreement on selfdetermination and religion and state in july 2002 in the januaryfebruary talks the parties agreed to establish national unity government and bicameral legislature the parties also agreed to hold elections during the interim period af ter rehabilitation r econstruction and repatriation in southern suda n the structure of the gove rnment and the relationship between the governing entities is not clear the national unity government would consist of the current government and the spl m it is not clear however what role if any other opposition groups would have in the national unity government the broad outline agreement is vague about wh at specific role the splm would have inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs13 the executive although the parties have ag reed president omar bashir would remain the head of government during the inte rim period the medi ators hope that the decisionmaking process in the executive w ould be one of respect for authority and partnership the parties agreed to equitable repr esentation in both chambers of the legislature without specifying the compos ition of the parties the mediators attempted to clarify what they meant by equitable sharing of power in the legislature and executive the mediators assert that relevant considerations shall be taken into account in determining what constitute s equitable representation what is meant by relevant considerations is not clear however some aspects of the agreement on the national civil service shed light on what is considered relevant considerations according to the agreement several principles shall be applied in determining the level of repr esentation and the number of positions that could be allocated for southe rn sudanese these principles include imbalances and disadvantages which exist must be redre ssed merit is important and training is necessary fair competition for jobs level of government shall discriminate against any qualified sudane citizen on the basis of religion ethnicity region gender or political beliefs and the national civil service will fairly represent all the people of the sudan this general outline of the guiding principles appears to satisfy the demands of the parties the government is likely to emphasize fair representation of the people of sudan merit and fair co mpetition since northerners are better educated and have more expe rience in government service the splm on the other hand is likely to focus more on the need to redress decadesold neglect and discrimination and effective utilization of affirm ative action for southerners the proposed executive will consist of th president vice presidents and council of ministers the pa rties have yet to agree on the role and number of vice presidents the splm had initially proposed rotation of the presidency and after contentious debate dropped its proposal it is not clear under the current arrangement if the splm would get the vice president position with executive powers or take one of several vice president positions the executive will have broad powers in matters of national security and administration of the federal government allocation of cabinet positions is expected to be addressed before final peace agreement is signed the mediators deliberately avoided dealing with allocation of posts in the national unity government because the parties could not agree in previous talks the reluctance by the government of sudan to accept rotational presidency in the initial phase of the talks and disagreement over the powers of the vice president has contributed to an erosion of confidence between the parties and uncertainty about the commitment of the g overnment of sudan to real powersharing arrangement with the splm the leader of the splm dr john garang is under intense internal and ex ternal pressure not to make further concessions some senior members of the movement contend that the splm has made number of important concessions while the govern ment of sudan continued to hardened its positions in march 2003 at leadership council meeting in southern sudan the splm leadership acknowledged that unwarranted concessions were made during the january talks and that co rrective measures would be taken the parties made some pr ogress in the wealthshari ng

oil reve nues while the government offered 10 the current preliminary agreement states that the sharing and allocation of wealth shall be based on the premise that all parts of sudan are entitled to development the agreement also emphasizes that the parties agree that the southern sudan faces serious needs the agreement gives the national unity government broad powers to collect taxes and manage national resources on the issue of land ownership the parties agreed that the regulation of land tenure usage and exercise of rights in lands is to be concurrent competency exercised at the appropriate levels of government the agreement on land ownership is vague and vulnerable to various interpre tations by the parties the parties may construe the phrase concurrent competenceat the appropr iate levels of government to mean in the case of the government of sudan th national unity government in which the current government is expected to domin ate and the splm could interpret the phrase as one that gives authority to th government of southern sudan the parties agreed that existing oil contracts shall not be subject to re negotiations some top splm leaders c ontend that the movement gave too much by allowing existing contracts to stay in place the splm and human rights organizations have repeatedly accused oil companies operating in sudan of supporting the government of sudans scorched earth18 policy in the oilproducing regions of southern sudan it is not cl ear what role the government of southern sudan would have in new contr acts it is also not clear if the parties interpretation of concurrent competence applies to oil resources moreover the parties agreed that if contracts are deem ed to have fundamental social and environmental problems the government of sudan will implement the necessary remedial measures the negative social and nvironmental impact in the oilproducing regions in southern sudan has been re ported on by human rights organizations19 the splm is likely to use this provision to influence new contract negotiations and renegotiate existing contracts with oil companies the parties agreed to establish fiscal and financial allocation

consistently argued that th south would not be responsible for the external debt of sudan ce these funds were used to subjugate southerners and that the funds were never used to develop the south the splm delegation dropped its opposition to the assumption of responsibility fo r the external debt after several days of debate is real progress be ing made between the government of sudan and the spla many observers and the parties to the conflict agree that negotiations between the government of sudan and the spla have made some pr ogress over the past several months21 the mediators are portraying positive picture and appear determined to keep the parties engaged in the negotiations however the optimistic scenario of peace within reach is not shared by some observers who believe that the sudan conflict may require more time to resolve some analysts are concerned that in the absence of trust between the parties and mounting tensions the talks might collapse some splm leaders charge that the government of sudan is dragging out the talks in order to launch full scale attack against the south according to some us officials and regional experts the government of sudan seems to be under intense pressure from within to finish off the spla militarily rather than to make concessions and threaten the unity of the country indeed there were major breakthrough agreements since july 2002 th ere was small yet incremental progress made in the last round of talks the pa rties moreover seem committed to continuing the negotiations the most notable achievements of the negotiations thus far are improved humanitarian conditions relative peace and st ability in south sudan and the asserted desire of the parties to reach just and lasting peace in recent months humanitarian conditions have improved sign ificantly large scale suffering and death by starvation is becoming thing of the past with humanitarian assistance being delivered to the needy largely unimpeded22 moreover there has been major military confrontation between the government of sudan and th spla since the signing of the cessation of hostilities agreement in october 2002 lthough government forces and allied militia attacked spla forces on number of ccasions in western upper nile in late 2002 the last six months have been notably peaceful and stable period in southern sudan fewer civilians have been targeted by

peace agreement could be reached by the end of june 200324 they assert that agreemen ts or understanding have been reached on wide range of issues indeed comparisons of current negotiations to previous attempts including the nigeri asponsored abuja peace process and the egyptlibya initiative suggest that the current igadled talk s have achieved much more than the others moreover the parties to the conflict seem to be more committed this time around than on previous occasions while the parties may not be absolutely certain of the end game there are reported signs that the parties could be preparing themselves politically and psychologically for an eventual settlement this is seen as major departure for bot h sides from their previously held positions indeed both sides have their respective rdliners who continue to undermine the process what observers see as new and inte resting about this process is the fact that these factions do not appear to enjoy str ong support within their respective camps and therefore are less likely to succeed analysts believe that external factors are also influencing the negotiations for the better shifting alliances in the region have had positive impact on the peace process improved relations between longtime arch enemies uganda and sudan for example have helped those within th nif who have been urging diplomatic solutions with regional actors and negotiations with the spla the twoyear war between ethiopia and eritrea which led to the dissolution of the frontline states assembled against the nif regime in khartoum helped the nif regime improve relations with neighboring ethiopia more over sudans rapproc hement with egypt strengthened the standing of the governme nt of sudan in the arab world meanwhile splms careful courting of the egyptian government in recent years which eased cairos fear of divided sudan may have contributed to the limited success of the igadled peace process some observers who are cautiously optimistic ac knowledge that although progress was made in the in itial talks there have been breakthroughs in recent months these observers see that the l ack of progress concerning the security arrangement the three dis puted areas the nuba mount ains abyei and southern blue nile and the status of the national capital as due in large part to the difficult nature of the issues solving these issues they argue will require assertive and forceful engagement by the united states and its peace partners president bashir of sudan and the leader of the splm dr john garang have met twice since the signing of the framework agreement in july 2002 in an effort to build confidence between the two leaders the parties so may also have ma more progress on some of the most contentious issues behi nd closed doors than is publicly known the second round of talks on wea lth and power sharing for example concluded with major disagreements on wide range of i ssues followup meeting with

regional information networkssupport by the world bank and the imf on the same issues reportedly produced significant results but the agreem ents have not been made public the pessimists pessimists emphasize that significant challenges remain to any peace settlement in sudan some an alysts and sudanese opposition groups are not convinced that the government of suda n is truly committed to just and lasting peace they argue that its apparent change in behavior is temporary and tactical in large part out of fear of sanctions that might be imposed by the united states indeed the foot dragging on political re form and counterte rrorism cooperation by the sudanese government ab ruptly ended shortly after the september 11th terrorist attacks one serious concern is that f action led by first vice president osman taha is opposed to the peace process according to regional observers and us officials this faction the core of the islamist wing of the government reportedly prefers to pursue the military option especially in light of increased oil revenues in recent years the government of sudan has purchased sophisticated weapon systems including helicopter gunships and has si gnificantly expanded its domestic production of weapon systems25 moreover some observers suggest that the islamists fear that peace agreement with the spla could weaken the islamic movement and eventually end their grip on power some have suggested that vice president taha is concerned that if there is peace agreement he would have to give up the vice president slot to the spla as the negotiations on power sharing seem to suggest in recent weeks however taha has suggested that he now supports the peace process and would like to play direct role in the talks several other factors could also complicate final deal between the spla and the government of sudan the north is increasingly divided th traditional parties the umma and the democratic unionist party dup are splintering and remain outside the peace process the recent mee ting of the national democratic alliance nda in eritrea clearly demonstrated th potential pitfalls if northern groups opposing the government of sudan remain outside the peace process many nda members are unhappy that the spla unilate rally signed agreements with the government of sudan and consider the acceptance of sharia islamic law in the north as serious mistake in early 2003 major rebellion in darfur state erupted forcing government forces to deploy to an area that had been peaceful for years the darfur crisis has serious consequen ces for the government of sudan26 the rebellion appears to enjoy popular public support nd has gained ground against government forces the majority of the people in darfur are of african and muslim decent moreover the backbone of the sudan ar my comes from the darfur region leading some observers to speculate that the unexpected success of the rebels may be attributed to the support they may have r eceived from the sudanese army itself the rebellion also is reportedly receiving assistance from chad the zagawa are major tribe in the rebellion and the tribe of president idris deby of chad the end game the end game is likely to be more contentious as the parties attempt to resolve difficult issues the most contentious issue will be securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31947crs18 arrangements in the interim period the government of sudan would like to see unified army while the spla insists in keeping its army during the interim period the spla is unlikely to give up on this issu and powerful forces in the government of sudan are vehemently opposed to twoar my arrangement arguing that this would be tantamount to an independent south th difficulty in resolving this issue lies in the deep mistrust that exists between the north and the south key element of the 1972 agreement that ended the first phase of the sudan conflict was the maintenance of unified army the spla leadership believes now that wa s mistake and may have contributed to the intransigence of the north once th south disarmed observers agree that the twodecade war has destroyed much of the trust between the two parties and that the in terim period should be used to build trust between the parties furthermore the spla argues that the july framework agreement provides southern sudanese the right to hold refere ndum to decide their association with the north creating unified army now they contend could impact the conduct and outcome of the referendum some observers believe that solution can be found without jeopardizing final peace agreement they argu that even if the opposing sides maintained two armies they could still tablish joint national institutions unified military comma nd national police force national training cen ter and joint border patrol but for this scenario to work they assert direct nd robust engagement by the united states in the peace process is pivotal they believe that american engagement is more relevant now in light of the change in leadership in kenya the igad special envoy general sumbeiywo who was close to kenyas former president moi and had the strong backing of the government does not enjoy the same level of access to the new kenyan leadership kenyas ne pr esident mwai kibaki also is not thought to be as committed to the sudan peace pro cess as former president moi who was personally involved in the peace pr ocess for almost decade some observers have suggested that th united states with the blessing of igad and the parties host discussion on security arrangements in washington they maintain that the parties are more likely to embrace session in washington believing that direct american engagement could make the united states guarantor of peace agreement indeed the bush administrations engagement in the peace process has been cited as major contributing factor to progress in the peace process the bush administration has helped bridge the gap between the united states and its european allies over sudan policy paving the way for improved cooperation in the peace process other us government agencies are expanding their activities in sudan reportedly ma
