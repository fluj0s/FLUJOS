uninsured children in the preceding discussion the percentages of various groups of children were compared in terms of their health insuran ce for example 75 of nonhispanic white children were uninsured in 2007 compared w ith 207 of hispanic children however because the united states has many more nonhispanic white children 45 million than hispanic children 16 million the number of uninsured in each group is similar as shown in figure 1 source congressional research service analysis of data from the march 2008 current population survey note numbers in millions totals may not sum to 100 due to rounding fulltime and fullyear means at least one parent living with the child was fulltim fullyear worker parttime or partyear means that at least one parent living with the child worked but not fulltime and fullyear whites blacks and asians are those who are nonhispanic and report only one race among nonhispanics individuals who report any other single race eg american indian or multiple races are categorized as other figure 1 characteristics of uninsured children under age 19 2007 89 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97975crs6 4 historical tables for 1999 fo rward are available at http www censusgovhhe swwwh lthins historicindexhtml the analysis in this sec tion is based on the tabl at http wwwcensusgov hheswwwhlthinshistorichihistt5xls 5 cps health insurance estimates for years prior to 1999 are available but are not directly comparable to those for later years because of questionnaire change that increased the number and percentage of people covered by health insurance beginning in 1999 as well as the absence of revised data for years prior to 1996 that w ould correct census bureau programming error discovered in 2007 based on unrevised estimat produced using the old questionnaire the number and percentage of uninsured children unde r age 18 showed yeartoyear fluctuations but grew significantly between 1987 and 1998 as employ mentbased coverage rates declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s public coverage rates rose as employmentbased coverage rates rebounded in the mid1990s public coverage rates dec lined old historical tables are available at httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwhlthinshistoricindex_oldhtmlthis apparent paradox that the group leas t likely to be uninsured makes up large portion of the uninsured exists when looking at other characteristics as well children who lived with at least one parent who worked fulltime for the entire year were least likely to be uninsured 9 compared with other children but still composed 60 of all uninsured children in 2007 similarly childre n in twoparent familie s were least likely to be uninsured 9 compared with others yet made up more than half of the population of uninsured children this raises difficult issues for policy makers who might wish to help uninsured children for example shoul d proposals be targeted at those in two parent families because they are more numer ous or at other uninsured children because they are more likely to be uninsured health insurance coverage of children over time health insurance estimates presented in this report thus far have referred to children under age 19 the remainder of this report refers to children under age 18 for whom historical estimates are more readily available4 between 1999 and 2007 the number of children under age 18 with employmentbased health insurance fell by 29 million while public coverage increased by 62 million these changes combined with overall child population growth over the period of 21 million led to smaller but still st atistically significant drop in the number of uninsured children 884000 between 1999 and 2007 looking at the percentage changes in coverage over the 1999 to 2007 period children under 18 experienced 57 percenta ge point decline in employmentbased coverage from 652 in 1999 to 595 in 2007 privat nongroup coverage also declined significantly from 57 in 1999 to 53 in 2007 however public coverage increased by 78 percentage points from 232 in 1999 to 310 in 2007 leading to decline in the percentage of uninsured children of 15 percentage points from 125 in 1999 to 110 in 20075
