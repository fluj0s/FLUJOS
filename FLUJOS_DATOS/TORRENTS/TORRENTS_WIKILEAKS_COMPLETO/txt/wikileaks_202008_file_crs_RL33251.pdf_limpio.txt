values to services that reflect physician work ie the time skill and intensity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the relative values are adjusted for geographic

calculation of the formula these include 1 the sustainable growth rate sgr which is essentially cumulative target for medicare spending growth over time with 1996 serving as the base period 2 the medicare economic index mei which measures inflation in the inputs needed to produce physicians services and 3 the update adjustment factor which modifies the update which would otherwise be allowed by the mei to bring spending in line with the sgr target in case can the adjustment factor be less than minus 7 or more than plus 3section 5104 the conference agreement overrides application of the

opportunity for families of disabled children to purchase medicaid coverage for such childrenfor children with disabilities there are number of potentially applicable medicaid eligibility groups some mandatory but most optional for some of these groups disability status or medical need is directly related to medicaid eligibility eg children receiving supplemental security income or ssi with family income below 75 fpl there are other pathways through which such children may also qualify for medicaid coverage for which disability status andor medical need are irrelevant eg children under age 6 with family income below 133 fpl all of the medicaid eligibility pathways for children require income levels that are generally below 300 of the federal poverty level fpl with some statespecific exceptionssection 6062a1 the agreement creates new optional medicaid eligibility group for children with disabilities under age 19 who meet the severity of disability required under ssi without regard to any income or asset eligibility requirements applicable under ssi for children and whose family income does not exceed 300 fpl states can exceed 300 fpl without federal matching funds for such

and pay premiums for family coverage through employersponsored insurance if certain conditions are met when the employer offers family coverage the parent is eligible for such coverage and the employer contributes at least 50 of the total cost of annual premiums for such coverage states must require participation in such coverage as condition of continuing medicaid eligibility for the child

costeffective medicaid will not pay deductibles coinsurance or other costsharing for family members ineligible for medicaid third party liability rules apply to coverage in group health plan that is such plans not medicaid must pay for all covered services under the plan costeffectiveness means that the reduction in medicaid expenditures for medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in group health plan is likely to be greater than the additional costs for premiums and costsharing required under the group health planany portion of required premiums on behalf of eligible children under such employer plans medicaid would be the secondary payer to these employer plans benefits offered by medicaid but not offered by the employer plans would be covered under medicaid also if such employer coverage is

income but only if specific caps on aggregate payments for costsharing including premiums for employersponsored family coverage if applicable and other charges are met these caps specify that costsharing cannot exceed 5 of income for families with income up to 200 fpl and cannot exceed 75 of income for families with income between 200 and 300 fpl states cannot require prepayment of premiums nor can states terminate eligibility of an enrolled child for failure to pay premiums unless lack of payment continues for minimum of 60 days beyond the due date states can waive payment of

the new optional coverage group set at 300 fpl to exceed the otherwise app licable afdcrelated income standard for children under medicaid this section also stipulates that children with disabilities made eligible for medicaid through the new optional coverage group would not be considered to be targeted lowincome children as defined under schip thus the regular medicaid fmap rather than the
