intelligence budget request bullrun briefing sheet when british analysts were cleared for the bullrun program they were given this briefing sheet outlining the sensitivities of the program including the nsas specific capabilities against widely used internet encryption technologies bullrun coi briefing sheet introduction 1 the ability to exploit targets encrypted communications is extremely fragile and is often enabled through sensitive eci programmes the need to takeadditional measures to protect that capability has long been recognisedcurrently virtually all decryption is carried out by ptd arthur processingwith decrypts going to the iib in the nocon coi some decrypts are placedin the endue coi due to the sensitivity or fragility of the exploitationcapabilitypenetrating target defences is the codecracking group within britains government communications headquarters or gchq 2 in recent years there has been an aggressive effort lead by nsa to make major improvements in defeating network security and privacy involvingmultiple sources and methods all of which are extremely sensitive andfragile these include computer network exploitation cne collaborationwith other intelligence agencies investment in highperformance computersand development of advanced mathematical techniques several ecicompartments may apply to the specific sources methods and techniquesinvolvedin 2000 the nsa mounted fullscale effort to preserve its access to the intern et the agency deployed the worlds fastest computers to break codes and began collaborating with technolog companies in the united states and abroad to build access points into their products 3 making the best use of these new capabilities requires that decryption processing be widely deployed beyond ptd and the results of thatprocessing be available to wide range of analysts this inevitably makes itharder to protect this sensitive and fragile capability and we need tocounterbalance this by introducing measures to control access to thismaterial and heighten awareness of the sensitivities amongst those who haveaccessthree years ago the nsa gained the capability to decrypt vast amounts of scrambled internet datasubscribe digital home delivery log in register now help us edition 4 to achieve this nsa has introduced the bullrun coi to protect our abilities to defeat the encryption used in network communicationtechnologies this covers both the fact of capability against specifictechnology and resulting decrypts which may be either plaintext or metadataevents gchq is also introducing bullrun csec dsd and gcsb areexpected to do likewisethe full extent of the ns as decoding capabilities is known only to limited group of top analysts from the nsa and its counterparts in britain canada australia and new zealand the socalled five eyes group only they are cleared for the bullrun program the successor to one called manassas both names of american civil war battles the corres ponding counterencryption program at gchq is edgehill named for the first battle ofthe english civil war control authority 5 the bullrun coi is owned by for penetrating t arget defences ptd authority to manage the coi is delegated to currently and currently bullrun sensitivity and coverage 6 it is imperative to protect the fact that gchq nsa and their sigint partners have capabilities against specific network security technologies as well as thenumber and scope of successes these capabilities are among the sigint communitys most fragile and the inadvertent disclosure of the simple fact of could alert the adversary and result in immediate loss of the capabilityconsequently any admission of fact of capability to defeat encryptionused in specific network communication technologies or disclosure of detailsrelating to that capability must be protected by the bullrun coi andrestricted to those specifically indoctrinated for bullrun the various typesof security covered by bullrun include but are not limited to tlssslhttps eg webmail ssh encrypted chat vpns and encrypted voip thespecific instances of these technologies that can be exploited will bepublished in separate annexe available to bullrun indoctrinated staffthe agency has circum vented or cracked much of the encryption that guards gl obal commerce and banking systems protects sensit ive data like trade secrets and medical records and automatically secures basic internet communications including t he emails web searches internet chats and phone calls of millions of americans and others around the world 7 in addition to the specific technologies that gchq or its sigint partners are able to exploit the methods used to achieve the exploitation must also beprotected these include support from other organisations both internal andexternal to gchq access to bullrun does not imply any needtoknowthe details of sources and methods used to achieve exploitation and ingeneral there will be needtoknow requests for access to informationon sources and methods should be sent to opcsec if consideredappropriate this access may require clearance for certain ecisunlike some classified information that can be parceled out on strict need to know basis the bullrun program is so secret that in general there will be need to know 8 bullrun material data and details must be protected with the use of the bullrun coi and be marked with the label bullrun in addition to therequired privacy marking and other descriptors use of the bullrun markingis restricted to gchq and its sigint 2nd parties access and security 9 requests for access to the coi must be sponsored by gc8 or above and must be accompanied by business case outlining the needtoknow access for contractors will be limited and will require strong business casesuch requests should be discussed with the coi authoritys delegates beforesubmission requests for access are to be sent by email to ptdaccessesonly small cadre of contractors were allowed to join bullrun it does not appear that edward j snowden had access but he managed to gain access to dozens of classified documents mentioning bullrun 10 knowledge of bullrun information and access to the bullrun coi will only be granted to indoctrinated individuals 11 it is the responsibility of sponsors or their successors to notify when an individual longer require access to bullrun handling procedures12 owners of bullrun materials are responsible for correctly marking the information and for ensuring that it is handled according to guidelines forprotecting classified or coi information 13 reports derived from bullrun material shall not reveal or imply thatthe source data was decrypted the network communication technology thatcarried the communication should not be revealed 14 further dissemination other than in product reports of any data orinformation derived from bullrun data must be thoroughly justified and receive prior approval from 15 all questions or
