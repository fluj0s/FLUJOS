110th congress since the previous taa reauthorization the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 congress has considered number of issues discussed below that have arisen in the context of taa and ataa reauthorization extension of eligibility to service workers currently only workers who make articles are eligible for taa in determining whether firm produces an article the department of labor relies on the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states hts published by the united states international trade commission the hts is the list of tariffs charged for all products imported into the united states dol statistics indicate that only 10 of the us workforce are in manufacturing occupations and thus potentially eligible for taa benefits under current law service industry and public sector workers who become unemployed for traderelated reasons are not eligible to receive taa benefits as the united states has shifted to more servicebased economy and as concern over outsourcing has increased there have been increasing calls to extend taa benefits to service workers for example to callcenter workers whose jobs have shifted to india5 congress has considered amending the trade act of 1974 to extend taa eligibility to service and public sector workers related provisions are included in the following bills hr 3920 hr 3943 hr 3801 s 1848 s 122 hr 3589 and hr 6442 see the taa and ataa legislation in the 110th congress section of this report for more information on these bills production shifts to nontrade agreement countries only workers in firms that have shifted production to countries with which the united states has freetrade agreement or those that are named as beneficiary countries under the caribbean basin economic recovery act pl 9867 the andean trade preference act pl 102182 or the african growth and opportunity act pl 106200 are eligible for taa unless the workers can demonstrate that there has been or is likely to be an increase in imports of articles that are like or directly competitive with articles that were produced by the firm for example if firm shifts production to canada or mexico the workers in the us plant would be eligible for taa because canada and mexico are both parties to the north american free trade agreement nafta pl 103182 however if the firm shifts production to china the workers in the us plant might not be eligible for taa because the united states does not have freetrade agreement with china in contrast workers in us manufacturing facilities may be eligible for taa if they become unemployed due to increased imports from any country regardless of 5 for more information see crs report rs22761 extending trade adjustment assistance taa to service workers how many workers could potentially be covered by john j

funding is capped entitlement currently set at 220 million per fiscal year some policymakers maintain that the current funding level which has been in place since fy2003 may be inadequate as some states have had to ration training benefits to eligible workers6 because of the effects of inflation 220 million purchased less training in fy2007 compared to fy2003 moreover if taa benefits are extended to service and public sector workers the current level of funding would likely be exhausted more quickly resulting in training being available to smaller percentage of taaeligible workers

asneeded basis7 given the episodic nature of layoffs states could need much greater funding than allocated based on previous years experience if they experience large layoffs of taaeligible workers conversely states could have large amounts of unused training funds if the number of layoffs is substantially lower than in prior years congress has considered providing states with lower initial allocations of training funds requiring that funds be allocated more evenly throughout the fiscal year and requiring that additional criteria be used to allocate the training funds to states related
