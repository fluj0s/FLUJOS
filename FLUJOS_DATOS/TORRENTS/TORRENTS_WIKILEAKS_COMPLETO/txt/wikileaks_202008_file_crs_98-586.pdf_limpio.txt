court for the central district of california determined that the defendant was required to forfeit only 1500000 of th 35714400 on appeal by the united states the court of appeals held that 1 the forfeiture violated the excessive fines clause but 2 since the defendant failed to file crossappeal requesting modification of the district court order that he forfeit 1500000 it precluded the court of appeals from setting aside the forfeiture order as unconstitutional on june 22 1998 the united states supreme court deci ded that full forfeiture of 35714400 would violate the excessive fines clause2 this report will not be updated the united states supreme court granted certiorari in united states v bajakajian3 on may 27 1997 the issue which was presente d on appeal to the supreme court

united states without filing the required report when neither the source nor the intended use of the currenc is unlawful on june 22 1998 in 54 decision the us supreme court decided th at the fine was grossly disproportional5 bajakajians crime was solely reporting offense6 it was lawful to take the currency out of the country if that action had been reported7 the money was lawfully obtained and the money was to be used to pay lawful debt8 the harm caused by the reporting violation was minimal and the max imum fine that could have been imposed under the sentencing guidelines was 50009 the court also established test for whether fine is excessive which is one of proportiona lity and best reflects the constitutional standard10 purposes of the statute the united states sought forfeiture of the currency pursuant to 18 usc 982 which requires forfeiture upon criminal c onviction under 31 usc 5316 section 982a1 of title 18 provides that the court in imposing sentence on person convicted of an offense in violation of section 5313a 5316 or 5324 of title 31 shall order that the person forfeit to the united stat any property real or personal involved in such or any property traceable to such property hence according to the terms of 18 usc 982a1 the seized currency is s ubject to forfeiture as property involved in such offense11 eighth amendment this however does not address the issue of whether such forfeiture is excessive within the meaning of the eighth amendment the forfeiture is considered unconstitutional if it does not survive scrutiny under the excessive fines clause of

power to punish13 the excessive fines clause limits the governments power to extract payments whether in cash or in kind as punishment for some offense14 case law leading to bajakajian in austin v united states the court declined the invitation to establish multi factor test for determining whether forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause15 the court believed that it woul d be more prudent for the lower courts to consider this question in the first instance16 in united states v real property located in dorado county 17 the court of appeals for the ninth circ uit addressed the i ssue and established twopronged test for determining whether forfeiture is unconstitutionally excessive under the eighth amendment18 since austin was decided several federal courts have formulated variety of multi factor tests for determining whether forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause19 and generally some form of the twopronged test has been followed in the ninth circuit forfeiture is constitutional under the excessive fines clause if 1 under the instrumentality or nexus test the forfeited property must have sufficiently close relationship to the illegal activity and 2 under the proportionality test forfeiture of the property must not impose upon the owner penaltyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98586crs4 2059 f3d at 982 2184 f3d at 33738 the court held that all currency forfeitures are unconstitutional when the crime for which forfeiture is ordered is simply failure to report under 31 usc 5316 because unreported currency can never be an inst rumentality of that crime and can therefore never satisfy the twoprong test as applied in the ninth circuit 22959 f supp 1523 sd fla 1997 23u s customs inspectors using xrays f ound currency concealed in defendants luggage checked for flight from miami to bogota colombia subsequent investigation by customs revealed that the defendants had 23728200 in us currency on their persons and in their luggage that they were attempting to remove fro m the united states without reporting at the sentencing hearing the defendants counsel conced ed that dismissal of the forfeiture count would be improper but asserted that forfeiture of th entire amount seized would violate the eighth amendment unlike bajakajian the court found that the defendants did not establish that the currency was lawful proceeds nor was intended to be used for lawful activities 24959 f supp at 1528 2566 uslw at 4516grossly disproportionate to his offense20 in applying this test in the bajakajian case the ninth circuit held that the forfeiture violated the excessive fines clause21 in united states v delgado 22 the district court did not agree with the ninth circuit the court said that it need not determine whether the unreported currency is an instrumentality of the crime because the instrumentality test is not required for criminal in personam forfeiture23 further the court said that it would not follow bajakajian on several other grounds first bajakajian is contrary to eleventh circuit law because the eleventh circuit applies pr oportionality test not an instrumentality test in civil in rem forfeiture casescivil in rem forfeiture under 21 usc 881a7 is designed to punish the individual acco rdingly the instrumentality test is inappropriate although bajakajian involves the criminal fo rfeiture of unreported currency the ninth circuit test was developed in the civil in rem context second bajakajian is factually distinguishable because the district court found that the funds were lawfully acquired and were intended for lawful purpose third the ninth circuits holding effectively obviates portion of statute enacted by congress with which result this court respectfully does not agree24 therefore the defendants motion to dismiss the forfeiture count because as argued by the defendants it would be excessive in an eighth amendment sense was denied since the lower courts have not been cons istent regarding whether section 982a1 is unconstitutional per under the eighth amendments fines clause insofar as it subjects to criminal forfeiture currency that is about to be transpor ted out of the united states without filing the required report the supreme court had the opportunity to address this issue when it rendered its decision in united states v bajakajian the supreme court struck down the fine as unconstitutional and in effect held that the government cannot always seize and keep all of the money that people try to take outside of the united states w ithout filing the proper reports25 the court held that federal statute that always subjects such money to forfeiture violates the constitutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98586crs5 26id 27id at 451819 28id at 4518 the court said its holding that full forfeiture would be excessive reflects judgment that forfeiture of even 15000 would have suffered from gross disproportion nor does it affirm the reduced 15000 forfeiture on novo review those issues are simply not before us respondent di d not crossappeal the 15000 forfeiture ordered by the district court the court of appeals thus declined to address the 15000 forfeiture and that question is not properly presented here either id at 4519 n11 29id at 4521ban on excessive fines26 it stated that the forfeiture in this case amounts to fine and some forfeitures are so di sproportional to the offense they violate the eighth amendments ban on excessive fines27 the court said that in order to develop constitutional excessiveness standard there are two considerations that are particular ly relevant 1 judgments about the appropriate punishment for an ffense belong in the first inst ance to the legislature and 2 any judicial determination regarding the gravity of particular criminal offense will be inherently imprecise both of thes principles counsel ag ainst requiring strict proportionality between the amount of punitiv forfeiture and the gravity of criminal offense and we therefore adopt the standard of gross disproportionality articulated in our cruel and unusual punishments clause precedents28 writing for the minority justice kennedy said for the first time in its history the court strikes down fine as excessive unde r the eighth amendment the decision is disturbing both for its speci fic holding and for the broa der upheaval it foreshadows29 it would appear that if the currency re presents lawful proceeds which will be used for lawful activities this could be significant factor in determining whether the forfeiture per is grossly disproportionate to the harm involved the court previously had provided mixed signals regarding how j udges should determine whether forfeiture violates the eighth amendm ents ban on excessive fines it is not clear what effect the decision will have on cases in which proceeds from illegal drug activity are seized especially wh the seizures are not considered punishment and therefore not treated as fines howe ver the court did pr ovide important new guidelines on distinguishing when forfeiture should be treated as fi nes and measured for excessiveness httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98586
