article letter to the editor siginty social media page tssirel who else is targeting your target collecting data stolen by hackers from ufouo menwith hill station f77 run date 05062010 tssirel hackers are stealing the emails of some of our targets by collecting the hackers take we 1 get access to the emails themselves and 2 get insights into whos being hacked tssirel people who open attachments from unknown senders gasp or respond to nigerian money laundering emails arent the only individuals on the internet being hacked some of our targets are also being targeted by outside forces both by statesponsored and freelance hackers could your targets communications be the target of other countries or groups tssirel recently communications security establishment canada csec and menwith hill station mhs discovered and began exploiting targetrich data set being stolen by hackers the hackers sophisticated emailstealing intrusion set is known as intolerant of the traffic observed nearly half contains category hits because the attackers are targeting email accounts of interest to the intelligence community although relatively new data source topi s have already written multiple reports based on intolerant collect u technique tssirel to the analyst using sigint databases collected intolerant data looks like simple mail transfer protocol smtp mail in this case though the traffic fairy has been hard at work to hide the traffic the hackers programs split victims email into pieces each piece is then obfuscated given different spoofed source ip address and sent to different destination ip address having different destination ip addresses serves to route the pieces across separate channels 1 of satellite signal the channels being used carry large amounts of traffic allowing intolerant data to hide as background noise much collaboration between cse mhs gchq and nsaw has brought about the transformation of intolerant data we collect into readable smtp mail ufouo victim set tssirel intolerant traffic is very organized each event is labeled to identify and categorize victims cyber attacks commonly apply descriptors to each victim it helps herd victims and track which attacks succeed and which fail victim categories make intolerant interesting indian diplomatic indian navy b central asian diplomatic c chinese human rights defenders d tibetan prodemocracy personalities uighur activists f european special rep to afghanistan and indian photojournalism g tibetan government in exile tssirel new victims appear to flood out their entire inbox going back months or even years then only new mail is transmitted hundreds of emails are seen on an average day u attribution tssirel within the world of cyber exploitation attribution is always difficult and intolerant is exception initial analysis points toward likely state sponsor based on the level of sophistication and the victim set determining which state is sponsoring the activity has yet to be done since the traffic is traveling over satellite the culprit must be within the satellite beams footprint to receive the stolen emails there was hope the footprint would point to which state was responsible but that hope was not realized as shown in the image tssirel attribution of intolerant data is difficult since the satellite beam footprint is so large eventually the virtual team working this effort would like to know who is hacking whom u way forward tssirel analysis continues with the goal of learning more about the attacks as well as improving attribution efforts are also being made to inform relevant parties including ntoc due to the obvious operations security opsec concerns where us and uk authorities have contact with indian diplomats or the european special representative for instance tssirel so the next time you scan your targets email pay special attention to the case notation if it contains 4pxfil 2 e9bdj4pxfiltargetnumber in the case of intolerant then the email is likely available because somebody else has hacked your target for additional details send an email to mhsindexnsaicgov ufouo pocs redacted index team mhs u notes 1 ufouo packet identifiers pids are used in satellite hub signals to designate subchannels 2 tssirel 4pxfil stands for fourth party exfil or outsourcing sigint these terms are used within the sigint community to refer to the practice of collecting data as it transits the internet going from the victims computer to the attackers ufouo sidtoday editors note this article is reprinted from mhss horizon newsletter
