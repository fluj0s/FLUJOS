1985 while tv marti began broadcasting in 1990 both programs are within the office of cuba broadcasting united states informa tion agency usia almost since the beginning us government broadcasting to cuba has been controversial supporters say source of news independent of the cuban government is important especially in the post cold war climate they say there is less print and broadcast media available now to cubans than ever before critics of us government broadcasting in cuba say it has too much cubanamerican focus and not enough diverse opinions they claim that tv marti broadcasts entertainment rather than news and editorials and has low viewership because of jamming by the cuban government and early morning time slots330 am to 600 am in addition some lawmakers have expressed concern that the nineperson advisory board for cuba broadcasting which is appointed by the president with confirma tion by the senate is not rotated as was stipulated by the legislation that created it thus in recent years the value of maintaining cuba broadcasting as it currently exists has come into question in the commerce justice state appropriations act for fy1994 pl 103121 congress provided funding for radio and tv marti but withheld portion for each until the usia director reported to congress not later than july 1 1994 on the two programs in issuing the report the usia director was to

through 1994 introduction since their inception radio and tv marti have attracted much controversy in 1991 one of the findings of the us advisory commission on public diplomacy was that tv marti was not costeffective when compared with other public diplomacy programs in 1992 gao questioned whether tv marti met voice of america broadcast standards as required by law1 in 1992 and 1993 news articles criticized the effectiveness of tv marti in reaching the cuban audience2 in 1993 some members of congress debated the value of continuing funding it subsequently the commerce justice state and related agencies appropriation act for fy1994 pl 103121 established an advisory panel on radio and tv marti to determine whether the broadcasting of these entities 1 consistently meets standards for quality and objectivity established by law or by usia 2 is cost effective 3 is being received by the cuban people on daily basis 4 and if tv marti is technically sound and effective and is consistently being received by sufficient cuban audience to warrant its continuation furthermore the act stipulated that appropriations would be withheld until 30 days after the director makes reports after consulting with the advisory panel on measures that the usia is taking with respect to recommendations of the panel on december 21 1993 the director of the usia joseph duffey announced the formation of the threemember panel the panel met for the first time on december 28 1993 and terminated in march 1994 as soon as the report was submitted to congress generally the advisory panel concluded that both radio and tv marti should be continued and streamlined as required by the fy1994 appropriations law usia director joseph duffey submitted response to the findings of the advisory panel in july 1994 as well as his determination that tv marti is technically sound and effective is consistently being received by sufficient cuban audience and is in the best interest of the united states to maintain at

foreign policy 1983 p 55million about 19 million below the request and 124 million less than current funding of 21 million the house recommended funding for tv marti the senate however set funding closer to the administration request at 248 million for both radio and tv marti in the end the senate version of the bill predominated and 248 million was appropriated for cuba broadcasting pl 103317 this report provides legislative history and funding levels for cuba broadcasting it discusses specific concerns some lawmakers have had with radio and tv marti over the years and presents the panels recommendations and the usia directors response and determinations as required by the fy1994 appropriations act establishment of radio and tv marti since the early 1960s us policy toward cuba has consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive trade embargo3 when fidel castro came to power in 1959 and began to build communist dictatorship uscuban relations deteriorated sharply the kennedy administration broke us diplomatic relations with cuba in 1961 after cuba demanded that us embassy staff be reduced to skeleton crew the united states subsequently sponsored the illfated bay of pigs invasion by anticastro cubans in 1961 and in 1962 imposed comprehensive trade embargo on cuba because of castros expropriation without compensation of us properties in cuba tensions peaked in october 1962 during the cuban missile crisis when the soviet union attempted to install offensive missile sites in cuba in the early to mid1970s there was some movement toward normalization of relations but in the late 1970s cubas military involvement in africa and its support for revolutionary groups in the caribbean basin region halted any movement toward improved relations in the 1980s uscuban relations remained tense because of cubas support for revolutionary movements abroad it was in this environment that in late september 1983 congress approved specialized us voice of america voa programming for cuba with passage of the radio broadcasting to cuba act pl 981114 according to the legislation while the voa was already broadcasting to cuba there is need for broadcasts to cuba which provide news commentary and other information about the events in cuba and elsewhere to promote the cause of freedom in cuba as result of the legislation radio marti named for 19th century cuban nationalist hero jose marti began broadcasting to cuba on may 20 1985httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94636crs3 5 government foreign broadcasting operations are divided into two basic types

broadcasting services tend to emphasize information perspectives policies and the culture of the broadcasting nation radio and tv marti radio free europeradio liberty are examples of surrogate broadcasting voice of america is an example of general broadcastingin 1987 just two years after radio martis first broadcast congress approved funding for study on the feasibility of establishing us government television service to cuba in order to increase the free flow of information into that country congress then authorized and provided money for startup operations and testing of television

called the board for radio broadcasting was created it has the task of reviewing the effectiveness of radio and tv marti and making any recommendations it may consider necessary the boards members are appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate with not more than five members of the same political party and with the president designating one member of the board to

states broadcasting to cuba congressional concerns about radio and tv marti have included the followin g politicization of the advisory board for cuba broadcasting meeting voa broadcast standards and audience size and accessibility of tv marti broadcasts to cubans politicization concerns about politicization at radio and tv marti have centered around the role of the advisory board for cuba broadcas ting and its controversial chairman jorge mas canosa many are concerned about the lack of turnover of the board members and the chairman as was intended by the originating legislation as illustrated in table 1 the terms of all board members including the chairman will have expired by the end of october 1994 some critics claim that the lack of turnover is due to lack of willingness on the part of past and current administrations to change the composition of the board they say that the conservative mas canosa has attempted to use his influence to gain control of the radio station so that it could be used to propagate the views of the cuban american national foundation cuban exile organization founded by mas canosa in 1981 some have argued further that mas canosa is using his position to promote himself as the next cuban leader after castro former radio marti director ernesto betancourt maintains that he was ousted from his position in 1990 because of his alleged opposition to tv marti and because mas canosa claimed to have lost control of radio marti7 in 1994 statement betancourt stated that his ouster opened the floodgates for the politicization of the station dragging it into exile politics and seriously weakening its editorial integrity8 mas canosa maintains that he has never tried to use radio marti for personal or foundation propaganda9 at the time usia spokesman stated that betancourt was being reassigned to fill critical need for the position of director of usia research office position which betancourt declined10 betancourt urges

including members of but not dominated by the cubanamerica n community with figure politically active among exile groups11 another concern expressed by some observers is for the boards membership to be more balanced with broad gamut of cuban american viewpoints represented the current membership of the advisory board consists of five republicans three democr ats and one independent it has been chaired by mas canosa since its establishment many seem to concur that more diverse views are needed some believe that mas canosa should rotate off the board entirely some believe he should resign the

office tv marti costs and compliance with broadcast standards and international agreements may 1992 gaonsiad92199 14 advisory panel report volume 2 statement of j richard planasbroadcast standards closely related to the question of politicization of cuba broadcasting is the issue of broadcasting standards of radio and tv marti some of the concerns that have been raised by observers and by some members of congress include broadcasting too much cubanamerican news too much entertainment and not enough news lack of editorials offering wide variety of views and lack of onair corrections of broadcasting errors in may 1992 the us general accounting office gao issued report on tv martis compliance with broadcast standards13 as part of the study the gao employed three consultants to watch broadcasts and assess program quality and compliance with voice of america standards that broadcasts be objective accurate balanced and present variety of views according to the report two of the three consultants believed that the broadcasts related to cuba and the cubanamerican community lacked balance and did not meet established voice of america standards the other consultant believed that the broadcasts generally met the standards but that improvements were needed in addition the report noted that tv martis inhouse critics also observed that some broadcasts might not meet standards gao recommended that the usia director instruct voa to institute procedures to ensure that tv martis broadcasts meet established voa standards with regard to radio marti in october 1992 gao staff met with officials of usias bureau of broadcasting about allegations that radio marti broadcasts did not meet voa standards and suggested that the bureau consider establishi ng an external review committee in order to implement the gao recommendations the office of cuba broadcasting established external review panels to review radio and tv martis news and programming concern has surfaced however regarding the objectivity of the external review panels since they are selected by the office of cuba broadcasting longtime radio marti staff member j richard planas recently stated that there is significant politicization of news and information within radio marti to the extent that we may need to consider if radio marti is doing both the cuban people and us foreign policy disservice according to planas radio marti editorial guidelines are routinely ignored in deliberate attempts to favor specific political agenda the agenda consists of stressing commentaries that are critical and derisive of the cuban regime while downplaying favorable evaluations and statements of support toward cuba stressing the hard line policy toward cuba while downplaying criticism of the us embargo or views favoring negotiations with castro presenting favorable aspects of cuban american political leaders who support the hard line policy while downplaying or even censoring criticism of these leaders emphasizing the deficiencies of the cuban regime while deemphasizing its accomplishments and favoring broadcasts of opinions and views about or calls for the imminent fall of the cuban regime

director of the office of cuba broadcasting antonio navarro maintains that over the past three years radio marti has drastically increased the volume of news and information as well as the diversity of responsible opinions in its programming and that one person organization or viewpoint dominates or controls any aspect of radio or tv marti15 in early june because of the numerous allegations regarding the management of the office of cuba broadcasting representative john conyers chairman of the house government operations committee s legislation and national security subcommittee wrote to usia director duffey representative conyers expressed concerns about alleged political bias which is reportedly undermining the accuracy and objectivity of broadcasts to cuba alleged retaliation against employees in the office of cuba broadcasting who have criticized this political bias and alleged cronyism whereby new employees have been hired not for their expertise but because of their connections to influential individuals16 depending on director duffeys response to representatives conyers letter which was requested by june 20 1994 but reportedly has not yet been received the subcommit tee may hold hearings to investigate the allegations17 tv martis broadcasting audience another fundamental concern for many observers including members of congress is whether tv marti is actually being viewed in cuba two reasons for low viewership are 1 the ratification by both the united states and cuba of the internatio nal telecommunications convention which requires that tv stations be established so as not to interfere with other nations broadcasts to comply with this treaty us broadcasts in cuba must be scheduled from 330 am to 600 am and 2 the constant and effective jamming of the broadcasts by the cuban government 1991 report issued by the presidents task force on us government international broadcasting noted that tv marti is impeded because it is forced to broadcast during time period when there are few viewers the task force report recommended that the us government should view this as matter of high priority and should act with vigor to try to gain better broadcast hours but also asserted that if it is not possible to change and extend the hours of broadcasting to reach larger audience the service should be terminated18 in march 1994 the chairman of the task force john hughes stated that the task force probably had the same views as in the 1991 report and characterized the 1991 report as concluding that it

programs of proven value21 in 1993 the commission reiterated its statement that tv marti was not cost effective and recommended that it should be shut down and its resources directed to productive

effective and the committee not being inclined to fund in any way broadcasting enhancements to make tv marti cost effective the committee is denying funding for tv marti for fiscal year 1995 with regard to the cutback in funding for radio marti the house appropriations committee stated that it intends that radio broadcasting to cuba reduce its operatio ns by approximately onethird to bring its resources more in line with commercial radio stations in the united states the committee noted that the amount recommended for radio marti funding is 84 percent more than the average for private

objective news commentary and other uncensored information directly to the cuban people the committee recommended providing 12 million to convert tv marti from vhf to uhf as called for by the advisory panel and noted that its overall funding level for radio and tv marti reflects efficiencies in the cuban broadcasting services an amendment offered on the senate floor by senator baucus to eliminate tv marti generated debate on whether or not tv marti is costeffec tive it was ultimately withdrawn however after senator mack introduced perfecting amendment that instead of eliminating funds for tv marti would have condemned the cuban governmen t for the deliberate sinking of tugboat filled with cubans including many women and children trying to escape cuba in the end the senate predominated in

significant numbers of cubans and he stated that usia has already begun to put into effect many of the panels recommendations which will help bring greater professionalism diversification and balance to radio martis programming with regard to tv marti the usia director agreed with the panels recommendation that it continue and asserted that while cuban jamming of the broadcasts and its inconvenient early morning broadcast hours have kept audiences small it does seen clear however that significant number of cuban citizens have attempted to tune in to these broadcasts and are

directed the panel to scrutinize radio and tv marti with regards to program quality and objectivity costeffectiveness and the extent to which news and information is already available in cuba on daily basis through commercial broadcast sources as well as whether tv marti is technically sound and effective and is consistently being received by sufficient cuban audience to warrant its continuation he expressed concern that the recommendations of tv marti supporters to make tv marti more resistant to jamming like converting from vhf to uhf ignore the overriding questions of feasibility costeffectiveness and legality that remain23 other members maintain that the advisory panel was correct in taking broad interpretation of its mandate and point out that the legislation establishing the panel called for it to study the purposes policies and practices of radio and television broadcast ing to cuba as noted by senator ernest hollings in letter to the advisory panel it was never our intent to have the advisory panel conduct solely narrow technical review of these programs24 in testimony before the advisory panel representative robert torricelli asserted that congress not only expected report on the technical effectiveness of broadcasting to cuba but also an evaluation of the overall effectiveness of these two institutions as vehicles to promote democracy in cuba25 advisory

regarding the advisory board was that it should be consultative body not involved in daytoday broadcasting operations or in the recruitment or promotion of personnel the usia director supported this

review the effectiveness of radio and tvhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94636crs15 26 the oig review examined allegations that 10 radio marti employees were unqualified for their positions or biased in favor of cuban marxists and socialists and an allegation that radio martis news director could not speak fluent english as required for the position with regard to the 10 employees the oig report determined that they were qualified and pointed out that an external review panel had recently reported that radio marti programming was generally well presented and relevant to the cuban audience nevertheless

may 199426 future of tv marti the panel concluded that tv martis broadcasts are technically sound and contain essential information not otherwise available to the cuban people the panel reported cuban jamming prevents those broadcasts from being received by any substantial number of cubans and as result tv marti cannot now be considered costeffective by the usual economic criteria nevertheless the panel asserted that the cuban people have an ardent desire and genuine need to receive the programming produced by tv marti and therefore recommended that tv marti be converted from the current vhf to uhf transmission this would require funding but would allow broadcasting throughout the day and would be more difficult for the cuban government to jam while the panel did acknowledge that many cubans do not own tvs with uhf reception capability more and more tvs in cuba are coming from japan south korea taiwanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94636crs16 27 advisory panel report volume 2 statement by daniel mica chairman of the board for international broadcastingchina and europe therefore future viewership would be expected to increase with uhf transmission the panel suggested that eliminating tv marti would send message to the cuban government and people that the united states is not committed to democracy and human rights promotion furthermore the panel asserted that in the event of crisis or upheaval in cubas future it would be important to have tv marti available as news source research presented to the panel indicated that at moments of severe crisis people turn to television first in the event of crisis if tv marti were not already operating it would take several months or more to begin operations in dissenting view chairman of the board for international broadcasting daniel mica stated to the advisory panel that tv marti is an experiment that should be shelved for the time being but suggested that broadcasts to cuba could be resumed in the future when there is greater chance for technical success assuming such resumption is still warranted by us foreign policy concerns27 several other witnesses to the advisory panel while favoring the concept of television broadcasting to cuba believe that the station should be shut down unless there are changes to increase viewership in his july 1994 response to the advisory panel report usia director duffy strongly supported tv marti maintaining that the best interests of the united states are being served by its continuation the director also maintained that television broadcasting to cuba is technical ly sound and effective and that it is consistently being received by sufficient cuban audience to warrant its continuation in justifying his finding about sufficient cuban audience director duffey cited december 1993 usia office of research survey of cubans visiting the us interests section in havana the survey showed that while 4 percent of the cubans surveyed reported regularly watching the signal for more than five minutes 38 percent reported attemptin g to tune in according to duffey tv martis inability to reach larger audiences in cuba is not the result of any deficiency on the part of tv marti but rather the political decision on the part of the cuban regime to deny the cuban people access to free news and informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94636crs17 28 report of the advisory panel on radio marti and tv

uslatin american relations for use by the office of cuba broadcasting 5 broadcast corrections the panel urged daily corrections that would enhance the credibility of the broadcasts the direc tors

from 500 am to 215 am the following day the rest of the time consists of prerecorded broadcasting 9 convert tv marti to uhf the panel asserted that tv marti should convert to uhf transmission to allow for broadcasting during prime time and to increase the difficulty in jamming by the cuban government researching this concept would require about one year according to the panel the director believed that more research on converting tv marti to uhf is necessary before investing in it if research concludes that transferring to uhf would make significant positive difference in the effectiveness of tv marti the director advised asking congress for support at that time 10 reduce tv marti broadcasting during transition to uhf such reduction in broadcasti ng would keep the tv in operation but reduce costs while researching the transition to uhf the director responded by stating that if this recommendation was made for cost savings the impact would be small currently tv marti repeats half hour newscast three times daily the difference if changed to repeating fifteen minute newscast four times daily would be negligible he said he went on to say that contrary to some perceptions tv marti broadcasts are almost exclusively news and information 11 produce video reports during the transition to uhf tv marti should explore the possibility of producing videotape documentaries and features for distribution in cuba mr duffey stated that tv martis programs department is currently producing and has produced several documentaries for broadcast on tv marti he cautions that the cuban recipients of these tapes run risk of prosecution under the enemy propaganda act of the cuban government 12 broadcast news at prime time the panel encouraged tv marti to consider broadcasting its hour
