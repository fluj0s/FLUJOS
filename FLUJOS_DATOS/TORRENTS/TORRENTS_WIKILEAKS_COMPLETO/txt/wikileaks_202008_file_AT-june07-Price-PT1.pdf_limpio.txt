anthropology today vol 23 3 june 2007although we routinely acknowledge the impact of colo nialism on the history of our discipline we seem to have blind spot when it comes to the specific ways in which more recent interests of military and intelligence agencies intersect with anthropologists and their research however given current efforts to engage anthropologists in military and intelligence campaigns we can longer feign igno rance our neglect of this past seems to be product of two factors firstly the high levels of secrecy surrounding agen cies such as the nsa and cia and secondly the fact that for various reasons anthropologists have been uncomfort able confronting questions relating to anthropologists interactions with these agencies nevertheless some of the cias past efforts to use and shape anthropological and social science research have been an open secret for decades open that is to all who cared to procure publicly available documents and do some detective work1 though largely unexamined the extent of covert cia funding of americanfunded social science research during the 1950s and 1960s was extraordinary this unexamined state of affairs is all the more problematic considering that over three decades ago the us senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities found that the cias intrusion into the foundation field in the 1960s can only be described as massive excluding grants from the big three ford rockefeller and carnegie of the 700 grants over 10000 given by 164 other foundations during the period 19631966 at least 108 involved partial or complete cia funding more importantly cia funding was involved in nearly half the grants the nonbig three foundations made during this period in the field of international activities in the same period more than onethird of the grants awarded by nonbig three in the physical life and social sciences also involved cia funds bona fide foundations rather than those controlled by the cia were considered the best and most plausible kind of funding cover for certain kinds of operations 1966 cia study explained the use of legitimate foundations was the most effec tive way of concealing the cias hand as well as reassuring members of funding organizations that the organization was in fact supported by private funds the agency study contended that this technique was particularly effective for democrati callyrun membership organizations which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators as well as their hos tile critics that they have genuine respectable private sources of income us senate 1976 182183 even though these covert funding programmes influ enced our research agendas and our theories american anthropologists have been surprisingly reluctant to learn their lesson and prevent this from happening again this now leaves us vulnerable in the us research findings by anthropologists psychologists and behavioural scientists are currently being applied to bushs war on terror in ways that are as yet incompletely understood because of the elevated conditions of secrecy if the past is any guide we would benefit from scrutinizing how the intelligence community interfaced with academia to get what they want mkultra in the early 1970s former us state department foreign service employee john marks used the freedom of information act to secure the release of thousands of pages of government documents describing covert cia programmes known as mkdelta and mkultra marks 1979 us senate 1977 these programmes used unwit ting scientists to study methodically whether effective forms of mind control brainwashing interrogation and torture could be achieved some studies investigated whether drugs stress or specific environmental condi tions could be used to break prisoners or to induce fessions marks 1979 sihe 1960 while effective means of mind control were identified these programmes produced significant data on coercion and interrogation that formed the basic research for the cias 1963 kubark counterintelligence interrogation manual this is the base document for the cia interrogation and torture procedures that emerged in the 1960s and continue in the present era cia 1963b 1983 mccoy 2006i would like to thank the three anonymous at reviewers who provided with solid editorial and analytical

anthropologists were led mostly unwittingly to provide input into interrogation techniques still in use today the second part to be published in future issue will examine more concretely how this research found its way into the kubark manual used by us intelligence at detention facilities abroad and through its programme of extreme renditions see also the article by roberto gonzález on pp 1419 of this issue anthropology today vol 23 3 june 2007 declassified 1963 cia report summarizing various mkultra projects stressed the interdisciplinary scope of the project noting that over the tenyear life of the program many additional avenues to the control of human behavior have been designed by the cias technical services division management as appropriate to investi gation under the mkultra charter including radiation electroshock various fields of psychology psychiatry sociology and anthropology graphology harassment substances and paramilitary devices and materials cia 1963a 4 this report explains how mkultra programmes secretly used cia money to fund academic researchers affiliated with universities through agency funding fronts designed to look like legitimate academic research insti tutions in some cases these academics knew they were funded by laundered cia funds but in most instances they were completely unwitting participants the process and cia expectations were described as follows annual grants of funds are made under ostensible research foundation auspices to the specialists located in the public or quasipublic institutions this approach conceals from the insti tution the interest of cia and permits the recipient to proceed with his investigation publish his findings excluding military implications and account for his expenditures in manner normal to his institution number of the grants have included funds for the construction and equipping of research facilities and for the employment of research assistants key individuals must qualify for top secret clearance and are made witting of agency sponsorship as rule each specialist is managed unilaterally and is not witting of agency support of parallel mkultra research in his field the system in effect buys piece of the specialist in order to enlist his aid in pursuing the intelligence implications of his research his services typically include systematic search of the scientific literature procure ment of materials their propagation and the application of test doses of drugs to animals and under some circumstances to volunteer human subjects the funding of sensitive mkultra projects by sterile grants in aid as noted in the preceding paragraph disclosed one of the principal controversial aspects of this program cia 1963a 78 emphasis added through such arrangements an unknown number of wit ting researchers projects were funded to produce reports that typically might have both public and secret versions public versions could be published in academic journals while the cia was given secret versions while pro grammes using scholars as willing researchers often had their own ethical problems they were fundamentally dif ferent from the cia projects that funded researchers who had idea for whom they were working within the cia richard helms provided dr sidney gottlieb and the cias technical services divisions with 25 million in funds between 1953 and 1963 for mkultra projects studying human responses to drugs and environ mental conditions that could manipulate individuals into adopting behaviours against their will mccoy 2006 28 29 cia operations bluebird and artichoke studied the usefulness of psychotropic drugs in interrogation both bluebird and artichoke regularly used unethical and illegal research methods such as dosing unsuspecting gov ernment employees or members of the public with strong chemical agents like lsd dmt liquid concentrates of thc or opiates see mccoy 2006 2628 marks 197953 121 these drug experiments spilled over into the coun terculture the cia searched for effective truth serums but in its search unleashed ken kesey timothy leary and allen ginsberg many of these experiments were illegal andor unethical they placed unwitting prisoner civilian and mil itary research subjects at risk and left some individuals with permanent damage see weinstein 1990 the cias efforts to find means of effectively controlling or inter rogating people drew in top american medical and social scientists alfred mccoy observed that the cias alliance with behavioral science seems marvelously synergistic placing mindcontrol research at the apex of the academic agenda and providing patronage that elevated cooperative scientists particularly psychologists to the first rank of their profession mccoy 2006 31 though the programme chiefly involved psychologists anthropologists wandered in and out of mkultrafunded projects in ways that have been documented but remain poorly understood margaret mead served on the advisory board

now becoming understood but enough is known to find patterns of cia cooptation and abuse of anthropological research see price 1998 the key to the mkultra programmes use of unwit ting anthropologists and other social scientists during the 1950s and 1960s was anthropologists uncritical reliance on legitimateseeming organizations that were secretly cia funding fronts one such apparently legitimate cia funded foundation was the society for the investigation of human ecology human ecology the society for the investigation of human ecology sihe was cia funding front which provided grants to social scientists and medical researchers investigating questions of interest to the mkultra program see price 1998 marks 1979 hef 1963 the society was founded in 1954 in new york by harold g wolff md renowned neurologist and leading authority on stress migraine and 1 for some examples of anthropological discussions of these relationships see castañeda 2005 mitchell 2002 price 2003a and 2003b 2 margaret mead maintained friendship with harold wolff for several decades she knew him at least from the mid1940s mm m3 hw to mm 52445 story in the november 1951 issue of the american anthropological

gajduseks research into kuru among the fore of new guinea mm c41 mm to hw 72158 3 there were also many other sorts of relationships that american anthropologists maintained with the cia during the cold war see price 2002 one example is given by alfred meyer who wrote that in 1952 when he was the assistant director of harvards russian research center anthropologist clyde kluckhohn once called into his office for confidential chat once in while he said i send memo around to all the members of the center in which i suggest that we discuss specific problem of course i had seen such memos and responded to them well he continued such suggestions of mine usually come from the local field office of the cia who phone saying our uncle in washington would like to know what you people think about such problem kluckhohn told that during the next semester he was going to be on leave and the cia agents wanted someone appointed to be their contact person meyer 2000 2122 4 raymond prince published

organizations as human ecology here and while the operations of organ ization shifted from new york city to cornell universitys medical school most of the key personnel remained with the organization hef 1963 james l monroe was the human ecology funds executive director from 1961 to 1963 in 1964 david rhodes became the executive director monroe had multiple cia connections and oversaw the air forces comprehensive study of korean war pris oners marks 1979 15657 and rhodes was psycholo gist involved in series of unethical drug experiments including efforts to dose unsuspecting people with an aer osol potion of lsd supplied by an mkultra research pro gramme ibid 99 but the public face of human ecology was that of paragon of respectable mainstream research the 1961 directory of the encyclopedia of associations described the foundation as one that stimulates and supports studies of mans adaptation to the complex aspects of his environment conducts investigations at universities and research centers in such subjects as psychic and physical brain function impairments sudden environmental change on the health and attitudes of large immigrant popu lation conducted among

personality change the scientist in the soviet union eoa 1961 291 the declassified cia documents released some decades later clarify that most of these study areas were of interest to the cia in its efforts towards systematic design of effec tive persuasion interrogation and torture methods harold wolff used his connections with margaret mead to try and identify anthropologists who could work on research sponsored by the society for the investigation of human ecology on 3 december 1956 wolff wrote to mead requesting copy of the mailing list for meads institute for intercultural studies ifis mm c37 hw to mm 12356 wolff wrote that he would like to bring to the attention of the members of ifis the interests of the society for the investigation of human ecology and the possibility for future research funding i have seen documents indicating that mead understood wolffs true interest in funding anthropologists but she did respond by informing wolff how to acquire preaddressed envelopes for mailing to ifis members mm c37 mm to hw 1457 the society for the investigation of human ecology funded anthropological and sociological projects providing specific cultural information about cold war enemy popu lations such as china or russia as well as research into sexuality both pleasure and pain were areas of interest for those studying interrogation stress and refugees see price 1998 the diversity in these different research projects made it difficult to discern simple pattern indi cating the cias interests some anthropologists were clearly lied to about the uses and purpose of their research john marks found documents indicating that when cornell university had hired an anthropologist before learning that the cia security office would not give her clearance harold wolff simply lied to her about where the money came from marks 1979 150151 fig 4 lists all projects appearing in the human ecology funds 19611963 report4 although the cias 1963 internal report clearly states that some mkultra funded scholars knew of the agencys involvement cia 1963a7 8 i have found evidence of any particular scholar par ticipating with knowledge of cia involvement and so we may assume that all recipients listed here were unaware of the cias sponsorship at the time they received these grants the table shows the projects in ascending order of human ecology fund grant funding many of the low funded projects probably had intelligence or national security applications and simply provided the human ecology fund with necessary false appearance of legiti macy for the public and the academic community likely examples of such projects include the studies on cranial analysis puerto rican migration and childrearing and restudy of levittown new york human ecology grants to scholars who conducted apparently innocent research unrelated to cia research projects sometimes had additional benefits john marks noted that technical services staff source explains that grants such as those to bf skinner karl rogers erwin goffman for their own unrelated research bought legiti macy for the society and made the recipients grateful he says that the money gave agency employees at human ecology reason to phone skinner or any other recip ient to pick his brain about particular problem marks 1979 160 the human ecology fund funded former british nigerian colonial psychiatrist raymond prince to travel to nigeria to undertake transcultural psychological studies in the late 1950s prince had knowledge of the cias funding of this research see hef 1963 and prince 1962a 1962b 1963 decades after the fact prince came to believe that his crosscultural psychological research and filmmaking was funded not only to establish legitimacy for the human ecology fund but also to attempt to recruit foreign nationals into the cia and to collect psychocul tural data on cultures and countries of interest to the cia for psychological warfare purposes prince 1995 407 cia document declassified in 1977 clarified that unbe knownst to prince the cias view was that his study will add somewhat to our understanding of native yoruba psychiatry including the use of drugs many of which are unknown or not

declassified document indicates that the cia has long recognized the potential usefulness of ethnographic fieldwork not only as window into distant cultural worlds but as means of potential recruitment and even for the sort of pharmacological research that was exam ined for mkultra interrogation research programmes many human ecologybankrolled projects appear to have had applications to mkultras coercive inter rogation and propaganda studies the listed studies examining childhood conceptual development appear to have had applications to what the cias now declassi fied 1963 kubark interrogation manual describes as the childlike regressive state induced by torture which they more sweetly termed coercive interrogation and the cia now euphemizes as enhanced interrogation cia 1963b research findings from human ecologyfunded studies examining such things as the effects of isolation and sleep deprivation stress hypnosis graphology and links between personality types and drug interactions likewise appear as vital components of the cias kubark interro gation manual though these human ecologyfinanced studies are not each though some were specifically cited in the manual which is manual for interrogators who may stray into torture not peerreviewed academic sour cebook and thus contains very few citations these studies were produced for and read by cia personnel contributing to it the key finding for anthropology in alfred mccoys book question of torture is mccoys demonstration that previously known ciafunded mkultra social science research projects were not primarily aligned with cia propaganda or brainwashing programmes but produced knowledge that was to be quietly harvested by cia per sonnel designing scientific means of conducting interroga tion and torture mccoy 2006 4346 cf prince 1995 there are many elements of human ecologyfunded research whose articulation with cia needs is still poorly understood for example the funded bioelectrics research or programmes establishing psychiatric scales or group psychology studies may have been incorporated into the cias secret research on interrogation or they may merely have provided an air of legitimacy for the foundation obviously psychiatric scales could be useful instru ments for interrogators gauging interrogation subjects mental health and responses questions remain concerning what the human ecology funds interest was in funding dr beatrice berles research on the impact of illness on families in harlem hef 1963 it may simply be that the fund was providing board members spouse with nepotistic kickback unrelated to mkultras desires berle was the wife of hef board member educator diplomat and cold warrior adolf berle but given the cias record of experimental abuse of prisoners and lowranking sol diers biderman and zimmer 1961 marks 1979 we may justifiably wonder what their interest in other relatively disempowered and poor populations may have been other listed human ecologyfunded studies had obvious appli cations to mkultra projects studying counterinsurgency and propaganda these include funded studies examining revolutions refugee studies chinese personality types chinese family structure soviet psychology crosscultural communication and various studies examining elements of psychological profiling human ecology china hungary and elsewhere china held keen interest for harold wolff and the society for the investigation of human ecology the cia used human ecology and wolffs presence at cornell to investigate ways to take chinese citizens living in the us and as lawrence hinkle put it steer them to the cia and make them into agents marks 1979 149 human ecologyfunded projects at cornell investigated ways to train such agents to resist chinese brainwashing efforts marks 1979 150 raymond prince later concluded that one of human ecologys goals was to use their chinese sample as means to identify disgruntled refugees with suitable personality profiles who had fled the communist regime 10 years earlier and might be persuaded to act as cia agents back in china prince 1995 411 william rodd studied differences in chinese problem solving abilities as well as difference in logical thinking and value systems hef 1963 17 william k carr was given 48480 to study anthropological identification of the determinants of chinese behavior the reports summation of this work stated that anthropologically the task of identifying determinants of behavior is less concerned with individual personality than with certain nonpsychological or cultural factors that influence the individual within his social system in general the behavior of all members of given society has common structure dis tinguishable from the common behavior patterns of individuals in other societies this similarity in group behavior may be attributed to the social system rather than the personalities of the several members it can be assumed that the organism is aware of definite number of environmental factors and that these serve as stimuli to the organism william k carr is attempting to conceptualize the principal social determinant of selected aspects of chinese behavior by using systemanalysis approach to the description of chinese society hef 1963 17 given raymond princes claim that some human ecology programmes were designed to recruit cia opera tives among chinese citizens prince 1994 it is natural to wonder if carr engaged in such activities but there is little information on what his work entailed whatever carr did find he was well paid with grants totalling over 48000 making him the anthropologist who received the most money from the human ecology fund prior to receiving this grant carr had produced papers on chinas young communist league functions and structures that may have been of interest to the cia see franke 1959 in march 1964 carr became member of the human ecology funds staff aaafn 1964 5 see also carr and tullock 1965

stephenson 1978 hef 1963 in the mid1950s human ecology sponsored two conferences where scholars examined the political psychological and cultural means through which hungarian refugees retained their identities under soviet occupation see sihe 1958 the cia secretly sponsored other academic conferences during this period by hosting such salons the cia rented some of the best minds of generation and directed them towards tasks that most would not have undertaken if their purpose had been disclosed see also saunders 1999 other projects were smaller in scale with less tangible out comes for example the results of another human ecology project were written up by anthropologist leon stover as psychedelic science fiction story describing subtleties of intercultural communication in story about efforts to film mental images of catatonics see stover 1972 l stover to dp 112894 in his review of all cia mkultra projects sidney gottlieb hoped that the society for the investigation of human ecology would become the cias eyes and ears probing into areas of research that were of interest and of use to the cia gottlieb dreamed that the society would try to keep in touch with that part of the scientific research community which were in areas that we were interested in and try to usually its mode was to find somebody that was working in an area in which we were interested and encourage him to continue in that area with some funding from us weinstein 1990 139 connecting past and present as i noted above in the mid1970s the us senate discov ered that surprisingly large proportion of research grants issued during the escalation of the vietnam war and other military cold war incursions were either directly or indi rectly funded by the cia without having to account for their actions these agencies were left free to set covert research agendas to influence the direction in which scholars took their research and to appropriate research for covert ends given that the war on terror once again finds intelligence agencies seeking help from academia we need to consider and evaluate these past interactions and be mindful that intelligence agencies have at times been silent consumers of our research even apparently innocuous research can have covert uses here i have outlined but one of several fronts used by the cia to fund and direct past research projects for more on the use of such funding fronts see eveland 1980 marks 1979 oconnell 1990 saunders 1999 wolf and jorgensen 1970 in the second part of this article i will describe how some human ecology projects can only now be understood in the context of harold wolffs connec tions to research that would be used in writing the cias kubark manual cia 1963b which involved developing effective means of interrogation that most of us would regard as torture unwitting participation by reputable scholars chan nelled what appeared as innocuous academic research into covert unethical programmes through this practice the cia helped build up the careers of some academics influ enced social science and behavioural research and gener ally attempted to create informal networks they could tap for information to provide input into their covert goals by their own admission cia moneylaundering was at its most effective when funds flowed through seemingly innocent private foundations like the human ecology fund few participants had any inkling that what they were doing served any goals other than their own more anthropologists today work openly for military and intelligence agencies than in the past but the current push in military and intelligence circles for ever more expertise means that we also risk return to covert funding of unwitting anthropologists particularly in the context of the lack of linguistic and regional field expertise of these agencies for example in muslim countries as the cias 1963 mkultra report noted using unwitting scholars to conduct research in areas of need is the most effective way to claim their expertise for causes academics including professional associations and ethics committees would otherwise oppose and for which they would otherwise need security clearance cia 1963a today some programmes like the pat roberts intelligence scholars program prisp and intelligence community scholars program are already openly adver tising and funding students covertly placed in our univer sity classrooms and research labs these are effectively cia nsa and fbi employees inside our research envi ronments on our campuses price 2005 not knowing who we are working with or sometimes even who we are working for suggests that some of us may already be unwittingly engaged in activities that tarnish our academic reputation if we do not want to go into history as collabo rators with such coercive covert agencies who may use our research to dominate and exploit the peoples we work with then we must take decisive action now identify and expose such programmes wherever we can and advise our professional associations to recommend our colleagues not touch them l 2002 interlopers and invited guests on anthropologys witting and unwitting links to
