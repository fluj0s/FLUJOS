1999 valerie bailey grasso analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report discusses recent congressionally mandated reductions in the department of defense dod acquisition workforce it reviews dods varied efforts to define who belongs to this workforce and examines potential issues for congress in identifying and downsizing the workforce it includes defense acquisition workforce definitions and estimates by the congress general accounting office gao and various defense management reports consequent issues for congress are identified congressional action concerning the defense acquisition workforce was taken in the fiscal year fy 1999 defense authorization and appropriation bills this report will be updated periodically as required defense acquisition workforce issues for congress summary in each of the past four fiscal years fy1996fy1999 congress has directed the administration to reduce the size of the department of defense dod acquisition workforce defined as the employees who participate in the development and procurement of weapons equipment and provisions for the military services these mandates reflect view in congress that the workforce has not been downsized in proportion to the decline in of the overall defense budget in general nor of the acquisition portion of the defense budget in particular as congress and the administration have debated the future of the defense acquisition workforce participants have encountered basic questions what precisely is the dod acquisition workforce how many people are in it and what exactly are their functions at present there is commonly accepted definition of the dod acquisition workforce previous attempts within the decade to define the workforce have produced estimates ranging from 25000 to 582000 personnel in early 1997 dod hired the jefferson solutions group private consulting firm to define the size and composition of the acquisition workforce jefferson solutions issued its report in september 1997 it estimated that the overall workforce included about 189000 people and that the largest acquisition workforce group consists of scientists and engineers about 43 percent followed by computer systems analysts and logistical and program managers about 16 percent and contractors purchasers or procurement support personnel about 15 percent notably the study did not address the issue or provide statistics on the extent to which dod relied on privatesector contractors to perform acquisitionrelated functions in response to section 912b of the fy1998 defense authorization act deputy secretary of defense for acquisition and technology jacques s gansler issued memorandum to defense agencies on november 20 1998 having determined that dod would use modified version of the definition used by the packard commission report each agency is required to conduct functional workforce analysis revise its personnel count and report findings by december 30 1998 currently two major questions confront congress in regard to the acquisition workforce first should the new definition constructed by the jefferson solutions group be adopted formally if so it will result in significant reduction in dods official count of acquisition personnel second to what extent will savings achieved through reductions be offset by additional unanticipated costs such costs may include 1 hiring contractors to perform acquisitionrelated functions previously performed by government employees 2 separation costs such as early buyouts retirements and severance pay and 3 overtime costs due to both personnel shortages and inexperienced personnel contents introduction 1 defining the

past four fiscal years congress has directed the administration to reduce the size of the department of defense dod acquisition workforce the dod employees who participate in the development and procurement of weapons and equipment for the military services c in the fy1996 defense authorization act congress directed the administration to reduce the workforce by 15000 people by october 1 1996 and by total of 25 percent compared to the 1995 figure over period of five years the act also required the secretary of defense to report to congress on ways to restructure functions among dods acquisition departments and agencies c in the fy1997 defense authorization act congress directed the administration to reduce the workforce by an additional 15000 people by october 1 1997 and stipulated that this reduction was to be in the form of actual acquisition personnel not just acquisition positions c in the fy1998 defense authorization act congress directed the administration to reduce the workforce by an additional 25000 people by september 30 1998 but permitted the secretary of defense to waive portion of this reduction if her certifies to congress by june 1 1998 that such reductions would adversely impact military readiness and acquisition efficiency the act also required dod to submit report to congress by april 1 1998 that provides plan for future acquisition policy including future opportunities to restructure and streamline dods acquisition organizations workforce and infrastructure c in the fy1999 defense authorization act congress directed the administration to reduce the workforce by 25000 acquisition personnel by october 1 1999 lowering it to 12500 personnel if the secretary of defense certifies that such reduction would cause an adverse effect on military readiness or management of the acquisition system these mandates to reduce the size of the dod acquisition workforce reflected congress view that the workforce has not been downsized enough that reductions continue to lag in proportion to the decline in the size of the overall defense budget in general and the acquisition portion of the defense budget in particular as result according to this view dod has spent more than is necessary to administer its crs2 acquisition programs reducing the workforce has been viewed as necessary requirement for eliminating wasteful spending and providing dod with increased funding for other priorities congressional interest in reducing the size and associated costs of the dod acquisition workforce has been energized by certain outside reports the may 1995 report of the dod commission on roles and missions for example noted that while privatesector defense contractors had undertaken largescale reorganizations adjusting to reduced level of defense spending little corresponding reduction had been made in the number of dod acquisition organizations or personnel1 congress and dod are presently at odds over the need for further reductions in the defense acquisition workforce dod now believes that it has exceeded its congressional mandates to reduce the acquisition workforce and that further acquisition personnel reductions will have an adverse impact this concern was expressed in 1997 report to congress required by the fy1996 defense authorization act dod stated that in fy1996 it had reduced the acquisition workforce by 23802 personnel militarycivilian excluding certain depot trade skill personnel employed by or assigned to its acquisition organizations 8802 more than mandated by congress for that year dod stated that without the depot skill trades exemption it reduced personnel in acquisition organizations by 30377 in fy1996 in its report dod estimated twoyear reduction by the end of fy1997 of over 56000 people 132 percent reduction 2 dods current position is that mandated acquisition personnel reductions have undercut its effort to manage the acquisition workforce and have adversely impacted military readiness in appeals to the fy 1999 defense authorization bill3 dod asked congress to reconsider house section 901 which requires that by october 1 2001 dod would phasein reductions of an additional 70000 defense acquisition personnel dod believed that section 901 excluded about 80000 civilian personnel performing acquisition functions at depot maintenance depots in its appeal dod strongly opposed these reductions having stated that personnel cuts enacted outside the manpower planning programming and budgeting system are inconsistent with 1 us department of defense directions for

the general accounting office gao has examined issues facing dods acquisition workforce in 1995 report before congressionallymandated personnel reductions began gao concluded that even with declines in both the defense procurement budget and the civilian workforce since 1990 the number of acquisition organizations remains relatively constant 5 1997 gao report using data from the defense manpower data center stated that for the period ending march 31 1997 dod reduced its acquisition workforce from the 1995 baseline by 50334 fulltime equivalent personnel ftes or 20223 more than required by congress6 in 1998 the house national security committee asked gao to review dods progress in achieving 25percent reduction in the acquisition organizations workforce examine the potential savings associated with such reductions determine the status of dod efforts to redefine the acquisition workforce and examine dods efforts to restructure acquisition organizations gao concluded that dod has been reducing its acquisition workforce at faster rate than its overall workforce and is on schedule to accomplish 25percent reduction by the fiscal year 2000 however potential savings from these reductions cannot be precisely tracked in dods budget in addition some of the potential savings from acquisition workforce reductions may be offset by other anticipated costs such costs include those for contracting with private entities for some services previously performed by government personnel ie substituting one workforce for another 7 such conflicting opinions on the size of the defense acquisition workforce and the potential savings to be achieved stem from an inability to define it over the past three years as congress and the administration have debated the future of the defense acquisition workforce policymakers have sought to answer the basic question what precisely is the dod acquisition workforce how many people are in it where in dod are they located and what exactly are

workforce this has led to confusing and contentious discussions about the workforce its size and composition the significance of reductions dod has made and the potential impact of carrying out further reductions historical perspective there have been at least seven attempts in recent years by congress and dod to define what constitutes the defense acquisition workforce each attempt was based on study which used differing combinations of occupational and organizational codes and produced estimates of the size of the workforce ranging from 25000 to 582000 personnel it is important to note that these studies were performed over period of more than decade period during which there have been significant changes in the size of the defense budget the size of the procurement portion of the defense budget the number of uniformed military personnel and the total number of dod civilian employees an estimate of the acquisition workforce that appears large or small in an absolute sense should be considered in light of the defense policy changes that have occurred currently the most commonly accepted estimates agreed upon by congress and dod range from about 106000 to 270000 personnel the first is an estimate of personnel whose positions fall under the defense acquisition workforce improvement act dawia dawia is the basis for nearly all of dods education training and career development programs for the acquisition workforce congress enacted dawia in the fy1991 defense authorization act8 it is codified in chapter 87 title 10 of the us code and has been amended several times since enactment the most recent estimate comes from the fy1998 defense authorization act public law 10585 and counts 270000 personnel 8 public law 101510 national defense authorization

report organizations sources unless otherwise noted data in this table were derived from dr james s mcmichael director of acquisition education office of the secretary of defense according to dr mcmichael the defense management report estimated the workforce count at 582000 in june 1989 dod and the defense management data center have used the same algorithm to arrive at the figure of 582000 when needed they apply this algorithm to the database to obtain comparable count dods current estimate is 375000 this definition also includes organizations which the secretary of defense may determine to have predominately acquisition mission current approaches in dods personnel system members of the acquisition workforce can be identified by using any of three basic approaches either alone or in combination 1 identification by occupational codes such as gs1102 contracting specialist contracting specialists are most often thought of as the acquisition workforce they are the public face that is most often associated with directly buying dod goods and services from aircraft carriers to 600 toilet seats some contracting specialists directly purchase goods and services others manage the buying process between dod and defense contractors still others develop supervise and monitor dod contracting policy not all occupational codes however can be neatly classified as either inside or outside the acquisition workforce some managers engineers and scientists for example are involved in acquisitionrelated activities but also perform other functions for example manager may be primarily responsible for base operations and serve as critical support for the daytoday running of the military installation 2 identification by organizational codes which reflect the mission of the office in which the person works such as the defense reutilization and marketing service drms which is responsible for dods surplus and excess property programs drms workers routinely acquire goods and services for disposal within federal agencies these goods and services are longer needed by dod throughout the defense establishment some workers are directly involved in buying and selling while others support this process for example auditors may have some oversight authority for the financial management process within military installation but have responsibility for the contracting process they may not be involved with the actual buying or selling either directly or indirectly there are also personnel that perform acquisitionrelated functions in organizations that do not have an acquisition mission while other personnel are assigned to an organization with an acquisitionrelated mission but are not involved in the acquisition process for example child care worker responsible for the installations day care center would be unlikely to have responsibility for procuring goods and services thus the organizational codes are not always an undisputed identifier crs7 3 direct identification in which dod performs desk auditof the actual performance of tasks by one worker and compares it with description of tasks and duties that make up acquisitionrelated functions and determines that based on empirical evidence the worker should be considered as part of the acquisition community the data is then entered into an information system and dod counts that individual as performing acquisitionrelated functions the direct identification method may be considered the most reliable but it is also the most timeconsuming according to dod military and civilian positions that are categorized as part of the dod acquisition system fall into one of 14 acquisition position categories as established by the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology each acquisition position category has standards set according to its level of complexity definitions of each category of acquisition positions can be found in dod instruction 500058r and dod manual 500052m9 although the definition of each acquisition position category appears in dod instruction manuals the number of positions made it difficult for congress to determine just how many different individuals occupied each position as well as what duties each individual performed within the framework of defense acquisition congress sought an objective source for definition of what constituted the defense acquisition workforce and directed dod to create new definition that would answer these questions jefferson solutions report at 1997 hearing on the dod acquisition workforce before the military procurement and readiness subcommittee of the house national security committee hnsc10 dod was asked to create new definition of the acquisition workforce that could be accepted and used by all participants in the debate to carry out this task dod hired the jefferson solutions group management consulting firm based in washington dc and headed by dr allan v burman former administrator of the office of federal procurement policy ofpp jefferson solutions issued its report in september 1997 the report used data gathered from the defense manpower data center dmdc and from interviews with officials from the office of the secretary of defense army navy air force defense 9 the following regulations prescribe policies and procedures governing career management activities of the acquisition workforce within dod organizations dod instruction 500058 r defense acquisition workforce january 14 1992 dod directive 500052 defense acquisition education training and career development

solutions review of the department of defense acquisition workforce prepared for the department of defense dasw197m1847 55 p crs8 manpower data center defense logistics agency staff from the senate armed services committee sac and the house national security committee hnsc and analysts from the general accounting office gao and the congressional budget office cbo the report examined two approaches for classifying acquisition workforce personnel 1 identifying personnel serving in acquisition organizations identified in dod instruction 500058r and 2 identifying personnel designated as part of the defense acquisition workforce improvement act dawia the report reached the following conclusions relying exclusively on acquisition organizations resulted in too broad definition as it included employees that do not perform acquisitionrelated functions such as police officers firefighters health care personnel or who perform variety of functions that are not limited to acquisition excluding organizations that did not qualify as acquisition organizations would overlook personnel within these organizations that perform acquisitionrelated functions such as contractors auditors and quality assurance experts since there are only 105544 acquisition personnel whose positions fall within statutory requirements for inclusion under dawia using dawia as an identifier would exclude many personnel who perform acquisitionrelated functions the jefferson solutions report adopted definition for the acquisition workforce that revised and expanded on the definition used by the 1986 packard commission see table 1 the new definition includes 1 all personnel employed in certain defense acquisition occupations regardless of the mission of the particular defense agency in which they work and 2 all personnel in acquisition organizations who are employed in certain acquisition support occupations the report recommended that dod adopt this new definition of the acquisition workforce ensure that the definition is applied in uniform and consistent manner across dod and the services and validate the data results through an independent agency such as the dmdc to ensure that the data is accurate and complete the report recommended that dod be given an opportunity to adjust the personnel count on casebycase basis the report also recommended that dod broaden its definition of employees covered by dawia to include all members of the newly defined defense acquisition workforce as illustrated in the following table the various occupational codes included in the new definition contained total of 177613 people the study group increased this figure by 65 percent to account for administrative and clerical support that the study group believed were underestimated in the data bringing the total defense acquisition personnel estimate to 189158 as illustrated in the following table 11 11 this table includes 13 occupational specialties not included in the 1986 packard commission report

september 1997 p 40 crs10 pertinent observations the jefferson solutions report was narrowly focused on the task of developing workable definition of who and what constituted the acquisition workforce the study combined both occupational and organizational data elements most of the occupations selected for the acquisition workforce were also located in acquisition organizations the study revealed that the largest acquisition workforce group consisted of scientists and engineers about 43 percent followed by computer systems analysts and logistical and program managers about 16 percent and contractors purchasers or procurement support personnel about 15 percent notably the report did not provide statistics on the extent to which dod used privatesector contractors to perform acquisitionrelated functions lack of this information could handicap the task of estimating the total cost of acquisitionrelated activities carried out for dod and could hinder policymakers in getting complete understanding of the workforce composition in its 1996 report on the defense acquisition workforce gao pointed out that savings resulting from staff reductions in acquisition organizations particularly reductions of engineering architectural or computer personnel may have been offset by increases in spending on privatesector contractors12 gao reached the same conclusions in 1998 report on defense acquisition organizations that since 1995 dod support service contracts increased for occupational fields with the largest personnel reductions and that any potential savings may be offset by contracting for services previously performed by government personnel13 since the military services also rely on contractors to varying degrees14 the lack of data on contractor support could complicate the task of making crossservice comparisons it raises the possibility that simple acrosstheboard reduction in the dod acquisition workforce could impact the military services disproportionately due to the congressional mandate to develop workable definition for the defense acquisition workforce dod must decide whether to use the recommendations of the jefferson solutions report further observation is that dod must consider whether the methodology used in the report can be tracked and duplicated by the defense management data center dmdc if it can it will be easier for dod to audit the data and keep abreast of the rate of growth andor attrition of both acquisition personnel and positions within dod and the military 12 defense acquisition organizations changes in cost and size of civilian workforce op cit p 2 22 13 us general accounting office defense acquisition organizations status of workforce reductions report to the chairman committee on national security house of representatives gaonsiad98161 june 1998 p 26 14 the air force for example has comparatively fewer acquisition workforce personnel because it chooses to use rely extensively on privatesector contractors while the department of the navy traditionally has relied more heavily on its own inhouse acquisition organizations crs11 services regularly recurring audits by dmdc would permit dod to report on the cumulative effects of reducing the acquisition workforce by tracking the movement of displaced workers throughout dod issues for congress in the wake of the jefferson solutions report and legislation in the fy 1998 and fy 1999 defense authorization bills congress will confront number of important issues regarding the defense acquisition workforce including the following adequacy and usefulness of new definition should congress adopt the definition of the defense acquisition workforce presented in the jefferson solutions report if so it will result in significant reduction in the dods official count of defense acquisition personnel if it is not adopted the debate on just how many acquisition personnel exist will be prolonged and probably put dod further behind in its efforts to streamline the workforce how much will the new definition help dod and congress to identify redundancies streamline the workforce and achieve savings they must determine to their satisfaction that the findings of the jefferson solutions report are accurate and thorough they will presumably seek agreement on the overall number of acquisition workforce personnel as well as the diversity of skills represented whether the process based on this particular definition of the workforce will ultimately achieve savings depends on variety of factors including the fate of personnel and positions classified as nonacquisitionrelated will savings be achieved through attrition reductionsinforce removals early buyouts or retirements or will personnel shortages result in an unexpected rise in overtime costs will newer less experienced workers result in greater inefficiencies with ultimately increased personnel costs will individuals be usefully absorbed into nonacquisitionrelated functions within dod will potential savings be offset by associated administrative costs as well as costs of increased service contracts for work previously performed by government personnel 15 once new definition is accepted dmdc the defense agency responsible for the collection and maintenance of automated databases on manpower personnel training and financial movement can collaborate with dod to provide further analyses and recommendations to congress with dmdcs assistance the findings of the jefferson solutions report could be validated thus enabling dod to make reasonable adjustments to the personnel figures if such adjustments prove necessary coordinating this function with dmdc would make it easier for dod to perform periodic audits keeping abreast of the rate of growth andor attrition of both acquisition personnel and positions within dod and the military services 15 for further discussion on the potential impact of dod acquisition workforce reductions see gao report to the chairman committee on national security house of representatives defense acquisition organizations status of workforce reductions gaonsiad98161 june 1998 20 pages crs12 secretary of defenses report section 912b of the fy1998 defense authorization act directed the secretary of defense to submit to congress report on acquisition workforce reductions made since fy1989 by fiscal year as well as specify definitions used to describe the defense acquisition workforce congress required the secretary to come up with definition of the workforce that could be applied uniformly throughout dod section 912c directed the secretary to submit to congress report on the reorganization of the defense acquisition workforce the purpose was to provide road map for future defense acquisition policy including future opportunities to restructure and streamline dods acquisition organizations workforce and infrastructure dod was directed to identify areas where overlap duplication and redundancy existed among the various acquisition organizations and to present alternative consolidation options methods for performing industry oversight and quality assurance and ways to shorten the procurement cycle for goods and services section 912c also required dod to explore new opportunities for building cross service and crossfunctional arrangements within the military services and defense agencies consider current and future needs for acquisition personnel including hiring systems that provided an alternative to the current civil service and make recommendations for legislative remedies that would be necessary to implement policy and procedural changes the secretary was also required to provide an assessment of the recommendations in the jefferson solutions report as well as discussion of potential legislative changes viewed necessary to implement policy changes in april 1998 the secretary of defense submitted to congress the report required by section 912c the report titled actions to accelerate the movement to the new workforce vision proposed the establishment of five categories of new initiatives described in the report as part of the secretary of defenses vision16 for the future acquisition workforce they are 1 restructure research development and testing 2 restructure sustainment 3 increase acquisition workforce education and training 4 integrate paperless operations and 5 other future focus areas rather than provide comprehensive review of acquisition organizations and functions as mandated in sections 912c and d the secretary proposed the formation of future task forces and focus groups to study these issues the report did not propose legislative remedies nor clarify the various definitions of the defense acquisition workforce nor did it propose new definition but cite the jefferson solutions estimate based on the revised packard commission as one measure of defining the defense acquisition workforce dod stated that it did not endorse the report nor its recommendations one of the factors for dod to consider is whether the methodology used in the study can be tracked and duplicated by dmdc this would make it easier for dod to perform periodic audits keeping abreast of the rate of growth andor attrition of both acquisition personnel and positions within dod and the military services auditing by dmdc would permit dod to report on the 16 actions to accelerate the movement to the new workforce vision secretary of defense report to congress april 1 1998 p 2 crs13 cumulative effects of reducing the acquisition workforce and track the movement of displaced workers throughout dod on november 20 1998 deputy secretary of defense for acquisition and technology jacques s gansler issued memorandum to defense agencies on his review of the recommendations of the acquisition workforce identification working group this group was formed in response to requirements in section 912b 17 the new workforce definition includes science and technology organization personnel the jefferson solution study gave dod broader view of the breadth and depth of acquisitionrelated activities in the total life cycle of weapon acquisition programs henceforth the acquisition workforce will be referred to as the acquisition and technology workforce secretary perry determined that dod would use definition of the acquisition workforce based on modification of the packard workforce definition he required each agency to conduct workforce analysis based on the modified packard definition revise the personnel count and report their findings by december 30 1998 funding implications the jefferson solutions report recommended that dod seek to broaden the definition of what personnel are covered under the defense acquisition workforce improvement act dawia and include all members of the newlydefined defense acquisition workforce if dod agrees with the reports recommendations the decision could have potential funding implications since dawia is the vehicle for nearly all of dods acquisitionrelated education training and career development programs in fy1998 dod requested budget of 100 million for dawia congress appropriated 95 million to broaden the membership of dawia from 105544 personnel to 189183 personnel suggests that congress will have to appropriate more funds for acquisitionrelated education training and career development programs there are advantages and disadvantages to increasing dawia membership it will cost more money initially in the long run however the investment should eventuate in better trained dod acquisition workforce under dawia dod has developed an organized and systematic approach to career development and training opportunities with appropriate benchmarks at each level of complexity within each program category by identifying dawias certification requirements as the benchmark for all acquisition personnel training and development activities it appears that all acquisition support personnel many of whom have been historically excluded from training and development due to dawia certification and requirements will have greater access to opportunities for promotion advance and growth the theory holds that this should conduce toward superior inhouse defense acquisition workforce 17 for the full text of the recommendations of the acquisition workforce identification working group and dods response to the requirements of section 912b see the defense acquisition reform home page web site located at httpcamaroacqosdmilararhtm and review the memorandum on the modified packard acquisition and technology workforce identification issued by the deputy secretary of defense for acquisition and technology jacques sgansler november 20 1998 26 pages crs14 conclusion congress will determine perhaps through the oversight process if dod has met both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law as described in section 912c of the fy1998 defense authorization act or section 931 of the fy 1999 defense authorization act notably dod leaders who have called for revolution in business affairs have been legislatively required to explore innovative and significant changes to make its acquisition process more efficient this includes exploring potential overlap and duplication of processes within dods acquisition organizations in the various defense agencies and military services listed in appendix d ultimately it is congress that will decide if such changes have been undertaken and if so whether the size and composition of the acquisition workforce have been adjusted appropriately crs15 selected bibliography us congress general accounting office defense acquisition organizations status of workforce reductions report to the chairman committee on national
