industries august 2009 page 1 introduction scope of assignment general objective oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc oliver wyman has been engaged by the department of labor and industries state of washington li to conduct an actuarial review of issues related to current retrospective rating programs in the state of washington the primary purpose of the review is to provide an independent anal ysis as well as recommendations regarding the adequacy and reasonableness of retrospective rating adjustments1 and how retrospective rating adjustments impact equity between employers within the retrospective program retro employers and between retro employers and employers not in the retrospective program nonretro employers goals the issues under examination with in the scope of this project are complex and require some understanding of concepts underlying the insuran ce process and retrospec tively rated insurance policies in general and application of these cepts in washington state in particular the list and descriptions of specific project goals pr esented below presume basic understanding of these concepts2 examine analyze and report on possible inequ ities within the retrospective program as respects the relative treatment of that is prem ium charges to individual retro employers or specific groups of retro employers specifi cally does the calculation of retrospective premium for retro employers resu lt in distribution of refunds surcharges for better than worse than anticipated loss experience based on sound actuarial principles3 1 the purpose of this study is not to conduct an independent audit of the li insurance rvices division 2 the background section on retrospective rating following provides description of retrospective rating in general and in washington state specifically that will assist readers of this report 3 final retrospective premium is calculated as combination of fixed fees and actual loss experience the calculation places an individual employers actual loss experience into an arithmetic formula t he arithmetic formula for an individual employer is determined by t of actuarial tables and parameters the specific table and parameters are in turn determined by the type of retrospective program selected by the employer and the employers size oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 2 examine analyze and report on possible inequ ities between retro employers and nonretro employers washington stat regulation wac 2961790402 requ ires that retro employers as group and nonretro employers as group fund the same portion of their total claim costs relative to their total premium charges that is each group is required to generate the same loss ratio45 specifically what aspects if any of the process by which li determines retrospective refunds surcharges potentially distorts the measurement of loss ratios and therefore potentially creates inequities between retro employers and nonretro employers review current retrospective program actua rial tables and parameters and comment as to whether the tables and parameters which were designed and developed 20 years ago are suitable for use in the current work ers compensation marketplace in washington state as to whether the tables and parameters poten tially impact equity between retro employers within the retrospective program as to whether the tables and parameters poten tially impact equity between retro employers and nonretro employers compare the retrospective program in washington to other jurisdictions offer recommendations with respect to ddressing issues identified in the study 4 the ratio of total claim costs losses to premium charges is called the loss ratio the loss ratio is the basic measure of the performance of an insurance program loss ratios greater than 1000 mean total losses have exceeded premium charges conversely loss ratios less th an 1000 mean to tal losses have been less than total premium charges 5 for nonretro employers premium charges are fixed usually for retro employers premium charges are based on actual loss experience and will va ry as individual employers receive re funds or surcharges in order to comply with washington regulation wac 2961790402 li requires that the overa ll loss ratio for nonretro employers to equal the overall loss ratio for retro employ ers li implements this requirement by adjusting the overall refund to retro employers until the loss ratio fo r retro employers equals th loss ratio for nonretro employers oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 3 specific task list li prescribed the following list of 15 tasks as specific guide to the project6 1 equity of retro employer v ersus nonretro employer costs the department calculates re tro refund target intended to result in retro and nonretro employers both funding an equal pe rcentage of their fu ture expected claim costs to what extent does this current calculation have any ac tuarial biases that have one party retro or nonretro subsidize the other 2 equity of claim free discount what impact does lis claimfree discount rating system have on retro and nonretro standard premiums is any impact of the clai mfree discount actuaria lly fair to both retro and nonretro firms both with the discount and without the retro pr emiums are based on the experiencerated accident and medical aid st andard premiums paid to the department does the current experience rating system in cluding the experience ra ting of small claim free firms produce any actuarial bias in th level of the retros pective premiums 3 kept on salary program current department comparisons between retro and nonretro firms do not take into consideration the avoided claim costs or the co sts borne by the employers for injured workers while they are keptonsalary does this distort the true picture of safety or returntowork comparisons between retro and nonretro firms if so what is an appropriate measure to produce these comparisons 4 trends in permanent partial di sability ppd award frequency what has caused the larger increase in ppd award frequency for retro firms than nonretro firms 5 comparison of data from retro employers and nonretro employers by industry group comment on the data the department will provide that shows comparison of retro employers and nonretro employers in areas such as claim frequency cost and market share in at least the follo wing industry groups agriculture wood products manufacturing groceryretail contractorsconstruction firms 6 impact of retro employer action s on classification base rates what influence if any do retro employer actions have on industry risk classification base rates 6 the task list presented in this report generally preser ves but does not exactly replicate lis presentation in the rfp issued for this project is sued last year for certain tasks lis presentation was par titioned into multiple tasks in order to more systemically address lis underlying concerns oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 4 7 medical aid premiums comment on the inclusion of medi cal aid premiums in the retro adjustment calculations is it possible for an employer to receive more in refund than the employers share of premiums paid what would be the impact of excluding half the medical aid premium from the retro calculations 8 number of adjustments for retro employers analyze the use of three retro adjustments given other considerations such as loss development factors and the influence the number of adjustments may have on retro participation how does this compare to retro programs in other jurisdictions 9 potential inequities within the retrospective rating program does the retro system reward in disproporti onate refunds larger retro groups over smaller groups or smaller groups over larger if so to what extent does this result in advantages or disadvantages for groups that are otherwis providing the same services and overall outcomes do financial incenti ves impact the claims management and safety efforts of the retro groups if so to what degree 10 performance adjustment factor paf comment on the paf the paf has historical ly been less than 10 but has recently been greater than 10 why has this occurred and is this actuaria lly appropriate 11 loss development factors ldfs why are the ldfs in washington state so high in comparison to those found in other states is this impacted by washi ngtons case reserve practices 12 case reserve levels have case reserve levels been consistent over time 13 evaluation of tables evaluate and make recommenda tions on the following tables table of insurance charges plan tables a1 a2 a3 b size group tables single loss limitation table 14 examination of bias in current tables is there any significant actuarial bias in the current tables and calculation with respect to size of enrollee risk classes of enrollee loss limitation choi ce of table selected quarter of enrollment loss development factorspaf third annual

oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 5 background retrospective rating introduction the purpose of this section is to provide background on methods of developing insurance premium charges in general nd retrospective rating specificall the section is designed to lay the groundwork for understanding the issues ddressed by this study those already familiar with the background presented in this section may wish to move directly to the executive summary guaranteed cost policies and nonretro employers cost of insurance coverage insurance premium provides for the following fundamental costs of insurance coverage losses in the specific instance of wo rkers compensation insurance sses include the cost of wage replacement benefits and the cost of medical treatment claims adjustment expenses claims adjustment expenses include the cost of claims management expenses that may be attributed to individual clai ms usually termed allocated expenses and which may include the costs of litigation surveillance etc and the cost of claims management expenses that are not attributed to individual claims usually termed unallocated expenses and which may include claims administrator sa laries equipment costs etc insurance company expenses these would include the cost of administrativ overhead rent and facility costs policy production costs commissi on taxes licensing etc insurance company profit insurance companies strive to earn reasona ble profit commensurate with the risk they assume by engaging in the business of insurance premium rates and exposure premium rates include provisions for each of th fundamental costs of insurance coverage premium in the most basic sense is equal to the rate multiplied by the number of exposure units in workers compensation insurance exposure units may be payroll hours worked or some other measurement of time at work for example an employer with 25 employees working 2000 hours per year at an average hourly rate of 20 will generate 1000000 to tal payroll 25 x 2000 x 20 in year in most states payroll meas ured in units of 100 is the typical exposure unit oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 6 for determining workers compensation premiu m therefore an employer with 1000000 annual payroll will have 10000 exposure units alternatively if exposure is measured by hours worked as in washington the same employer will have accumulated 50000 25 x 2000 hours worked in which case there will be 50000 exposure units hours worked is the measure of exposure in washington in some states for some types of employment pr emium rates are charged on per capita basis using the example above the same employer with 25 employees will have 25 exposure units7 regardless as to measure of exposure premium rates are developed appropriately such that sufficient premium is developed to provide for th fundamental costs of in surance coverage in the example above rates of 350 per 100 pa yroll 070 per hour worked or 1400 per employee per year will each generate the same annual premium of 35000 experience rating and the experience rating modification in workers compensation insurance each employer pays premium rate based on type of work or services provided premium rates are publis hed by workers compensation classification of which there are hundreds nevertheless even with this level of detail in the rating system the premium rate for each classificatio n can only be viewed as an aver age rate for all employers with payroll in that classification relative to the published premium rate the actual claims experience of some employers will be greater while for others actua l claims experience will be lower the purpose of the experience rating plan is to forecast how individual employers will perform relative to the average employer in the cl assification the forecas t is based on what is conceptually very simple measurement each employers recent actual claim experience for prior years is measured against what would ve been expected based on the average for the employers classification the result of this measurement is the employers experience modification if an individua l employer has greater than av erage claim experience that employer is assigned an experience modifica tion greater than 1000 also known as debit modification if an individual employer has lower than average claim experience that employer is assigned an experience modification less th an 1000 also known as credit modification therefore workers compensation premium is equal to hours worked x premium rate per hour x experience modification 7 in washington other exposure bases are used for certain specific workers compensation employee classifications for classifications 540 541 550 and 551 rates are expressed as cost of per square foot of wallboard installed similar examples exist in other states oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 7 guaranteed cost policies guaranteed cost policy is the insurance policy with which individuals are most familiar predetermined premium is paid at policy incepti on or as installments acr oss period of time the premium is fixed8 and final regardless as to what the employers actual loss experience may turn out to be premium is determined as described previously hours worked x premium rate per hour x experience modification guaranteed cost premium is said to be prospective in the sense that premium rates and the employers experience modification are used to forecast what the employers future loss experience will be this forecast is the basis for the guaranteed cost premium guaranteed cost premium paid by any single employer may or may not be sufficient to fund the cost of insurance provided to that specific employe r some employers even afte r experience rating will generate losses much greater than their premium payment while other employers will generate losses much smaller than their premium payment on average across large number of employers guaranteed cost premium is expected to be suffi cient to provide for benefit payments expenses and profit9 guaranteed cost policies and washington workers compensation premium rates in washingt on provide for the cost of wage replacement benefits medical benefits claim and other administrative expenses premium rates in washington do not provide for profit in the true sense of the word however they do include an offset for expected investment income that will be earned on premium collections until losses and expenses are actually paid10 this offset is actually reduction to premium rates in washington guaranteed cost premium is calculated exactly as described above and represents the premium charged to nonretro employers guaranteed cost premium is generally known as standard premium in washington the rm standard premium will be used from this point forward 8 in actuality final premium is not determined until the actual exposure number of hours worked d uring the policy period is known this is usually not known until short time after the policy period ends 9 insurance companies use the law of large numbers the larger the group of employers insured under guaranteed cost program the greater the likelihood that actual results for the group will be as expected this is the principle that permits insurance companies to offer insurance to single employers who may r may not generate claim costs greater than their premium payments 10 in other jurisdictions insurance companies offset their profit provision for expected investment income in washington there is pro fit provision so employers receive the full be nefit from the investment income offset oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 8 retrospective rating in general retrospective premium standard premium for nonretro em ployers guaranteed cost policies is based on past claim experience for the employers specific workers compensation classification as well as the employers own past claim experience as in corporated into the employers experience modification as discussed above standard pr emium is forecast of expected future claim experience for specific employer and is fixed not withstanding audit adjustments to reflect actual hours worked during the polic period at policy inception rega rdless as to an individual employers actual loss experience premium for retrospective insu rance programs are determined primarily by an individual employers actual claim experience during the polic period unlike guaranteed cost policies where premium is known and fixed at the star t of policy period premium for retrospective insurance policies is not known until the final meas urement of actual claim experience the final measurement of actual claim xperience can be one year or many years after the end of the policy period the actual measuremen t is either specified in the po licy contract or is unspecified with the caveat that final measurement is made with the agreement of both the insured and the insurer11 the formula for the calculation of retr ospective premium is shown below ___ ___ actual loss tax retrospective basic limited x conversion x multiplier premium premium losses factor ___ ___ losses used in the above formula are labeled actual limited losses because an insured may elect to purchase per claim limit on losses that are used in the retrospective premium calculation actual limited losses means the sum of all losses capped at the selected per claim limit additionally the insured may elect to secure maximum limit on retrospective premium payable as well as minimum retrospective premiu m payable each of the terms above as well as the maximum and minimum limits on retrospe ctive premium payable is defined below maximum limit on retrospective premium payable retrospective premium is based on actual ss experience during the policy period an insured may elect to establish maximum lim it on retrospective premiu m payable to provide protection against unexpected claim experien ce maximum limits provide additional protection to the insured by limiti ng payments to the insurance co mpany as such there is fee for establishing maximum limit the fee is determined actuarially and is included in the basic premium 11 currently in washington there are three measurements of claim experience occurring 21 months 33 months and 45 months after program enrollment oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 9 minimum limit on retrospective premium payable retrospective premium is based on actual ss experience during the policy period an insured may elect to establish minimum limit on retrospective premium payable minimum limit guarantees the insurance company minimum premium regardless as to how low the insureds actual claim experience may be minimum limits are financial guaranty to the insurance company as such there is credit or premium reduction for establishing minimum limit the credit is determined actuar ially and is included in the basic premium per claim limit retrospective premium is based on actual ss experience during the policy period an insured may elect to establish maximum per claim limit on losses that are used in the retrospective premium calculati on for example if an insured establishes maximum per claim limit of 500000 and incurs 1250000 milli on claim during the policy period that claims contributes only 500000 the maximum lim it to the calculati on of retrospective premium per claim limits provide additiona l protection to the insured by limiting premium payments to the insurance company as such there is fee for per claim limitations the fee is determined actuarially and is included in the basic premium basic premium basic premium provides for the following insurance costs insurance company expenses insurance company profit including any ffset for expected investment income the actuarial cost of limit on retrospective premium payable the actuarial credit for minimu m retrospective premium payable the actuarial cost of limit on individual claims the cost of claim adjustment expenses associ ated with losses above individual claim or policy maximum limits actual limited losses actual loss experience during the policy period adjusted to reflect the limit on individual claims as applicable loss conversion factor lcf the lcf is typically number greater than one and provides for the cost of claim adjustment expenses this expense is provided for as multiplicative factor against losses because there is presumption that claim adjust ment expenses will vary directly with loss volume that is the greater the loss volume the greater the charge for claim adjustment expenses and vice versa tax multiplier the tax multiplier provides for premium taxes and assessments oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 10 the formula for retrospective premium provides for the fundamental costs of insurance coverage as follows losses are provided for as follows actual limited losses the charge for per claim limits in basic premium the charge for maximum pr emium in basic premium the credit for minimum premium in basic premium claims adjustment expenses are provided for as follows loss conversion factor basic premium insurance company expenses are provided for as follows basic premium insurance company profit is provided for as follows basic premium variations in most jurisdictions wide va riety of programs are available typical program variations include incurred versus paid loss programs in incurred loss programs the re trospective premium is determined based on incurred losses which are paid loss plus case reserves for paid loss programs retrospective premium is determined based on paid loss only in both pa id and incurred loss programs adjustments may extend out many years however any agreement on final adjustments in paid loss program do include provision for case reserves per claim limits typically wide variety of limits are av ailable ranging from 10000 to 5000000 or more minimum and maximum premium payable typically wide variety of limits are available oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 11 variation in expense provisions insurance companies will negotiate an almost in finite variety of program s based on variations on how expenses and insurance charges in the basic premium are collected typical variants include shifting portion of the expense component of basic prem ium into the lcf in this situation the basic premium is reduced and the lcf is increased such that if the employer generates expected claim experience the insurer will collect the shortfall in the basic premium through the lcf this is shown in very simple example that follows typical retrospective premium basic premium 25000 expected losses 50000 lcf 110 converted losses 55000 50000 x 110 retrospective premium 80000 25000 55000 reduced basic retrospective premium basic premium 10000 expected losses 50000 lcf 140 converted losses 70000 50000 x 140 retrospective premium 80000 10000 70000 examples showing actual losses at various levels typical reduced basic retrospective retrospective actual losses premium premium 50000 80000 80000 25000 50000 x 110 10000 50000 x 140 20000 47000 38000 25000 20000 x 110 10000 20000 x 140 80000 113000 122000 25000 80000 x 110 10000 80000 x 140 shifting expense costs from the basic premiu m to the lcf provides an opportunity for an employer to significantly reduce costs an em ployer in reduced basic program would pay much lower premium than with typical program if claim experience is significantly lower than expected however if this same employer d significantly greater than expected claim experience it would pay much larger premium in reduced basic program than with typical program oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 12 in some instances there is basic premium with all expenses and actuarial charges as well as claim administrative expenses included in the lcf in this extreme case if an employer were to have losses premium would be zero12 this illustration is im portant in the sense th at it serves as the basis for understanding the differences between the various retrospective plan s that are available in washington these are discussed in the following section 12 these programs are generally reserved only for large employers where the likelihood of claims is essentially zero nevertheless large employer participating in th is type of program can significantly reduce the expense portion of retrospective premium by realiz ing less than expected loss experience oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 13 retrospective rating in washington state available plans there are currently five retrospective plans ava ilable in washington a1 a2 a3 and b each is described below note that plan b even though offered in single set of tables is essentially two separate plans one for sm aller employers with relatively low maximum premiums and one for larger employers with re latively high maximum premiums as such plan b is described separately for each circumstance additionally note that each plan reflects single 500000 per claim limit per claim limits ot her than 500000 are not currently offered in washington plan basic premium tabular value that decr eases with selected maximum premium

large employer with oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 14 significantly lower loss experience than expected will tend13 to pay the lowest premium under plan b while the same employer with significantly greater than expected loss experience will tend to pay the highest pr emium under plan b determining retrospective premium the general formula for the calculation of retrospective premium is shown below ___ ___ actual loss tax retrospective basic limited x conversion x multiplier premium premium losses factor ___ ___ the formula for the calculation of retros pective premium in washington follows actual loss loss performance retrospective basic limited x conversion x dev x adjustment premium premium losses factor factor factor this formula is slightly different than the gene ral formula presented above the components of this formula as well as the differences from the general formula are discussed and explained below it is important to note that while the loss development factor and the performance adjustment factor are independent quantities th at are derived and calcu lated separately in practice they are combined into si ngle number for presentation purposes basic premium basic premium serves similar role in washington as in the general formula with some differences in washington ba sic premium provides for administrative and other program expenses which are generally lower than they would be in typical retrospective rating programs there is profit and the impact of i nvestment income is included in the lcf the actuarial cost of maximum li mit on retrospective premium payable the actuarial credit for minimu m retrospective premium payable the actuarial cost of the 500000 limit on individual claims actual limited losses actual loss experience during the policy pe riod adjusted to reflect the 500000 limit on individual claims this is the same as the general formula loss conversion factor lcf in washington the lcf provides for the cost of claim adjustment expenses as well as the impact of investment income to account for in vestment income that could be earned during the period between the time li collects premium and the time that losses are actually paid 13 the impact will vary depending on the maximum premium election oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 15 loss development factor actual limited losses are developed to reflect the expectation that limited losses will increase over time as claims mature loss developm ent is expected in the insurance industry especially with workers compensation claims in other jurisdictions loss development factors may be applied as part of the retrospective premium calc ulation or they may only be considered when the insured and the insure r are negotiating final adjustment in washington loss development factors are app lied as part of the retrospective premium calculation performance adjustment factor paf the paf is unique to washington washi ngton regulation wac 296 1790402 requires that retro employers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium this is equivalent to requiring that retro employers and non retro employers have the same ratio of incurred losses to premium li th erefore requires that the overall loss ratio for non retro employers to equal the overall loss ratio for retro employers li implements this requirement by adjusting the overall premium required from retro employers until this condition is met the adjustment is made th rough modification to actual limited losses in every employers retrospective premium calcu lation the modification is made through application of the paf which is initially set at 1000 the paf is either increased above or decreased below 1000 until the required retrospective premium is generated 14 tax multiplier there are premium tax charges in washington 14 description of the actual process may be simplified as two basic steps step one the ratio of incurred actual unlimited losses to standard premium for nonretro employers is compared to the ratio of incurred actual unlimited losse s to standard premium for retro employers standard premium for retro employers is reduced until the loss ratio for both groups are equal the amount by which standard premium for retro employers is reduced is the aggregate retrospective refund the difference is termed refund because the initial premium paid by retro em ployers is equal to their standard premium step two the retrospective premium for every retro empl oyer is calculated using the formula in the text with starting paf of 100 this is the formula retrospecti ve premium the paf is adjusted until the difference between standard premium for retro employers and the formula retrospective premium equals the aggregate retrospective refund determined in step one step one may be viewed as the process used to determine the required aggregate retrospective refund step two may be viewed as the process by which this refund is distributed to individual employers the actual process requires adjustments for investmen t income and rate level c hanges however the basic algorithm is as described above oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 16 retrospective premium adjustments and refunds retro employers are initially charged standard premium15 retrospective premium is calculated using the formula described in the prior secti on at three points in time 21 33 and 45 months following enrollment these points in time are generally referred to as adjustments at the first adjustment the calculated formula retrospective premium is compared to the initial standard premium charged if the formula retrospective premium is greater than standard premium additional premium is paid if the formula retros pective premium is less than standard premium premium is refunded to the employer the pr ocess is repeated at the two subsequent adjustments except comparisons are made to standard premium net of any prior premium surcharges or refunds the first adjustment has generally resulted in pr emium refunds to retro employers because first retro employers generally have less than average loss experience and second the manner by which premium rates are estab lished in washington this latter issue is material and is discussed separately for th medical aid component and the accident fund component of premium rates the medical aid component of premium rates is tablished in manner that is expected to be adequate for all employers retro and nonretro co mbined in the state therefore prior to experience rating there is an exp ectation that medical aid portion of rates will be higher than necessary for retro employers given that retr employers have lower than average claim experience experience rating mitigates but does not eliminate this issue the accident fund component of pr emium rates is established in manner that is adequate for nonretro employers nonretro employers ge nerally have claim expe rience that is higher than average but significantly higher than retro employers as such the accident fund component of rates will be materially higher th an necessary for retro employers experience rating mitigates but does not eliminate this issue the second and third adjustments are less likely to produce refunds than the first adjustment regardless retro employers can expect in the aggregate net premium refunds after the final adjustment at 45 months following enrollment16 15 hours worked x premium rate per hour x experience modification 16 under wac 2961790428 retro groups forfeit their eligibility if they are required to pay additional premium for three consecutive coverage periods oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 17 the unique nature of the process in washington washington regulation wac 296 1790402 and its requirement th at retro employers and non retro employers fund the same percentage of losse s from premium is unique and serves as the basis for the existence of the paf however this requirement is more than technical adjustment to the general retrospective premium formula rather the requirement established by wac 2961790402 defines the method by which the ov erall dollar value of the retrospective refund in washington is calculated the retrospective formula used in washington and the paf is simply vehicle by which the overall dol lar amount of the retrosp ective refund which is determined by matching retro ex perience to nonretro experience is distributed to individual employers this is different than in any other ju risdiction in all ot her jurisdictions the retrospective formula is stand alone calculation that determines the retrospective premium due from an individual employer independent of any other employers experience this is not the case in washington in washingt on the total retrosp ective premium due and therefore the total retrospective refund is determined by comparing xperience of all retro employers combined to the experience of all nonretro employers combined in this sense the premium requirements and experience of all employers in the state are inextricably linked given this situation it is entirely possible for retro employers as group to have identical loss ratios in two consecutive years but have completely different refunds for example if retro employers as group have loss ratios of 095 in 2011 and 2012 but nonretro employers as group have loss ratios of 095 in 2011 and 120 in 2012 retro employers as group will realize significantly larger refund in 2012 than in 2011 even though their loss ratios we re identical in both those years oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 18 reexamination of goals the primary purpose of the review is to provide an independent analysis as well as recommendations regarding the adequacy and reasonableness of retrospective rating adjustments and how retrospective rating adjust ments impact equity among retro employers and between retro and nonretro employers given the information presented in the prior section it is apparent that the system in washington poses very specific challenges as respects equity in particular we note that the paf and underlying methodology is lis re sponse to the requir ement established by wac 2961790402 that retro employers and nonre tro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium any issues rega rding the methodology and data underlying the calculation and application of the paf will potentially impact equity between retro employers and nonretro employers as well as between retro employers themselves as such this report has examined data process an d application as applie d to use of the paf workers compensation rates in washington are the sum of the medical aid component and the accident fund component17 the medical aid component pr ovides for the cost of medical treatment while the accident f und component provides for the cost of wage replacement benefits this is the case in all jurisdic tions as respects workers compensation rates however washington is unique in that there is regulatory standard that employees fund one half the medical aid compone nt of workers compensation rate s this requirement raises questions as to the equity of retrospectiv premium calculations which presume employers have funded 100 of the medical aid component the situation is further complicated by the fact that some employers do fund 100 of the medical aid component this report addresses questions raised by this situation washington like other jurisdictions has numbe r of programs in place to mitigate the cost of workers compensation claims to employers in particular washington has kept on salary program18 and claim free discount program19 this report addres ses how if at all these programs impact equity between retr employers and nonretro employers and among retro employers 17 there is also component for supplemental pension benefits cost of living adjustments that is constant acro ss all rate classes this provision is currently 836 cent s hour worked like medical aid employees fund half of this component 18 the kept on salary program allows employers to continue to pay wages of injured employees rather than seeking wage replacement benefits from the workers compensation system in certain circumstances this can result in substantial savings to the employer by allowing the employer to maintain claim free discount as well as avoiding the impact of lost time wage replacement claim on the employers experience modification 19 the claim free discount program provides discount to employers who have lost time or disability claims during their experience rating period oliver wyman actuarial

claims administrator and are based on information available to the administrator at the time the reserve is either established or adjusted standards and prot ocols exist regarding case reserving but judgment and experience play significant role the principal question is whether there is difference in case reserve levels on average between retro employers nd nonretro employers and if so does this difference impact equity between the two groups 21 loss development factors provide for the expected growth to claim costs over time growth occurs due to newly reported claims as well as increases to reported costs on claims already reported to li loss development is an expected phenomenon common to most types of casualty insurance lines the principal question is the accuracy and appropriateness of ss development factors used in the re trospective premium calculations oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 20 executive summary key findings 1 retro employers generally have better than ex pected claim experience relative to non retro employers by industry group 2 the current methodology used to ensure that retro employe rs and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from prem ium as required by wac 2961790402 is reasonable and equitable and is independent of concerns regarding the application of the paf within the group of retroemployers as well as the number of retro adjustments 3 it is reasonable to conclude that the expe rience of retro employers act to decrease the average rate for individual classifications 4 the number of retrospective rating adjustments should be increased 5 the application of the po licy adjustment fa ctor paf should be changed 6 while the medical aid po rtion of the refund appe ars to be appropriate in aggregate the method for distributing it to employers should be revised 7 the procedure for allocating occupational di sease losses is not equitable and must be revised 8 li in the process of preparing data fo r oliver wyman has identified and corrected several important data issues oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 21 principal observations program integrity 1 retro employers generally have better than ex pected claim experience relative to non retro employers by industry group22 retro employers generate lower losses per hour than nonretro employers in all industry groups except h l n and r b retro employers generate lower loss ratio s relative to standard premium than nonretro employers in all industry groups except r c retro employers generate wer experience rating modifications than nonretro employers in all industry groups exce pt h j and r d retro employers generally have greater average claim frequencies measured per 1000 hours worked than nonretro employers ho wever claims for retro employers tend to close faster and have lower average co sts than nonretro employers additionally retro employers with lower than expected claim experience pay lower premium charges and retro em ployers with greater than ex pected claim experience pay higher premium charges relative to retr employer with average claim experience while there are concerns re garding the equity of premium charges among retro employers as well as between retro employers and nonretro employer s

ployers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium as required by wac 2961790402 is reasonable and equitable and is independent of concerns regarding the application of the paf within the group of retroempl oyers as well as the number of retro adjustments addressed later in this section the current methodol ogy utilizes rolling average technique that generates results that are credible and stable b the current methodology ap propriately adjusts data generated at different times for changes in rate level as well as for the impact of investment income on funds held by li c there appears to be need to increase the number of adju stments to retrospective premium beyond the current final adjustme nt of 45 months after enrollme nt this issue is discussed later in this section howe ver the methodology used to meet the requirements of wac 2961790402 is independent of the number of adjustments to retrospective premium the same methodology can be used for additional adjustments d there is concern regarding the applicatio n of the paf and the impact on equity between retro employers this issue is discussed in the following paragraph however the methodology used to meet the requireme nts of wac 2961790402 establishes the benchmark premium refund in the aggregate to retro employers and is independent of how the paf is applied application of the paf addresses how to distribute the benchmark premium refund to retro employers and is therefore separate issue 3 the current methodology used to apply the paf creates bias for or against specific employers depending on plan selected actual loss experi ence and program availability the current methodology applie s the paf only to the actual limited loss component of retrospective premium it does not apply the paf to the ba sic premium component as such the current methodology leverages the im pact of the paf on employers who select programs with small or ab sent basic premium component if the paf is greater than 100023 employers in plans with littl or basic premium will receive less than their fair share of the aggregate retrospective refund while employers in plans with larger basic premium charges will receiv more than their fair share if the paf is less than 1000 employer s in plans with little or basic premium will receive more than their fair share of the aggregat retrospective refund while em ployers in plan s with larger basic premium charges will receiv less than their fair share 23 historically pafs have ranged from 0600 to 1100 although they have been below 1000 prior to the last few years the very low pafs in the early 2000s were direct result of low rate levels and therefore high loss ratios during this period of time more recently rate levels have increased in part due to significantly reduced investment income with higher rate level and lower loss ratios pafs ve increased significantly oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 23 b the retrospective premium formula is shown below and clearly demonstrates that basic premium is not impacted by the paf actual loss loss performance24 retrospective basic limited x conversion x dev x adjustment premium premium losses factor factor factor c the formula for retr ospective premium is designed to be adequate after consideration of all components this is easily understood after considering how expense and actuarial charges are shifted from basic premium to the lcf to cr eate different plans the current approach treats employers who elect plans with higher basic premium differently than employers who elect plans with smaller or basic premium this is not justifia ble from an actuarial perspective nor does there appear to be any other reasonable explanation our understanding is this approach was taken to simplify computer code designed decades ago d the equalization of nonretro employer ss ratios and retro employer loss ratios as required by wac 2961790402 is based on the combined losses and total premium of all employers in the nonretro program and the combined losses and total premium basic premium and loss based premium of all employers in the retro program therefore the paf methodology which distributes the impact of the equalization process to individual retro employers should impact all retrospe ctive premium component s equally clearly it does not simple adjustment to the retrospective pr emium formula will address this issue as shown below _____ _____ actual loss loss performance retrospective basic limited x conversion x dev x adjustment premium premium losses factor factor factor _____ ____ 4 the current number of adjustments to retr ospective premium is not sufficient to capture differences in loss development between retro employers and nonretro employers additionally it is likely that there are significant differences in loss development between employers in the retro spective program that are not captured by the current number of adjustments there are currently three adjustments occurring at 21 33 an d 45 months following enrollment data indicates th at loss development beyond the third adjustment for retro employers is materially different from loss development for nonretro employers therefore increasing the number of adjust ments will impact and in crease equity between retro employers and nonretro employers 24 the loss development factor and the performance adjustment factor are independent quantities that are derived and calculated separately however as mentione d earlier in practice they are combined into single number for the purpose of presentation oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 24 b insurance industry data and studies cond ucted in other states demonstrate that loss development varies materially by hazard for worker s compensation exposure s even after 45 months as such there is an expectation that im plementing additional adjustments will impact and increase equity between retro employers c consideration should be given to implementing additional adjustments at 57 months and 69 months following enrollment increasing th number of adjustments can be expected to improve equity between retro employers and nonretro employers and between employers within the retrospective program d consideration should be given to using di fferent loss development factors for retro experience and nonretro experience during th process of equalization of nonretro employer loss ratios and retro employer loss ratios as requir ed by wac 2961790402 the current procedure assumes identical loss development for both groups at the time of each adjustment this procedure if dopted would improve equity between retro employers and nonretro employers however it would have impact on the equity between retro employers as such this proc edure must be considered complement to increasing the number of adjustment s not an alternative 5 the claim free discount rating sy stem is actuarially fair data demonstrates that th claim free discount cfd ratin g system rewards employers with lower than average loss ratios and complement s the experience rating system for both retro employers and nonretro employers b the tables above display by year individual ly for retro employers

industries august 2009 page 25 discount it is clear that em ployers entitled to the claim free discount have significantly lower loss ratios than those who ar not additionally applicat ion of the discount increases the loss ratios of employers entitled to the discount to level cl oser to that of employers not entitled to the discount c examination of claim free discount detail by industry group and group size generally demonstrates the same level of equity for the majority but not all industry groups and group sizes however significantly greater va riation is expected as statewide data is partitioned into smaller categories 6 analysis of nonhearing permanent part ial disability ppd claim frequency demonstrated that for the period under examination 2003 through 2007 there were discernable differences between claim fr equency trends for retro employers and nonretro employers the analysis was co nducted by size of employer and while relativities varied by size of employer with in each size group the relativities were approximately constant overtime after consid eration of sample size similar results were found to be true for permanent tota l disability claim frequency as well 7 kept on salary claims for employees kept on salary are not consistently reported to li at times l i is not informed that an employee has be kept on salary unle ss they are converted to lost time accident fund workers compen sation case the only information available to oliver wyman for analysis regarded lost time claims where empl oyees had been kept on salary are those that had been reported to and recorded by li there is information available on what portion of cl aims where employees had been kept on salary are ultimately closed w ithout becoming lost time claims or what portion of these claims are currently open but have not yet been closed or converted25 b available data on converted claims demonstr ates that over 95 of converted claims are converted during the retrospective rating period additionally data does not show discernable difference in observed conversi on rates by claim maturity between retro employers and nonretro employers in fact data for claims converted after the last retrospective rating adjustme nt suggests that conversion is delayed for greater percentage of claims from nonretro employers rather than retro employers as such data does not support the assertions that retro employers will intentionally keep employees on salary and delay conversion until after the final retrospective rating adjustment so as to avoid incurring the cost of converted claim during the retrospective rating period the implication is that obser ved differences in loss development between retro employers and nonretro employers is du to phenomena unrelated to the kept on salary program 25 for purposes of this discussion converted kept on salary claim is kept on salary claim that evolved into lost time claim additionally as respects reporting the following is of note the claim would have been originally reported to li as having medical losses only and the claim would have been subsequently identified as claim that had been kept on salary when it became lost time claim oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 26 data issues impacting equity 8 portion of the loss experience for nonret ro employers was double counted for one quarter per year annually extending back to the early 1990s this artificially increased the loss ratio for nonretro employers and led to artificially high retrospective premium refunds the impact was to overstate the loss ratio for nonretro employers due to double counting losses in the loss to premium ratio b as result the loss ratio for retro employers was increased to match the overstated loss ratio for nonretro employers during the process of ensuri ng that retro employers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium as required by wac 2961790402 c the loss ratio for retro employers was increased by reducing pr emium in the loss to premium ratio d retrospective premium is redu ced by increasing the retrospe ctive refunds the result was an increase to retrospective refunds that was not warranted corrections were made promptly by li following the discovery of this error by li staff f the overall impact of this issu is material the correction of this issue may potentially reduce the average retrospectiv refund by approximately 10 according to li g while the error goes back to the 1990s only those periods that have not had third adjustment are affected by th correction of this error h it is important to note that th is error originated with design and comp uter coding of the retrospective rating program in wo rk done almost twenty years ago 9 premiums from horse racing and other classi fications were inadvertently included with experience used during the process of ensuring that retro employers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of sses from premium as required by wac 2961790402 all experience from these cla ssifications should be excluded from calculations during this process the impact of including the premium from horse racing and ot her classifications in the loss to premium ratio wa s to understate the loss ra tio for nonretro employers b as result the loss ratio for retro empl oyers was decreased to match the understated loss ratio for nonretro employers c the loss ratio for retro employers was decreased by increasing retrospective premium in the loss to premium ratio oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 27 d retrospective premium is increased by decr easing the retrospective refunds the result was decrease to retrospective refunds that was not warranted corrections were made prompt ly by li following the discover of this error by li staff f the overall impact of this issue was not material because the corrections by li were made before the accumulation of significant premium impact 10 there was an error in the process of calc ulating retrospective refunds during the period when medical aid premium was suspen ded during the latter half of 2007 the intent was to provide retrosp ective refunds to retro employ ers as if the rate holiday did not occur to balance this benefit to retro employers comparable dividend was issued to nonretro employers an error du ring this process resulted in understated retrospective refunds we note that while the first retro adjus tments for some retro employers were impacted by this issue corrections were made promptly by li following identification of the error by l i staff subsequent adjustments for retro employers affected by the error will reflect the corrections implemented by li therefore there will be effect on the final refunds issued to any participant occupational disease issues impacting equity 11 overstated occupational dise ase loss experience was charge d to nonretro employers during the process of ensuring that retro employers and nonretr employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium as required by wac 2961790402 this artificially increased the loss ratio for nonret ro employers and led to artificially high retrospective premium refunds occupational disease losses may be partitioned into four segments an amount chargeable directly to retro employers b an amount chargeable directly to nonretro employers c the nonchargeable portion of claims wh ere portion of the loss may be attributable to either retro employers or nonretro employers26 d the total cost of claims that cannot be attributed to any employer27 ideally only would be charged to retro employers and only b would be charged to nonretro employers during the process of ensuring that retro employers and nonretro 26 it is possible that the portion of the cost of an occupational disease claim may be attr ibuted to an individual employer and the remaining portion is nonchargeable portions of claims may be deemed nonchargea ble because the employee previously worked for selfinsu red employer or because exposure to the underlying hazard began prior to the earliest open retrospective rating period 27 this represents the cost of claims where portion of the cost may be charged to single empl oyer oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 28 employers fund the same percentage of sses from premium as required by wac 296 1790402 programming in li data systems as signed to retro employers excluded d from the calculation but assigned occupational diseas loss experience from b and c to nonretro employers c should have been excluded as well this occurred because programming used to manage occupational disease data was designed and implemented decades ago when occupational disease losses were an immaterial component of overall loss experi ence occupational di sease losses currently represent significant portion of overall ss experience and the older programming code is longer appropriate b the impact was to materia lly overstate the loss ratio for nonretro employers by including portion of nonchargeable occupational diseas losses with nonretro employer loss experience c as result the loss ratio for retro employers was increased to match the overstated loss ratio for nonretro employers d the loss ratio for retro employers was increased by decreasing retrospective premium in the loss to premium ratio retrospective premium is decreased by increasing the retrospective refunds the result was material increase to re trospective refunds that was not warranted correcting this issue may potentially reduce the average re trospective refund by approximately 20 according to li f it is important to note that the programming deficiencies that created this issue originated with the original design and computer codi ng of the retrospective rating program decades ago medical aid premium 12 the treatment of medical aid premium and sses in the calculatio n of retrospective refunds may result in retrospective premium th at is either too high or too low for individual employers in th is respect the mann er by which retrospective premium and therefore retrospective refun ds are currently calculated are actuarially unsound however given the complexity of the issue and the variety of reasonable perspectives on the issue it likely is not po ssible to address the issue in manner that addresses all actuarial issues unless all employers fund 100 of medical aid premium the current process of determining the to tal aggregate retrospect ive refund to retro employers that is balancing loss ratios between nonretro employers and retro employers as required by wac 2961790402 incorporates all premium and loss dollars in the calculation of the loss ratio fo r retro employers regardless as to whether medical aid oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 29 premium was funded by employers or employees28 while the current process of determining the total ag gregate refund can be viewed as appropriate the current process of distributing the total aggregate refund to individual retro employers is not appropriate it is our opinion that the process does result in fair distribution of costs between retro employers and nonretro employers but it does not result in fair distribution of refunds to retro employers the current process of distributing the total aggregate refund to individual retro employers presumes that employers fund 100 of standa rd premium and are resp onsible for 100 of losses in theory employe fund 50 of medical aid premium and are therefore responsible for 50 of medical aid losses th current process could potentially result in overstated refunds overstated surcharges situations in the extrem where an employer might receive retrospective refund greater than the employer tion of standard premium b there are numerous factors that interact to create an extraordin arily comple x issue as respects this issue these factors are related to the determination of statewide rate level application of the experience rating plan the vari ation in medical aid costs by classification the cost of loss prevention and loss control balancing the expe rience of retro and nonretro employers as required by wac 2961790402 and individual employer behavior as respects actual funding of medical aid premium accident fund rates are at materially hi gher level than medical aid fund rates see discussion at end of background section as such accident fund rates are the primary driver of retrospective refunds the medical aid portion of overall rate s varies significantly by classification experience modifications impact both medical aid premium and accident fund premium after application of experience rating and consideration of average rate level medical aid premium is significantly clos er to required levels for retro employers than accident fund rate level which would be measurably greater than required the employer funds the cost of loss cont rol and loss prevention which result in lower experience modifications which benefit employees both in terms of reduced medical aid premium payments as well as the reduced likelihood of serious disabling accident employers assume all risk associated with participation in the retrospective program portion of employers in washingt on fund 100 of medical aid premium 28 there are other interpretations where arguments could be m ade that some or all of medical aid experience should be removed from the process of determining the total aggregat retrospective refund to retro employers we are not suggesting that these interpretations be adopted by li oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 30 actuarial tables and plan variety 13 the current actuarial tables in washington for all retrospective plans are over twenty years old and do not reflect changes in work ers compensation claims and exposure that have occurred over the past

august 2009 page 32 4 we recommend that the number of adjustments to retrosp ective premium be increased to minimum of four adjustments at 21 33 45 and 57 months after enrollment but more preferably to five adjustments including final adjustment at 69 months we also recommend that li monitor loss development between retro employers and non retro employers to at least 120 months 5 there are general concerns or recommenda tions regarding the claim free discount rating system it is actuarially fair 6 there are general concerns or recommendations regarding the kept on salary program itself however we do recommend that li begin tracking all kept on salary claims both before and after conversion and compiled detailed information data base on all claims data issues impacting equity 7 li has addressed the issue regarding the double counting of loss experience for non retro employers 8 li has addressed the issue regarding p remiums from horse racing and other classification experience 9 li has addressed the issue regarding th error in the process of calculating retrospective refunds during the period when medical aid premium was suspended during the latter half of 2007 occupational disease issues impacting equity 10 we recommend that the issue regarding occupa tional disease data be addressed there are likely number of different ways that this can be done in an equitable manner that does not distort the process of ensuring th at retro employers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from pr emium as required by wac 2961790402 two relatively straightforward thods that yield similar results are presented below to assist the reader the mann er in which occupational dise ase losses are partitioned is repeated below an amount chargeable directly to retro

total cost of claims that cannot be attributed to any employer oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 33 li assigned to retro employers but incorrectly assigned b and c to non retro employers two equally appropriate approaches are approach 1 assign to retro employers assign b to nonretro employers excluded c and d from the calculation approach 2 assign to retro employers assign b to nonretro employers distribute the sum of cd to retro and nonretro employers in the same proportion that each group s chargeable losses bears to total chargeable losses this is shown as follows c d x b is allocated to retro employers c d x b b is allocated to nonretro employers approach 1 has the advantage of only using data that can be clearly assi gned to either retro employers or nonretro employers while approach 2 has the advantage of giving occupational disease claims more approp riate weight in the overall calculation medical aid premium 11 we do not recommend that li change the current methodology used to determine the total aggregate retrospective premium refu nd however we do recommend that li change the method by which th overall retrospective refund is distributed to individual employers the method should be adjusted to more actuarially appropriate approach suggested approaches are discussed in the foll owing section of the rep ort however given the complexities of the situation concerning dical aid any new method is likely to have deficiencies the ultimate goal should be to reduce the defici encies to as low level as possible and distribute premium requirement s as equitably as possible between retro employers oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 34 actuarial tables and plan variety 12 we recommend that the actuarial tables be updated and reworked to reflect current exposure hazard claim frequenc and claim costs specifically tables must reflect the current probability distribution of losses and claim frequency in order to account for at least the following changes that have occur red since the current tables were first designed impact of medical inflation on claim costs impact of changing medical technology impact of shifting hazard across industry groups impact of aging population impact of decreasing claim frequency impact of shift in mix of claims by type impact of changes and improvement s to loss mitigation procedures impact of changes and improvement s to loss prevention procedures the following should be considere d during redesign and updates tables should be constructed to reflect variation of hazard by classification tables should be constructed to refl ect larger variety of per claim limits tables should be constructed to reflect larger variety of minimum premiums tables should be constructed to reflect larger variety of maximum premiums this recommendation if ad opted will require very rge number of work hours and time to implement data acqu isition and analysis must be th orough and complete it is therefore important that the re sulting actuarial work products be designed in manner such that key components can be easily upda ted annually this will avoid the need to update the entire tabu lar system annually whi ch is not feasible but will main tain the overall integrity and accuracy of the redesign ed tables for an exte nded period of time oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 35 discussion and analysis equity of retro employer versus nonretro employer introduction the following items were identified in this study as impacting equity between retro employers and nonretro employers treatment of occupational disease data issue regarding double counting of nonretro employer experience issue regarding premiums from horse racing and other classifications issue regarding error in the proc ess of calculating retrospective refunds during period when medical aid premium collection was suspended number of retrospective rating adjustments kept on salary program the latter two items are discussed separately later in this secti on detailed discussions of the other items follow treatment of occupational disease data occupational disease losses are charged to individual employers based on set of rules in place in washington the rules termine what portion of an occupational disease claim may be charged to specific employer these dete rminations depend on the employ ees work life service for the current employer and service for prior employers as well as the nature of the insurance program for prior employers as suc h losses due to occupational disease cl aims may be partiti oned into four general segments an amount chargeable directly to retro employers b an amount chargeable directly to nonretro employers c the nonchargeable portion of claims wh ere portion of the loss may be attributable to either retro employers or nonretro employers30 d the total cost of claims th at cannot be attributed to any employer31 30 it is possible that the portion of the cost of an occupational disease claim may be attr ibuted to an individual employer and the remaining portion is nonchargeable 31 this represents the cost of claims where portion of the cost may be charged to single empl oyer oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 36 the following diagram displays the distributi on of occupational disease losses for 2003 through 2007 by segment the chart shows the distribu tion by segment as follows the amount chargeable di rectly to retro employers 1160 million b an amount chargeable directly to nonretro employers 1537 million c the nonchargeable portion of claims where tion of the loss may be at tributable to either retro employers or nonretro empl oyers coded as 6750000 in data 1120 million d the total cost of claims that cannot be attributed to any employer 1357 million as result there is total of 2477 million of non chargeable losses du ring the process of ensuring that retro employers and nonretro employe rs fund the same percentage of losses from premium as required by wac 2961790402 there are two approaches of treating the non chargeable losses both of which will result in similar equitable results all occupational disease claims 5 years experience 2003 2007 1120m 216 1537m 297 1160m 224 1357m 262 charged to retro groups charged to non retro groups 6750000 not charged oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 37 approach 1 eliminate nonchargeab dollars in their entirety 1160 million would be charged to retro employers b 1537 million would be charged to nonretro employers c plus d 2477 1120 1357 million would be removed from the calculation approach 2 distribute nonchar geable dollars to retro employ ers and nonretro employers in the same proportion that each groups charge able losses bear to total chargeable losses 1160 million or 43 of to tal chargeable dollars are charged to retro employers b 1537 million or 57 of tota l chargeable dollars are charged to nonretro employers c plus d 2477 1120 1357 million are total nonchargeable dollars then 1065 million or 43 of total non chargeable dollars 2477 million would be allocated to retro employers then 1412 million or 57 of total non chargeable dollars 2477 million would be allocated to nonretro employers during the process of ensuring that retro em ployers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium as re quired by wac 2961790402 programming in li data systems assigned to retro employers excluded d from the calculation but assigned occupational disease loss experience from b and c to nonretro employers c should have been excluded as well or c and d should have been included and distribute d proportionately as described above this occurred because programming used to mana ge occupational disease data was designed and implemented decades ago when occupational dis ease losses were an imma terial component of overall loss experience occupational disease sses currently represent significant portion of overall loss experience and the older pr ogramming code is longer appropriate the impact was to materially overstate the loss ra tio for nonretro employers by including portion of nonchargeable occupational disease losses wi th nonretro employer loss experience the magnitude of the overstatement is illustrated by co mparing what the allocati on should have been if all nonchargeable losses were excl uded versus what was actually done retro nonretro correct allocation excluding all nonchargeable losses in millions 1160 1537 actual allocation in millions 1160 2657 oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 38 as result the loss ratio for retro employers was increased to match the overstated loss ratio for nonretro employers the loss ratio for retr employers was increased by decreasing retrospective premium in the loss to premium ratio that is by increasing the retrospective premium refunds the impact of this issue wa s material correcting for it may potentially reduce the average retrospective refund by approximately 20 according to li double counting of nonretro employer experience in the process of responding to and reconciling specific data requests issued by oliver wyman li discovered an error that had been embedded and masked in obscure computer code written many years ago at least to the early 1990s the error involved the double counting of accident fund losses paid on open claims fo r the first quarter of nonretro employer ss experience as result nonretro employer losses ve been materially overstated for period of approximately fifteen years li estimated that since 2000 over 400000000 of losses for nonretro employers was double counted the impact was to materially overstate nonretro employer loss ratios during this period of time as result during the process of ensuring that retro employers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium as required by wac 2961790402 loss ratios for retroemployers were in creased to match the artificially high loss ratio for nonretro employers loss ratios for retro employers were increased by decreasing premium in the retro employer loss to premium ratio premium was decreased by increasing retrospective premium refund l i estimated that retrospective refunds were overstated between 10 and 15 we understand that enrollment periods that have already gone through the third adjustment prior to the correction being made were not affected retr participants were not asked to return any of the funds that had been paid to them however for those enro llment periods that had not had their final adjustment correcti ons will flow through the system at the time of their next adjustment premiums from horse racing and other classifications classifications associated with horse rating are not part of the retrospective rating system it is our understanding that for many years these premiu ms were reported di rectly to the horse racing commission and were not ente red into lis computer system this procedure changed in early 2004 and premium began to be reported however losses were still excluded to correct for this mismat ch the horse racing pr emium which totaled approximately 64 million was removed given that the premium in question was nonretr employer premium the correction increased the nonretro loss ratio the correction increased the target loss ratio for determining retrospective employer refunds therefore retrospective refunds increased slightly oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 39 error in retrospective refund calculation during rate holiday during the rate holiday in washington during the second half of 2007 medical aid premium was not collected from either employers or employees however retrospective refunds we re calculated as if the rate ho liday did not take place in effect participants were given refund of prem ium that they had not paid similar dividend was granted to employers who do not participate in retro in order to maintain the equity between the programs however an error occurred when hours worked we re lowered during the audi t process in this process the assumed medical premium was not removed rather the medical aid premium due upon deposit was added to the medical premium char ged at audit as result the resulting medical aid premium used in the calculati on of retrospective refunds was too high nonretro employers had more audits than retro employers as result the correction of this error reduced nonretro employer premium by 474 million and retro employer premium by 85 million given that significantly large amount of premium was removed from the non retro employer loss ratio calculation than that fo r retro employers nonretro employer loss ratios increased by larger amount than retro employer loss ra tios this resulted in net increase to retrospective employer premium refunds it should be noted that since this error was iden tified less than three ears after it occurred the correction will affect all retro employers oliver wyman actuarial

the kept on salary program is an optional program in washingt on in which employers elect to pay employees their regular salari even if they are unable to work due to workplace injury employers both retro and nonretro can benefit fr om this program as respects experience modifications avoiding lost time cases and ssociated wage replacement costs will reduce experience modifications all else being equal which results in wer overall premium charges additionally the kept on salary program will assi st employers in maintaining their claim free discount in situations where retro employers uti lize the program there is beneficial impact on the retrospective refund we note that several large retro groups require their pa rticipants to utilize kept on salary program in all situations the intent of the program is to motivate employers to retain portion of claim costs and therefore reduce overa ll system costs data on claims where employees are kept on salary is limited these claims are not consistently reported to li unless they are converted to lost time acc ident fund workers compensation case the only information available from li is on claims that have been converted there is information available on how many claims where employees are kept on salary are ultimately closed without conversion or what portion of claims are currently open but have not yet been closed or converted as such it is difficult to dr aw broad quantitative conclusions from the available data however data is available separately for re tro employers and nonretro employers showing the relationship between conversion and claim maturity for converted claims it has been suggested that retro employers will intenti onally keep employees on salary and delay conversion until after the final retrospective rating adjustment the motiv ation is to avoid incurri ng the cost of lost time claim during the retrospective rating peri od and therefore pay overall lower premium charges available data does not support this suggestion data demonstrates that excess of 95 of converted claims are converted during the retrospective rating period additionally the data does not show discernable difference in the observed conversion rates by claim maturity between retro employers and nonretro employers in fact data for clai ms converted after the last retrospective rating adjustme nt suggests that conve rsion is delayed for greater percentage of claims from nonretro employers rather than retro employers the implication is that observed differences in loss development between retro employers and nonretro employers is due to phenomena unr elated to the kept on salary program these issues are illustrated in the chart on the following page which shows the ratio of unconverted kept on salary claims to total kept on salary claims by maturity measured in calendar quarters from date of loss oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009

impact of retro employers on classification rates there is an expectation that wi th better than expected experien ce the impact of retro employer experience would be to decrease the average statew ide rates for the classifications in which they participate we have not compared retro em ployer experience to nonretro employer experience by individual classification ho wever we have calculated incu rred losses per derived hour by industry group separately for retro employers and nonretro employers the comparison was done for total losses combined and individually for medical aid losses and accident fund losses the graphs summarizing the results of this analysis are presented in prior section of this report but are reproduced on the following page for the convenience of the reader for almost all industry groups retro employers ve lower average costs per derived hour than nonretro employers this is true for total losses as well as individually for medical aid losses as well as accident fund losses an argument could be made that it woul d be inappropriate to conclude that retro employers act to lower cla ssification rates because the observations based on these graphs could be due to varying market shar by classification within each industry if this were the case though retro employers would have to have greater market share in lower hazard classifications this is known not to be the case additionally the observations extend across almost all industry groups finall similar charts presented earlier in this report show that retro employers have lower average experience m odifications than their nonretro employer counterparts given this information it is reasonable to conclude that the experience of retro employers acts to decrease the average rate for individual classifications oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 71 total losses per total derived hours all years combined 02000400060008001000120014001600

high or too low fo r individual employers in this respect the manner by which re trospective premium and therefore retrospective refunds are currently calculated are actuarially unsound however given the co mplexity of the issue and the various interpretations that may be made regarding the situation in washington it is unrealistic to expect stand alone actuarial solution independent of the various interpre tations of the situation the current retrospective premium calculation pres umes that employers fu nd 100 of standard premium and are responsible for 100 of losses however in wa shington it is suggested that employees fund 50 of medical aid premium this is true for many employers however our understanding is that substa ntial portion of empl oyers fund 100 of medical aid premium retrospective premium and therefore refunds to re tro employers are based on the presumption that employers fund 100 of medical ai d premium and are responsible for 100 of medical aid losses assuming that all employees fund 50 of medical aid losses and are responsible for 50 of all medical aid losses then the curre nt process of determining retrospective refund is actuarially unsound and potentially could result in overstated refunds to individual employers overstated surcharges or overly re duced refunds to individual employers situations in the extreme where an employer might receive retrospective refund greater than standard premium paid in the issue of actuarial soundness could potentially im pact the magnitude of the overall retrospective refund as well as the distribution of the overall retrospective refund to individual employers the magnitude of the impact or wh ether there is any impact at all will depend on the specific interpretation of the situation there are number of differ ent ways to interpret and possibly correct the situa tion in all frankness the most appropriate meth od at least from tec hnical perspective would be to ensure that all employers fund 100 of all workers compensation premium including medical aid premium as is the case in all other jurisdiction s if this path were taken then the current approach would be appropriate and medical aid premium would longer be an issue i n fact for employers that fund 100 of medical aid premium the current approach is appropriate however what might be appropriate and commonplace from technical perspective may not be appropriate from socio economic viewpoint in washington in any case an examination of the appropriateness of funding portion of medical aid premium through employees is beyond the scope of this analysis we will continue the discussion with the presumption that the current practic is desired and will continue as noted there are different in terpretations and courses of actio n to adjust the calculation however before discussing varying interpretation s and adjustments it is important to understand underlying factors that complicate this issue th factors are related to the determination of statewide rate level application of the experience rating plan the cost of loss prevention and loss oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 73 control balancing the experience of retro and nonretro employers as req uired by wac 29617 90402 and individual employer behavior as respects actual fundi ng of medical aid premium accident fund rates are at materially high er level than medical ai d fund rates see discussion at end of background section as such accident fund rate s are the primary driver of retrospective refunds the medical aid portion of overall rate s varies significantly by classification experience modifications impact both medical aid premium and accident fund premium after application of experience rating and cons ideration of average rate level medical aid premium is significantly closer to required levels for retro employers than accident fund premium which is measurab ly greater than required the employer funds the cost of loss control and loss pr evention which result in lower experience modificati ons which benefit employees both in terms of reduced medical aid premium payments as well as the reduced likelihood of serious disabling accident employers assume all risk associated with participation in the retrospective program significant portion of em ployers in washington fund 10 0 of medical aid premium in order to better understand how philosophy and in terpretation of the issu above can impact the view of how medical aid premium and losses should be treated consider two extremes guaranteed cost interpretation in one extreme an approach could be taken th at treats the employee fu nded portion of medical aid premium and therefore one half of medical aid losses as nonretro experience with this approach the following would apply determination of over all retrospective refund for the purpose of balancing the experience of retro and nonretro employers as required by wac 2961790402 one half of the medical aid premium and one half of the medical aid losses would be removed from retro em ployer experience used to determine the overall retro employer loss ratio and transferred to nonretro employer experience used to determine the overall nonretro employer loss ra tio the impact would be reduction to the total retrospective prem ium refund from the current approach in washington distribution of overall retrosp ective refund to retro employers for the purpose of determining individual re tro employer refunds the employer is presumed to have paid one half of the medical aid prem ium and therefore one half of the medical aid losses are included in the form ula used to determine individual retro employer premium the impact would be redistribution of th overall reduced as described above retrospective refund between retro employers when compared to the current approach in washington oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 74 ultimate payer interpretation the other extreme would treat the retro empl oyer as the ultimate payer of medical aid premium32 in this extreme an approach could be taken that treats the employee funded portion of medical aid premium and th erefore one half of medical ai d losses as ultimately the responsibility of retro employ ers with this approach the following would apply determination of over all retrospective refund for the purpose of balancing the experience of retro and nonretro employers as required by wac 2961790402 all medical aid premiu m and all medical aid losses would be included with retro employer experience used to determine the overall retro employer loss ratio this is the current approach in washington distribution of overall retrosp ective refund to retro employers for the purpose of determining individual re tro employer refunds the employer is presumed to have paid 100 of medical aid premium nd therefore 100 of medical aid losses are included in the formula used to determine individual retro employer premium this is the current approach in washington the guaranteed cost interpretation gives nonretr employers the benefit of retro employer medical aid experience the ultimate payer approach pr esumes that employers pay 100 of workers compensation premium and are re sponsible for 100 of medical aid losses and ignores the principle of employee funding in washington while arguments could be made for both extremes given the considerations discussed earlier it is apparent that neither extreme is an appropriate approach unfortunately the second extreme the ultimate payer approach is in fact the current approach in washington this is the basis for our criticism of the current approa ch in was hington given the above discussion one po ssible approach is as follows determination of overal l retrospective refund the current method of determining the overall retrospec tive refund which is equivalent to the ultimate payer interpretation coul d remain unchanged the refund is generated by the better than expected experience of retro em ployers regardless as to the s ource of premium payment and should therefore benefit retro employers distribution of overall retrospect ive refund to retro employers in perfect world all considerations listed earlier in this section could be appropriately considered and method devised to properly distribute ach employers refund to the appropriate premium payer employee and employer this is not possi ble theoretically due to innumerable ways that these considerations could be interpreted it is also not possible from practical viewpoint33 one 32 with this interpretation the source of funding of th employees portion of medical aid premium is presumed to be the employer who therefore bears responsibility for 100 of medical aid losses as well 33 given that final retrospective refunds are not determined until 45 months after enrollment possibly longer if recommendations in this report are adopted employees would have to be tracked in order to deliver the final refund consideration would have to be given to situations where there would be an accident fun d refund but oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 75 possible way to partially m itigate the issues with th current approach would be to reflect the reality that many employers fund only one half of medical aid premium and are ther efore responsible in theory for one half of medical ai d losses therefore for the purpos of determining individual retro employer refunds the employer is presumed34 to have paid one half of medical aid premium and therefore one half of the medical aid losses are included in the formula used to determine individual retro employer premium overall impact this approach would leave the overa ll retrospective refund unchanged however it would re sult in redistribution of the overall refund amongst re tro employers when comp ared to the current approach in washington this would partially address concerns with th current approach but would not eliminate them additio nally it is possible that this specific approach could require modifications to the manner by wh ich rates are established for individual classifications finally this approach still could in theory lead to si tuation where an employer receives retrospective refund greater than what wa s paid into the system during the course of this exam ination numerous permutations we re discussed and examined the approach suggested above is presen ted as practical and realistic way of partially dealing with an extraordinary complex issue however this approach is not presented as recommendation because as mentioned above it only partially addresses concerns with the current approach and potentially may generate additional issues as respects ratemaking medical aid fund assessment in which case an employee would have to be asked for payment these and other considerations were discussed at length with li 34 possible variant on this approach would be to identify those employers who fund 100 of medical aid premium and modify their retrospective premium formula appropriately we have not discussed the practical impl ications of this suggestion with li oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 76 number of adjustment s for retro employers introduction currently there are three adju stments for retrospective prem ium 21 33 and 45 months after enrollment at the time of the adjustment th overall retrospective premium requirement and refund is determined by balancing the experience of retro and nonretro employers as required by wac 2961790402 additionally the premium requirement for individual retro employers and therefore the dist ribution of the overall retrospective refund to individual employers is determined through the use of the retrospective rati ng formula as described earlier in this report therefore the number and timing of retro adjust ments impacts all aspects of the retrospective premium calculation determination of overall retros pective refund equity between retro and nonretro employers to the extent that loss devel opment differs between retro employ ers as group and nonretro employers as group beyond the current third and final adjustment ther will be an inequity between the groups and the requirements as established by wac 2961790402 will be violated in order for the current third and final adjustme nt to be appropriate loss development for both groups of employers would have to be identical after the third adjustment distribution of overall retrospective re fund equity amon gst retro employers to the extent that loss developm ent differs between individual retro employers beyond the current third and final adjustment there will be an inequity between individual retro employers in order for the current third and final adjustment to be appropriate expected loss development on average would have to be the same for each indi vidual retro employer after the third adjustment the following is more deta iled discussion of each of these individual items equity between retro an d nonretro employers we reviewed studies conducted by li and examined historical loss developm ent data provided by li information provid ed demonstrated that the current th ird and final retro adjustment at 45 months following enrollment is not sufficiently long to captur differences in loss development between retro employers an d nonretro employers as such the current sy stem creates inequities between retro employers and nonretro employers the following chart supplied by l i illustrates this concern oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 77 the chart above shows refund development to theoretical fifth adjust ment the chart is interpreted as follows at the first adjustment refunds can be expected to decrease by 22 through fifth adjustment at the second adjustment refunds can be expected to decrease by 63 through fifth adjustment at the third adjustment currently the fi nal adjustment refunds can be expected to decrease by 40 through fifth adjustment at the fourth adjustment refunds can be expected to decrease by 03 through fifth adjustment the implication is that refunds ar 40 to high because subsequent measures of loss experience at theoretical fourth and fifth adjustment demonstrate significantly different greater loss development for retro employers than for nonretro employers refund development all enrollments 411991 112003 22 634003 7060504030201000 at 1st at 2nd at 3rd at 4th

chart supplied by li displays the same information but individually for older enrollment periods and more recent enrollment periods equity amongst retro employers loss development will naturally vary between employers with different risk exposure employers in hazardous classifications that incur relatively large number of serious claims that are reported and adjusted at relatively immature ages will have materially different loss development patterns than another employer with lower number of serious cases but which are reported at later maturities both of these employers will have materially different loss development patterns than an employer whose primary exposure is clerical industry data and experience sugge sts that differences in loss development between employers are material beyond the current third and final ad justment of retrospective premium 45 months after enrollment therefore increasing the numb er of retrospective rating adjustments will not only increase equity between retro employers and nonretro employers but will also increase equity amongst retro employers as group refund development enrollments 411991 712000 38 observations enrollments 1012000

actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 79 potential inequities between retro employers the following items were identified in this stud as potentially impacting equity between retro employers performance adjustment factor number of retrospective rating adjustments actuarial tables analysis of group size the first three items are discussed in detail in sepa rate sections of this report brief discussions are presented below for completeness more co mplete discussion of the analysis of group size follows performance adjustment factor the equalization of nonretro employer loss ratios and retro employer loss ratios as required by wac 2961790402 is based on the combined losses nd total premium of all employers in the nonretro program and the combined losses and total premium basic premium and loss based premium of all employers in the retro pr ogram therefore the paf methodology which distributes the impact of the equalization process to individual retro employe rs should impact all retrospective premium components equally as disc ussed elsewhere in this report it does not the current paf methodology excludes the basic pr emium component of retrospective premium the entire impact of the paf is levera ged onto the actual limited loss component notwithstanding equity issues the current approach also creates market bias towards one type of retrospective plan or the other depending on th current values of the paf when the paf is less then 1000 as it has been the impact of the paf is to increase retrospective refunds it is then advantageous for retro employers to select plan with the lowest value of basic premium in order to realize the highest leveraged impact of the paf this has in fact been the case according to information provided by li our understanding is that ther is preference for plan b which in fact has the lowest values of basic premium charges relative to the other available plans number of retrospective rating adjustments industry data and experience sugge sts that differences in loss development between employers are material beyond the current third and final ad justment of retrospective premium 45 months after enrollment therefore increasing the numb er of retrospective rating adjustments will not only increase equity between retro employers and nonretro employers but will also increase equity amongst retro employers as group oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 80 actuarial tables the current actuarial tables in washington for ll retrospective plans are over twenty years old and do not reflect changes in workers compensati on claims and exposure that have occurred over the past twenty years these include but are not necessarily limited to impact of medical inflation on claim costs impact of changing medical technology impact of shifting hazard across industry groups impact of aging population impact of decreasing claim frequency impact of shift in mix of claims by type impact of changes and improvements to loss mitigation procedures impact of changes and improvement s to loss prevention procedures these issues have been discussed earlier as an example the current tables reflect single per claim limit of 500000 twenty five years ago 10 of total losses could have been expected to be above 500000 limit currently that value is 25 using another state as an example this is an expected change due to the impact of inflation on claim costs therefore an employer with relatively high of number of large claims is being undercharged for the expected cost above 500000 this is becau the current tables were constructed at time when this charge was 10 of total loss cu rrently this charge is expected to be 25 of total loss using another state as an example overall retrospective premium is determined by the requirements of wac 2961790402 which dema nds that the overall loss ratio for retro employers equal the overall loss ratio for non retro employers therefore the impact of undercharging one employer for costs excess 500000 is to overcharge another employer for costs excess 500000 in this example lower hazard retro employers are subsidizing higher hazard retro employers updating and adjusting the actuarial tables will increase equity amongst retro employers analysis of group size general observation we do observe that the relative size of group is important and th ere are measurable differences in cost based on group size thes differences are due to practical availability of claim free discounts to smaller groups which are offset by tabular advantages which are likely actuarial in nature for larger groups oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 81 discussion li provided five year history separately for each retro group of the following data standard premium incurred loss medical nd accident fund separately paid loss medical and ccident fund separately we examined the historical losses and prem ium of 472 retro groups from 2003 to 2007 many of these retro groups did not have complete history because their retro partic ipation began or ended within the five year period 211 of the retro groups had the complete 5 year history and an additional 63 groups were examined when we examined only the three year period of 20052007 we observed that the retro groups of smaller size had greater variability of their loss experience as demonstrated in the chart below the grou ps with fewer years of experience in

experience while the retro groups of smaller si ze have greater variab ility in their loss experience they also have the most potential for bette r experience we examined the retro groups in three size groups small group size premium 100000 medium group size premium 100000 749999 and large group size premium 750000 oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august

group size produced loss ratios this low these results are not necessarily unexpected as explained by the law of large numbers the particularly good loss experience of the smaller sized retro groups is utilized in the claims free discount program examining the indemnity onl loss experience of th three year period 20052007 from 274 retro groups we see that near ly half of the smaller retro groups

larger groups the same advantage is seen when comparing larger employer to group of smaller employers who together generate the same standard premium as larger employer consider risk with 80 expected

department of labor and industries august 2009 page 84 performance adjustment factor large portion of this information was presen ted earlier in this report in the background section and the executive summary it is comp iled here for the sake of completeness the formula for the calculation of retros pective premium in washington follows actual loss loss performance retrospective basic limited x conversion x dev x adjustment premium premium losses factor factor factor this formula is slightly different than the gene ral formula for determining retrospective premium presented earlier in this report the components of this formula as well as the differences from the general formula are discussed and explained below it is important to note that while the loss development factor and the performance ad justment factor are independent quantities that are derived and calculated separately in practice they are combined into single number for presentation purposes basic premium basic premium serves similar role in washington as in the general formula with some differences in washington ba sic premium provides for administrative and other program expenses which are generally lower than they would be in typical retrospective rating programs there is profit and the impact of i nvestment income is included in the lcf the actuarial cost of maximum li mit on retrospective premium payable the actuarial credit for minimu m retrospective premium payable the actuarial cost of the 500000 limit on individual claims actual limited losses actual loss experience during the policy pe riod adjusted to reflect the 500000 limit on individual claims this is the same as the general formula loss conversion factor lcf in washington the lcf provides for the cost of claim adjustment expenses as well as the impact of investment income to account for in vestment income that could be earned during the period between the time li collects premium and the time that losses are actually paid loss development factor actual limited losses are developed to reflect the expectation that limited losses will increase over time as claims mature loss developm ent is expected in the insurance industry especially with workers compensation claims in other jurisdictions loss development factors may be applied as part of the retrospective premium calc ulation or they may only be considered when the insured and the insure r are negotiating final adjustment in washington loss development factors are app lied as part of the retrospective premium calculation oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 85 performance adjustment factor paf the paf is unique to washington washi ngton regulation wac 296 1790402 requires that retro employers and nonretro employers fund the same percentage of losses from premium this is equivalent to requiring that retro employers and non retro employers have the same ratio of incurred losses to premium li th erefore requires that the overall loss ratio for non retro employers to equal the overall loss ratio for retro employers li implements this requirement by adjusting the overall premium required from retro employers until this condition is met the adjustment is made th rough modification to actual limited losses in every employers retrospective premium calcu lation the modification is made through application of the paf which is initially set at 1000 the paf is either increased above or decreased below 1000 until the required retrospective premium is generated 35 tax multiplier there are premium tax charges in washington retrospective premium adjustments and refunds retro employers are initially charged standard premium36 retrospective premium is calculated using the formula described earlier in this repor t at three points in time 21 33 and 45 months following enrollment these points in time are generally referred to as adjustments at the first adjustment the calculated formula retrospective premium is compared to the initial standard premium charged if the formula retrospective premium is greater than standard premium additional premium is paid if the formula retros pective premium is less than standard premium premium is refunded to the employer the pr ocess is repeated at the two subsequent adjustments except comparisons are made to standard premium net of any prior premium surcharges or refunds the first adjustment has generally resulted in pr emium refunds to retro employers because first retro employers generally have less than average loss experience and second the manner by which premium rates are estab lished in washington this latter issue is 35 description of the actual process may be simplified as two basic steps step one the ratio of incurred actual unlimited losses to standard premium for nonretro employers is compared to the ratio of incurred actual unlimited losse s to standard premium for retro employers standard premium for retro employers is reduced until the loss ratio for both groups are equal the amount by which standard premium for retro employers is reduced is the aggregate retrospective refund the difference is termed refund because the initial premium paid by retro em ployers is equal to their standard premium step two the retrospective premium for every retro empl oyer is calculated using the formula in the text with starting paf of 100 this is the formula retrospecti ve premium the paf is adjusted until the difference between standard premium for retro employers and the formula retrospective premium equals the aggregate retrospective refund determined in step one step one may be viewed as the process used to determ ine the required aggregate retrospective refund step two may be viewed as the process by which this refund is distributed to individual employers the actual process requires adjustments for investmen t income and rate level c hanges however the basic algorithm is as described above 36 hours worked x premium rate per hour x experience modification oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 86 material and is discussed separately for th medical aid component and the accident fund component of premium rates the medical aid component of premium rates is tablished in manner that is expected to be adequate for all employers retro and nonretro co mbined in the state therefore prior to experience rating there is an exp ectation that medical aid portion of rates will be higher than necessary for retro employers given that retr employers have lower than average claim experience experience rating mitigates but does not eliminate this issue the accident fund component of pr emium rates is established in manner that is adequate for nonretro employers nonretro employers ge nerally have claim expe rience that is higher than average but significantly higher than retro employers as such the accident fund component of rates will be materially higher th an necessary for retro employers experience rating mitigates but does not eliminate this issue the second and third adjustments are less likely to produce refunds than the first adjustment regardless retro employers can expect in the aggregate net premium refunds after the final adjustment at 45 months following enrollment37 the current methodology used to apply the paf cr eates biases for or against specific employers depending on program selected actual loss experience and program availa bility the current methodology applies the paf only to the actual li mited loss component of re trospective premium it does not apply the paf to th basic premium component as such the current methodology leverages the impact of the paf on employers who select programs with small or absent basic premium component if the paf is greater than 1000 employers in plans with little or basic premium will receive less than their fair share of the aggregate retrospective refund while employers in plans with larger basic premium charges will receive more than their fair sh are if the paf is less than 100038 employers in plans with little or basic premium will receive more than their fair share of the aggregate retrospective refund while employer s in plans with larger basic pr emium charges will receive less than their fair share 37 under wac 2961790428 retro groups forfeit their eligibility if they are required to pay additional premium for three consecutive coverage periods 38 historically pafs have ranged from 0600 to 1100 although they have been below 1000 prior to the last few years the very low pafs in the earl 2000s were direct result of low rate levels and therefore high loss ratios during this period of time more recently rate levels have increase d in part due to significantly reduced investment income with higher rate level and wer loss ratios pafs have increased significantly oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 87 the retrospective premium formula is shown below and clearly demonstrates that basic premium is not impacted by the paf actual loss loss performance39 retrospective basic limited x conversion x dev x adjustment premium premium losses factor factor factor the formula for retrospective premium is designed to be adequate afte r consideration of all components this is easily understood after co nsidering how expense nd actuarial charges are shifted from basic premium to th lcf to create differe nt plans the current approach treats employers who elect plans with hi gher basic premium differently than employers who elect plans with smaller or basic premium there is actuarial justif ication for this the equalization of nonretro employer loss ratios and retro employer loss ratios as required by wac 2961790402 is based on the combined losses nd total premium of all employers in the nonretro program and the combined losses and total premium basic premium and loss based premium of all employers in the retro pr ogram therefore the paf methodology which distributes the impact of the equalization process to individual retro employe rs should impact all retrospective premium components equally clearly it does not the current approach also creates market bias towards one type of retr ospective plan or the other depending on the current va lues of the paf when the pa f is less then 1000 as it has been the impact of the paf is to increase retrospective refunds it is then advantageous for retro employers to select plan with the lowest value of basic premium in order to realize the highest leveraged impact of the paf this has in fact been the case accordin g to information provided by li our understanding is that there is preference for plan b which in fact has the lowest values of basic premium charges rela tive to the other available plans on the other hand when the paf is greater than one the impact of the paf is to decrease retrospective refunds it would then be advantageo us for retro employers to select plan with the highest value of basic premium in order to dilute the impact of the paf 39 the loss development factor and the performance adjustment factor are independent quantities that are derived and calculated separately however as mentioned earlier in practice th ey are combined into single number for the purpose of presentation oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 88 simple adjustment to the retrospective premium fo rmula will address this issue as shown below _____ _____ actual loss loss performance retrospective basic limited x conversion x dev x adjustment premium premium losses factor factor factor _____ ____ this is the approach we recommend that li use it is important to not that this adjustment does not impact the over all retrospective refund however it will redistribute the overall retrospective refund more equitabl retro employers with larg er portion of their retrospective premium in the basic portion will see their ref unds increased all else being equal and retro employers with smaller portion of their retrospective premium in the basic portion will see their refunds decreased all else being equal oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 89 loss development factors case reserving this task considers the level of loss development factors in washington as co mpared to other states and addresses the concern as to whether it is impacted by washingtons case reserve practices an examination of loss development factors used by li in the retrospective formula shows that the loss development factors are significantly higher than workers compensation insurance industry factors from other states there are number of reas ons for this observation first this is not correct comparison the loss development factors used in the retrospective rating calculation exclude pension claims insurance industry data from ot her states is for all claims excluding pension cases which tend to be the rgest cases will likel have the impact of increasing loss development factors becau these cases once established tend to develop very slowly into the future ss development factors are ratios of exp ected final cost to reported costs to date removing pension cases from the calculati on is equivalent to removing large fixed amounts from the numerator and denominator of the ldf ratio the remaining ratio will likely be significantly larger second case reserving pr actice in washington does not plac case reserve on claim until that claim is eight months old this has the impact of delaying loss development early on in claims life cycle this explains the very high factors at 12 and 24 months of ag these ages may be interpreted as time from rollment for the purpose of comparison to washington 40 combined experience from all

consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 90 finally nearly every state in the country allows for the resolution and settlement of claims prior to awarding pension disability this program referred to as compromise and release is not permitted under washington statute as result there is abilit to settle claims for fixed amount or lump sum direct result is that the averag claim duration in washington is significantly longer than in ot her jurisdictions as ma ny more claims become pension claims and those claims are paid for the life of the in jured worker oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 91 case reserve levels this task asked oliver wyman to examine whether case reserve levels have been consistent over time in order to examine this question oliver wyma n asked for and received from li random sampling of claims that had cl osed in the fo llowing ranges between 24000 and 26000 between 74000 and 76000 between 123000 and 127000 between 245000 and 255000 l i does not maintain developm ent records for individual claims beyond seven years so they were not able to fulf ill our original request of n claims that closed in ea ch of these ra nges for each of the last ten years the intent of this re view was to identify any shifts in data that might ad us to concl ude that there had been material change to ca reserve levels over time using this data we were unable to identify any patte rns in the data that woul d lead us to conclude that loss reserves have been inconsistent we also held teleconference with dan dorris case reserve supervisor at li dan informed us that there have not been any si gnificant changes in how case reserves have been handled over the past several years and also that there is difference in how case re serves are handled for retrospectively rated claims and nonretro claims finally we examined history as available of the average cas reserve per open claim this history did not indicate change in case reserving practices over time oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 92 evaluation of tables evaluate and make recommenda tions on the following tables table of insurance charges plan tables a1 a2 a3 b size group tables single loss limitation table oliver wyman has reviewed the tables and offers the following conclusions table of insurance charges and plan tables the table of insurance charges and plan tables are well out of date absent of any other changes the tables should be updated to reflect current experience while it is impractical to adjust tables annually we would recommend that the tables be revise d on regular cycle perhaps every 3 to 5 years this would allow the tables to reflect the changes in experience as they occur the workers compensation market has changed signi ficantly since these tables were first used in the 1980s or 1990s the di stribution of losses has changed as well as claim frequency the tables a1 a2 a3 incl ude loss conversion factor of 72941 the factor is calculated using the following parameters claims administration expense ratio to loss 9 discount factor 669 neither of these factors has been revised in man many years again just from the passage of time these factors need to be revisited and updated each of the five plans six if you consider that plan b is really two plans combined as one has its own advantages and disadvantages th plans are outlined in the table below plan basic premium minimum premium lcf tabular equals basic 729 a1 058 tabular 729 a2 tabular tabular 729 a3 tabular tabular 729 b small employers tabular equals basic tabular b large employers 0 0 tabular 41 the loss conversion factor for table b varies bas ed on the size of risk and the maximum premium selected oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 93 for entries shown as tabular the value decrease s as the selected maximum premium increases each of the plans appeals to slightly different ri sks and the final cost paid by retro participant could differ significantly based on the plan that is chosen particularly if the retro risk experiences particularly good or particularly bad experience the differences can be hundreds of thousands of dollars even for m oderately sized risk consider for example risk that generates 800000 of standard premium with an expected loss ratio of 80 and selected maximum of 1 20 depending on the pl an selected if the insured was to realize an 80 loss ratio th ey could expect re fund ranging from 90000 to 190000 however if this risk were to have particularly good year and realize 50 loss ratio the refunds would range fr om 90000 to 418000 while if they we re to have particularly poor year and realize 110 ss ratio the results would range from 40000 charge to 90000 refund the table below demonstrates the range of results loss returnpayable using maximum of 120 ratio plan plan b plan a1 plan a2 plan a3 500 342800 418400 90400 139200 342800 800 167840 189440 90400 139200 167840 1100 7120 39520 90400 52080 7120 the usage of the multiple tables provides for ma ny choices for insureds some of the tables prevent wide swings in the example above th plan a1 insured would have had the same refund under any of the three scenarios plans and b however can have significant swings 350000 and 450000 respectively in the above example other factors can influence the c hoice of plan particularly the si ze of insured in the example above plan b would have produced the greatest retrospective re fund at the 80 expected loss however with the same loss ratio and standa rd premium of 80000 plan a2 would have been more favorable if the same loss ratio was xpected with standard premium of 8000000 the retrospective return under plan b would be from 300000 18 million greater than any of the other plans there is significant effect on this analysis fr om the performance adjustment factors paf which are discussed earlier in this report as pr esently utilized the paf is applied only to the loss portion of the retrospective premium and t to the basic premium portion as result when the paf is less than 10 which is the usual case large risks in plan b benefit more than other risks because large risks in plan b pay basic premium as result their entire retrospective premium is reduced by the paf risks in plan are less affected because the paf is not applied to basic premium in r ecent quarters the paf has been approaching 1000 oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 94 should the paf become larger than 10 the reverse effect could be seen with plan b participants being penalized to greater degree than other participants absent of other changes this could lead to movement of par ticipants from plan b to other plans having five tables does complicate the issue some what however as long as the tables are updated correctly the same tables could remain in use it is up to the department to consider whether streamlining the number of ta bles would be worthwhile revision size group tables the size group tables are updated annually by th department the tables are based on standard premium and are adjust ed by the annual change in acci dent and medical aid rates the size group tables are used as entry points on the retrospective rati ng plan tables the purpose of updating them annually is to not have an employer change groups solely due to rate changes the ncci and most other jurisd ictions use an expected loss table for similar purpose in those plans the expected losses increase each year for inflation while different from the ncci we dont find problem with th current washington method as it appears to be accomplishing the intended purpose single loss limitation table the single loss limitation table in wa shington is not tabl at all its single value and we view this as inappropriate the value of any loss applied in retrospective rating calculation in washington is limited to 500000 this produces numerous issues not limited to the following the 500000 limitation is too large for smaller in sureds smaller insureds will never benefit from the limitation becau large loss will hit their maximum premium before it ever hits the 500000 threshold consider risk with an expected loss of 300000 and 150 maximum premium the maximum prem ium of 450000 regardless of plan is below this threshold these insureds would benefit from lower optional limitations because there would at least be the possibility of coverage the 500000 limitation is too small for larger in sureds larger insu reds can hit this limitation fairly frequently in some cases several times year those losses can be planned for and thus the limitation is not pe rforming the function that it was designed these insureds would benefit from higher op tional limitations because the charge for higher limitation would be lower than it is for the current 500000 limitation oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 95 beyond the value of the limitation being 500000 fo r all insureds ther are other equity issues there is distinct chargecredit fo r the limitation so essentially all insureds are paying the same amount for it as demonstrated above this is unfair to small risks as they are paying for coverage from which they will never collect as well as to large risks who are paying for coverage that they dont need even if the 500000 level was appropriate fo r an insured hazard groups which are utilized by the ncci in other jurisdictions do not apply in washington two risks could have identical expected losses but one risk may be in more hazardous group and thus more likely to have large loss for example consider the following risk expects 100 losses of 10000 each total expected loss 1000000 loss for retro rating calculation 1000000 risk b expects 20 losses of 10000 each and one loss of 800000 total expected loss 1000000 loss for retro rating calculation 700000 an actuarially appropriate ss limitation must recognize the difference in expected losses entering the retro rating calculation the current program in washington does not in other jurisdictions the single loss limitation varies by the size of the insureds and to some degree by the insureds choice of lim it we view this as better process than in washington and recommend that li move to program more si milar in construction to other jurisdictions oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 96 examination of bias in current tables 14 examination of bias in current tables is there any significant actuarial bias in the current tables and calculation with respect to size of enrollee risk classes of enrollee loss limitation choi ce of table selected quarter of enrollment loss development factorspaf third annual adjustment as the final adjustment group enrollment vs individual enrollment underwriting of safety process effectiveness used by enrollee oliver wyman has reviewed the tables and offers the following conclusions size of enrollee as detailed in our response to previous tasks the tables are designed in such as way that larger participant will generally have better result than smaller participants even if you combine smaller participants experi ence so that it mirrors larger pa rticipant this is one of the reasons why retro groups have been so popular in washington as compared to individual retro particpants loss limitation as detailed in our response to the previous task there is clearly bias in the current tables and procedures with respect to loss limitation quarter of enrollment retrospective rating participants can enroll effective the first date of each calendar quarter this improves the flexibility of the program by not re quiring enrollees to wait nearly full year before they could enter the program while each quarters results is calc ulated individually the results are rolled together for full year before refunds are calculated while results for the 1st and 3rd quarters are often significantly di fferent from the other larger quarters they are then combined with the results for the 2nd and 4th quarters as result we do not see any bias in this procedure third annual adjustment as the final adjustment as detailed in our response to previous tasks th data provided clearly indicates bias in only having three annual adjustments retro losses develop at rate of about 4 higher than non retro losses between the third annual adjust ment and the fifth annual adjustment group enrollment vs individual enrollment groups that enroll in retro do benefit from the law of large numbers as compared to individual enrollees group enrollee co uld potentially benefit from single loss limitation for example oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 97 the functioning of the tables co uld also produce significantly lower costs for group enrollees assuming the enrollment is of group of equal sized insureds for example consider an individual enrollee with 80000 of standard premium and an 80 loss ratio given maximum premium ratio of 12 their costs will range from 69000 to 87000 if losses match the expected the exact result depends on which table is selected now consider group enrollee with 800000 of sta ndard premium and an 80 loss ratio given maximum premium ratio of 12 thei r costs will range from 610000 to 710000 while the group enrollee could experience ref und of 11 23 the individual enrollee will see results ranging from an 11 debit to 9 refund underwriting of safety proce ss effectiveness us ed by enrollee whether or not the safety process is effectively underwritten is im material retrospectively rated insureds develop better loss experi ence than those risks th at do not enroll in retrospective rating as result washington law requires that these risk s receive reduction in their premium if one enrollee were to more effectively underwrite safet then all else being equal their results would be better than other enrollees risk classes of enrollee we have not found any bias based on risk class choice of table selected as detailed in our response to the previous task there is clearly bias regarding the application of pafs to the current tables as pafs are onl applied to the loss portion of the retrospective premium calculation as result table b will be pr eferred particularly by larger risks if the paf is significantly less than 10 otherwise the tables represent choice for the enrollee as to how much risk they are willing to take and what reward that th ey will recognize given that risk if their results are good however we do not view this as bias loss development factorspaf other than the application of the paf to onl the loss portion of the retrospective premium calculation we do not believe that there is any bias the calculatio n of the paf does result from what we believe to be misallocation of occupati onal disease losses however this does not mean that the paf itself is biased the department is currently introducing more precise loss development methodology currently the other separation of losses is between accident and medical fund losses the revised methodology should lead to more accurate result as generally speaking retro employers engage in more hazardous work applying developm ent factors that are spec ific to the type of loss should improve equity oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 98 comparison to industry task 15 asked oliver wyman to identify differe nces between the retrospective rating program in place in washington with the prog rams in place in other jurisdictions for the purpose of completing this task we ar comparing the washington program to three other programs the standard ncci program used in multiple jurisdictions including unless otherwise noted the neighboring state of oregon california new york many of the differences as will be defined below are necessitated by some of the intricacies of the washington program including the provision th at retro and nonretro policyholders pay an equitable share of premium effective date in the three other programs cited the effective date for retrospective rating generally matches the effective date of the policy in washington entities can enroll in one of four dates the fi rst day of each calendar quarter january 1 april 1 july 1 and october 1 the restriction on enrollment date is required in washington due to the provision that retro and nonretro policyholders pay an equitable share of premium in washington the intent is to balance all retrospective rating policies vs all non retrospectively rated policies to do this it is expected that overall significant retrospect ive rating refund will be earned in other jurisdictions the intent is for retrospective rating to be balanced on an individual policy level and the expectation is that credits to some policyholders will offs et debits to other policyholders number of retro adjustments in the three other programs cited there are limits on the number of retro adjustments rather the ncci rules state that there should be as many adjustments as they need until carrier and insured agree to longer adjust new yorks language is the same while california notes that there can be one or more adjustments in washington there are presently three and only three adjustme nts adaptation of the ncci rule would be impractical in washington due to the requirement that retro and nonretro policyholders pay an equitable shar of premium as noted earlie r in our report oliver wyman is recommending that the number of adjust ments be increased from three to five oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 99 eligibility in the three other programs cite d risks are eligible for retrospective rating is the standard premium is at least 25000 workers compensa tion can be combined with other casualty insurance to reach the 25000 threshold as well as under the ncci and new york plans 75000 threshold for 3year plan the 3year pl an does not exist in california risks in california are eligible for the large risk alte rnative rating option if standard premium is greater than 1000000 in washington many smaller risks ar eligible for retros pective rating risks are

retro premium retro premium basic premium converted loss tax multiplier retro premium is subject to min and max we note that in some jurisdicti ons although not california or new york alae is included in the definition of converted loss in washington the formula is similar but ther is major difference in the calculation washington retro premium basic premium ratio standard premium loss conversion factor developed losses retro premium is subject to min an d max although companygroup can forego maximum premium protection if enrolled in plan and large enough to qualify as selfinsurer under washington law oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 101 while basic premium ratio standard premium is essentially analogous to basic premium in other jurisdictions the loss conve rsion factor in washington as currently used incorporates the policy adjustment factor paf the paf is applied in such manner as to balance the loss ratios between retro and nonretro policyholders in washington we note that this factor currently is applied only to sses previously in our report we noted that this introduces inequities between retrospectivel rated risks and recommended th at the paf be applied to the entire retro premium and not just the loss portion large risk alternative ra ting option lraro this is common option that allows larger risks to be retrospectively rated as mutually agreed upon by carrier and insured under the ncci plan lraro is an available option for risks with an estimated annual standard premium of at least 1000000 indi vidually or in any combinati on with gl hpl commercial auto crime glass or wc we note that lr aro is not an available option in oregon the ncci is currently filing revision that w ould reduce the premium eligibility standard to 5000000 new york follows plan similar to the ncci howeve r risks need to have an estimated annual standard premium of only 500000 to qualify california offers lraro for risks with an timated annual standard premium 1000000 lraro is not offered in washington however washington does offer an option as noted earlier for risks to forego maximum premium protection lcf the loss conversion factor is commonly used term however its application differs amongst the programs cited ncci the loss conversion factor usually covers claim adjustment expenses and the cost of the insurance carriers claim services such as inve stigation of claims and filing claim reports for the alae option the lcf would not typically incl ude allocated claim adjustment expense the definition of the lcf in new york is simila r to the nccis lcf however in california the loss conversion factor is established by ag reement of the insured and insurer the california lcf should not be large enough to result in negative expenses in the calculation of the basic premium factor washingtons application is sligh tly different in that the lcf re presents an expense charge for claims handling and the present value of developed losses oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page 102 tax multiplier for the ncci tax multiplier covers licenses fees assessments and taxes which the insurance carrier must pay on the premium which it coll ects the multiplier includes provision for subsidiary of the assigned risk market in new york the tax multiplier covers licenses fees and taxes which the insurance carrier must pay on the premium which it collects in california the tax multiplier primarily reflects the cost of premium taxes and other miscellaneous costs that the insurer pays based on premium that is not otherwise provided for in this plan there is explicit tax multiplier in washington per occurrence limitations the nccis program currently has rule sta ting that the minimum per claim limitation is 25000 with standard premium threshold of 100000 the ncci llow higher per claim limitations provided that they do not exceed 50 of standard premium however the ncci is currently filing program that woul d remove all such constraints in new york per occurrence limits range from 25000 to 10000000 the credits for these limitations vary by hazard group california also offers variety of per occu rrence loss limitations also ranging from 25000 to 10000000 in washington the per occurrence limitation is 500000 regardless of the size of the insured the single limitation is too large for smaller insu reds the losses needed to reach the maximum premium are smaller than 500000 nd is too small for larger insu reds the insureds would be willing and able to absorb more volatility in their losses in ex change for greater discount on the rate oliver wyman actuarial consulting inc department of labor and industries august 2009 page
