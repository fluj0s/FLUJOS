general state prohibitions on coercion terroristic threats harassment or hate crimes some of these laws feature hate crime element without which conviction is not possible others do not in either case there are obvious first amendment implications the supreme court has explained that not all speech particular expressive conduct is protected by the first amendment however in rav v st paul it held cross burning with the intent to annoy was protected and did not come within the fighting words category of unprotected speech shortly thereafter in black v virginia the court held that cross burning with the intent to convey true threat was not protected some of the justices noted another difference between the two cases the ordinance in rav had hate crime elementthe offense had to be motivated by racial or some other discriminatory animus the statute in black had such element in years since black was announced the lower courts have continued to recognize true threats as unprotected but have also continued to analyze challenges to threat statutes under the first amendments overbreadth doctrine and the vagueness doctrine of the fifth and fourteenth amendments due process clauses these laws have generally survived such challenges although an imprecisely worded statute has fallen victim to vagueness attack upon occasion

that dates from the nineteenth century field code 1865 it is crime reminiscent of extortion but without the extraction of property required of that offense8 in those states in which it is found it is essentially the same it prohibits efforts to compel another through the use of threats to do or refrain from doing so mething the victim is legally entitled to do person commits the crime of criminal coercion if without legal authority he threatens to confine restrain or to cause physical injury to the threatened person or another or to damage the property or reputation of the threatened person or another with intent thereby to induce the threatened person or another against his will to do an unlawful act or refrain from doing lawful act 9 few states characterize as the crime of intimidation the crime known elsewhere as coercion10 in either case the proscription would apply where cross burning or other symbolic threat is designed to discourage another from exercising or refraining from

by symbolic threats may be difficult if not impossible under most circumstances on the other hand in those states where the terroristic threats statute proscribes threats of death serious injury or

assessed without considerations of its first amendment implications generally these statutes will pass constitutional muster so long as they can be read only to proscribe expressive conduct that falls outside of the protection of the first amendment the first amendment provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech23 the fourteenth amendments due process clause imposes the same restriction upon the states24 many of whose constitutions house comparable limitation on state legislative action25 the first amendment protects both pure speech and expressive conduct used to convey message or embody an ideology26 however the supreme court has long recognized that the first amendment does not afford all forms of expression absolute protection and the government constitutionally may prohibit the forms of expression that fall outside of the first amendments protections27 the first amendment permits restrictions upon the content of speech in few limited areas which are of such slight social value as step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality28 the proscribable categories

the property was located in full view of public highway where neighbors and passersby could view the ceremony and the burning cross35 in the second case mr elliot burned cross on the front lawn of an african american family who had moved in next door36 the statute under which the men were convicted read in pertinent part it shall be unlawful for any person or persons with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons to burn or cause to be burned cross on the property of another highway or other public place any such burning of cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate 37 after laying out the statute the court proceeded to trace the history of crossburning placing particular emphasis upon the use of the burning cross as threat of future bodily harm by the klan38 the court noted that while cross burning sometimes carries intimidating message at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed39 writing for the court40 justice oconnor indicated that cross burning if accomplished with the intent to intimidate person or group could be considered true threat in light of the history of burning crosses41 in endorsing the constitutionality of the statutory provision banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate the court defined true threat42 true threats encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to particular individual or group of individuals see watts v united states 394 us 705 708 1969 political hyperbole is not true threat rav v city of st paul 505 us at 588 the speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat rather prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the fear of violence and from the disruption that fear engenders in addition to protecting people from the possib ility that the threatened violence will occur ibid intimidation in the constitu tionally proscribable sense of the word is type of true threat where speaker directs threat to person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death 43 34 id 35 id 36 id at 350 37 id at

the intent of creating pervasive fear in victims that they are target of violence it seems to fall squarely within the type of constitutionally proscribable speech described by the court44 the court also recognized that historically crosses have been burned for reasons that are protected by the first amendment45 the act of burning crosses is common at traditional klan meetings not unlike the meeting mr black held during which the cross was lit and those gathered sang songs including amazing grace 46 however the majority declined to find that once law discriminates based on this type of content the law is unconstitutional47 the first amendment does not prohibit all forms of content discrimination within proscribable area of speech48 within the types of content discrimination that did not violate the first amendment the court cited rav 49 for the proposition that when the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists50 in this case virginia did not single out cross burning with the intent to intimidate for certain re asons such as crossburning with the intent to intimidate due to racial prejudice but rather banned all cross burning done with the intent to intimidate regardless of the underlying animus51 the majority found the facts of one of the cases it was deciding illustrative52 it was unclear from the record whether mr elliot burned cross on his neighbors lawn to express racial hatred or to express his lack of appreciation for complaints about guns mr elliot fired in his back yard53 because the virginia statute was written to include mr elliots conduct regardless of his motivation the statute did not discriminate against his conduct on the basis of the content of the message the crossburning conveyed and fell within the permissible bounds of content discrimination outlined in rav 54 44 id 45 id 46

the court held that the statute criminalized speech based on protected features of otherwise proscribable speech id at 385 in that way it singled out for opprobrium certain specific ideas and left others untouched id though the ordinance had been limited only to apply to fighting words it was clear from the statute that it only applied to fighting words in connection with hostility on the basis of race color creed religion or gender id at 391 so for example conduct otherwise proscribable under the statute like burning cross would not be punishable if done with animus towards persons sexual

form of intimidation55 as result the court held that statute which cr iminalizes crossburning with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with the courts previous holdings56 likening the situation to its obscenity cases where state may regulate only that obscenity which is most obscene the court held that state may choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm57 following the true threat analysis justices oconnor rehnquist stevens and breyer went on to strike down the statute because it contained another provision that made the act of cross burning prima facie evidence of the intent to intimidate58 the plurality found that though it was constitutional to ban cross burning with the intent to intimidate as true threat the prima facie evidence provision could create an unacceptable danger that protected speech would be criminalized or chilled 59 the issue in this portion of the opinion was jury instruction delivered in mr blacks case60 the instruction stated that the act of burning cross by itself is sufficient evidence to infer the required intent61 this interpretation of the prima facie evidence provision rendered the statute unconstitutional in the pluralitys view62 the provision permits the commonwealth to arrest prosecute and convict person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself63 in the pluralitys view the provision stripped away the very reason why state may ban cross burning with intent to intimidate and created an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas 64 on that basis the plurality held that the statute was invalid on its face65 recognizing that the virginia supreme court had not passed on the meaning of the prima facie evidence provision the plurality left open the possibility that virginias highest court could apply constitutional interpretation to the prima facie ev idence part of the statute or sever it from the statute completely66 justices scalia and thomas dissented from the pluralitys view that the prima facie evidence provision rendered the statute facially unconstitutional67 justice scalia joined by justice thomas argued that prima facie evidence as interpreted by virginia courts in the past cut off defense nor interposed any obstacle to contest of the facts68 in scalias view prima facie evidence is evidence that suffices on its own to establish particular fact but that is true only to the extent that presumption remains unrebutted 69 the act of burning cross is sufficient only 55 id 56 id at 368 stevens j concurring cross burning with an

element of the offense not to establish an irrebuttable presumption of intent to intimidate70 scalia further cited decision in which the supreme court emphasized that where statute regulates expressive conduct the scope of the statute does not render it unconstitutional unless its overbreadth is not only real but substantial judged in relation to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep71 justice scalia argued that an instance in which person would burn cross in public view without the intent to intimidate and then refuse to present defense would be exceedingly rare and did not rise to level of substantiality that would render the statute unconsitutional72 the class of persons the plurality was concerned could be convicted impermissibly under the prima facie evidence provision was far too insubstantial to justify striking down the statute as facially invalid73 justice scalia agreed however that the jury instruction in mr blacks case was improper and would have remanded the case for interpretation of the prima facie evidence provision rather than hold the entire statute unconstitutional74 justice thomas also wrote separately in dissent justice thomas argued that the prima facie evidence provision created an inference as opposed to presumption and should not raise concern for the court presumption justice thomas noted compels the factfinder to draw certain conclusion or certain inference from given set of facts75 on the other hand an inference does not compel specific conclusion but merely applies to the rational potency or probative value of an evidentiary fact to which the factfinder may attach whatever force or weight it deems best 76 thomas observed that statutes prohibiting possession of drugs implied an intent to distribute based upon the quantity of drugs held and nothing more77 in thomass opinion these possession with intent statutes operated in much the same way as the statute at issue in this case78 justice thomas also dissented from the courts constitutional analysis of the statute justice thomas argued that banning crossburning did not implicate the first amendment because the statute banned conduct only79 in tracing the history of the crossburning statute at issue justice thomas noted that the law was enacted in 1952 time when the virginia legislature was controlled by segregationists80 the legislature recognized that crossburning was terrorizing conduct and punishable for that reason81 it is unlikely in justice thomass view that state legislature that thoroughly supported segregation and the superiority of the white race would have intended to proscribe the message of white racial superiority82 rather the legislature considered 70 id at 374 71 id at 375 internal citation omitted 72 id 73 id at 374 74 id 75 id 76 id at 395

the conduct not expression83 as result justice thomas saw reason to analyze the statute under the first amendment84 justice souter also wrote separately joined by justices kennedy and ginsburg85 justice souter would have found the statute unconstitutional86 he disagreed with the courts interpretation of rav and the application of the particular virulence exception outlined in that case to cross burnings87 rather souter would have analyzed the virginia statute for whether its nature is such that there is realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot88 regardless of that distinction justice souter did not believe either conviction could be upheld when considering the entire statute as it was applied to the accused89 in souters view the primary effect of the prima facie evidence clause is to skew jury deliberations toward conviction in cases where the evidence of intent to intimidate is relatively weak and arguably consistent with solely ideological reason for burning 90 in that way souter viewed the statute as suppressing ideas to an unacceptable degree91 on the basis of black it would appear that without offending first amendment precepts law may proscribe cross burning and similar exhibits intended to convey true threats whether it may proscribe only those true threats that also include hate crime element of the type found in the ordinance in

may be struck down on grounds that it is overly broad95 where statute proscribes conduct rather than pure speech the supreme court is less likely to invalidate the statute on overbreadth grounds as the conduct statute prohibits moves further from the realm of pure speech toward conduct that may fall within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws like harassment or terroristic threats the protected speech that may be deterred cannot with confidence justify invalidating the statute on its face 96 as justice scalia pointed out in black where statute regulates expressive conduct the scope of the statute does not render it unconstitutional unless its overbreadth is not only real but substantial judged in relation to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep97 as result statutes that ban conduct which may otherwise be expressive likely must create danger of deterring substantial amount of protected speech in order to be declared facially overbroad statutes banning expressive conduct that may be considered true threats are not immune however to facial overbreadth challenge faced with the problem of potential unconstitutionality state courts by and large have used the canons of statutory construction to limit the reach of statutes to proscribe only true threats as defined by the court in black 98 accepted rules of statutory construction instruct courts to when feasible construe the regulatory effects of statutes challenged under the first amendment to punish only expression which falls outside the amendments protection 99 using this general principle courts have read statutes to prohibit only those constitutionally proscribable forms of expression taking care to avoid applying the statute to protected speech100 as the supreme court held in black statutes such as those addressed in this report if interpreted by state courts only to prohibit conduct that amounts to intimidation or expressions meant to communicate serious threat of harm would likely pass

not reach substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct it may be impermissibly vague because it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to protect against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests101 yet there is nothing inherently vague about statutes that outlaw the use with the intent to threaten of burning crosses or other harbingers of violence although as with any type of statute they may be imprecisely drawn upon occasion102 g8g146g144g145g157g146g151g144g561g25g152g155g141g156g561 cross burning and comparable exhibits may provoke anger as well as fear laws that condemn threats have sometimes been defended on the ground fighting words lie beyond the pale of the first amendments protection this category of unprotected speech is of somewhat uncertain dimensions rav is fighting words case yet the court in black opted for true threat mode of analysis instead on the other hand in black it elected to distinguish rather than reject or ignore rav the fighting words doctrine begins in chaplinsky v new hampshire where the court held that fighting words by their very utterance inflict inju ry or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace and may be punished consistent with the first amendment 103 in chaplinsky the court upheld statute which prohibited person from addressing any offensive derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place calling him by any offensive or derisive name or making any noise or exclamation in his presence and hearing with the intent to deride offend or annoy him or to prevent him from pursuing his lawful business or occupation 104 the state court construed the statute as forbidding only those expressions as have direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom individually the remark was addressed 105 given the limited scope of application the supreme court held that the statute at issue did not proscribe protected expression106 101 chicago v morales 525 us 41 52 1999citing kolender v lawson 461 us 352 358 1983 102 lansdell v state ___ so2d ___ ___ 2007 wl 2811969 alacrimapp sept 28 2007finally we note

to define within the bounds of the constitution and requires the threat of an immediate breach of peace in order to be punishable in cohen v california the supreme court held that words on tshirt that contained an expletive were not directed at person in particular and could not be said to incite an immediate breach of the peace107 for that reason profane words that are not accompanied by any evidence of violence or public disturbance are not fighting words108 the court went on to describe the value of expression in communicating emotion109 in the courts view certain words including expletives which could in other contexts be construed as fighting words may be indispensable in effectively communicating emotion form of expression protected by the first amendment110 in brandenburg v ohio the supreme court struck down an ohio statute that criminalized advocating violent means to bring about social and economic change111 the court found that the statute failed to distinguish between advocacy which is protected by the first amendment and incitements to imminent lawless action which are not protected112 these cases illustrate that fighting words require an immediate risk of breach of peace in order to be proscribable what speech is proscribable therefore appears highly dependent upon the context in which it arises113 moreover it can hardly escape notice that rav involved law that outlawed cross burning with the intent to annoy while black involved law that outlawed cross burning with the intent to threaten the first the court found impermissible the second it said offended only because an attendant provision effectively read the intent to threaten out of the proscription g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 to the extent that statutes of the types identified in this report ban expressive conduct that falls outside the protection of the first amendment the laws generally pass constitutional muster when the laws can be read to encompass expressive conduct that is normally protected by the united states constitution as well as traditionally criminal conduct the statute likely must chill substantial amount of protected conduct in order to be deemed facially invalid courts may limit their interpretations of statutes that appear to sweep too broadly on their faces to encompass only those forms of expression that are constitutionally proscribable 107 403 us 15 20 1971 108 id 109 id at 26 110 id 111 395 us 444 446 1969 per curiam 112 id at 448 113 see odem v mississippi 881 so2d 940 948 miss ct app 2004finding that complaints and
