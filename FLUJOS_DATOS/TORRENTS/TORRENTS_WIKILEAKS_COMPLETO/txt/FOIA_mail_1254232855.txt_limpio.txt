case of removing number of the adjectives it is important to keep the moral high ground in this if just to show how comment on paper should be written and submitted to the same journal that had the poor paper in the first instance might be worth reiterating this if any of us get called when the comment does come out there does seem trend these days to slam paper on blogs with attempt to submit comment to journal agree on the running meanderivative issue the spectral diagram is better scatter plots arent that useful unless theys might help with the parts but its obvious from the time series plots and the rsquareds are so different finally there was this comment via jim s from neville nicholls i vaguely recall angell and korshover papers from that time the attached refers to some of them also found newell and weare this isnt the first but it might be worth adding attached this one from science as well neville nicholls wrote hi jim i hop things are going well with you thanks for being part of this robust response to the latest silliness you have certainly gathered an illustrious group of coauthors i am disappointed that you didnt cite the very early 1970s work by newell and weare and by angell and korshover i think you should squeeze these in to demonstrate that the climate community did not have to wait for mclean et to understand the influence of enso on global temperatures in fact our colleagues in the 1970s understood this and demonstrated it much more scientifically than does the mclean et paper cheers neville cheers phil at 2145 28092009 kevin trenberth wrote hi all about time incidentally i gave copy to mike mcphaden and discussed it with him last week when we were together at the oceanobs09 conference mike is president of agu basically this is an acceptance with couple of suggestions for extras and some suggestions for toning down the rhetoric i had already tried that bit my reaction is that the main thing is to expedite this that means extras unless it really makes sense and removal of few unnecessary words like absolutely in the abstract we have number of such adjectives that could be removed i agree with rev 3 in this greatly overstates could be just overstates as it is reinforced better later severely overestimates could be just overestimates faulty analysis maybe flawed analysis extremely high maybe very high or unduly high i would leave last sentence alone though as the main comment few more comments embedded below grant foster wrote from 1jgratmospheresaguorg date mon 28 sep 2009 155405 0000 to 2tamino_9hotmailcom subject 2009jd012960 editor steve ghandecision letter cc 3twistor9gmailcom manuscript number 2009jd012960 manuscript title comment on influence of the southern oscillation on tropospheric temperature by j d mclean c r freitas and r m carter reviewer comments reviewer 1 comments this paper does an excellent job of showing the errors in the analytical methods used by mclean et and why their conclusions about the influence of enso on global air temperature is incorrect i have only couple of suggestions to help clarify their analysis of the methods first little more explanation of the comment about the time derivative reduced to an additive constant would help second in the analysis of the artificial time series i think it would be interesting to show the results of both steps of filtering running mean and derivative as separate time series this would help the reader understand why the filtering creates false correlations the only other suggestion is to find better adjective than faulty in the abstract to characterize the analysis it is not so easy to see the result from the derivative owing to the phase shift the spectrum actually does better job i would address this comment in this way and change faulty reviewer 2 comments i think this comment on mclean et can be published more or less as is i have two comments first in the abstract page 3 line 15 im not sure that inflating is quite the right verb the paper itself does not make the point that the filter constructed by mclean et inflates power in the 26 year window perhaps isolating would be better verb yes it should not be in abstract if not in text need to point out that the response function in fig 1 is greater than unity and does inflate so adjust the text secondly i think the points that are being made with figures 4 and 5 could be strengthened by adding to the right of each plot of pair of time series scatter plot of the pairs of values available at each time such scatter plot would help to clearly illustrate the absence upper panels or presence lower panels of correlation between red and black values i dont think this helps there is nothing to be gained from scatter plot that correlation or regression value does not summarize reviewer 3 comments accept pending major changes mainly in style not scientific comment the real mystery here of course is how the mclean et paper ever made it into jgr how that happened i have idea i cant see it ever getting published through j climate the analyses in mclean et are among the worst i have seen in the climate literature the paper is also poorly guised attack on the integrity of the climate community and i guess that is why foster et have taken the energy to contradict its findings so the current paper foster et should certainly be accepted someone needs to address the science in the mclean et paper in the peerreviewed literature but the current paper could be and should be done better thats why i am suggesting major changes before the paper is accepted all of my suggestions have to do more with the tone and framing of the current paper rather than its content 1 as noted above i agree mclean et is problematic but as it is written the current paper almost stoops to the level of blog diatribe the current paper does not read like peerreviewed journal article the tone is sometimes dramatic and sometimes accusatory it is inconsistent with the language one normally encounters in the objectivelybased peerreviewed literature for examples in the abstract do you really need all of these adjectivesgreatly overstates severely overestimates faulty analysis extremely high agree see above in the introduction unfortunately their conclusions are seriously in error strikes as overly subjective better to say we will demonstrate that their conclusions are strongly dependent on or something like that dont go that far could drop seriously but they are in error page x6 tell us absolutely nothing surely its enough to state tell us nothing agree page x9 it is misleading thats strong word it may be true but i think we should rise above such accusations misleading is ok i did search not sure i have latest and found grossly misleading and the grossly could be removed anyway im sure the lead author gets my point i think the current paper will have much greater impact and can claim the high road if it is rewritten in more objective manner 2 similarly instead of framing the paper as taking down mclean et why not focus more on interesting aspects of the science such as the frequency dependence between enso and globalmean temperature perhaps crosscorrelation analysis would be useful the importance of not extrapolating results from one timescale to another timescale or the lack of trends in enso that way the current paper contributes to the peerreviewed literature while also doing service by highlighting the problems with mclean et i think i tried to emphasize that this should be teaching moment even more important given the time lapse 3 in general the current paper is sloppy and needs tightening i dont think the lead author needs 10 pages of text to make the main points so over to you to generate the next draft
