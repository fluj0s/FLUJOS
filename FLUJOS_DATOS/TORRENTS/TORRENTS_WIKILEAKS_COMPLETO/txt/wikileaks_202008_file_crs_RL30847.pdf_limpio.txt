1996 farm bill was designed to provi gradually declining fixe d payments to producers of major crops grains and cotton while giving them more flexibility to plant in response to market signals among othe r provisions however unanticipated persistently low commodity prices and 3 years of multibillion dollar ad hoc emergency farm aid packages to supplement the assistance programmed through the 1996 law have raised questions about its effectiveness ma ny have expressed preference for more reliable met hod of supporting farm income than ad hoc laws and are pushing for variety of changes to accomplish that in new bill questions of equity eg who should get aid and how much program cost impacts on trade competitiveness and the environment are among the considerations in this debate the economic prosperity of the us farm sector is heavily dependent upon exports so the provisions of new bill r eauthorizing farm export and foreign food aid programs also will be of keen interest these provisions also might become venue for providing guidance regarding fa rm sector goals and objectives to us officials negotiating new multilateral round of agricultural trade reforms as well as several new bilateral and regional agreements moreover the agricultural credit research conservation domes tic nutrition assistance nd rural development titles will bring an array of interests into

and food legislation in an omnibus multiyear authorizing bill commonly called the farm bill federal farm support food assistance ag ricultural trade marketing and rural development policies are governed by vari ety of separate laws however many of these laws periodically are evaluated re vised and renewed through an omnibus multiyear farm bill of course these policies can and sometimes are modified or overhauled as freestanding authorizing legislation or as part of other laws however periodic farm bills have pr ovided congress the administration and interest groups with an opportunity to r eexamine agricultural and food issues more carefully and address them more comprehensively the federal agriculture improvement and reform fair act of 1996 pl 104127 was the most recent omnibus farm bill and many of its provisions expire in 2002 without new legislation notably in the area of farm income and commodity price support programs permanent statutes w ould take effect mo st of these statutes were enacted decades ago and are longer compatible with current national economic objec tives global trading rules and federal budgetary or regulatory policies in fact these largely outdated permanent laws have been kept on the books in part to compel an increasingly urban and suburban congress to pay attention to national agricultural policy the heart of every omnibus farm bill is farm income and commodity price support policy namely the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers however farm bills typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food aid conservati on and environment domestic food assistance primarily food stamps agricultural credit rural development agricultural research and ducation and marketin grelated programs often such miscellaneous provisions as global warmin g food safety and animal health and welfare are added this omnibus nature of the farm bill creates broad coalition of support among conflicting interests for policies that individually might not survive the legislative process among the gr oups l obbying c ongress will be farm and commodity organizations input suppliers commodity handlers processors retailers and exporters foreign customers and competitors universities and scientific organizations domestic consumers and food assistance advocates environmentalists and rural communities so for example farm state lawmakers look to urbanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs2 1 see appendix b for table of contents of the 1996 farm law 2 commission on 21st century production agriculture directions for future farm policy the role of government in support of production agriculture january 2001legislators support for commodity price supports in exchange for their votes on domestic food aid and vice versa the 1996 farm b ill had 9 titles and some 300 pages much shorter than the 1990 farm bill which consiste d of 25 titles and over 700 pages1 farm bills and the programs they encompass are complex tightly intertwined and intensely interactive changes to one program of ten have unintended consequences for others for example legislative change that raises corn prices must be examined for how it might change the planting decisions of thos who grow other crops such as soybeans and in turn the cost of the support program for soybeans likewise change in the corn program can have major implications for producers who feed corn to dairy cows beef cattle and other animals for gar producers and processors who can use corn syrup in place of sugar for many pr oducts for consumers including those on limited food budgets and for exporters and fo reign competitors the level and type of support provided also can affect farm quipment companies agricultural investors and rural financial instituti ons fertilizer and pesticide suppliers and farmdependent rural communities congressional action the farm bill likely will not be the only legislation in the 107th congress affecting the farm sector lawmakers also are or will be considering welfare legislation tax reform trad legislation governmentwide budget resolutions and various appropriations bills all of them closely followed by farm interests in reality federal farm po licy is an ongoing issue for lawmakers the 1996 law was intended to guide agricultural s upport through 2002 but unanticipated economic problems forced congress to be gin the next farm bill debate in 1998 when it considered and passed the first of series of ad hoc measures that have pumped many billions of dollars in supplemen tal aid into the farm sector see farm income and commodity price support on page 8 in 2000 the house agriculture committee held numerous hearings on the 2002 farm bill most of them in various parts of the country this year in late january both the house and senate agriculture committees formally resumed work by holding separate hearings to receive the recommendations of the commission on 21st century production agriculture blueribbon panel of experts established by the 1996 farm bill to advise cong ress on future policy changes2 both committees are holding additional hearings in early 2001 for example the house committee has focused heavily on proposed changes to commodity price and income support programs already taking testimony fro m approximately 20 separate general agriculture and commodity organizations the house chairman has indicated desire to pass at least the commodity support titles of farm bill this year effort s to do so were bolstered when the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs3 on march 28 2001 passed its budget resoluti on which would allow for more future spending to be devoted to agriculture if the house agriculture committee reports legislation authorizing new commodity and farm income support title by july 11 2001 see the federal budget on page 4 however several other members of congress including leaders of the senate agriculture committee have indicated that omnibus legislation including the comm odity section may not pass congress until 2002 related policy considerations economic situation for the last 3 years lower demand for us agricultural exports due to the global economic slowdown the continuing high value of the us dollar and abundant world supplies have contributed to sharply wer prices for major farm commodities slowly recovering world ec onomy is expected to stimulate rise in the value of farm exports to 53 billion in fy2001 above the recent low of 49 billion in fy1999 but still short of the record high of nearly 60 billion in fy1996 according to the us department of agriculture usda farm export volumes for many items are expected by usda to continue to experience growth in the coming years but prices and therefore overall value of exports will recover more slowly due to large production and stocks the trade outlook is important to farm ers because exports account for 20 to 25 of the value of their production and one third of harvested acreage is exported farm income also is affected by other factors not the least of them government subsidies usda forecast data show that 2000 net cash farm income at 564 billion has remained close to the annual av erage of the 1990s due largely to record high direct payments to farmers th is has helped to undergird the value of agricultural land and other asse ts keep farm debt at favor ably low levels and protect farm operator incomes production expenses until recently relatively low have been on the rise due to higher fertilizer fuel in terest rate and other input costs usda predicts that absent another round of emer gency payments for farmers ie over and above what they are programmed to receive under the 1996 farm law us farm net cash income could drop below 51 billion in 2001 changes in farm income also have impacts on rural communities and businesses that depend on the agricultural sector m eanwhile if the us economy in general continues to cool unemployment coul d rise and nonfarm household incomes decline that would bode higher costs for the food stamp program where spending is directly affected by employment and in come changes so the food stamp as well as the rural development titles of new farm bill could become even more prominent issues in the next year or twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs4 3 the

gross outlays fy2000the federal budget like all areas of the federal budget agri culture and other programs in the farm bill face spending constraints imposed by c ongress these constraints begin to take shape with the start of the annual congre ssional budget process when the house and senate budget committees recommend maximum spending levels for broad functional categories once these limits are approved by congress via the annual budget resolution program spending cannot be increased that would breach these limits unless either 1 they are offset by increased revenue or cuts in other programs or 2 congress and the president declare the extra spending to be emergency3 farm bill budget categories most of the major programs that assist production agriculture including commod ity price and income supports crop insurance farm credit marketing and agricultural research fall within socalled function 350 the agriculture function of th federal budget other functional areas of spending administered by usda in clude food stamps under function 600 income security conser vation programs under func tion 300 the natural resources category foreign food aid under function 150 the international affairs category and so forth so although most of these programs are addressed by the agriculture committees in an omnibus farm bill they are scattered throughout the federal budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs5 4 the food stamp program accounted for bout 189 billion of the 33 billion food and nutrition category farm and foreign agricu lture outlays likely exceeded food assistance program outlays for fy2000 due to the 305 billion cost of commodity credit corporation ccc farm spending 5 these figures refer to farm spending by the ccc the usda entity cr eated specifically to finance operations of the departments farm price income support and related programsfor scorekeeping purposes see figure 14 in fact spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farmers nor with the farm or appropriations bills adding further complexity some programs within each functional category are considered mandatory spending while ot hers are discretionary examples of mandatory spending are the major farm commodity price support programs and the food stamp program funding needs fo r mandatory programs are determined indirectly in the house and senate agriculture committees when they write directly into the authorizing laws the eligibility standards and benefit levels for these programs as long as this funding does not exceed levels permitted in the separate congressional budget resolution the appr opriations committees then generally are expected to provide the necessary eartoyear funding in the annual usda appropriation examples of discretionary spending are agricultural research and extension and farm marketing services while discreti onary programs also are designed and authorized in the house and senate agriculture committees their annua l funding levels are not set until the house and senate appropriations committees decide on them as part of the annual usda appropr iations bill of course both mandatory and discretionary program authorizations and spending still ultimately must be approved by the full house and senate after they ar reported by the relevant committees before either the agriculture committees or appropriations committees make these decisions by drafting the appropriate legislation whether it is new farm bill an annual usda appropriation or some other measure the panels must know how much room they have been allocated under the congressional budget resolution the baseline thus the opening stages of debate over new farm and food policy usually occur in the budget committees both the administration and the congressional budget office cbo independently estimate what the level of usda spending will be in coming years based on current policy generally meaning the continuation of existing law and on dditional assumptions about likely economic and market conditions the debate focuses on whether these estimates the baseline are appropriate or whether mo re and possibly less spending should be built into the baseline usually congress uses the cbo baseline for the major farm income and price support programs cbo in december 2000 timated that annual spending will be about 102 billion in fy2002 and 92 billion in fy20035 the cbo annual baseline generally continue s to decline from just under 92 billion in fy2004 tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs6 about 53 billion in fy2008 as well as in fy2009 which conceivably might be the final years of new omnibus farm bill however ccc farm spending including emergency aid was about 305 billion in fy2000 and is projected at 173 billion for fy2001 unless as many anticipate congress again provides additional emergency assistance this year earlier each congressional author izing committee submitted to the budget committees its recommendations for spendi ng on programs under its jurisdiction although the agriculture committees did not request specific dollar amounts for additional farm assistance they did ask the budget committees to provide them with the flexibility they might need to provide ad hoc assistance this year as well as to make possible changes to authorized fa rm commodity support programs once they expire in 2002 the house budget committee completed markup of the fy2002 budget resolution hconres 83 on march 21 2001 which the full house approved by 222205 vote on ma rch 28 although the housepassed resolution does not specifically increase allocations for fa rm commodity support spending it does support the administration proposal for the use of reserve fund to finance future new farm spending needs for the near term section 8 of hconres 83 as passed by the house allows the chairman of the house budget committee to increase allocations for farm spending in fy2001 if legislation is considered authorizing financial assistance to crop growers for l onger term farm spending needs section 6 allows the budget committee chairman to increase agricultural spending in fy2002 by july 25 2001 if the house agriculture committee reports legislation authorizing new farm bill commodity title by july 11 2001 the full senate completed its versi on of hconres 83 on april 6 where senators earlier approved floor amendm ent to add to the baseline about 635 billion more for mandatory agriculture spending over the next 10 years more of the funds would be available in the earlier than later years of that period it is expected that housesenate conference after the spring recess will resolve differences in the two measures coalition of major farm and commodity organizations have been urging congress to provide at least 12 billion more annually the final level obtained will be key determinant in the type of programs lawmakers design for new farm bill international trade us international trade obligations mo st notably under the multilateral uruguay round agreement on agriculture uraa pos another constraint on farm program design and spending ge nerally that agreement pl aces countries domestic farm support programs into one of several broad categorie s based on their relative likelihood to distort trade major agri cultural trading countries are required to discipline limit total spending ie th eir aggregate measure of support or ams for their most tradedistorting socalled amber box policies countries report to the world trade organization wto on their domestic farm spending for each year the united states like virtually all othe r countries has been reporting that its ams has been below its allowable annual vels the last year it reported was forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs7 6 countries including the unite d states do not have to count amber box subsidies toward their total ams if the total support provided by all of them is less than 5 of the value of production the socalled minimis exclusion if the subsidies apply to specific commodity eg wheat sugar milk etc then the 5 rule applies to the production value of that commodity only if the subsidies are noncommodity specific then the 5 rule applies to the value of the count rys total agricultural production 7 see above footnote however as of ea rly april 2001 the united states had not yet submitted its ams notification to the wto for any of these 3 years so how the payments will be counted was still not known1997 from 2000 on the united states cannot exceed 191 billion in ams spending us amber box programs that generally might be counted toward ams include dairy peanut and sugar price suppor ts crop marketing loans loan deficiency payments and other direct payments linked to perunit levels of production storage payments and crop insurance and loan interest subsidies among others6 the least tradedistorting programs socalled green box are exempt from ams limits green box programs include income suppor ts not coupled to current production or prices such as the payments going to producers who signed 7year production flexibility contracts under the agricultural market transition act amta in the 1996 farm bill conservation nd environmental activities such as the conservation reserve program crp farm disaster relief payments and domestic food aid like food stamps the uraa does provide latitude to us policymakers in developing domestic support measures that can both provide sign ificant aid to producers but at the same time comply with wto obligations some analysts argue for example that the united states will be able to claim that the emergency market loss payments congress has provided to amta contract holders for 3 consecutive years 1998 1999 and 2000 are exempt from ams commitments because either 1 they are not tied to current production and prices or 2 they are not commodityspecific and therefore the subsidies could be measured against total us production value for all commodities keeping the level below the 5 minimis exclusion7 on the other hand some member nations of the wto c ould argue that the payments were made specifically in response to immediate price and supply cond itions and were so large as to affect world trading patterns thereby undermining the objectives of the agreement the question could become point of contention in the wto negotiations to further reform agricu ltural trade which are now under way as congress begins to consider ne w farm bill other countries will be evaluating whether in their view future programs comply with the uraa moreover the united states is pressing the eu for further cutbacks in its own domestic supports and continue d additions to the us programs by congress might undermine that us negotiatin g position some have argued meanwhile congress will likely be seekin g support methods that it can justify as uraacompliant thus farm policy proposals tied to conservation rural development andor resour ce retirement or those providing subsidies to producers irrespective of what they plant or of curre nt prices might be viewed more favorably than others congress and the administration also may seek to influence futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs8 multilateral roles in ways th at are consistent with u s domestic support policy aims and measures see crs report

1996 farm law significantly revised fede ral farm support policy title i the agricultural market transition act amta eliminated variable deficiency payments which were the difference between legislated target prices and current usually lower market prices for wheat feed grains cotton and rice producers of these commodities instead are receiving production flexibility contract pfc payments which are lump sum benefits that decline each year these are provided irrespective of current market prices or planting choices supply controls in the form of specific annual acreage bases and cropla nd setasides were ended by the 1996 law because it was argued they distorted pr oduction decisions and ceded export markets to foreign competitors who increased output whenever us farmers had to cut acreage in order to receive subsidies with federal payments decoupled from production under the 1996 law farmers were encouraged to plant for market returns rather than federal program benefits and were given broad planting flexibility the 1996 farm law was enacted at time when farm prices were at high levels and foreign markets were expanding greatly the major crop producers or owne rs of the land where these crops had usdaassigned bases prior to 1996 were set to receive total of about 36 billion in contract payments over the 7year life of the law in addition the 1996 law maintained some price protection by providing countercyclical marketing loan assistan ce for amta commodities and for soybeans and minor oilseeds under this program farmers who take out usda crop loans are permitted to repay them upon maturity at market prices if these prices are less than the original perunit bushel pound loan ra the difference is in effect revenue subsidy moreover those eligible for but not taking the crop loan also receive an equivalent subsidy called loan deficiency payment ldp ccc net outlays for loanrelated activities including ldps were 16 billion in fy1998 48 billion in fy1999 98 billion in fy2000 and are projected at 66 billion in fy2001 according to usda the 1996 law also had paved the way for elimination of the l ongstanding dairy price support program whereby the gove rnment steps in to buy surplus cheese butter and nonfat dry milk whenever farm milk prices decline below statutorily determined level sugar price support which operates primarily through ccc loans was continued although without domestic marketing contro ls the peanut program whereby domestic prices ar protected through production quotas and higher price support for quota peanuts also was

farmers 19802001fdevelopments since 1996 at the time of passage objections to the 1996 law were heard from some who worried about inadequate c ountercyclical income support in the law if prices fell in fact this began to happen late in 1997 this followed seve ral years of unusually good growing conditions in many parts of th world financial crisis in key growth markets for us farm goods asia and latin america and rise in the value of the us dollar against other currencies falling commodity prices substantially reduced farm income and the congress stepped in with several emergency measures to increase government payments to farmers after 3 years of such emergency measures this aid along with the rising cost of the loan programs increased farm subsidies well above the levels anticipated under the 1996 policy from 1998 to 2000 these emergency measures provided total of approximately 25 billion in farm and related assistan ce over and above amounts already authorized by the 1996 law alt hough substantial portion was for disaster assistance eg drought flooding etc about 17 billion of it was in response to falling commodity prices nearly 14 billion of the 17 billion went to those with amta production flexibility contracts mu ch of the rest of the economic non disaster aid was for special subsidies for producers of soybeans and other oilseeds peanuts tobacco milk honey wool and mohair in effect congress revived programs for the latter three commodities which earlier it had eliminated in addition the dairy price support program s been extended twice and though it is now scheduled to expire at the end of calendar 2001 will likely be extended againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs10 who farms today the 1997 census of agriculture counted approximately 19 million farms these can be divided into at least three distinct groups most of which remain familyrun operations however more detailed breakdown of these census statistics shows that the sector is much more diverse in production income and economic wellbeing than indicated below large commercial operations about 157000 commercial farms with nnual agricultural sales of 250000 or more about 900000 on average account for 8 of all farms but 72 of all us production value such farms depend primarily on agriculture for their income the bulk of which comes from market sales not government payments although sizeable portion of such payments do go to such farms midsized farms about 189000 farms with annual sales between 100000 and 250000 about 160000 on average account for about 10 of all farms and 15 of us production value operators of these farm s obtain 57 of their household income from nonfarm sources some are sound and others are severely stressed economically small farms these are the nearly 16 million remaining farms with average sales of less than 100000 annually and 16000 on average they receive virtually all of their household income from nonfarm sources and are considered farms primarily because of their location character and the fact that census defines farm as any place that sold as little as 1000 in agricultural products however some of these smallest farms are operated by socalled limitedresource farmers who have little or other income in 2000 direct government payments to farmers reached 22 billion figure representing over onehalf of net farm income and some 40 of net cash income for the calendar year figure 2 from usda data of this total 95 billion came from the emergency farm aid the rest was primarily from higher marketing loan subsidies already programmed under the 1996 w in recent years government farm subsidies actually have reached recordhigh levels but they have helped the overall farm economy remain in rela tively strong financial cond ition at least through early 2001 according to usda the case for federal farm support apparent inequities in the distribution of program benefits the economic well being of todays farm households and the comparatively small role of farming in the employment and income base of many rural communities have challenged the original justifications for the price support programs when the programs were created in the 1930s farms were by todays standards smaller and poorer played larger role in their local economies and shared relatively equally in the production of the nations supplies of food and fiber today by contrast average farm operator household income exceeds the national average for all us households rural economies are except in few areas far more diverse and farming is much more segmented and specialized farm payments including the emergency aid of 19982000 by design still are effectively based on output rather than being targeted to farmers who are the most economically distressed for these and other reasons critics question why nonfarmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs11 8 commission on 21st century production agriculture 9 these arguments are made in greater detail in the commissions reporttaxpayers should transfer an average of 114 billion annually over the past 10 years in support to farmers and primarily those farmers gr owing selected commodities defenders of the current system argue th at federal farm pr ograms are intended to maintain the productive and competitive cap acity of us agriculture not serve as welfare for individually needy farms healthy agricultural sector is vital to the national economy where the net value of agricultural goods and services accounted for 90 billion nnually during the last 5 years8 the overall food and fiber sector accounts for more than 15 of gross dome stic product and 18 of us civilian employment however the majority of t hose percentages are contributed by offfarm industries such as inputs processing marke ting etc agricu lture deserves special consideration because it is highly volatile industry subject to highly priceinelastic demand the vagaries of biologicallybased production variable weather patterns and volatile world market forces it has been ar gued government s upport helps to assure an abundant supply of safe reasonablypr iced food produced in an environmentally sound manner9 selected issues and options many policy makers and farm groups are pushing for policy changes that would provide more reliable method fo r supporting farm income than ad hoc laws and pushing for more assurance that the money will be available when needed in future years meanwhile though the complexities and political consider ations inherent in major reauthorization of farm policy make it likely that another supplemental ad hoc funding package will be considered this year debate over both shortterm relief and longterm policy changes involve such issues as 1 competition for additional money with those pursuing other policy interests such as tax re lief deficit reducti on or social security and medicare reforms 2 the extent to which policy changes might weaken the underlying market orientation goal of changes made by th 1996 farm law 3 which commodity groups should benefit from policy changes and by how much and 4 conformance with trade agreement caps on domestic support for agriculture and with the us negotiating position that the european uni on eu and other pa rties should reduce tradedistorting farm support agricultural interest groups have offere d variety of options for modifying current farm policies except as noted th options discussed below mainly apply to policies for wheat feed grains upland cotton rice and oilseeds pfc payments most although not all organi zations that have testified to date have called for conti nuation of lump sum production flexibility contract pfc payments some have r ecommended increased annual f unding which will total about 4 billion in the final year of th current program perhaps as more permanent alternative to the annual ad hoc supplements that have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs12 appropriated for pfc recipients since 1998 some want increased pfc payments so that eligibility can be expanded to include soybean and other oilseeds acreage one question is whether additional commodity groups should share in any expanded amta funding such as the tobacco peanut milk wool mohair apple and cranberry producers who recently received direct payments under the emergency funding laws another issue is whether the basis for awarding pfc payments ought to be revised eg by using more recent pl anting histories allowing entry of farmers who did not produce contract crops wh amta was adopted in 1996 etc countercyclical assistance there is growing interest in the concept of countercyclical assistance where supplemental payments would be made when farm income declines below predetermined leve l and halted when income is above that level the commission on 21st century production agri culture recommended such supplemental income suppor t sis which would pa producers when national aggregate program crop gross income ie th at for all wheat feed grains cotton and rice falls below some percentage of the income level for those crops in an earlier base period others have called for mo re targeted countercyclical aid the american farm bureau federation afbf for example has recommended that such payments be made when any states as opposed to national gross cash receipts for particular commodity wheat oilseeds co tton rice feed grains or oilseeds fall below predetermined level this level could be recent 4year average ie 1996 1999 of receipts for the crop afbf has stated countercyclical programs vers ions had been proposed in 2000 by representative stenholm and by the clinton administration effectively might provide compensation for lost revenue regardless of whet her they were due to poor yields or low prices proponents assert that because payments would not be tied directly to current prices or production th ey could be exempt from disciplines under the uraa others disagree noting that revenues are in fact product of price times pr oduction therefore designing the tails of any such program will pose challenges for policymakers as they consider both trade and budgetary impacts marketing loan assistance so far there appears to be widespread support among agricultural interests for continuation of marketing loans and loan deficiency payments however past proposals to alter their operation are again on the table options include revising or removing the cap on loan rates so that loan deficiency payments rise or fall with prices or income extending loan terms fixing loan rates at higher legislativelyspecified levels andor removing the secretarys discretion to lower rates the national farmers uni on nfu for example has proposed that rates be set annua lly at not less than 80 of the 3year moving average of the full economic cost of production per unit per planted acre as calculated by the economic research service utilizing the most recently available data

will be seeking concessions on their use in the next round of reforms so during the reauthorization deliberations spending and program design will hinge not only on domestic questions such as budget impact but also trade negotiation considerations some members of congress also have questioned the effectiveness of these programs in particular do export subsidy and market promotion activities actually increase overseas sales or simply displace those that would have occurred anyway moreover even if sales increase do they translate into substantially higher farm prices and incomes or might direct fa rm subsidies be more costeffective approach some critics claim that these programs benefit prima rily large food and export companies who can afford to pay for such activities themselves or foreign buyers more than us producers defenders cite studies claiming positive outcomes from such spending although both sides agree that more critical analysis is needed with regard to food aid there are compla ints that it is primarily convenient outlet for us farm surpluses and source of aid that tends to diminish when these surpluses decline such critics could be seeking some reassurance of more stability in us food aid levels ven though they agree the united states has been the leading provider of food aid worldwide questions regarding food aids effects on commercial sales and on developing countries farm ec onomies also arise research into these questions so far has produced mixed results suggesting among other things the possible need to examine food aid impact s more closely on casebycase basis one issue that could recei ve closer attention is the performance of 300 million pilot global food for education initiative the outgoing clinton administration used ccc funds to launch this initiative to help establish school and preschool food programs in 38 developing countries also known as global school lunch the effort is bein g operated mostly through the world

perception of its value could help them decide whether or not to explicitly authorize more permanent program with stable funding with variety of multilateral regional and bilateral trade negotiations ongoing or planned the farm bill could become vehicle for further congressional guidance on negotiating objectives and strategy at the same time some segments of agriculture could view these negotiations with trepidation par ticularly where the prospect of increased imports might pose competitive threat to their own domestic sales examples might include dairy pea nuts sugar and hortic ultural products so on the one hand agricultural interests may be pushing for language in the farm bill promoting further market reforms while on the other some groups might seek protection for their

to producers to insta ll conservation practices spending is concentrated in priority areas that have been identified in each state issues that may be addressed include raising the program authorization level the use of priority areas comparing conservation accomplishm ents under this program with the programs it replaced in the 1996 farm bill and distribution of funding between livestock and crop producers another topic that will likely receive attention is that some of the oldest sma ll watershed projects built unde r the watershed operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs19 program are reaching the end of their design life providing additional funding for rehabilitation and determining whether to consider as part of the rehabilitation process more recent environmental require ments affecting watershed projects are issues that might be raised one approach to conservation on working lands that received widespread attention in the 106th congress is embodied in the conservation security act proposal introduced by senator harkin s 3260 and representative minge hr 5511 the proposals would provide incentives to farmers to practice conservation at three different levels under 3 to 5 year contracts the paym ents would increase as higher levels of conservati on are applied widespread involvement in the drafting of these proposals make it one likely legisl ative model as the farm bill progresses in the 107th congress green payments the conservation secur ity act proposals have been characterized as form of green payments this refers to providing financial incentives to producers based on the scope of their conservation activities rather than on the volume of commodities they produce the green payment concept is seen by some as attractive because it could pr ovide new mechanism to support farm income forge stronger link between cons ervation and farm income objectives and still comply with world trade organization obligations current wto rules may exempt these types of programs from discipline because they are not considered to be tradedistorting the conservation security act proposal is one model for translating the concept of green payments into programs other variations and alternatives are reportedly being discussed reaching agreement on whether this is desirable approach and what form it should take present major challenges other options members also will be interested in extending or modifying many existing programs among these ma be legislative proposals increasing overall funding for technical assistance changing funding levels for existing programs or using mandatory sources to fund different portion of the conservation effort expanding the farmland protection program to either make more entities or more areas eligible to participate and revising eqip to make more producers eligible or to increase the effort to address water quality problems originating with agricultural activities other possible changes such as in the overall conservation mission whether current federa l staff levels are adequate or how to better monitor conservation accomplishments may also be under review for more information on conservation topics see crs issue brief ib96030 soil and water conservation issues food stamps and tefap at the end of fy2002 several provisi ons of the

couple f ood stamps from welfare and emphasize its role as nutrition support program and concerns derived from the rge cuts made in food stamps to help finance welfare reform when program reauthorization was included in the 1996 reform law differing policies states have great deal of control over tanf assistance and work rules for families depending on the rulestate tanf policies can be markedly more liberal or restrictive than food stamps federa lly established food stamp standards on the other hand envisi on relatively uniform national safety net program for virtually all those in nee d while states have number of important food stamp options they are circumscri bed by federal w and regulations conflicts between tanf and food stam p policies coupled with partially shared caseload and administrative structure have created strained relationshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs21 between the two at the state level this is exacerbated by states desire to apply their tanf policies to food stamps penalties ssessed them for erroneous benefiteligibility decisions under the food stamp quality control qc system what they see as overly complex food stam p rules and limits on waivers from federal policies many state human services ad ministrators hold that food stamps and tanf are on collision course nd have called for simplifica tion of food stamp rules and consolidating tanf and food stamp worktrai ning efforts they also want much greater control over food stamp policies to reinforce tanf goals revision of the qc system and more open waiver policy or for some conversion of food stamps to state block grants but advocates resi st vesting much more decisionmaking power in states particularly where funding is almost totally federal additionally they contend that tanfbased policies are not nece ssarily transferrable to the rest of the food stamp rolls eg elderlydisabled pe rsons lowincome working adults and fear that needy people may be discouraged from or denied participa tion in food stamps in their view the food stamp safety net should not be tampered with noncitizens the 1996 welfare reform law ended food stamp eligibility for most noncitizens amendments in the 1998 agricultural res earch law pl 105 185 restored eligibility to some primarily to childre n and the elderlydisabled resident in the us prior to welfare refo rm proposals to remove

5year cost of more than 900 million administrative payments normal federal payments to states for food stamp administrative costs 50 share are reduced by about 200 million year this expiring reduction was enacted to correct windfall states could receive in the interaction of tanf and food stamp funding rules the congressional budget office will score cost to food stamps if the reduction is not renewed access food stamp enrollment has fallen continuously and dramatically from its spring 1994 peak of 28 million people november 2000 rolls show 171 million persons this has been accompanied by large drop in the rate at which those eligible participate the participation rate went down from 71 in 1994 to 59 in 1998 most recent estimate only portion of the decline in recipients can be closely associated with better economic conditions and reformed food stamp eligibility rules while the estimated number of eligible individuals fell by 17 the number participating dropped by almost double 31 other cited reasons include administrative practices the difficulty of applying for and keeping benefits and lack of understanding that losing benef its from or being discouraged from applying for tanf does not apply to food stamp eligibility or benefits advocates and state administrators are worried that access to food stamp aid is being undermined and that those leaving tanf are not getting necessary help from food stamps the clinton administration ma several efforts to change food stamp administrative practices and regulations to support increased participation culminating with controve rsial november 21 2000 regulations food stamp amendments in the fy2001 agriculture partment appr opriations law encouraged participation with increased benefits for those with high shelter costs and eased eligibility for lowincome households with cars advocates and state administratorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs22 are expected to follow up with their own additional initiatives for better food stamp access and benefits funding for tefap in the view of state and local emergency food assistance providers tefap has served as cushion for those losing welfare or food stamp benefits under the 1996 welfare reforms ma ny also contend that federal support for tefap has not kept pace with growing demand and is well below what would be required if there is an economic dow nturn renewal of the appropriations authorization for tefap administrativedist ribution costs and the setaside of food stamp money for tefap food purchases will bring the adequacy of current support levels into the farm bill debate ther also may be calls for increasing the 100 million food stamp funding setaside to buy more commodities for the program farm credit and finance omnibus farm bills commonly contain credit title that makes policy changes to usda agricultural credit programs and addresses issues that relate to commercial lenders such as the farm credit system fcs and commercial banks credit is an important production input for ma ny farmers with all nders holding approximately 180 billion in outstanding farm loans farmers depend on longterm credit to finance their purchases of r eal estate and shorterterm loans to finance production expenses such as for machinery and equipment livestock seed feed and fertilizer usda farm credit usdas farm service agency fsa serves as lender of last resort to eligible familysized farmers whose fi nancial condition is too weak to permit them to obtain commercial credit fsa provides direct loans to farmers and also guarantees the timely repayment of

commercial loans outstanding that carried an fsa repayment guarantee fsa makes and guarantees real estate and operating loans and also makes direct emergency disaster loans these loan progra ms have permanent authority under the consolidated farm and rural development act and unlike the farm commodity programs do not require periodic reaut horization however congress frequently uses omnibus farm bills to make change s to the terms c onditions and eligibility requirements for federal farm credit programs among other provisions the credit title t itle vi of the omnibus 1996 farm bill tightened qualifications for fsa loans by limiting the number of years borrower could remain customer of fsa before be ing required to graduate to commercial lender the 1996 farm b ill also continued policy begun in the 1980s of shifting fsas financial resources from direct lending to guaranteed loans in an effort to wean farmers from federal credit progra ms and to reduce federal credit costs congress does not have to wait for the next farm bill to make policy changes to fsa farm loan programs and commonly does make adjustments to the programs in intervening years for example as the farm economy began its downturn in the late 1990s congress loosened some qualifications for loans including suspension of the graduation requireme nt until the end of 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs23 for

repeat of the severe credit crisis of the mid1980s with widespread bo rrower loan defaults andor bankruptcies so far has been avoided for two reasons supplemental government payments have provided ade quate income to help most farmers meet their debt servicing requirements plus farmers now ar not as highly debt leveraged as they were in the 1980s nonetheless the direc tion of the farm economy over the next year or two could be major dete rmining factor on what credit issues might be considered in the 2002 farm bill if commodity prices remain low and farm cash receipts weak congress might consider an extension of the postponement of borrower graduation requirements beyond 2002 as well as other forms of forbearance for fsa loan customers farm credit system issues separately issues relating to the farm credit system also could be an issue in the farm bill debate the fcs is confederation of cooperatively owned banks and ssociations it has federa l charter and is classified as government sponsored enterprise but is privately owned and operated by the memberborrowers the farm credit adminis tration the federal regulator of the system has sought to modify the lending authorities of the system through regulatory changes however commercial banks which are the primary competitors with the system are strongly opposed to these changes and contend that any major modifications should be addr essed legislatively rather than through regulations rural development variety of federal laws nd programs deal with rural policy they have been crafted by numerous congressional committees and the programs are administered by several federal agencies including usda designated as the lead federal agency for coordinating rural development by the 1980 rural policy act usda administers rural development programs that for the most part are authorized under omnibus farm laws title vii of the 1996 fa rm law fair is the rural development title its provisions along with those of most other titles of the fair act expire in 2002 changes to farm commodity programs title i of the current law will be closely examined in terms of their impact on rural communities while federal farm payments and policies have directly helped many farmers and financial institutions in many rural areas most experts agree that rural communities across the nation cannot depend on agriculture alone for their economic wellbeing first the number of farm dependent counties has declined dramatically down from overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30847crs24 2000 in 1950 to 556 in 1990 moreover changes in farm structure larger farms greater concentration in manufacturing and global competition have lessened the role of production agriculture in farmdepe ndent rural economies at the same time economic environmental and demographic changes in rural farm communities have lessened their role as facilita tors of agricultural production the rural development title of past fa rm bills generally has supported the infrastructure of rural areas with tr aditional support for housing electricity community development and so on more recently policymakers have pushed for programs that support innovative and lternative industry development and mechanisms to finance it pressure for ch alternative approaches is expected to continue as policymakers recognize the changing structure of agriculture and the diversity of rural communities with some growing and prospering and others falling further behind as their primary industries including agriculture either decline or adapt to global marketplace and econom that often means fewer employment opportunities and lost population proposals are being circulated that prom ote technologies to help farmers with planting decisions and local investments in industries that will add value to their products among others research is increasingly focused on improvements in agricultural waste management and environm ental protections traditional strategies notably valueadded agriculture eg regional food proc essing plants cooperatives organic farming are being promoted by many in the farm sector while holding promise for agriculture and surrounding communities there are limits on how many yogurt plants small dairy processors or valueadded food processors can be supported by these local economies especi ally with increasingly global competition in these sectors thus rural entrepreneurship of the past eg in the valueadded enterprises such as dairy processing facilities and processing of timber and mining resources may give way to future forms of rural trepreneurship that build around new or previously ignored resources among the options are investment innovation in agriculture from the perspective of environm ental entrepreneurship or environmental capital for example publicprivate velopment of carbon emission markets and sustainable land management innovations tied to national clean water and international agreements carbon emissions and environmenta lly sensitive land use for nonagricultural purposes eg recreation what roles if any the federal government might play in encouraging these or other types of activities are among the issues that congress may address in considering new rural development title agricultural research extension and education the 1996 farm bill included title
