types of resources paidin capital and callable capital paidin capital represents funds held by the bank and transferred to it by member countries who buy shares in the bank for votes callable capital represents promises of funds available to the asdb by its member countries callable capital cannot be used to make loans it can only be used to meet the asdbs obligations to its bondholders if the asdb ever lacks sufficient funds on account of defaults for example to repay them the money it borrowed to fund its ordinary capital

resources of the asdb the asdb provides assistance for numerous projects ranging from economic infrastructure to social programs the types of projects that the asdb funds have changed over time in its early years from 1966 to 1971 77 of funds were lent for economic infrastructure programs while only 05 went for social programs since then the share going to economic infrastructure has declined slightly while funding for social programs has grown however transportation and other large infrastructure projects continue to account for the bulk of asdb loansalmost 50 in 2005 the asdb provided 74 billion of assistance to its member countries across all operations 1 this included 580 billion lent to public and private sector operations and 115 billion in grant based financing the size of the asdbs lending portfolio has increased slightly in recent years but remains below peak lending during the east asian financial crisis in 1997 when its total operations increased to 95 billion mostly attributable to 4 billion financial sector program loan to south korea the largest asdb borrower in 2005 was china at 15 billion other top borrowers were indonesia 114 billion pakistan 776 million and vietnam 578 million as reflected in its borrower mix string of natural disasters has driven the bulk of asdb lending over the past few years in response to the december 26 2004 tsunami off the coast of aceh indonesia the asdb launched the largest grants program in its history as of december 15 2006 asdbs total approved assistance and cofinanced funds for tsunamiaffected countries stood at us 89124 million of this 72434 million or 81 is grant funding to help pakistan rebuild following the october 2005 earthquake that killed over 70000 people the asdb pledged over 1 billion for

annual real gdp growth between 1979 and 2005 averaging 97 china has emerged as major economic leader in the region china is the second largest regional shareholder behind japan with 643 of total shares and 544 of the vote despite its rapidly growing economic res ources and expanding investments throughout asia and africa china remains paradoxically some argue one of the asdbs most important borrower countries cumulatively china is the asdbs second largest debtor since joining the asdb in 1986 china has received 164 billion in total assistance some critics argue that the asdb as well as the other development banks should not lend to middleincome countries such as china that are able to raise capital on the private markets or that have welldeveloped foreign investment programs of their own ceasing such lending however would deprive the mdbs of major source of income and force them to fundamentally change their focus and overall business strategy policy shift away from lending to ddleincome countries and focusing exclusively on the needs of the poorest countries would also likely entail significantly increased levels of 1 the following data are from the 2006 asian

member countries higher levels of mdb funding may be difficu lt given increased aid budgets constraints in the united states and other mdb donor nations the growing role of china as source of development capital in asia highlights an additional concern for many that asdb assistance is not competitive with that offered by bilateral creditors and the private sector developing countries like pakistan and indonesia once unable to access the global financial markets can now access private capital relatively easily china and other emerging creditors are increasingly providing development assistance without the environmental and anticorruption standards that are requirement for borrowing from the asdb or other mdbs in asia china is providing loans to several poorer countries including cambodia laos and myanmar the likely reasons for this boost in chinas lending to its poorer neighbors are future gains from additional infrastructure in the region and the increased trade that it will be able to support reportedly cambodias prime minister boasts that chinas spring 2005 offer of 600 million of loans to pay for two bridges near the capital phnom penh hydropower plant and fiberoptic cable to create telecommunications links between cambodia vietnam and thailand had strings attached 2 furthermore an august 2006 assessment of the banks marketrate lending which drives majority of the institutions operational finances determined that the asdb may longer be meeting the needs of its marketrate lending clients effectively 3 asdb clients raised several concerns including high costs for asdb borrowing compared to other mdbs and the private sector intrusive nonfinancial costs driven by shifting asdb strategies and policies limited variety of asdb services and perhaps most distressing concern regarding the potential erosion of country and sector knowledge at the asdb4 these concerns combined with increased competition for developing country debt either from regional powerhouses like china or from private investors on the worlds capital markets have had negative effect on the institutions finances the asdbs income from its marketrate lending and other asdb investments decreased by 38 between 2001 and 2004 the bank hopes to reinvigorate its lending to middle income countries through several measures designed to decrease costs and ease constraints on borrowing this may raise concerns among some members of congress that loosening constraints on borrowing may conflict with two mdb reform area s that have been of special interest to the administration and congress increasing project oversight and greater reliance on performance based lending g22g145g142g561g3g156g146g138g151g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g561g8g158g151g141g561 the asian

australia with 218 million and the united kingdom with 202 million contributions from the asia and pacific region accounted for almost half of the replenishment contributions to the asdf do not count

asdb projects and the introduction of performancebased allocations in the agreement the asdb noted that grants are to represent 21 of total asdf funding under the new 7 billion asdf9 replenishment donors pledged new contributions of 32 billion plus some additional voluntary contributions the balance is expected to be met by additional contributions andor internal asdb resources donors also agreed to increase the weight given to good governance and strong policy performance in the system used to allocate asdf resources to borrower or grantee countries to increase resources for anticorruption activities and to establish results management unit to oversee the implementation of new results measurement strategy in november 2006 asdf donor nations undertook midterm review of asdf9 according to the chairs summary donors were generally happy with asdf progress so far but felt that implementation of the asdbs results measurement initiatives and overall framework for managing for results was too slow this echoed comments made by us alternate ed kenneth peel at the 2006 annual meetings while there has been some progress overall actual implementation of the asdf ix commitments remains disappointingly slow we appreciate the good work being done such as the resultsbased country strategies but want quantitative targets to be incorporated consistently in all projects and we need progress in implementing new incentive system that rewards staff for development impacts not increasing lending targets 5

the acu would be unit of accountcomprised of basket of regional currencies weighted by either exports or gdp sharesto support monetary integration efforts and to be used by financial market participants for regional settlement of payments and invoicing of trade transactions kurodas asdb agenda while greeted warmly by china japan and other major regional countries raised concerns among the united states and other nonregional members who worry that the new strategy may divert the asdb from its focus on poverty reduction and stray into policy issues that have traditionally been the purview of the international monetary fund at the asdbs 2006 annual meeting then us treasury under secretary timothy adams raised concerns about asdb missioncreep 9 italys asdb executive director commented that the asdb must remain firmly anchored to its vision of an asia and pacific region free from poverty all other strategic objectives must be pursued in ways that contribute to this goal10 although president kuroda has denied that increased integration efforts will crowd out the asdbs poverty work discord may increase between regional countries and the nonregional countries who are the

the 2007 annual meetings in may 2007 at the meeting president kuroda presented bank governors with report on the future role of the bank prepared by group of eminent persons chaired by unctad secretary general supachai panithpakdi the report reaffirmed president kurodas goal of reducing the banks focus on poverty alleviation in favor of asian financial integration and the needs of the regions middleincome countries while germany was supportive of the strategy and japan remained relatively neutral many criticized the bank for betraying its focus on the poorest and neediest countries and placing it in situation where the asdb would compete with other institutions such as the international monetary fund imf and asiapacific economic cooperation apec which are already involved in asian financial reform the united states reiterated its concerns arguing that the bank not lose focus on serving the needs of the extreme poor 11
