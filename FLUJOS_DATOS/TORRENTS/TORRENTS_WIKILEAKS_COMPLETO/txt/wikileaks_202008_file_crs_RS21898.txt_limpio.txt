programs including participation data it also includes discussion of selected federal issues this report will be updated as warranted by major legislative or other relevant developments introduction the 1980s ushered in many high school reform efforts in the united states most reform efforts were aimed at increasing graduation rates and preparing more students to enroll in postsecondary education statistics show that 30 of freshmen students require at least one remedial course1 in response to these factors and others many policymakers and researchers began contemplating approaches to reform the existing structure of american high schools one such alternative that arose was the concept of concurrent enrollment in high school and college the early programs were known as middle college high schools the first middle college high school opened on the campus of laguardia community college in new york city in 1973 the students who attended the school were enrolled in high school and concurrently taking college level courses for which they received college level credit the students who originally participated in laguardias middle college high school program were identified as having history of absenteeism failing core subjects possessing little to motivation or selfesteem but also possessing 1 data retrieved from the us department of education national center for education statistics postsecondary education quick information system httpncesedgovsurveyspeqis publications975843asp congressional research service the library of congress crs2 potential to pursue college education the focus on atrisk students remains an integral aspect of todays middle college programs laguardias program is viewed by many as the grandfather of concurrent enrollment programs since the inception of the program at laguardia programs with comparable structure but different foci have evolved there are two general types of concurrent enrollment programs2 dual enrollment programs whereby the student is high school student taking college courses at their high school or at local college and early entrance programs which allow high school aged students to pursue college degree or at least receive two years of college level credit within the latter group there are programs for academically gifted students and programs for students who are atrisk of failing or dropping out of high school for the purposes of this report concurrent enrollment does not include the following students who take college level courses as substitutes for their high school curriculum and receive high school credit students who participate in advanced placement courses or who take the accompanying exam for exemption from certain college courses or students who take the general educational development ged exam instead of receiving high school diploma httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21898 this report describes concurrent enrollment programs their presences and how they are funded the report also discusses federal policy issues related to concurrent enrollment programs description concurrent enrollment programs share some key similarities they also can differ in significant ways the most notable differences pertain to who instructs the course where the course is taught the costs for participating in the program if the student receives college degree and the duration of the program for example in the case of the high school based dual enrollment program students receive instruction in college level courses from high school teacher on their campus these programs are often located in rural areas where students are unable to take or experience difficulties in taking college courses on college campus in contrast in the college dual enrollment model students take high school courses at their high school campus and take regular collegelevel courses at the college in many instances the student can take collegelevel courses on the college campus during the regular school day the high school and college dual enrollment models are very similar except that in the high school model an articulation agreement exists between the two participating schools whereas this is not required in the college model moreover the college model is not necessarily formalized program as individual students can elect to take college courses while enrolled in high school without prior permission from the high school 2 concurrent enrollment programs are also frequently referred to as dual enrollment andor dual credit programs the phrase concurrent enrollment is used in this report to describe education programs that enable high school aged students who have not received high school diploma to take college level courses and receive college credit in many of these programs the students are also enrolled in high school and seeking high school diploma thus the phrase concurrent enrollment crs3 the early entrance programs both the atrisk and highly gifted models are also very similar to each other and to the dual enrollment programs in both concurrent enrollment models the students are high school aged students many participants are taking high school courses and all of the participants are taking college level courses the most consequential difference is that the participants in the early entrance model earn college degree or at least two years of college credit at the completion of the program while this can also be accomplished in the dual enrollment programs the early entrance programs are structured to produce this outcome the courses are also instructed by college faculty unlike the high school based dual enrollment model table 1 highlights the differences and similarities among the programs table 1 concurrent enrollment programs how long does the who

private foundations for additional information regarding tuition costs for specific early entrance programs see httpwwwearlyentranceorgchartshtml concurrent enrollment programs are best described as secondarypostsecondary education hybrid the programs attempt to make the transition from high school to college seamless many of the programs are designed to enhance the high school experience especially during the final two years and prepare students to enter college and graduate concurrent enrollment programs are straddling two very separate and distinct systems secondary education and postsecondary education traditionally institutions in each sector cater to an inherently different population of students the institutions have different cultures faculty missions and governing bodies in addition within high school and college the pedagogical philosophy and techniques are significantly different in an article discussing early college high schools nancy hoffman states these schools crs4 have challenged the divided structures of our current secondarypostsecondary education systems by raising important issues about funding across levels and jurisdictions how credits should be awarded faculty credentials and the compatibility or lack thereof of accountability systems that span high school and postsecondary education3 size obtaining data pertaining to the number of concurrent enrollment programs as well as the number of enrolled students is hampered by the lack of consistent definition researchers and policymakers are not in agreement about what constitutes concurrent enrollment program in spite of the absence of clear definition available data suggest that the number of concurrent enrollment programs as defined in this paper has increased over the years with significant amount of the growth occurring in the last 10 years the first middle college high school opened in 1973 and since then they have grown to approximately 30 schools enrolling 4500 students in 199920004 latest data available in 2001 the bill and melinda gates foundation bmgf and several other philanthropic groups committed more than 40 million to jobs for the future to coordinate the creation of 70 new early college high schools5 jobs for the future is nonprofit organization that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21898 advocates for policies for the advancement of youth and young adults it is estimated that once all 70 schools are operational they will enroll approximately 28000 students in addition many of the middle college high school programs have applied for funding from bmgf to convert to an early college high school based on projections received from jobs for the future it is estimated that at least 150 early college high schools will open by 2007 in addition to the formal programs discussed above the number of students who take college level courses while enrolled in high school either at their high school or on college campus has also increased some researchers believe that the growth is in part attributable to increased state support and administrative assistance available data on student participation is limited to select group of states that have witnessed significant growth in the past few years for example in virginia in 1991 approximately 2000 students participated in dual enrollment programs whereas this number had jumped to 6700 in 19976 3 nancy hoffman college credit in high school increasing college attainment rates for underrepresented students change julyaug 2003 p48 4 ibid 5 early college high schools are categorized as type of early entrance program the early college high school initiative extends the concept of the middle college high school by requiring students to complete minimum of two years of college level course work this option is available to middle college high school participants but is not mandated 6 thomas bailey and melinda karp promoting college access and success review of credit based transition programs us department of education office of vocational and adult education washington dc nov 2003 crs5 funding concurrent enrollment programs pose challenges to federal state and local funding sources for secondary and postsecondary education federal funding for secondary education is generally provided to state and local education agencies via the elementary and secondary education act esea as amended whereas federal funding for postsecondary education is predominantly authorized by the higher education act hea as amended students who are concurrently enrolled in secondary and postsecondary programs are presented with unique and challenging situation for obtaining federal funding for participating in these programs title iv of the hea which authorizes the major federal student aid programs states that student is not eligible for any grant loan or work assistance under title iv if heshe is enrolled in an elementary or secondary school section 484 a1 as result students who participate in concurrent enrollment programs who would otherwise qualify for federal student aid are not eligible for title iv funds to support the expenses of taking college courses while in high school they are required to seek alternate sources of funding such as state local or private scholarships few states have established separate funding sources for these programs to receive funding7 many early entrance programs rely upon funding from private donors such as httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21898 the bmgf to help offset the costs of these programs federal issues federal legislation and funding sources do not appear to accommodate these hybrid programs student who desires to participate in one of these programs either must pay the fulltime tuition and fees to participate early entrance highly gifted or pay for the individual courses she takes dual enrollment college the school that chooses to offer this type of program may risk running afoul of the adequate yearly progress ayp and highly qualified teacher provisions of the esea early entrance at risk the following section discusses selected compliance issues with the esea as amended by child left behind act nclba and current legislative proposals to amend the hea compliance concurrent enrollment programs as designed are at risk of failing to comply with federal statues and regulations under esea as amended by the nclba states that receive esea title i part assistance must have plans to ensure that teachers teaching core academic subjects are highly qualified by the end of the 20052006 school year8 to be deemed highly qualified teacher must have full state certification must not have had any certification requirements waived on an emergency temporary or provisional basis must have at least ba and must demonstrate competence in all academic subjects taught many early entrance programs such as the middle college high school programs 7 for additional information regarding state funding policies see state dual enrollment policies addressing access and quality at httpwwwteacherscollegeeduccrcpapers cbt_state_dual_04pdf 8 for additional information about highly qualified teachers and nclba see crs report rl30834 k12 teacher quality issues and legislative action by james b stedman crs6 often have college faculty instructing many of the core courses under the current provisions of esea these instructors are not likely to be considered highly qualified mainly because they have not met k12 certification requirements another provision of the esea requires schools to demonstrate that students are making adequate yearly progress9 for secondary schools this requires among other things that students receive high school diploma in the standard number of years the standard amount of time allotted for high school completion is generally four years compliance with this standard may be adversely affected by concurrent enrollment participants students who participate in concurrent enrollment programs generally complete the program in five years or more although they receive high school diploma and at least two years of college level credit or an associates degree if school fails to make ayp for two continuous years the school is then subject to various corrective actions schools that operate concurrent enrollment programs may be particularly at risk for failing to make ayp because of the number of years that it takes for student to graduate from high school prior legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21898 during the 108th congress hr 4283 college access and opportunity act of 2004 was introduced in the house among the many proposed amendments to the hea included in the bill hr 4283 sought to amend the eligibility requirements for the pell grant program to direct student aid to individuals participating in early entrance programs for highly gifted students specifically the proposal would extend eligibility for pell grants to those students who are in their junior or senior year of high school are eligible for pell grant except for being secondary school student are academically gifted and talented as defined by section 9101 of the esea and have been accepted and are enrolled fulltime in residential early entrance program for gifted students in addition the student would be prohibited from taking any additional secondary school course work during or after her participation in the early entrance program and she must agree to repay the amount of funds received if she fails to complete the early entrance program in its entirety or participates in any secondary school course work because the proposal prohibits recipient of the grant from taking any additional secondary school courses the student apparently is also unable to receive high school diploma 9 for additional information about adequate yearly progress see crs report rl32495 adequate yearly progress ayp implementation of the child left behind act by
