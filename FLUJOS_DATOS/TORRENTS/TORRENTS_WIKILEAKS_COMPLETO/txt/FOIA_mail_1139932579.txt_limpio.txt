from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to fortunat joos joosclimateunibech subject re fwd some figures at last date tue 14 feb 2006 105619 0700 cc rahmstorfozeanklimade eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno tosbornueaacuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed hi all i commented on the reference period issue in my previous email and hope we can resolve it today or tomorrow at the latest tim and keith should help convince fortunat that their choice is strong tim can you make the other changes suggested by fortunat thanks peck hi i have now found the time to look over the figures first congratulations to this effort looks great tremendous job i assume many hours of work i have however few points 1 the instrumental record our best piece of information is missing in panel please add to the emic panel 2 i am not very enthusiastic to normalize model results with respect to 15001899 the emic panel is to illustrate two points the difference between low and high solar forcing and withwithout anthropogenic forcing i think panel emic panel would be more informative in this respect if all runs with anthropogenic forcing and the proxies are normalized as in panel b 190611990 and the runs without anth forcing start at the same point as the ones with anth forcing i have strong opinion on panel d 3 please change bern25c to bern25cc thanks for considering this best regards fortunat jonathan overpeck wrote hi stefan and fortunat attached are the draft figs that include proxy obs simulations and comparisons of the two as you can see tim just sent them big job but they look great in my eyes see tims email below for more background info we need fast feedback from you both specifically 1 any general comments on the figs this is crux set of figures and we need your eyes to look at them carefully 2 is it wise to keep the new emic run panel attached to the second figure as attached i vote yes but what do you think it fits w the other panels pretty well 3 either way we need caption prose from you perhaps fortunat start and stefan edit or vice versa if stefan can start first on the new emic panel 4 also we need new or prose that can be added to that describes the panel and its implications as it informs our assessment keith will then integrate this into the section im not sure of this but perhaps you could start with new question heading and then have short to go under it something like what is the significance of the new reducedamplitude estimates of past solar variability of course we need your feedback and prose asap please send to eystein keith and tim thanks in advance for the help best peck xsieve cmu sieve 22 date fri 10 feb 2006 180019 0000 to jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject some figures at last cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xueaspamscore 1028 xueaspamlevel xueaspamflag dear peck and eystein the attached word file contains the latest versions of two of our figures first is the reconstructions with many requests now done linear time scale dotted early instrumental temperatures not solid line oerlemans added new panel showing shading for the overlapping regions of temperature reconstructions second is the forcings and models stendel echam simulation added 15002000 new echog erik2 simulation just published in grl from gonzalezruoco et added 10001990 reconstruction envelope replaced by new shading of overlaps in the temperature reconstructions correction of some labelling errors those runs that did not include 20th century sulphate aerosol cooling are dotted or dashed after 1900 the two low ones also omitted ch4 n2o cfcs o3 hence still cool despite omitting aerosol cooling the echog erik1 simulation with the very outofequilibrium initial conditions is dashed finally the extra panel with the new emic runs is included as panel again with the new shading of overlapping temperature reconstructions keith suggests sending to stefan and fortunat too for their views can you do that they may now be gone for the weekend of course best wishes and sorry this is late am i right in thinking that the only other possiblets figure is the location maps still working on those had very little time in last 2 days due to media etc attention re science paper cheers tim dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit
