from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to ben santer santer1llnlgov subject re figures for revised version of paper date wed oct 25 143807 2000 ben i hope the surgery next week goes ok ruth and i are going away next week for short break to coldstream on the river tweed this was the holiday cottage matthew had planned to go to for his honeymoon but the fuel crisis around his wedding time precluded this we were able to negotiate the cottage for later date as we could get refund or claim on the insurance as national emergency wasnt declared so on nov 1 we will think about you ive listed off the diagrams and will take the text when it comes but i wont be able to send you any comments until the week of nov 6 also just sent back comments to mike mann on the paper by tom and you factoring out enso and volcanoes felt like writing red ink all over it but sent back short publish suject to minor revision to mike this is the first time ive ever reviewed one of toms or your papers copy of what i sent is attached i forgot to sign it before sending it again hope all is well later next week cheers phil at 0637 pm 102400 0700 you wrote dear all sorry that it has taken so long to revise our paper as i mentioned in previous email ive had to repeat most of the calculations using an improved estimate of the preeruption reference level temperature tref ive also had to look at the sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in tref id like to thank tom for prompting to take critical look at this issue its an important one id also like to thank the rest of you for all the comments that youve sent i hope ive addressed them adequately in the revised paper another major change is that rather than giving results are based on variety of different filtering options eg estimation of volcano parameters from unfiltered data too noisy and highly smoothed data 13term gaussian filter leads to underestimate of volcanicallyinduced cooling we now only give results for our best guess filtering option fiveterm binomial filter we still discuss sensitivities to tau the volcanic signal decay time and choice of enso index restricting attention to one filtering option reduces the length of tables and hopefully improves the clarity of the paper ive rewritten the discussion of the iterative method and we now make it clear that although this approach is automated its implementation still involves number of subjective decisions filter choice choice of averaging period for estimating preeruption reference temperature choice of tau etc many of the changes made here attempt to address useful comments that i received from tom lennart and erich kindly provided with the slp data from the gsop gso1 and gso2 integrations recall that we did not have this data previously and so our estimation of enso signals in gso1 and gso2 and of ensovolcano signals in gsop was based on simulated nino 34 ssts only weve now also used the simulated soi to perform ensovolcano signal estimation section 5 discussion of echam4opyc results has been completely rewritten and the ordering of individual subsections should now be more logical we discuss the simulated pinatubo signal first then the enso component of simulated temperature trends and finally residual trends after the removal of volcano and enso effects today im sending you as postscript attachments the revised figures for the paper to simplify things ive encoded the figure number at the top of the postscript file i dont want to overload your mailboxes so im sending the figures in two separate mail messages there should be 11 figures in total tomorrow ill send you the revised text of the paper and the tables please let know if you have any problems printing these files note that all figures except figure 7 are in color color is not essential for some of the figures and in the next day or two ill prepare blackandwhite versions of figues 3 5 6 8 9 10 and 11 but for now i thought you might find it easier working with the color versions i will be going in for surgery on november 1st and am not sure how long it will be until i get back to my office i realize that it may not be feasible to submit the paper before november 1st but id really appreciate it if you could send comments before november 1st these will keep occupied while im trying to get back on my feet with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national laboratory po box 808 mail stop l264 livermore ca 94550 usa tel 925 4227638 fax 925 4227675 email santer1llnlgov
