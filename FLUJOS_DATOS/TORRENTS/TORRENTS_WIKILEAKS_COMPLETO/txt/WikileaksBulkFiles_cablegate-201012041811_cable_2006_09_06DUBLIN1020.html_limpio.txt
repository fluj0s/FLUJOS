ambassador james c kenny reasons 14 b and d 1 c this is an action request please see 10 2 c summary although supportive of continued us military transits at shannon airport the irish government has informally begun to place constraints on us operations at the facility mainly in response to public sensitivities over us actions in the middle east shannon remains key transit point for us troops and materiel bound for theaters in the global war on terror while yielding diplomatic benefits for the irish government and significant revenues for the airport and regional economy segments of the irish public however see the airport as symbol of irish complicity in perceived us wrongdoing in the gulfmiddle east and in regard to extraordinary renditions view that underpinned recent jury decision to acquit the shannon five protesters who damaged us naval aircraft the irish government has repeatedly defended us interests in the face of public criticism but has recently introduced more cumbersome notification requirements for equipmentrelated transits in the wake of the lebanon conflict these requirements which entail more expansive interpretation of munitions of war are designed to give the irish government mor latitude to decide on allowable transits accoring to senior department of foreign affairs oficial we suspect that the government aims with tese new constraints to dampen public criticism ahead of the 2007 general elections and we would apreciate department gudance on usg response including on any next steps regarding the shannon five end summary shannon significant benefits and sensitivities 3 sbu us military access to shannon airport in western ireland is among the most tangible benefits of traditionally strong usirish relations for the united states geography makes shannon key transit point for military flights and military contract flights carrying personnel and materiel to iraq and the middle eastgulf theater in the global war on terror as well as to europe and africa in 2005 roughly 340000 us troops passed through shannon on nearly 2500 contract carrier flights about 450 equipmentrelateddistinguishedvisitor transit milair flights and thousands of airspace overflights also took place approximately 220000 troops have transited to date this year for ireland us military transits not only demonstrate bilateral cooperation in support of us objectives in the gulfmiddle east but also generate significant revenue for shannon airport and the regional economy in 2005 the airport turned euro 29 million profit after earning roughly euro 103 million from services for transit flights including landing parking catering and fuel the economic gains for the shannon area are less easily calculated but would include at minimum payments for hotels foodbeverages transportation and cultural activities that come with 810 overnight stops per year for roughly 200 soldiers each time revenues may fall in 2006 as world airways dodcontract carrier has begun to transfer operations from shannon to its leipzig hub for internal logistical reasons 4 sbu for segments of the irish public however the visibility of us troops at shannon has made the airport symbol of irish complicity in perceived us wrongdoing in the gulfmiddle east this popular sentiment was manifest in the july 25 jury decision to acquit the shannon five group of antiwar protesters who damaged us naval aircraft at the airport in 2003 in the belief that they would prevent loss of life in iraq ref members of the shannon five have subsequently called for mass demonstration in dublin on september 23 capitalizing on publicity for the september 2124 ryder cup tournament and the return of university students as part of campaign to demilitarize the airport although it is by means clear that any protest will reach mass proportions participation in the planned protest will likely draw from vocal antiwar lobby that has demonstrated against us use of shannon from the start of the iraq war up through the recent lebanon conflict dublin 00001020 002 of 003 in late 2005early 2006 euwide debate on extraordinary renditions similarly galvanized this lobby and the irish public generally to question us military access to the airport the irish government and shannon 5 c the irish government consistently has acted to ensure continued us military transits at shannon in the face of public criticism since the shannon five decision for example irish authorities have upgraded airport security doubling the number of police and military personnel patrolling the facility and introducing rigorous checks at the parking lot and perimeter fence the upgrade is also partly response to possible islamic extremist threats moreover despite general government reluctance to challenge independent court decisions defense minister willie odea and governing fianna fail party politicians have publicly questioned the legal merits of the shannon five jury decision these public statements track with representations to the irish parliament by government ministers over recent years and months in defense of us practices at shannon including by foreign minister dermot ahern who cited us assurances on renditions this past year to rebuff calls for random aircraft checks in parliamentary debate this spring minister of state for europe noel treacy dismissed renewed calls for random inspections following the transit of us military prisoner that occurred without prior notification to the irish government ref b 6 c notwithstanding its general support for us interests the irish government has more recently begun to place limits on certain forms of us transits at shannon on august 15 the irish department of transport informally advised post by email that all military equipment including hmmwvs and trucks were to be considered munitions of war requiring prior notification to the transport department and exemption waivers for transshipment in addition to diplomatic clearance requests for state aircraft we have heretofore provided notification for troop transits with accompanying weapons hazmat and actual weaponsmunitions but not nonlethal military articles the transport department notice followed upon the department of foreign affairs dfa oral but definitive decision during the lebanon conflict to forbid us military transits carrying munitions to israel policy that dfa did not convey to post before informing the media indications of this trend to constrain us operations at shannon first arose in the context of the extraordinary renditions issue in late 2005 for instance the dfa informally denied dhs deportation transit through shannon of convicted foreign nationals from the united states out of apparent concern that the public would misread the transit as rendition 7 c in an august 30 meeting with the dcm and emboff dfa political director rory montgomery said that the department of transports more encompassing approach to munitions of war and notification requirements reflected the irish governments interest in knowing the full scope of military materiel transiting ireland he recalled that the february shipment through shannon of us apache helicopters tofrom israel which the us contract carrier had not listed as munitions of war elicited parliamentary criticism and highlighted the need for clarity about the nature of materiel in transit ref c more expansive notification requirements that would apply to all countries would make it easier for the irish government to decide on allowable shipments while remaining predisposed to respond quickly and positively to us transit requests said montgomery he added that the dfa would recommend that the department of transport consult with post in the process of clarifying and publishing guidance on munitions of war the dcm noted posts intention to confer with the transport department and he emphasized that broader notification requirements would make it more cumbersome to process materiel shipments with the possibility that us military planners would consider alternatives to shannon as transit hub comment and action request 8 c comment irish sensitivities generally about foreign military usage of the airport often make any inadvertent dublin 00001020 003 of 003 breaches of irelands restrictive rules on foreign military transits more visible and problematic neutral country ireland has military attache system sofa for us activities and strict rules regarding weapons transits and the wearing of foreign military uniforms occasional and inadvertent breaches of weapons and uniform policies like failure to notify transiting prisoners ref b and military equipment are met with public and press scrutiny but also with government understanding any incident however that becomes the cause for public debate about the us use of shannon will likely add pressure on the government embassy has sought to manage the policy issues notification requirements and the coordination of transiting flights overflights refuelings crew rest overnights and equipment failure overnights with existing dao and civilian embassy resources on the ground with the help of extra tdy support to the dao office and tdy eucom presence at shannon airport which is threeandahalf hours from dublin we have managed the occasional problems adequately and well 9 c more comment we intend to engage other ranking dfa transport and irish defense department officials upon their return from the august holiday period on the reasons for new constraints at shannon particularly the novel interpretation of munitions of war and its application to other countries russian transits to venezuela for instance the irish publics overwhelming opposition to israeli military actions in lebanon has exacerbated the governing fianna fail partys sensitivity to public criticism ahead of irelands may 2007 general elections the major opposition party fine gael supports continued us military use of shannon but the labour party and the green party fine gaels opposition partners favor review if not reversal of irish policy on us transits against this political backdrop us missteps at shannon could easily become campaign grist fianna fail concern that midlevel dfa officials have cited in informal discussions with post compliance with the new rules entailing notification for almost any us military equipment transiting if feasible from the us logistical perspective will require higher order of coordination among transcom air mobility command tacc and the contract carriers 10 c action request we would appreciate input from the department and other usg agencies for our planned followon discussions with irish officials on shannon embassy will diplomatically pursue the most workable arrangements possible with irish officials but we would appreciate washingtons judgment as to whether the process of notification of almost everything of military nature including by contract carriers through shannon is becoming too difficult to make the airport preferred transit stop guidance is also requested regarding the shannon five decision an outcome that dfa political director montgomery described as bizarre and presumably not precedential our understanding is that the case as criminal matter has run its course as there is possibility to appeal jury decision under irish law there may be an option to pursue the case as civil matter and post would need authorization and funding to contact local attorneys about this possibility another option would be to present an itemized bill for aircraft damages to the irish government either to seek compensation outright or at least to convey usg dissatisfaction with the shannon five verdict
