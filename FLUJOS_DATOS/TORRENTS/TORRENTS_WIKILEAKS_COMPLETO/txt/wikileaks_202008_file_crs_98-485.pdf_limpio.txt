on dualuse technology with military and civilian applications allow us exporters to compete while protecting us security interests he disputed that there were objections within the administration to allowing satellite exports to china saying that after november 1996 when the licensing jurisdiction was tr ansferred from the partment of state to commerce the commerce department i ssued three export

hearing of the house national security and international relations committees on june 18 1998 under secr etary of commerce for export administration william reinsch acknowledged that in the 1995 case his department alone had allowed hughes to pr ovide launch failure analysis to china he stated that after the apstar2 launch failure in 1995 the company involved hughes conducted an analysis without the participation of the chinese launch service provider the analysis was written in order to satisfy insurance requirements the analysis was reviewed by the department of commerce which determined that it contained only information already authorized for export under the original commerce license issued in february 1994 the unclassified report was provided first to consortium of western insurance companies and later to the chinese launch service provider at that hearing david tarbell dir ector of the defense technology security administration dtsa conf irmed that the department of defense dod did not monitor the launch or the launch failure an alysis reinsch acknowledged that the commerce department did not consult with either the partment of state or dod the decision to release the report to the prc was made solely by commerce department licensing officer29 reinsch also acknowle dged however that the authority for an additional license to conduct launch failure

assistant secretary of defense fr anklin miller tes tified only about authorized significant technology transfers and that satellite launc hes have not provided any benefits to current generation prc icbms he was not able to elaborate publicly on potential improvements to ne w prc icbms under development43 admiral joseph prueher commander in chief of us pacific forces said on october 23 1998 that any transfers of missile t echnology or knowhow in connection with launching us satellites in china have improved prc icbms only incrementally not by any quantum leaps and bounds nd accelerated solution of technical guidance problem for one of their missiles44 john pike director of the space policy project at the fede ration of american scientists argued that there are significant differences between chinas ballistic missiles and the long march slvs45 he said that the long march slvs were longer than the css4 icbm so they flexed more during ascent they also had bigger nose cones to hold satellites that were bigger than warheads these characteristics resulted in stresses on the long march he also argued that deploying two satellites from one long march as china has done for iridium was very different from launching mirvs warheads unlike satellites were designed to survive greater vibrations and the h eat of reentering the atmosphere other experts stressed the commonalitie s between the technology as well as technical expertise used in rockets and missiles senate subcommittee provided graphical comparison of the applicab ility of technology in slvs and

lowerstage design validation and general quality assurance also multi satellite dispensers could be modified as multiplewarhead dispensers thus assisting chinas reported efforts to develop capability in mirvs for its icbms47 china used such dispensers to launch multiple satellites for iridium experts at the monterey institute of international studies also pointed out that significant portion of the components technology and expertise used in the research and development of slvs were virtually interchangeable with that of ballistic missiles these overlaps included launching multiple satellites from single slv and delivering multiple warhead s on single missile similar technology involved upper stage control systems sep aration and ignition of the upper stage attitude control and

security at the national labs the committee apparently did not focus on the question of prc political donations nor requested the justice departme nt to begin new investigations loral and hughes denied having violated the law61 shifting attention from missile tec hnology to nuclear weapons the cox committee reviewed the most serious concerns that the prc had stolen information on nuclear weapons allegedly from us na tional laboratories of the department of energy third incident has been made public involving the w88 nuclear warhead deployed on the trident ii submarinelaunched ballistic missile62 the federal bureau of investigation fbi investigated that incident in which china reportedly received data from alamos nationa l lab in the mid1980s but the case was uncovered in 1995 two other cases involving china and us labs were previously reported63 representative dicks said that the most important matter to be learned from the committees report will be that for 20 years starting in the 1980s we had major counterintelligence failure at amos and at other national labs that is now being corrected64 allegations of the prcs acquisition of nuclear weapon secrets were publicly confirmed by us intelligence on april 21 199965 in 2000 us intelligence reportedly concluded from additional translations of prc documents obtained in 1995 that prc espionage has gathered classified information on us ballistic missiles and reentry vehicles in addition to that on nuclear weapons66 according to the cox committee the prc has stolen or otherwise illegally obtained us missile and space technolog that improves the prcs military and intelligence capabilities after three failed satellite launches in 1992 1995 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98485crs25 1996 us sate llite makers hughes and loral transferred missile design information and knowhow to china without required export licenses from the department of state in violation of the international tra ffic in arms regulations the us firms gave technical information that has improved the reliability of prc rockets used to launch satellites with civilian and military purposes the information was also useful for the design and improved reliability of future prc ballistic missiles specifically the committee found that in 1993 and 1995 hughes illegally recommended to the prc improvements to th fairing nose cone that protects the payload and in 1996 loral and hughes helped the prc improve the guidance of failed rocket and in so doing deliber ately acted without the legally required license and violated us export control laws regarding hughes the committees report printed an unclassified assessment completed on december 18 1998 by the stat departments office of defense trade controls that offi ce concluded that in review ing the prc launch failure of january 1995 that involved lm2e space launch vehicle slv and the apstar2 satellite hughes engaged in technical discussions with the prc wit hout us government monitors that resulted in significant improvement to the prc spacelift program and contributed to chinas goal of assured access to space moreover the lessons learned by the chinese are inherently applicable to their missile programs as well since slvs and icbms share many common technologies as for loral and hughes activities in 1996 the committee reported that 1998 interagency review determined that the technical issue of greatest concern was the exposure of the prc to western diagno stic processes which could lead to improvements in reliability for all prc missile and rocket programs the improvements to chinas ssile program could come from increased production efficiency and improved reliability through doption of improved quality control and reliabilityenhancing measures in design and manufacturing that were introduced after the accident investigation including some that the loralled independent review committee advocated the committee judged that the guidance system of the long march 3b rocket reviewed by loral and hughes in 1996 was among the systems capable of being adapted for use in the prcs planned roadmobile intercontinental ballistic missiles ie the df31 there were previous concerns that after the explosion that destroyed the loral built intelsat708 satellite in 1996 classified us encryption boards were lost to china the committee reported that while the two fac3r encryption boards were not recovered from the crash site by loral they most likely were destroyed in the explosion while it is not known whethe r the prc recovered the boards even if they did it would be difficult for the prc to determine the cryptographic algorithm that was imprinted on them and rever seengineering of damaged board would be even more difficult thus the nati onal security agency remains convinced that there is risk to other satellite systems now or in the future resulting from having not recovering the fac3r boards from the prc contrary to earlier allegations of us assistance for chinas development of multiple satellite dispensers and mirvs the committee determined that motorola did not provide the prc with informati on on how to design the smart dispenser rather the prc built the smart dispenser indigenously to motorolas specificationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98485crs26 67 washington post june 15 1999 p a27 space news june 28 1999the cox report agreed with earlier public assessments of the administration that in the 1990s the prc has deployed total of approxima tely 20 css4 icbms in silos but contrary to the white h ouses june 1998 announcement of detargeting agreement with china most of those icbms remain targeted on the united states nonetheless the report noted previous statements by us intelligence that the css 4s are deployed in their silos without warheads and without propellants during day today operations the committee judged that within 15 years chinas missile modernization program c ould result in the deployment of up to 100 icbms moreover if china aggressi vely developed mirvs it could deploy upwards of 1000 thermonuclear warheads on icbms by 2015 co nfirming suspicions of problems in chinas slbm force the committee reported that while china developed jl1 slbm to be launched from the pla s xiaclass nuclearpowered submarine the prc has not yet deployed the jl1 slbm in june 1999 loral space and communicati ons published fullpage response to the cox report loral said that its employees acted in good faith and did nothing to violate export control regulations or the law or to harm national security nonetheless lorals statemen t acknowledged that mistake s were made loral also referred to sensitive information that c ould have been conveyed at the meetings saying that unfortunately the review committee secretary loral engineer had already faxed copy of the report reviewing the launch failure to the chinese in the process of sending it to the committee memb ers however prior to doing so the secretary took measures to delete ll sensitive material from the report67 in its recommendations related to satellite exports the cox committee expected that the executive branch will aggressively implement the satellite export control provisions of the strom thurmond national defense authorization act for fy1999 stated that the congressional judgme nt that the department of state is the appropriate agency for licensing both exports of satellites and any satellite launch failure investigations must be faithfully and fully implemented stated that the department of state must ensure consistent withnational security that satellite export licenses and notices to congress are acted on in timely fashion and that exporters are informed about the progress of th eir applications and have access to appropriate dispute resolution pro cedures the executive branch and congress should ensure that the partment of st ate has adequate personnel and resources devoted to processing

including co mmunications afte r launch failures recommended that in light of the impact on us national security of insufficient domestic commercial space launch capacity and competition congressional

transfers for chinas military and missile programs the committee found evidence that u s technology had been incorporated into the currently deployed prc icbm force while noting that such integration may not be pparent for several years if at all the report also stated that extensive assistance from nonus foreign sources probably is more important than technology transfers associated with satellite launc hes nonetheless the committee concluded that the technical information transferred during certain satellite launch campaigns enables the prc to improve its present and future icbm force that threatens the united states as well as shortrange and intermediaterange ballistic missiles that threaten us military forces and allies in asia further us national security may be harmed according to the report if china proliferated missile systems improved by us technology the committee also found that improvements to chinas space launch capability also enhanced its use of space for military reconnaissance communicati ons and meteorology pos ing challenges to us national security the committee found that despite assurances of government monitoring and security safeguards there were security violations and significant weaknesses in the implementation of the satellite export policy since the reagan administration us satel lite exports to china the committee concluded have created tension between us national security interests and us commercial interests and this tension and conflic t of interests have been problematic throughout the usprc sa tellite launch relationship the committee made 10 recommendations related to strengthening controls over satellite exports these included authority for monitors from the defense threat reduction agency dtra to suspend

into those allegations the white house agreed and confirmed that us c oncerns did not center on chinas currently deployed icbm force but that unauthorized assistance and transfers of space launch vehicle and sa tellite technology could assist china in the development of future ballistic missiles while concurring with most of the committees recommendations the administration disagreed with the last one saying that the longstanding policy of permitting the launch of us commercial satellites by china with strong technology controls serves our overall national intere st however this statement did not cover chinas increasing use not just launch of such satellites export controls and intelligence in addition congressional investigations expanded to include concer ns about alleged poli ticization of export control and intelligence in the clinton ad ministration export control specialists skeptical of liberalizing controls on dualuse technology transfers to china complained that
