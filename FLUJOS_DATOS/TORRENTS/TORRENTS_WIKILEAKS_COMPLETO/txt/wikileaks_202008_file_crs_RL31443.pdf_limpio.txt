or deficit as well as allocations of spending enforcement of the budget resolution relies prima rily upon points of order and r econciliation procedures with regard to the enforcement of budget aggr egates and committee spending allocations the major points of order are found in s ections 311 and 302 of the act respectively the term deeming resolution is not officially defined nor is there any

an ad hoc basis the form and content of deeming reso lution is not prescribed so it may be shaped to meet the particular needs at nd for example the house and senate have used simple resolutions as the legislative vehicle in the past but deeming resolution may be incorporated into bill such as an annual appropriations act as single provision at minimum deeming resoluti ons provide new spe nding

the budget resolution ie enforcement of budgetary levels th major points of order under the 1974 congressional budget act are found in s ections 311 and 302 which deal with the enforcement of budget aggregates and co mmittee spending allocations respectively house and senate rules and pr actices differ somewhat with regard to these two points of order section 311a generally bars the consid eration of any spending measure that would violate the aggregate budg et authority and outlays leve ls for the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution and any revenue measure that would violate the aggregate revenue level for the first fiscal year or the sum of all fiscal years covered by the budget resolution section 302a generally requires that the aggregate amounts of spending recommended in the annual budget resoluti on be allocated by committee the house and senate appropr iations committees receive an allo cation for only one fiscal year but the remaining house and senate committees receive llocations for all of the years covered by the budget resolution3 section 302b requires the house and senate appropriations committees to subdivide their allocations by subcommittee4 section 302f generally bars the considera tion of any spending measure that would violate the committee spending allocati ons made under section 302a or the appropriations committees suballocations of spending made under section 302b in view of the different time frames for making committee spending allocations the spending levels are enforceable for one year in the case of the appropriations committees but are enforceable for multiyear period in the case of the other house and senate committees the purpose of the budget reconciliation pr ocess is to change substantive law so that revenue and mandato ry spending levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies reconciliation generally has been used to reduce the deficit through spending reductions or revenue increases or combination of the two in more recent years however the reconc iliation process also encompassed revenue reduction generally and spending increases in selected program areas at

httpwwwsenategovbudgetrepublicananalysis2008bb062008pdfbeginning of the 110th congress the house and senate adopted rules restricting the use of reconciliation to deficit reduction5 reconciliation is twostep process6 under the first step reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing one or more committees in each house to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues or both by the amounts specified in the budget resolu tion if more than one committee in each house is given instructions each instructed committee submits reconc iliation legislation to its respective budget committee which incorporates all submissions without any substantive re vision in to single omnibus budget reconciliation measure under the second step the omnibus budget reconciliation measure is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures for example debate time in the senate on r econciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane the process culminates with enactment of the measure thus putting the policies of the budget resolution into effect the deeming resolution when the house and senate do not reach final agreement on budget resolution in timely manner or fail to reach final agreement altogether during session they are faced with mixed situation regard ing budget enforcement for upcoming fiscal years the multiyear budget levels in th prior years budget resolution remain in effect and provide some basi s for enforcing points of or der with respect to revenue and mandatory spending legi slation changing economic and technical factors over the past year however may ve rendered the prior budget vels out of date thereby undermining their value as realistic ba sis for enforcement of present policies further the house and senate must adopt new budget resolution each year in order for the enforcement of annually appropriated spendi ng levels to be continuous if budget resolution is not adopted for fiscal year there is allocation of spending made to the appropriations committees unde r section 302a and basis for them to make the required spending suballocations under section 302b7 consequently when the house and sena have been presented with such situations they have resorted to the use of deeming resolutions to provide basis for updated enforcement the term deeming re solution is not officially defined nor is there any specific st atute or rule authorizing such legislation instead the use of deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal w ith the issue on an ad hoc basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31443crs4 inasmuch as the form and content of deeming resolution is not prescribed its form and content may be shaped to meet the particular needs at hand for example the house and senate have us ed simple resolutions as the legislative vehicle in the past but deeming resolution may be incor porated into bill such as an annual appropriations act as single provisi on at minimum deeming resolutions provide new spending allocations to the appropriations committees but they also may set new aggregate budget levels provide revised spe nding allocations to other house and senate committees or provide for other related purposes deeming resolution may even declare that budget resolution in its entirety passed earlier in the session by one chamber is deemed to have the force and effect as if adopted by both chambers house and senate action on deeming resolutions both the house and senate have acted on several deeming resolutions in the past for purposes of this review distin ction is drawn between instances in which the budget resolution was adopted in tardy manner and instances in which budget resolution was adopted at all tardy adoption of the budget resolution for 30 of the 34 fiscal years cove ring fy1976fy2009 the house and senate adopted at least one budget resolution as shown in table

measure was reached in april may or early june allowing the house and senate to bring the regular appropriations bills and other budgetary legislation to the floor with little or delay in some instances however the final budget resolution was not in place until late june or even until august or october the general practice of the senate in such years particularly with regard to the regular appropriations bills was to consider legislation within the framework of the senatepassed budget resolution but not to adopt deeming resolution for exampl spending levels provided in the appropriations bills generally were consistent with the spending allocations to the senate appropriations committee and the spending s uballocations thereunder that would have been made d the senatepasse d levels become the final ones consideration of the measures usua lly occurred by unanimous consent the tardy adoption of budget resolutions has been more of problem for the house than the senate especially because the house usually begins the consideration of the regular appropriations bills at an earlier point in the session in 1990 the house made procedural change to allow the consideration of the regular appropriations acts to begin if the budget resolution was not finalized in timely manner the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title x iii of pl 101508 as amended added

legislative procedures for adju sting the public debt limit by bill heniff jrthe legislative vehicle for the deeming resolution in each instance was special rule reported by the house rules committee three of the special rules provided for the consideration of an annua l appropriations act two re gular appropriations acts and one supplemental appropriations act and the other provided for the consideration of conference report on budget resolution each of the special rules contained separate section setting forth the deeming resolution provisions at the beginning of the next session w hich started new congress additional deeming resolution provisions were adopted by the house as part of the openingday rules package usually numbered hres 5 in 2007 the rules package was hres 6 which was approved by sepa rate vote on each title over the first two days these actions were required because simple h ouse resolutions such as special rules reported by the house rules committee do not carry over into new congress thus the initial deeming resolution had to be re newed by the adoption of new resolution the initial deeming resolution first used by the house for fy1999 only provided spending allocations to the house appropriations committee in the other three years the initial deeming resolu tion had broader pplication putting into effect the entire budget resolution at its latest stage

than the house with respect to deeming resolutions for fy1999 it adopted two simple resolutions for this purpose in single session the first only provi ded spending allocations to the senate appropriations committee but the second had much broader application in the following instance for fy2003 the senate did not adopt deeming resolution despite several ttempts to do so in the last two instances for fy2005 and fy2007 the senate included deeming resolution provisions in statute including regular appropriations act enacted in august and supplemental appropriations act enacted in june

by the house reflected cap on appropriations for the fiscal year of 873 billion but the cap for that fiscal year established in the fy2006 budget resolution was 7 billion lower at 866 billion this

until the fy2008 budget re solution was adopted in the senate however affirmative action had to be taken to terminate the deeming resolution thereby avoiding any conflict with the newl revised

budget act the tardy adoption of budget resolution or the failure to adopt it at all leads to another enforcement problem but one that involves timing issues rather than substantive enforcement under sec tion 303a of the 1974 congressional budget act the house and senate generally may not consid er spending or revenue legislation for fiscal year until the budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted the section poses less of problem for the house than it does for the senate first section 303b provides an excepti on in the house for general appropriations bills considered after may 15 but this exception does not apply in the senate second the house may include waivers of the section 303a point of order in special rules governing the consid eration of individual measures section 303c also bars the considera tion of appropriations measures in the senate until the spending allocation to the senate appropriations committee required by section 302a has been made unlik many other points of order under the 1974 act waivers of section 303a only require simple majo rity vote in the senate over the years the senate has waiv ed section 303a dozens of times for various types of budgetary legislation in many years however the senate has chosen not to waive section 303a with respect to the consideration of regular appropriations bills instead the senate appropriations

cases the waiver was obtained under ccessful motion directed specifically to waiving section 303 in several other instances the waiver was obtained under unanimous consent reque st the use of the waiver motions or unanimous consent requests in these cases attested to the consensus regarding the need to consider the regular appropriations bills after all such motions are subject to extended debate and any senator can raise an objection to unanimous consent request an extended debate on motion and an objection to unanimous consent request occurred only once both occurred in august 1984 in c onnection with the agriculture appropriations bill for fy1985 the extended debate on the waiver motion began on august 1 and was brought to close on august 8 when the senate voted 6834 to invoke

been adopted in fairly timely manner during the period covering the 102 nd congress through the 110th congress of the 14 budget resolutions that were adopt ed 10 were adopted in april or may the remaining four were adopted in june in addition in recent years the senate sometimes has deferred the initial consideration of some of the regular appropriations bills until late in the session due to poli tical difficulties or even abandoned the consideration of individual appropriati ons bills in favor of consolidated appropriations measures accordingly in the 14 years during this period that budget resolutions were adopted the senate appropriations committee was able to avoid the need for waivers of section 303a during the four years in which the h ouse and senate failed to agree on
