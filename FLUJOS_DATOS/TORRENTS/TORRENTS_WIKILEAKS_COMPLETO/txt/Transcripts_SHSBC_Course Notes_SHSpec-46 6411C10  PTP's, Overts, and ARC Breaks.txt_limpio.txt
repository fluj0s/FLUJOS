there is another style of auditing between level 0 and level 2 see hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing it is version of guiding style without repetitive commands it is guiding style that goes into itsa coffeeshop style lrh is talking about guiding secondary style here this is outlined in hcob 12nov64 scientology ii pc level 0iv definition processes p 2 you can herd pcs into line by multiple acknowledgment the styles of auditing parallel the return of selfdeterminism to the auditor progression upwards through the styles of auditing goes along with an increase in the auditors ability to occupy viewpoint and therefore observe the error in training is to demand more of the lowerlevel auditor than he can possibly deliver eg having level 0 auditor finding out from the pc what is troubling him before having him talk about it listen style is the hardest for the instructor to judge and at first for the student to do because it is so simple that the student adds all sorts of complexities you must adjust your supervision to this simplicity there are three actually six barriers to case improvement 1 ptps 2 ptps ld 3 overts and withholds 4 overts and withholds ld 5 arc breaks 6 arc breaks lb these are potentially present in any session at any level we dont try to handle them at level 0 and 1 they come into action at level ii with the things given in the book of case remedies the woof and warp of any case is composed of certain mental makeup of combination of chronic or continuous nature in any pc there is chronic case messup then you have those things that keep the basic aberrations from unraveling these are the things that keep the case from being entered and that prevent the pc from being in session given that he does have an auditor any of these things can be chronic or immediate continuous or temporary an overt act will go into action only when restraint is put on it in the form of some sort of withhold the person becomes guilty etc since you have to have secrecy you have to have censure and with censure there is need for secrecy when being doesnt think an action is good he goes into being made guilty hence the overtmotivator sequence hence the connection between the feeling of guilt and on the one hand feeling that one has done wrong and on the other hand the feeling that one will be punished the overt is prior to the withhold you should classify overt withhold and missed withhold processes all under overts there are lots of things to know about overts and lots of processes for running them the present existence of problem is worse than its problematic nature the ptps floatingness in time is what is peculiar to it and what makes it get in the way of auditing it was looking at the ptp that got lrh into discovering gpms on politicalphilosophical level the problem appears as dialectical materialism which says that force vs force produces ideas dialectical materialism is making philosophy of and deifying the problem although dialectical materialism says that force vs force produces ideas it is actually the other way round since actually idea vs idea produces force the idea that force makes ideas is just an expression of the man from mud theory if neither postulate of problem overcomes the other force accumulates on them and the forces will counteroppose if they are in balance they will hang up in time only those problems that are held in this delicate balance hang up and become ptps to get rid of problem one postulate or the other must give way if one side can overbalance the other the problem slips and doesnt remain ptp past problems may be solved by overbalancing without really being resolved these may still exist in the past but they are not floating up to pt ptps still have an exact balance on both sides the cold war of russia vs the us has slipped since the idea of coexistence crept into the ussr if as an auditor you realize that not every problem needs to be handled but only the ones that are so delicately balanced your job will seem easier since there have been lots of problems in thetans whole existence the balance is actually so delicate that any little nudge will change it and let it slip away you sometimes see pc struggling to hold onto ptp that has been way of life after the auditor has knocked it off its pins the pc has still got tremendous accumulated forces involved in its solution routine is something you use to change an aspect of the pcs case it always works unless there is ptp overt or arc break in the way an arc break is actually tickling of some major restimulation of something in r6 list 1 is adequate to key it out it is direct shortcircuit into the bank there are actually very few things in chronic restimulation in the bank the primary one is difficulties with communication that is the primary endword that gets into restimulation there is real reason why anyone should communicate with anyone about anything when you run recall time you communicated you are actually running 268 gpms all at once so wonder the pc feels better afterwards and when something goes wrong with your comm cycle that upsets the pc exactly what the pc does at that point is probably the rootword when you quiet it down by locating and indicating the bpc you just drop it back to its former status you havent done anything for the pcs case but you have made him auditable the big buttons in the bank are 1 communication 2 time 3 havingness these things like time problems and bits of items like havingness are the things that are in chronic restimulation but the aberrative value of havingness compared to communication and time is miniscule communication is way back on the series communication and time are in restimulation all the time or for one thing there wouldnt be any time that is one reason why waiting is so upsetting that means that you go after arc breaks with feather touch to key them out dont audit them or you will mess the pc up by keying in communication harder knowing that these three phenomena are what keep case from being audited keeps you from being confused by all the possible manifestations which do in fact boil down to these categories ptps ow and arc breaks the pc can be troublesome case trouble source because he has someone on the other side of him who doesnt want him to improve he will try to get better to prove the other person wrong which gives him ptp resulting in case gain overts carry lot of different reactions depending on things like the persons responsibility level they are source of change not fixedness in case the case shifts does well at times gets sporadic results etc the pc wont let himself get any better he has odd computations like the idea that if he gets strong he might commit overts you would get the same manifestation of rollercoaster gain in pts condition if there is someone in the persons environment who keeps knocking him down whenever he gets better the mechanism is withhold when person has tremendous number of overts that remain constant he is trying to solve problem with overts that is the usual reason for the overts the overt can be on the part of the person or of society over the course of an intensive or longer cycle you have to get sufficient gain to get the pc up high enough so that the gates dont get closed in your face by his committing more overts before you get to audit him again the reason the psychiatrist damages people is that his problem is that of preventing people from damaging other people your problem then would be social problem in dealing with the continuous pt overt case you would have to solve this problem before you could make progress with the case the nochange overt case goes up and down little unlike the ptp case the pc may refrain from committing overts for awhile so overts cause change on graphs constantly but not steadily with fluctuating graph you could also be facing pts situation the main problem relating to overts is whether the pc will be damaged by motivators running overts can backfire if you let the pc get off only wholetrack overts because they are safe or miniscule overts critical thoughts etc such pc is dodging continuous pt chain of overts the pc with continual outrud is arc breaky if you try to get him to put his attention elsewhere because when you take his attention away from the charge of the outrud it hits him hes got to have it remedied before he can be run on routine fortunately not all pcs need much remedying the book of case remedies is basically just batch of methods for putting in ruds you can be as nice as you want about pulling withholds but remember that it must be done and that fact may put you beyond niceness once in awhile eg you might have to say something like ok come back for some more auditing when you have decided to tell what you have done thats lfing
