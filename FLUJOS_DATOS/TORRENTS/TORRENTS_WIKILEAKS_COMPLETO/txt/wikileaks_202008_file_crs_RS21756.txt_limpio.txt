deficit gregg esenwein and philip d winters government and finance division march 23 2005 abstract congressional concern over the size of the federal budget deficit has prompted calls for reduction in federal expenditures one proposal would freeze nondefense discretionary funding at its fy2005 level since nondefense discretionary outlays constitute slightly under 20 of overall federal outlays limiting their growth would produce modest reduction in the federal budget deficit congressional budget office cbo estimates indicate that freezing nondefense discretionary funding at its fy2005 level would produce cumulative savings of approximately 147 billion including reduced interest payments over the fy2006 to fy2010 time period these savings would reduce the cumulative baseline budget deficit by approximately 12 over the period order code rs21756 march 23 2005 crs report for congress received through the crs web the option of freezing nondefense discretionary spending to reduce the

congressional budget offices cbos fy2006 budget report shows large estimated baseline deficit 295 billion in fy2006 followed by declining deficits in subsequent years legislative language directs how cbo is to produce its baseline estimates such that they estimate the future paths of federal revenues and spending under current laws and policies1 hence these baseline projections of budget deficits do not include future policy changes matter how likely they are to be adopted by congress examples of such policy changes might include continued funding for the 1 cbo budget and economic outlook

discretionary outlays accounted for 193 of total outlays in fy2004 although non defense discretionary outlays have increased over the last decade from 177 to 193 of total outlays they still represent less than 1 out of every 5 the federal government spends in contrast mandatory spending and net interest payments currently account for almost 61 of total outlays their percentage of total budget outlays is expected to increase over the next few years as social security and medicare expenditures rise in response to demographic changes and medical cost pressures and as net interest payments rise as result of growing federal debt 2 see crs report rs22045 baseline budget projections under alternative assumptions by gregg esenwein and marc labonte crs3 table 1 components of federal outlays

for fiscal year 2006 historical tables feb 2005 table 83 cbo provides estimates of the annual budgetary effects of selection of alternative httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21756 policy scenarios3 one of these scenarios is that discretionary nondefense funding is frozen at fy2005 levels the dollar difference between the baseline paths for nondefense discretionary spending and the one assuming funding freeze produces an estimate of the savings resulting from freezing discretionary spending table 2 contains this measurement calculated from cbo data from freezing nondefense discretionary outlays at their fy2005 levels the savings from freezing nondefense discretionary outlays begin relatively small 7 billion in fy2006 and grow to 51 billion in fy2010 the cumulative savings over the fy2006 to fy2010 period are approximately 141 billion excluding interest payment savings table 2 freeze calculations fy2005fy2010 in billions of dollars outlays nondefense total savings discretionary nondefense

expected deficit which in turn slows increases in federal debt held by the public net interest payments will be smaller than they otherwise would be during this period the estimated savings in net interest payments from freezing nondefense discretionary spending grow from 1 billion in fy2007 to 6 billion in fy2010 the cumulative net interest savings are 13 billion4 hence the estimated total deficit reduction from freezing nondefense discretionary outlays would be 154 billion over the period the cbo baseline budget deficit projection for the fy2005 through fy2010 period is shown in table 3 as mentioned earlier it seems very likely that an alternative deficit estimate that includes likely future action such as additional expenditures for the iraq and afghanistan campaigns and the extension of at least some if not all of the expiring tax provisions would make the deficit estimates larger table 3 cbo baseline deficit projections in billions of dollars

year 2006 march 2005 the cumulative baseline budget deficit estimate over the fy2005 to fy2010 period is 12 trillion the savings in both outlays and debt service payments from freezing non defense discretionary outlays at their fy2005 levels is 147 billion over the same period this would produce cumulative reduction in the baseline budget deficit of just over 12 4 this report assumes that approximately half of the debtservice adjustment associated with cbos projection of freezing all discretionary funding at fy2004 levels would accrue if the freeze in funding was limited solely to nondefense discretionary funding
