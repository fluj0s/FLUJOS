significant differences between the bills that the house and senate conferees brought to the conference and highlightin g the language the conference adopted inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31445crs2 its

the conferees added other provisions regarding us trade remedy laws following the overview the report provides sidebyside analysis of the house and senate bills short title and findings both bills have the same short titlebipartisan trade and promotion authority act of 2002 the two bills contain two iden tical findings that re late national security and trade each bill contains third finding on wto dispute settlement procedures which are similar but not identical the third finding was not contained in the original hr 3005 as passed by the hous in december 2001 but was added as part of the house conference version by hre s 450 the conference report includes the first two findings which are identical in the house and senate bills and includes third finding that combines language from both bills trade negotiating objectives the legislation sets down what the congress considers to be the goals the president must accomplish in negotiating trade agreements in order for those agreements to receive expedited treatment under the trade promotion authority tpa this section is divided into subsections on overall trade negotiating objectives principal trade negotiating objectives promotion of certain priorities consultations and adherence to obliga tions under uruguay round agreements the language in the two original bills in this section was similar although the senate bill adde d several trade negotiating obj ectives in the conference report the conference adopted the house ve rsion in some cases the senate language in some cases or new language in others cases overall trade negotiating objectives using identical language the two bills contain seven objectives regarding the use of trade agreements to promote us and world economic growth and living standa rds and to promote such social goals as respect for the environmen t and for workers and childre ns rights the senate bill included an eighth objective to ensure equal treatment for small business the conference report adopted the eighth obj ective and added ninth to promote universal ratification and full compliance with the international labor organizations ilo convention 182 prohibiting and acting against the worst forms of child labor principal trade negotiating objectives the original senate and house bills contained 13 specific objectives with similar wording that pertain to eliminating barriers in manuf actured and agricultural goods trade and in services trade in foreign investment and in electronic commerce the establishment of rules and standards regarding anticorruption inte llectual property rights ipr protection and labor and environment protection and the operation of the world trade organization wto the senate bill added language regarding trade in autos and auto parts which was dropped in the conf erence report the senate bill also expanded the objective regarding foreign i nvestment to include language requiringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31445crs3 that foreign investors be accorded rights in the united states greater than those accorded us investors in the united stat and language re garding the settlement of investorgovernment disputes in foreig n investment including the discouragement of frivolous claims all of which was adopted in the c onference report regarding ipr the senate bill added language requiring respect for the declaration on public health adopted at the november 2001 wto ministerial in doha qatar which was included in the conference report in add ition the senate bill st rengthened language on export subsidies contained in the objec tive regarding agriculture the conference adopted the house version the senate b ill also added langua ge regarding settling disputes within the wto by ensuring that wto bodies adhere to established standards when adjudicating disputes which the conference adopted with slight modifications the most extensive differences between the house and senate bills in this subsection were the four objectives that the senate bill added they included lengthy objective on discouraging the use of the worst forms of child labor practices adopted in the conference report by in compressed form an objective for promoting human righ ts and democracy dropped by the conference an objective to seek revision of wto rules regarding border taxes adopted by the conference and an objective to promote trade opportun ities for us textile producers adopted by the conference but in compressed form the housesenate conference added prin cipal objective not contained in either the senate or house bill that requires negotiators to ensure the us ability to enforce its trade remedy laws and to address and reme dy market distortions that lead to unfair trade practices promotion of certain priorities using simila r language the two bills listed 12 presidential actions that the congress considers necessary in order to maintain us competitiveness they relate to the protection of labor rights and the environment and preserving the ability of the united states to implement its trade remedy laws the housesenate conference eliminated objective 9 pertaining to trade remedy laws which was added in the conference report to the principal negotiating objectives section and substituted requirement that the president submit report on the extent to which the c ountry or countries that are parties to an agreement reached under the tpa authority have laws against the exploitation of child labor consultations the senate and house bills contained identical language requiring the us trade representative ustr to consult with congressional revenue committees and other committees with jurisdiction with the congressional oversight group and with congressiona l trade advisors the consultation requirements are also addr essed later in the bill the conference adopted the language of the two billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31445crs4 adherence to obligations u nder uruguay round agreements identical language in both bills required th president to take into account the degree to which trading partners adhere to obligations under the uruguay round agreements the conference report adopted th language contained in the two bills trade agreements authority the two bills and the conference report have almost identical language except with regard to import sensitive agricultura l products on the presidents authority to negotiate tariff agreements where changes in tariff levels would go into effect by proclamation they would set the same limits on allowed tariff changes they would require that such agr eements be entered into be fore june 1 2005 or by june 1 2007 if expedited procedures for an imp lementing bill are extended see below under the provisions of the two bills and the conference report the president would have to enter into other tariff nd nontariff trade agreements by the same deadlines as above these agreements woul d have to make prog ress in meeting the negotiating objectives and the president would have to satisfy the outlined consultation and assessment requirements legislation to implement these trade agreements would be considered under ex pedited procedures trade authorities procedures if provisions of the legisla tion 1 approved the trade agreement and any statement of administrative action and 2 were necessary or appropriate to implement the trade agreement if statutory changes are required to implement the trade agreement such legislation is called an implementing bill under both bills and the conference repor t trade authorities procedures would apply to an implementing bill for trade ag reements entered into by june 1 2005 or by june 1 2007 if 1 the president re quests the extension request and other information due by march 1 2005 and 2 neither house of congress adopts an extension disapproval resolu tion before june 1 2005 the bills would require report by private sector advisors on the pr esidents request for extension the senate bill also would require related report by the us international trade commission itc both bills would allow the president to commence negotiations where determined to be feasible timely and beneficial an important difference between the bills however was highly controversial provision commonly called the daytoncraig amendment this amendment was in the senate bill sec tion 2103b4 and not in the house bill the daytoncraig amendment states that trade authorities pr ocedures would not apply to any provision in an implementing bill that modifies or amends any us law that provides remedies from unfair foreign trade practices eg us antidumping countervailing duty and safeguard laws such provision would be stricken from the implementing bill if 1 any senator makes point of order ag ainst the provision and 2 the point of order is sustained by the presiding officer the point of order may be waived or appealed before or after action by the presiding officer respectively with the support of majority of senators b ecause the daytoncraig amendment could increase the uncertainty of implementing any negotiated change to trade remedy laws and therefore might reduce the administrations flexibility in negotiations the administration was forcefully opposed to the provision supporters however argued that the amendment was necessary to protect the us ability to address unfairhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31445crs5 foreign trade practices that hurt us firm s and us workers the conference report does not include the daytoncraig amendment consultations and assessment the bills and the conference report have virtually identical language on notice and consultation before nego tiation for some tariff agreements and for nontariff agreements the president at least 90 da ys before starting negotiations would be required to provide notice of intent to ter into negotiations and other information before and after giving notice the presid ent would have to c onsult with the revenue committees and such other committees the president deems appropriate and the newly established congressional over sight group cog described later the bills have similar but not identical language on sectorspecific negotiations for agriculture negotiations both bills would require the president to assess how us tariffs on agricultural produc ts compare to foreign tariffs on similar products and decide whethe r negotiations will address any disparity both bills require the president to consult with the revenue committees and the agriculture committees they both would establish special consultation and assessment procedures for import sensitive agricultura l products but the nate bill adds for these products that the ustr consult on foreign export subsidy programs and the senate bill has br oader definition of import sens itive agricultural products the senate bill but not the house bill has provision requiring the president to consult with specified committees on negotiations directly related to fish or shellfish trade and to keep the committees informed of negotiations on an ongoing basis both bills have identical language requiring the pres ident to assess us and foreign tariffs on textiles and apparel and to consult with the revenue committees on tariffs and negotiating objectives the conference report follows the language in the senate bill including the requirement that the president consult on negotiations related to fish or shellfish trade both bills and the conference report require that before entering into some tariff agreements and nontariff agr eements the president must consult with the revenue committees other committees of jurisdiction nd the cog they specify what the consultation should cover major difference among the bills and the conference report concerns notification by the president of proposed ch anges to trade remedy laws the house bill has provision for these specific types of changes the senate bill provides that at least 90 days before entering into trade agreement the president must notify the revenue committees of any such proposed change it requires the president to report why the amendments are seen as necessary and why they are consistent with related trade negotiating objective the senate bill would require that within 60 days of the presidents notification the ch airman and ranking member of the revenue committees in each house would report to their respective houses on the proposed amendments the conference report provides that at leas t 180 days before entering into trade agreement the president must report to the revenue committees on 1 the range of proposals advanced in the negotiations with respect to that agreement that may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31445crs6 in the final agreement and that could require amendments to the laws covering antidumping and countervailin g duties and safeguards nd 2 how these proposals relate to objectives descri bed in section 2102b14 the principal negotiating objective on trade remedy laws with respect to trade agreement with chile or with singapore the president must report at least 90 days before entering into the trade agreement the conference report provides that resolution may be introduced with respect to the presidents report this resolution would state that the proposed changes in the presidents report were inconsistent with the negotiating objectives described in section 2102b14 special legislative procedures would apply to the resolution as long as the revenue committee of that chamber has not reported out another resolution with respect to the presidents report and the committee has not reported out disapproval resolution unde r section 2105b lack of notice or consultations the two bills and the conference report have virtually identical language requiring private sector advisors to submit report on trade agreements not later than 30 days after the president notifies congress of the intent to enter into trade agreement they also have almost identical language requiring the president to give details of the agreement to the itc before entering into the agreement and requiring the itc to submit an economic assessment to congress within 90 days after the president enters into the agreement implementation of trade agreements the house and senate bills set down pr ocedures for presidential notification of congress and submission to congress of legislation to implement trade agreements negotiated under the trade promotion author ity the procedures include deadlines and required supporting information the sena bill prohibited any part of trade agreement not previously disclosed to congress from being considered for the expedited legislative procedures under the trade promotion authority the conference report retained the senate language in addition the two bills set down limita tions of trade authorities procedures which stipulate that an implementing bill will not receive expe dited treatment if within 60day period both houses of c ongress agree to procedural disapproval resolution regarding the trade agreement because of the lack of notification or consultation with congress on the part of the president the bills set down procedures for considering procedural disapproval resolutions the senate bill added provision requiring the secretary of commerce to submit report on us strategy to address what the bill refers to as instances where wto dispute settlement panels and the wto appellate body have added to us obliga tions through their decisions on us trade practices if the report is not provided the tpa would not apply to the implementing bill the conference report dopted the senate lang uage but added that the secretary of commerce must consult with the secretary of state the secretary of the treasury the attorney general and the ustr httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31445crs7 treatment of certain trade agreements for which negotiations have already begun the senate and house bills and the conference report are identical in allowing an exemption from prenotification requirements for certain trade agreements this exemption would apply to trade agreement that 1 is entered into under the wto entered into with chile entered into with singapore or establishes free trade area for the america and 2 results from negotiations that started before enactment of the tpa bill the conference adopted the language contained in the two bills congressional oversight group the two bills and the conference report have essentially the same provisions on the establishment of new congressiona l advisory body called the congressional oversight group cog members of c og would be the chairman and ranking member of the revenue committees thr ee other members from each of those committees more than two from the same party and the chairman and ranking member from any other committees with jurisdiction cog members would be official advisers to the us delegation in trade negotiations they would consult with and provide advice to the ustr on the formulation of objectives negotiating strategies and other trade matters both bills and the conference report would require the ustr in consultation with the chairman and ranking member of the revenue committees to develop guidelines for the exchange of information between the cog and the ustr the guidelines would provide for among othe r things regular detailed briefings on negotiating objectives access to documents coordination during negotiations and consultation on compliance and enforcemen t the only difference of note between the house and senate bills is that the senate bill would require the ustr to include in the guidelines timeframe for submitting labor rights report the conference report includes this senate provision other provisions both bills and the conference report have identical language requiring the president to submit along with the final text of the trade agreement plan for implementing and enforcing the trade agreement the plan would have to include along with cost analyses descripti ons of additional border personal needed additional personnel for monitoring nd implementing the trade agreement additional us customs service equipm ent and the impact on state and local governments the bills and conference report also have identical language stating that trade promotion authority is
