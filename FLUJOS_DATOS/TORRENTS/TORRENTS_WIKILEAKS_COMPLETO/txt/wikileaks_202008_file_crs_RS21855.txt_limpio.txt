years however the unresolved cyprus issue the failure of ankara to authorize the reopening of the greek orthodox theological seminary on the turkish island of halki and its refusal to recognize the

talks on aegean sea sovereignty disputes over air space territorial seas continental shelf and related issues for several years greece is determined to resolve all disagreements with turkey peacefully

exercises right to 12mile territorial sea as allowed under the law of the sea treaty greece is signatory of the treaty turkey is not greece also objects to turkeys infringements of greeces claimed

republic of macedonia declared its independence in 1991 its territory covers 39 of the historic region of macedonia the remaining 51 is in greece and 9 is in bulgaria macedonia asserts its right to use and be recognized by its constitutional name the republic of macedonia greece objects claiming that the name usurps greeces heritage and conveys irredentist ambitions against greeces largest

fyrom which is how greece refers to it httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21855 in 1995 athens and skopje signed an interim agreement to normalize relations and settle all outstanding disputes except for the name and greece ended an 18month long trade blockade of fyrom since then officials of both governments have met with the secretary generals personal envoy us lawyer matthew nimetz to discuss the name but have not reached mutually acceptable solution greek officials call for compromise composite name with clear geographic qualifier eg northern macedonia to be used everywhere6 in april 2008 greece whose position is solution means invitation for macedonia to join nato and the eu vetoed macedonias membership in nato because solution had been found it argued that because the name dispute is not resolved macedonia had failed to meet what greece said was the criterion of good neighborliness required of new nato members all greek political parties and the vast majority of the public support the governments position but the international trend in name usage favors macedonia with 120 governments recognizing it as the republic of macedonia athens and skopje have said that they are willing to resume negotiations on the name despite the name problem greece is top investor in the fyrom and bilateral trade is strong other regional issues greeks and serbs have particularly close ties based on their common orthodox christianity their alliance during the 20th century balkan wars and greek empathy during the division of yugoslavia greece hopes that serbia and all of its balkan neighbors eventually will become eu members in order to strengthen regional stability greece sought security councillegitimized mutually acceptable agreement on kosovo to reassure serbia and protect kosovar serbs it opposed kosovos unilateral declaration of independence as needlessly hasty violation of international law and perhaps because it might set precedent for northern turkish cyprus 5 interview

bilateral usgreek relations in november 2004 the united states formally recognized macedonia by its constitutional name the republic of macedonia prompting greek demarche the state department said that the decision was not directed against greece but intended to bolster macedonias stability and ensure its path toward multiethnic democratic state within its existing borders crs6 president bush added that the united states still would embrace any name that emerges from negotiations between athens and skopje the administration supports the assisted negotiations and regretted greeces veto of an nato invitation to macedonia because the name issue was unresolved hres 356 introduced on may 1 2007 and sres 300 introduced on august 3 would express the sense of congress that the fyrom should stop violating interim agreement provisions regarding hostile activities or propaganda and work to find mutually acceptable official name greece is one of 12 eu member states not part of the us visa waiver program vwp which allows shortterm visitors to enter the united states without visa greece had failed to meet the eligibility criteria by the time the program was frozen after 911 after the

order to guarantee its own httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21855 energy security and to collect transit fees yet the bush administration is concerned that planned greek energy links to russia ie the burgosalexandroupolis oil pipeline from russia via bulgaria to greece and the south stream natural gas pipeline from russia bulgaria and greece to italy and austria may undermine efforts to ensure europes energy security by diversifying sources from excess dependence on russia in line with this view the administration welcomed the turkeygreeceitaly pipeline that bypasses russia to supply azerbaijani natural gas to europe although official usgreek relations are generally cordial there is strong strain of antiamericanism in greece stemming from us support for the greek military junta that ruled from 19671974 and us failure to prevent the turkish invasion ofintervention in cyprus in 1974 among other issues unsupported allegations of us interference in domestic greek political affairs surface regularly antiamerican sentiment is manifest in periodic mass demonstrations mobilized by communists anarchists unions antiwar activists and antiglobalization forces whose influence is disproportionate to their numbers in society 7 greek deputy foreign minister us official discuss visa waiver program athens news agency february 8 2008 see also crs report rl32221 visa waiver program
