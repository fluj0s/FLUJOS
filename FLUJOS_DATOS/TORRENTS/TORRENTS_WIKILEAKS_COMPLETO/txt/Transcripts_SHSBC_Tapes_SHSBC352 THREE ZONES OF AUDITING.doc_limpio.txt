three zones of auditing lecture given on 5 november 1963 vas da date audience november the 5th five nova russian month five nov ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now youre facing cataclysm in auditinga cataclysm you havent recognized fully that you can be found out not as pc but as an auditor weve gone through the stages of finding out pcs now we can always find out the auditor the tone arm the motion of the tone arm finds you out and if you are still in state of wondering what it is wrong with the pc that youre not getting tone arm action then you have already been found out because an auditor can get tone arm action at will an accomplished auditor can get tone arm action at will tone arm action has to be prevented there are numerous ways this can be prevented numerous ways there are at least ten or twelve ways per auditor now if you multiply the number of auditors by ten or twelve you will possibly have some approximation of the number of ways that tone arm action can be prevented because its prevented by additive complications and failure to recognize basics failure to recognize basics today there are three zones of auditing three zones not of just auditing but three zones of applied scientology one is basic auditing two is case analysis and three is r4 now that meansthat means then that there are three zones of expertness and you should recognize these as separate and distinct areas of performance its in driving ear can you steer can you handle gearshift and can you start stop and run the motor via the accelerator i mean there are these three separate areas of action now this tends to reduce the amount of complication that youre confronted with because theres many an auditor will be doing r4 and falling all over himself but doing it perfectly writing down the items perfectly on lists with calligraphy that is beyond reproach who is reading his meter down to the finest point who knows every rule who knows every law connected with all goals finding lists and item findingknows it coldand who somehow or another will go splat and the pc wont make it and so forth because there remain two zones basic auditing and case analysis and he could do the techniques and processes of r4 with the most surpassing perfection without once colliding with winnot even accidentally his basic auditing could be out or his case analysis could be out he can do all the actions he has ability whatsoever to visualize bank two goals in juxtaposition to him means nothing it means its thought in advance of another thought or it means something hes playing mumbletypeg in the dark and getting his knuckles cut to ribbons because he doesnt know whats an engram and whats an implant and he doesnt know this and doesnt know that and he just hasnt got his paws on these items at all he can do the technique perfectly you see thathe can do that perfectly but the otherbluaah whats he getting with it well hell get all sorts of balderdash for one thing or another hell do perfect list and come out perfectly by the rules and he finds goal to be do have and find catfish well bunk brother there was never such goal ever invented anyplace by anybody and he has found this by opposing to dance it just doesnt make any sense but because he doesnt know what sense its supposed to make he then buys it lock stock and barrel you see the mechanical actions when im auditing these days i actually do just about the most mechanical job of auditing you ever cared to watch its just pocketapocketapocketapocketapock totally mechanical pc says waterspouts in the fireboxthats all right with you see ill write it down pc says to spit and then says to orangicate and to jump over the moon and to wear hip boots and says to spit again ill just write down to spit because thats what the pc said at that particular time you understand and then says to catfish and to be tiger and so forth and to spitill just write down to spit again because the pc said it you understand all right now hes running along and as long as he runs i dont pay any attention im just there and i read the meter and if something falls i mark it fall if it blows down i mark it blowdown and if its there its there and if it isnt there when i start nulling if it falls i mark it as fall and if i find two falls on the list or two rrs or two anythings except couple of ticks i just tell the pc to continue the list i dont care what the pcs saying and so on the pc says oh well that to spit thats my goal and so forth and i say all right thank you ill check it out here to spit id say well it doesnt read yet lets get some more charge off and see where we sit here now heres your auditing question just mechanical you see you drop nickel in the player piano man and it grinds off the roller you get the idea now that phase comes to end at one of two points either everything has gone off according to schedule and im sitting there looking at goal or whatever it is or it hasnt and ive got pc whos looking ragged and redeyed and whos getting awful droopy and so forth and at this point i become case analyst see you cant even hear the gears click but ive moved over into an entirely different department of auditing new department new sign on the door lrh case consultation i dont quite change my collar and hat but i think if you were watching it you would see almost that amount of change occur pcs been running things up to now and he fell on his head see im perfectly willing the pc go on and tell anything see as long as it fits up and so forth but now this thing has run into the wrong pocket and the thing has gone awry and ive got goofedup pc and ive got things that are bit not running right see it isnt all by perfection or simply the actionthe mechanical action of finding something has been concluded see see if something went wrong i consider the mechanical side of the picture is concluded thats it see just like youre coaching somebody thats it well thats all with the mechanics boy you have just lost your amanuensis and you have just inherited case analyst see all right the action either completed its cycle and finished or it went wrong and couldnt complete its cycle so its quick like bunny out with the drawer off with the robot auditor and on with the other hat see now now all right uhhuh nownow were in the case analysis department why did your grandfather have to marry the girl you see were going to get down to basics here now the data im using now is an entirely different set of data its how do banks go together does the goal to be do have and find catfish oppose to dance thats just see i asked that question i look at this thing thats been found here see to be do and have catfish you see and find catfish you see does this oppose to dance nope i say and im afraid at that point the pc could persuade plead do mammy act down on his knees and would find adamant i would let him itsa all of his reasonsas long as i was getting tone arm action but thats as far as i would go because thats over in the field of basic auditing which never completely deserts you and which well go into in minute but he says this to be do and have and find catfish was originally found in angeles by one of the best squirrels there and you see it it rocket reads and it wouldnt matter much it wouldnt matter much id let him tell anything he knew about it as long as i was getting tone arm action and after he got all through telling all about itbecause hes now gotten enough charge off so that maybe my case analysis is little more accurateid just go through my act and i find out whats wrong here because i know something is wrong now it isnt matter of is this list complete or isnt this list complete because im not now being the listing robot see im being the case analyst and i want to know how come this list is misbehaving thats what i want to know thats the first thing i want to know whats it coming from is it something wrong here has the pc not been answering the auditing question i dont count on an arc break you dont become case analyst just because you have an arc break and only because you have an arc break we want to know how does this bank add up which gpm has swapped ends with what gpm how has the pc managed to get himself into this mess now you get the idea and im going to find the answer well theres dozen potential answersfortunately very few more than thatand im going to find which one of these things apply and im going to straighten it out and after i got it all beautifully straightened out we find out in this particular instance that it was very very simple the pc has been guessing what goal harmonics on the goal before the goal which we have just been listing that was what the pc was listing you see what goal is an upper harmonic of the goal we had before the goal when hes supposed to be doing who or what would to dance oppose see thats what hes supposed to be asking see or the pc is saying what problem would to dance resolve see theres something goofy going on here and im going to find out what it is or im going to find out what bank misalignment when we did to dance in all innocencebecause i take it at any given instant that having gotten more charge off our analysis will be more accurate than previous analyses so i never count on any analysis carrying forward in time analysis is valid after the date of the analysis why because the accuracy of an analysis depends upon the amount of charge taken off the case so at any future date if you can audit at all you have taken more charge off the case and so youll get more accurate analysis all analyses are subject to inaccuracy by reason of charge therefore tone arm action in the interval having removed charge from this particular area will now make it possible for you to get more accurate analysis any analysis you do is succeeded by more accurate analysis until there isnt anything there to analyze you got it thats the only time when you never reanalyze or requestion anything on tuesdayon tuesday we have found out absolutely equivocally with exclamation points with rocket reads with pc sell with total auditor agreement with everything just flags going up in all directions you see small guy fawkes fireworks coming out of the emeterevery sign points to the fact that to dance is an actual gpm yeah but that was tuesday what will it do on thursday we are now analyzing case on thursday well then my analysis is never based on the comfortable feeling that tuesday i had right answer at any given instant on any analysis it is only the factors present now which are analyzed thats the only safe way to do an analysis you can make some of the most colossal mistakes lets say youre going up the bank trying to find the pt gpm and you found the goal to play golf and you marked that down very carefully as the third gpm youre nut if you just keep on believing from here on out that when you come back down the bank having removed two gpms off the case youre going to find to play golf probably hasnt anything to do with it see its probably lock on an ri in the third gpm to recreate got the idea but at that time when you first were going up the bank you checked it over is this an actual gpm brroow you know fireworks rocket reads everything oh the pccognite cognite oh everything terrific you see blowdowns oh marvelous it doesnt cut any ice on thursday because thursday is two more days of charge off the case dont you see so youre always approaching more accurate potential analysis right up to the moment that you attain ot youre going to be horrified youre going to run some goals perfectly correctly absolutely every item out of the thing and yet few months from now when youre goingsomebodys going over this case theyre going to find out that half the items were missed and threequarters of them were wrong somehow or another you got by however and so forth well thats the case analysis with the case that far upgraded dont you see so of course the analysis i more accurate analysis is not dependent upon the auditors ability to read an meter it is dependent upon the pcs ability to itsa and therefore its going to shift the fond beliefs of tuesday are where most case analyses come apart at the seams because on thursday with two days of charge off youre liable to get some different answers that make lot more sense you understand you never take case analysis for granted these things are always taken conditionally always conditionally an auditor needs nice full saltshaker sitting around under the corner of his emeter you see so he can always take everything with grain of salt case analyst is skeptic but his skepticism must not be so high as to undermine the pcs confidence so this again is another frame of mind an entirely different frame of mind your robot frame of mind well the guy says i spit and so forth and he puts that down and thats goal and oh my you got another one and thats another goal and he puts it down to spit again and so on and youyour frame of mind is well he said it so we write it down and the meter said this so we write it down and theres nothing going on here except thats what youre doing you see you can sit and dream about the weather as far as thats concerned theres mental strain here of any kind whatsoever see thats an attitude thats the attitude of the auditor running the process you see now we shift the hat we get different attitude not challenging invalidating attitude with regard to the pc but an attitude ofwhich is best attended by the song it may be so i really dont know your story sounds you know thisits not really skeptical attitude but its the attitude of somebody listening to the tales of several travelers who have just come back from far land they have not been to with different stories its not buying attitude its not any kind of an attitude well thats what it is so we will try that one on see well this is the best we can arrive at so this is what we will use to proceed withwarily expecting all trucks to come off the rails at any given instant see were proceeding warily under this the case analysis is always as good as it is at the time it is done and is better than that and theres reason to get misemotional about it just because on thursday you got different answers ive seen auditors go out and contemplate suicide you see just on this basis but onbut on tuesday but on tuesday it was an actual gpm andandand so forth and it read and everything ran and everything ran along beautifully on tuesday and and now i find out its just lock not even an ri its lock on an ri and ohhh deeeear ohhh well theres reason to be like that about it because the reality of the situation is is that thursday of course with more charge off is going to give you better answer so you can always look for better answer all answers are taken conditionally and everything you know about bank and about case and about how the thing ought to stack up is used theres stops it isnt basis of well i cant make the pc wrong by saying this to be do and find catfish doesnt sound to like an actual gpm you mustnt say something like that you see because that would be invalidative of the pc the thing to do is accept it and let the pc run out of rr in the next few minutes of play oh yes yes like nonsense it is you see you dont want to speak invalidatively theres trick of doing this ill show you an invalidation the pc says you know imy goalmy goal is really to be do and find have and find catfish and thats thats my goal and you say oh yeah all right okay okay you want to check that out all right to be do have and find catfish to be do have and find catfish im sorry that doesnt read right now thats not an invalidation this is invalidationthis is invalidation the pc says my goal is to be do have and find catfish oh mmhm to run to walk say something else to the meter rather than what the pc said and youre in trouble right now ill give you an idea the pc says theres some more suppresses on thisthis doesnt just apply to lists see theres some more suppresses on this okay on soandso has anything been invalidated yes goddamnit what you just said has been im invalidated you know arc break here we go see thats direct invalidation because its basically disagreement dont you see youve gone through all the actions of disagreement so you dont care what the pc says you dont immediately throw it in his teeth and say under circumstances is there such goal as to be do and have find catfish without even checking it and start answering you know well check it the pc wants it checked check it skin off anybodys noseitll read or it wont but you got this on the listto be do have and find catfishand thats supposed to be the last item on the list and this is supposed to be what is opposed by to dance not in your bank not in anybodys bank it aint never happened and it never going to happen the kind of goal youll get its very hard to imagine what itll be before you eventually see it and sometimes you get beautifully surprised but you have an idea already of the kind of goal youre looking for what would to dancewhat goal would to dance oppose well probably to be sour you know to be something itll be some different type of action you see to be funereal you know to drag you know to sag you know or something like this itll be some kind of funereal goal sometimes theyre very clever sometimes theyre very tricky and you can miss them and theyyou have to think about them for moment and all of sudden you see that it would but it definitely would oppose it it definitely would oppose it not resolve it it oppose it bang goals are in opposition its white today on this bank and its black tomorrow on that bank you get the idea i mean bang bang direct oppositions they make dichotomy you see to be happy is followed by to be sad and its more complicated than that you see so you can figure yourself to death in case analysis and so forth but you should have general idea you should have general idea about what youre going to get there and sometimes youre very agreeably surprisedto dance comes out as to be funeral director see something like this you know and its just little bit offbeat and then sometimes it takes you little bit by surprise and you could beat yourself to death by not accepting it and so forth it is or it isnt but because you know case analysis you know what youre looking at now if you got goal like that however to be do and have catfish as to dance opposeahh if you just got through running to dance and it didnt run out of rr it obviously was the goal theres doubt about that but theres something messed up here someplace and you better find out what it is maybe you overran the bottom of the goal maybe you got items in that goal from something else maybe the analysis of the goal or the goal looks all right however it doesnt seem to be bad off so it seems to behave the right line plot and everything so youre not being critical in this particular line because it looks all right so you finallyyou decide well to dancetheres nothing wrong with that as the source to list from that would be the first thing that would give you some wild goal like this as the only goal you could get on the list you see to be do and have catfish see so theres nothing wrong with the source youre listing from it looks all right it checked out youve run it and so forth when youre just doing goal opposes trying to get to present time and so forth youre running it blind because you really never have second check of running it final check of goal is will it run not will it behave on the meter see but will it run do you get line plot off of it thats the final test of valid gpm now then you must assume other things amongst those is the pc might have been out of session while he was listing it might be an arc break involved here that you hadnt suspected you throw those things aside or accept them or the pc wasnt answering the auditing question or something of the sort so we go into some kind of dissertation with the pc finally decide the pc couldnt have been answering the auditing question theres something wrong here so you ask exactly what were you doing as you were listing this list and so forth and you finally get well i was trying to list the harmonic on the list which just came before this and so forth and i wasi knew what it could be because you see on on just before to danceto dance you see we had to be sad andand so forth so obviously its something about being leisurely oror something and that would be what it all right have you found the answer well youll find out that when things are wrong your tone arm is wrong always youre not getting action on the tone arm its stuck high or its messed up in some way but basically youre not getting tone arm action when you dont get tone arm action you either have just runif youre running why the tone arm action depends on getting the next item but this thingthis tone arm action is pretty extreme and youve made an error of some kind or another well when you get that straightened out that tone arm action will correct soon as you get your tone arm action corrected and looking little bit better and you got the answer to what this is all about and so forth you got the answer now at that moment you remove your hat as case analyst and you put it in the drawer and you take out your hat as mechanical auditor and you put it on and you say this is the auditing question this this is the auditing question the auditing question is what goal would to dance oppose now have you got that you know we went little bit astray just moment ago the pc is saying rrraah rrraah little astray you know just moment ago not answering the auditing question so lets make sure we answer this auditing question real good and so on youre doing fine all right but lets get the auditing question answered now now what goal would to dance oppose all right ththththat ththththat ththththat that that and you get the list go through all the rules andjust mechanicaland you come up smiling bright thats all there is to it theres two hats and one of them is always in the drawer the speed with which you shift these hats is sometimes rather bewildering but its actually hat shift so it isnt something that you should get all tangled up about and get your feet all wound up in the rope with because in actual fact you are never the mechanical listing auditor and the case analyst at the same tune and you are never the mechanical auditor when theres something wrong with the case you cant do the job so you obviously are case analyst and after the case is straightened out there is more need for case analysis thats another point you should keep in mind if theres nothing to analyze dont analyze if everythings going along smouthily now why you go along smouthily back to your mechanical auditor hat see lets not start making trouble for the pc as case analyst lets not start showing off youve found the answer youve restored the case the pc is cheerful the tone arm is now in reasonable situation life it looks much brighter to one and all well this is the point where you should take off the case analyst badgehat and put it in the drawer and put back on the mechanical auditor hat dadadada dededededa dededededa dededededa just all sweetness and light and youre not saying is that an actual gpm are you sure youre listing right now you well i wonder if that is so on and so on youre doing uvruhrrhururh its just all sweetness and light tadadada the pc says oranges are black you say okay thank you good fine anything he saysall right got the idea well so that takes down your complications to considerable extent to compartment your actions see if you try to run both of these actions at the same time youll go mad youll be under such tension that you will develop gpms with it now theres one hat which you wear all the time all the time all the time all the time even though youre shifting these other two hats youve got another hat on the back of your head and that is the basic auditing hat and if you cant do the basic auditing hat then it doesnt matter how brilliant you are as case analyst it doesnt matter how marvelously mechanical you areand believe its marvelous to be that mechanical you know for just your r4 hat it takes lot of skill just to sit back there and just do nothing but so the sun is shining and everything is fine the pc says there are fire engines in the beauty shop and you write down there are fire engines in the beauty shop go to hell we dont care everythings fine but your basic auditor hat could be wrong and prevent you from doing that if your basic auditor hat is wrong both of these hats go wrong matter how well skilled you are in both of them you could be case analyst with exclamation points halfway down the wall you could know r4 backwards and upside down count the name rank and serial number of every bulletin which ever carried listing rule on it and so forth and be able to do shorthand pitman and gregg simultaneously with three different pencils on three different lists on three different pcs and you still wouldnt make any ots because the basic auditor hat is the third hat and its worn all the time and its not complicated hat it starts originally with tr 0 whatever other trs you have it still starts originally with tr 0 which is being able to sit in the session and confront the pc you see and it goes up to tr 1 giving an auditing command that somebody can hear and understand and that impinges on somebody and giving an acknowledgment when one is needed not giving acknowledgments when theyre not needed and forgetting to give them when they are guys going on teteteta burte ta budeta deyap yapyapyapyappleyappleyappleyappleyappleyapple yappleyappleyappleyappleyappleyapple your tr 2 has got to be good enough just to go on and on and on and on and on you acknowledge the completion of cycle of action well youve asked whatsit and the pc hasnt completed the itsa so you sure dont acknowledge because the acknowledge is stop point so its gauging the cycle of action which youre handling thats basic auditing whats the extent and length of this cycle of action one whatsit and fifty itsas all right therefore at the fiftieth itsa you say good is the length of it one whatsit and one itsa so therefore at the length of the itsaone itsa you say good thats elementary see the complete cycle of action of the whatsit and itsa is followed by tr 2 now youve got yourself great big lot of ability if you can do that you know basic auditing has practically nothing to do with anything i that anybody thinks it has anything to do with you know its giving somebody something to talk about and letting him talk and telling him he has talked when he has talked you see and when he originates and says you know that goal to be have do and dance catfish you know that thatthatthat thing that we had and so forth you dont immediately jump in and say that was to be do have and find catfish that was to be do have and find catfish that you found not be do have and dance catfish that wasthat was something else dont you remember so your auditors code comes into it too bit see weve had these things for long time they arent anything new we can state them more smouthily but pc originates and says you know that goal we found you know i just realized that applies very definitely to my marriage you know even though it wasnt my goal it does have something to do with my marriage and so forth let him finish the cycle of action you see there of that origin hes making and so forth and hes run down and you get tr action so you just keep your mouth shut because hes making cognition and so on you gauge the point when hes finished with his cognition youve understood what he said and you told him you heard it thats just basic auditing there isnt anything can get around it at all now we add the complication into basic auditing as part of basic auditing of being able to run an emeter while doing those things run an emeter well enough so that when the needle goes ping against the right hand edge of the dial your thumb goes slip and rights it to set and when it goes tick we know it has gone tick and when it has rocket read we know it has rocket read and when its fallen we know it has fallen and weve adjusted it and noted that thing accordingly and this is done all the time when basic auditing is going on and so on so the woof and warp of basic auditing can get terribly complicated on this basison this basis this fundamental you ask most auditors what are you doing they will tell you what they were doing but if you asked them this question at that point in the session what happened they will inevitably tell you i did this i did that i did something else theyre more likely to tell you i soandso and soandso theyre not telling you what happened theyre telling you what they did that isnt what happened because all basic auditing actions are coordinated with the pc an auditor may be just going through some mechanical motions of some kind or another but he is still handling another thetan and full bank and what happened in the session combines what the pc did what the bank did and what the auditor did and what read on the meter and theres four elements that comprise what happened now this is asking you to extend your perimeter of permeation when you are so sucked back to your chest that you cant see beyond the other edge of your emeter the chances are you arent going to be able to do the trs either but youre handling pc and youre handling bank and youre handling meterin addition to your own actions and frankly your own actions in session are completely unimportant ninety percent of students worry is about his own actions in the session how did he hold his little finger of his right hand while he asked the auditing question and did he have the right vocal intonation when he asked the auditing question was his diction absolutely proper when he said thankgulpyou thats the most wasted show in the world it has audience theres audience theres applause there are observers the most unseen character in the world is an auditor in session he actually unless hes born exhibitionist is about as visibleabout as visible as drop of water in running stream it isnt that he isnt there its just that he isnt visible hes an almost perfect example of thetan that isnt packing mass and if he understands that his actions in session are not the important actions of session at all theyre not the important actions of session the important actions of the session are the performance of the pc the pcs bank and the meter and the auditors actions are completely unimportant except where they get in the road and fail to promote the actions of the pc the pcs bank and the emeter so an auditor consistently worrying about his own actions and what hes supposed to do right and what hes done wrong in session im learning some of this from critiques people are making of their own auditing yeah thats right theyre all critiques of their own auditing i couldnt care less they dont realize that i have yet to receive proper report of an analysis of session given on tape i have yet to receive proper report im still waiting for one to come in there are some that are almost proper in spots but they allmost of them concern what the auditor did who cares do you realize the auditor is not going to get clear on his own actions in session now this is impressed on you by your instructors by the fact they do trsby your coachesyoure supposed to be able to do this do that and the other thing but little study of this sort of thing goes long long ways an auditors actions can be anything they care to be as long as they are not destructive of the continuity of the session an auditor actually runs mostly on lack of action see he doesnt have to do this and do that and do the other thing and not do this and not do that and not do the other thing thats bunch of balderdash somebodys orienting his auditing on the subject of i should not and i should and i should wiowhawait minute wait minute this is an auditing session and thats third dynamic activity the auditors merely running it now its only when the auditor starts putting his feet on the desk and getting the shoes in the pcs face that we run into the notdos or its only when the auditor sits there tonguetied and the pcs going into big arc break and the auditors saying well lets see the right way to itsa is to hehheh you know you ought to be in there pitching what thewhatwhat cooked here what happened see he apparently is not adding anything into the session hes not getting anything done in the session hes not directing the session hes not getting the session running in any particular direction so thats an absence of auditor now the pc arc breaks and the auditor sits there and says oh its perfectly reasonable i have goofed so therefore its perfectly reasonable you know lot of pcs been knocked in the head with this in fact i know of one auditor this actually is not fully the story of it but just in passing saw everything the pc was saying so reasonable the pc was alreadyfor other reasons having nothing to do with the auditingon the way out the curtains were ringing down the betweenlives areas were yawning and the auditor however did have lastminute chance in order to make grab back see the pc arc broke over period of days actually and the auditor sat there and said that everything the pc was saying was reasonable and so never tried to cure the arc break well the pc died sad story but i wish to drive it home that happens very rarely but this isolated incident did happen purely and for that exact and only reason the auditor knew that everything the pc was saying was reasonable the auditor did not know how to audit well the auditor did not know how to read meter the auditor did not you get the story here you see so therefore the auditor sat and agreed that this was all true and pc never arc breaks for those reasons pc arc breaks because of uncompleted cycles of action bypassed charge and when thats kicked into view the pc arc breaks and his attention fixates on the auditor now session arc break is where the auditor has gorgeously goofed and has yanked the pcs attention with violence off of some charged object thus not completing the arcthe cycle of action of the pcs inspection and so this causes collapse which is very painful to the pc and the pc will take it out on the auditor but in actual fact an eradication of that sudden yank of attention is what is needful to cure this arc break so the auditor who gets in reasonable frame of mind about his auditing an auditor who gets in reasonable frame of mind about his arc breaks or gets unreasonable and starts protesting against it simply doesnt understand the mechanism of an arc break his auditing really had very little to do with itvery little to do with it except where the basics of auditing are violently followed the pc is saying ive got ive got large cat here on the table and the auditor says well im not going into that now get that nasty cat off the table you see thats liable to produce shock but why not really because of what the auditor said but because the pcs attention was yanked suddenly off the cat the cat collapsed on it and you had bypassed charge right there right then and then the auditor did nothing to restore the attention and get rid of locate the bypassed charge do you understand auditors running r4 may go on for days weeks even with big section of bypassed charge and the pc nattery and arc broken the auditors saying all the time this is nattery and arc broken pc that is an auditor who doesnt know his basic business he just doesnt know his business had nothing to doeven case analysis he just doesnt know his business arc broke pcsomething big wrong see so thats the time when you take the basic auditing hat and add to it the case analysis hat basic auditing has gone wrong so you add case analysis to it to make it work thats all there is to that auditors never reasonable about an arc break if theres big arc break then theres something big wrong with the case it isnt that you have slightly misworded some little tiny ri in some corner of caseugh bluh you got couple of goals wrongly worded and backwards brother great big husky gpms are pushing this pcs head off and then of course basic auditing failed slightly and produced the necessary lock to cause the arc break to swing up into session it all requires little error in basic auditing to trigger the arc break wrong goal can sit there long time without ever being fired into an arc break until all of sudden the itsa line is cut or imagined to be cut and the pc will flare on that lock into an arc break that arc break means only this that theres something godawful wrong with that case thats all that means somethings gone wrong in the case analysis department not in the basic auditing department the basic auditing department can always be improved always and improved 100 percent to absolute perfection will not avoid arc breaks will not all by itself make case run smoothly given errors in the case analysis department basic auditing in the world personality i am holy man and everything in my vicinity of course runs calmly i permeate peace thats not going to prevent an arc break brother you found wrong goal and you listed it upside down theres only one thing going to straighten that out and thats finding its wrong goal and that it was upside down you understand so that comes back into the case analysis department but basic auditing is something we do smoothly not selfcritically we do very smooth job of basic auditing and thats what we do in basic auditing we dont do dededededa and then not do dedededa and budadabup but if you dededededa you will davdvadvadvavaw andand if you get crisscrossed up and if the pc says awigawag you never say kapow pow you see bunk that is the wrong way to study basic auditing i mean that is the wrong way to study basic auditing basic auditing does really not consist of bunch of dos and donts it consists of thetan sitting there in the auditing chair running pc and the pcs bank and verifying it on meter and keeping up the auditing cycle whether the big one or the little onejust keeping it kicked ahead and keeping it going and theres really rule or trick in it anywhere that solves all of its problems and so forth because it isnt that complicated an action you make it far more complicated an action than it really is you say to the pcyou say to the pcyouyoure into techniques in how do you produce tone arm action youre not into basic auditingnot really but basic auditing will produce tone arm action if its being done the auditor says how are you today joe i dont care what the whatsit is how are you today joe this is basic auditing see joe says well when i woke up this morning and i wasnt feeling so good and so on i still have little bit of headache and so forth and i think it was that letter i got from aunt susiebelle and so on and she so on and so on and so on and so on and the auditor sits there and basic auditing simply requires that as long as that tone arm is moving you dont do another ruddy rrrrrr goddamn thing see heh its almost too elementary see and finally the tone arm steadies down and the pcs finished saying what hes saying but even though he has stopped talking he might still be thinking over the remainder of the communication and if so youll be getting some needle and tone arm reaction you dont even have to learn to look at the pc and tell whether he was introverted or extroverted you can tell it off meter and he goes on and pretty soonand he looks at you and he looks blankly into thin space for maybe minute two minutes three minutes four minutes five minutes it doesnt matter how long and youre still getting the tone arm action and so forth and he finally turns around and he says yeah ii guess thats all i guess thats how i feel this morning and you say good well wheres the technique see unless interrupted and blasted with bazookas with his chair pulled out from underneath him and the auditor eating crunchy brand of candysee additive additive additive additive why basic auditing runs off nicely now youve got to know what to ask the pc now youre getting slightly into techniques now what do you ask the pc to produce tone arm action well youre getting into the technique sector and i started out by calling it r4 because were mainly talking about routine 4 and im trying to coordinate it with you but at lower levels the techniques still belong up there in that sector what technique do you use well whatever technique you use you run it the way it is supposed to be run if its run with little bit of assessment and little bit of this and little bit of that and so forth its still run first with basic auditing then with technique and if anything goes wrong you finish the cycle of the thing with case analysis its always onetwothree proposition the one hat you wear all the time is the basic auditing hat now as long as youve got this basic auditing hat terrifically tangled up with techniques as long as youve got it terrifically tangled up with case analysis as long as youve got case analysis terrifically tangled up over here with techniques youre going to be in mess man i feel for you i can see you now supposed to be asleep lying there upon your pillow bit of salt water dripping upon the cambric quietly in the dark and if i was to appear at that moment and you were to ask what am i doing wrong why id almost hit it right on the groove if i said well youve got basic auditing mixed up with technique youve got technique mixed up with case analysis youve got case analysis mixed up instead of basic auditing and your basic auditing is probably absent while youre doing other things and so forth and if youd just straighten these things out into its three ponds then learn to do each one of these things first basic auditing without injecting what you are doing in it very much but just do the actions of basic auditing and the techniquewell learn what the technique is and then adapt and fit that into so your basic auditing can go on and run it and when you run into trouble or finish the technique go into case analysis and so forth why you probably would take look at that and be able to figure out exactly what you did had crossed up you probably would close your eyes and go soundly to sleep if you heard i cant talk loud yet anyhow the situation then is that compartmentation of action brings about comprehension of action you go down in the engine room of ship and you see the big whizzles going around the scrubbles and the ruddybars pounding out against the flogwheelslooks awful complicated to you till somebody points out that those bars belong to the generator and these bars belong to the main engine and those up there theyre steam pipes and they simply have to do with the fire room and they have nothing to do with all this moving machinery you take it apart and you can understand it you realize that all those bars up there can swhen they stop well the lights go out in the ship and when these bars down herethese great big oneswhen they go out why the ship stops moving through the water and when the fire goes out in there why neither one of them moves see and right away you understand this little bit better see actually you could teach woolly fuzzwuzz that much compartmentation about steam engineering dont you see so its not too much hill to climb and basic auditing is the firebox see youre putting something into this session or youre not dont you see and as longwhen thats absent why nothing moves just nothing see andnot good analogy but the generating equipment and that sort of thingthats the technique and the big drives going aroundthats the pcs bank man and as long as that bank is moving youve got tone arm action and youve got things happening the pcs getting better and everything is going along beautifully all of sudden why you come to session one day and you got headache and your basic auditing goes out and everything goes to hell so you remedy your handling of technique you go study bulletin on r2h you see to get this new technique because you didnt have good session with the pc so you get down r2h perfectly perfectly you get it down so itjust to the exact point and you listen to tape on it and you get it absolutely squared and you go into the next session your basic auditing out the window do perfect r2h and you lay beautifulwshhhboom well the main drives werent running you see so you repaired the generating set which was running wasnt anything wrong with your technique you just didnt happen to be applying it small oversight dont you see all the valves were open but there was nothing generating steam to make better analogy simple you actually think you are being trained as auditors in actuality you are simply being untrained over all of the complications which during the vast vistas of time you have accumulated with regard to human relationships and minds and im simply trying to lead you through this maze these barbwire fences these down forests these windfalls this snow wind storm and ice and sleet that you imagine is there and finally point out to you that it doesnt matter whether its there or not this is what you do and you get marvelously simplified look at the situation see i imagineyou know in the writing professions they always have writers who cannot write unless they have their blue slippers on they have musicians who cannot play unless they have the purple handkerchief in the swallowtail coat pocket you see you have the fellow who always has to have china cat on the piano you see before he can give concert you know you have the prima donna who must always have received green and purple chrysanthemums just before in order to have good luck you know youve got all this nonsense well actually thats just big substitute for knowing what theyre doing its big substitute for confidence its they put it off into something else theyve got it fitted into some other thing because youre actually wearing all these three sectors very solidly with high level of responsibility asked but youll find out that person believes that if he takes too much responsibility in one of these sectors or something like that its liable to go wrong well thats just because hes unconfident its best sort of to let the pc run the sessionthis is one frame of mind see see this has nothing to do with basic auditing or anything else this is athis is new datum that is interjected this is one of the additives it is really best to let the pc pretty well run the session and the hidden datum is because if anything goes wrong then it really isnt my fault and we call this making the pc selfdetermined see thats the way we excuse this frame of mind so were into complication now that has to be battered down with clubs if youre going to get at anything see all right now lets go in the other way the pc doesnt know what hes talking about and is going to get himself into severe trouble and i will be to blame so therefore i had better do everything in the session and not permit the pc to do anything in the session because if you depend on the pc that will make him guilty and thats like blaming the pc and you really shouldnt do that so we must relieve all responsibility from the pc and therefore itsa only on the meter you get this frame of mind well this is this reverse vector of responsibility on the thing lets take full responsibility for the thing you see and then it wont go wrong well whats all this worry about it going wrong i dont know why you worry about it going wrong and yet an auditor audits more poorly if he himself has had some bad sessions then he has the example of how wrong it can go if as pc hes had some very bad sessions or as an auditor hes conducted some bad sessions now hes got reality on the fact that it can go wrong and he actually starts fighting back against it going that wrong and hell start fighting back against its going that wrong up to point of where he does nothing in session but keep it from going wrong so theres of course session theres just an effort to not have wrongnesses thats not session there are many ways that you could analyze this there are many ways you could understand it but this is all in the matter of being conducted across the storm sleet rain night barbwire fences and howlingwolf type forests to safe plateau of confidence dont you see its all liabilities as long as you recognize that additives are the main thing and frankly youin the field of basic auditing theres very little to teach you very very little to teach you in basic auditing all you have to do is observe that pc has an attention line on his own bank and that when you ask question his line goes on his bank and you should let it go on his bank until hesuntil its through going on his bank and then you should tell him well thats now off of your bank when it comes off the bank and keep an agreement on the situation and just gets these things running find out what the mind is doing this fellows worried about squirrels so all right you just say well when did you start worrying about squirrels now youre in the technical department over here you see thats the technique department so you know that theres something to do if youyou got the times hes worried about squirrels all right thats fine but now you fit that into basic auditing and youre back on the same old stand now youre noplace else youre asking question and hes going to play theplay the attention line on the stuff in the bank and your tone arms going to move and when hes finished talking why youre going to tell him hes finished talking and what the hell i mean how can you make anything complicated out of this see its not possible really most auditors genius iswhen theyre having hard timeis best demonstrated in finding difficult way to do it because in actual fact it cant be complicated techniques are taken care of over here in this second department see there are ways to run these techniques and they run off in train maneuver actually it requires quite little grooving and training to run technique its all sort of dadadadada woundup doll and this wound up doll stuff goes on but back of that woundup doll stuffthats not auditing see theres auditing connected with all right when was that arc break see dadadada and so forth and all right now was it caused by affinity communication or reality is it soandso waffwaffwa well this is all sort of phonographrecord stuff you see at any momentat any moment the auditors basic auditing hat is liable to go on he says was it affinity and the pc says well theres your basic auditing hat see the pc says oh well you know it could have been long time about 19 and there was this girl and so forth could have been affinity you know its funny thing but every time i thought of that in connection with that particular incident i waff waffwaffwaffwaffwaffwaff waffwaffwaffwaff waffwaffwaffwaff waffwaff well how long is he going to waffwaffwaff well it doesnt matter how long he waffwaffwaffs because youre auditing the whole time there is speeding it up or slowing it down except as it produces or fails to produce tone arm action now if you let him go waffwaffwaffwaffwaff on was it affinity when actually it was communication and you didnt get down to point of being able to assess that yet you know and hes going waff waffwaft on this particular subject and the tone arm is sitting here at 47 period and it isnt going anyplace else and you let him waffwaff waff for half an hour youve got rocks in your head see thats basic auditing hatwhere is it where is it look through the drawers man you must have parked it down therethe last time you took off your case analysis hat you must have removed your basic auditing hat too this guy has finished talking but because you are being silent you are inviting itsa in some peculiar way oh yes you could explain it but the truth of the matter is is time is going by without tone arm action so what hat is out the basic auditing hat is out not the technique hat not the case analysis hat its the basic auditing hat thats out youre letting the guy run on and on and on and be insession without getting tone arm action so obviously he has said all there is to say and hes asised everything there is to asis and he has done everything you have required of him and you are now from here on in some weird way cleaning clean from now on out so you of course arent auditing you just havent perceived you ask him whatsit and you said was this affinity was this caused by affinity and then you looked at him expectantly you see in other words you threw your basic auditing hat into the middle of your technique hat see you just didnt go woundup doll say was it affinity was it dadadada wadadadadada tick tock bing bang that was dbowbowbowbowbow down the line but you pause somewhere you invited this you caused something to be corrected you know youre somehow or another inviting an itsa youre not in control of the session you got your basic auditing hat of getting him to answer question you dont want question answered you want tick on meter you understand now if youre getting ta action on slow assessment thats another thing thats the technique dont you see but this youre just simply trying to find the source of the arc breakpowpowpowpowpowpowpowpow pow oh bing bang see all right there it isbang youve done it back to the basic auditing hat it says here that this is false communication that caused the arc break is that so oh now you get wafflewaffle waffle yipyipyip yopyopyopyop yiffleyopyop wafflewafflewaffle waffle down comes the tone arm up goes the tone arm down goes the tone arm wafflewafflewafflewaffle there we go there we go thats it thats wrow its so wrow and so on so on and it was so on and so on and iiit was aunt sadie it was dear old tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action and so forth what are you doing youre getting tone arm action what are you doing auditing see all basic auditing is is coordinating your question and the pcs itsa with the tone arm and when theres nothing happening in the session make sure that you grab the technique or the other hat and get somethingand the case analysis hatand get something to happen see and when it isnt happeningwell the tone arms rolling now thats fine and so forth just keep kicking the ball along man keep pouring the coal into the firebox and letting the flames roar youre just sitting back there and you saypc says your pc says oh scraffle scraffle and you notice well he said scraffle scraffle and its been kind of little while and we dont seem to be getting any tone arm action here and he seems to be getting sort of dark in his statements of scraffle scraffle maybe im overrunning this particular thing recognize an error in basic auditingyouve invited an itsa on something without having any coal on the fire see you just went for vacation or something when you shouldnt have as far as the basic auditing hat youll get all this stuff coordinated theres really nothing to it theres three hats now youre taking the basic auditing action in the basic auditing actionyou can do all kinds of wild things with basic auditing and produce tone arm action you can produce tone arm action with do birds fly perfectly done as basic auditing action now you think im kidding try it some time do birds fly thats as close as you can get to technique see go through model session and run do birds fly youd be surprised youd get some tone arm action the pc says this is boring and tiring process to have nothing whatsoever to do with that and you say okay and if you do it all right hell then explain to you why its basic and boring process and youll get quite bit of tone arm action youve got to have the pc willing to talk to you and got to have the pcs attention on his own case and you shouldnt go yanking his attention off his case and putting it on you because youre not putting on show youre just the auditor its not matter of merely the auditor but the best auditor is totally unperceived in session hes not visible man his presence is felt not seen hes just about as close as you can get to an invisible man now of course its the technique and its the state of the case as arrived at in case analysis which gives you the technique and the application of the technique and the woundupdoll characteristics with which you can deliver that particular technique and when to stop delivering the technique and so forth these are all questions which are really independent of basic auditing they have to do with the understanding of whats technique and whats basic auditing and whats case analysis but basic auditing its your ability to just sit there and be uncomplicated and keep the ball rolling actually the divisions do not at first appear sharp to you they would not appear sharp to you because at the present moment i imagine youve got them pretty well intertwined you say what is auditing auditing is running the process go to the foot of the class auditing is not running the process auditing is doing basic auditing running the process and having an analysis of the case that justified your running the process and tells you when the process is flat see so theres three different departments involved here auditing is three different departments you say well an auditor actuallyin session an auditor should sit thereshould sit there and answer politely well i dont know i dont know if thats statement of auditing or not dont you see why its only one section of the session one section of the sessionthats the auditor see theres three other sections of the session and the two most important parts of the session are completely omitted thats the pc and his ability to itsa which youre trying to improve and that is the bank which is knocking the pcs head off and via the pc can knock yours off too if you mishandle it all right theres two biggreat big important pieces of the session and theyre the most important pieces of the session the most important of course is the pc and the next most important is the pcs bank and the next most important thing is the emeter and the verificationindication verification process of what the pc said and we get down to not the most unimportant part of session you understand because hes actually the most important as far as the beingness of the session is concerned but the most invisible or unexamined or not germane conduct not germane is the auditor see theseyou dont concentrate on the auditor fellow says i listened to this report of my case analysis and i found out that i cut the pcs and i found and i did this and then in the session i said oh man theyre not answering the auditing question the auditing question on criticism of your auditing thing hell it has nothing to do with what you did who cares what you did nobodyunless it got in the road of the session or failed to make the session run now thats important what is important is what happened in the session see its not case of i cut the pcs itsa oh its the fact the pc was itsaing and was apparently asising some portion of the bank and was prevented from doing so by dropping the emeter off the table on his foot thats what happened so now you see you have all elements expressed but i cut the pcs itsai dont think you have the power to cut the pcs itsa what kind of thetan shears do you use see the pc also can cut his own itsa dont be so selfconscious you dont always cut the pcs itsa to make the arc break you see you do it frequently enough but once in while you just didnt pick up the ball at that particular minute or steer in that particular direction and with perfect aplomb you were steering to the right and you should have been steering to the left and everything exploded in your face and there was frankly possible wayyou shouldnt be so selfcriticalthere is possible way it could have been prevented svengali charcot the best mind readers of all time inhabiting his bank with him could not have foretold that when you zigged he would zag dont you see the important thing is that zig occurred when zag should have occurred thats important why it occurred is of secondary importance but it did occur now you can go ahead and say well why did it occur and so forth and promise never to do it again and throw half crowns out here in the wishing well in penance and make the instructors do infraction sheets but anyhow the thing about it is that it did occur that is primary not why it occurred that is not even secondary that is tertiary or something i have to learn what some of those upper figures are i wonder what fiftieth is fiftyertiary i guess see what i mean you see sessiona session is something if weve got piece of cake and its sitting on the table and somebody comes along and picks up the cake and throws it on the floor only damn fool stands around and asks why he threw the cake on the floor but people i will assure you always do ask that the only importantreally important element present is that cake has been thrown on the floor which you were about to get piece of and yet youll inevitably stand around and ask why did he do it and so forth thats completely unimportant theres cake its on the floor see thats important first things first now session is an irreplaceable section in time it will never happen again there will never be an opportunity for it to occur again there will be more sessions but there will never be that session see that session is itself so we look straight at it and look straight in the teeth of this thing and we see that what happened in the session is of primary importance first did you get ta action second was the pcs ability to itsa and confront improved third was his bank straightened out now those are the important things in session that you cut the pcs itsa has nothing to do with it whatsoever if at the same time you got ta action you actually did eventually improve the pcs ability to itsa and you got his bank straightened up you understand those are the important things it doesnt matter what expression you have on your face so long as that expression does not impede getting something done see thats all thats important it does not matter whether you appear in session in boiler suit or pinstriped morning trousers or an afternoon cocktail dress it just doesnt matter how you appear in the session so long as when you appear in the session is your dress impeding or pushing forward the session now you can wear glaringly yellow sweater or dazzle rhinestone studded sweater and cut the session to ribbons so therefore your dress influenced the session because it ruddy well blinded the preclear the boiler suit being stained with diesel oil and quite odiferous impeded the sessions progress so if you adjudicate everything from whatwhat happened in the session what is happening in the session and whether or not the session did get tone arm action whether or not it improved the pcs ability to itsa confront his reality on his bank and whether or not it straightened out the bank anyif you adjudicate those things youve got it made and you go around holding your head in your hands and saying well lets see did i give the auditing command in the proper tone of voice it frankly doesnt matter damn whether you gave it in any tone of voice by telepathy or by shortwave radio all that matters is was youdid you produce these results in the session now what you call basic auditing training is simply the mean refinement the average actionbest calculated to produce result in the session with minimal impedance of the session gains there is completely proper auditing action except as measured against these elements now if you understand auditing from that particular viewpoint when you walk outside after this lecture you can lift up flap of your skull and skid out the 568000 data which youve got there now completely impeding your ability to sit there and get the job done see because in the final run is did you do your job as an auditor and if you did your job as an auditor that irreplaceable terribly precious session was very far from being in vain it promoted the thing and went on forward and you continued to do your job adding up one of these sessions to the next session to the next session at the far end of it somewhere up along the line youve got yourself completely rehabilitated being and that can mean great deal so all of your rightnesses and wrongnesses with regard to your actions particularly see are just waste of breath your selfcriticism hasis badly spent its whether or not you produced result if youre doing things in session which impede gains in session well theyre probably wrong but who cares lets do the things that get results in session not the things that dont and if we never get results in session by reason of never doing anything in session well decide to be brave and do something in session and that isabout there is where all analysis ends it doesnt go really much further than that well i thought i could give you these three sections and subdivisions of auditing and you could see them clearly each one in their own light and it might make it much easier for you to view what is going on and carry forward session to better and happier conclusion thank you
