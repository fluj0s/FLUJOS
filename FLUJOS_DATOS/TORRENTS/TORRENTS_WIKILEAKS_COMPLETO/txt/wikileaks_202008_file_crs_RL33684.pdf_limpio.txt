policy and critical point of contention in us relations with china which claims sovereignty over taiwan the us policy framework for taiwan was laid down in 1979 when washington severed official relations with the republic of china roc on taiwan and instead recognized the peoples republic of china prc as the legitimate chinese government the basics of that policy shiftthe taiwan relations act the 3 uschina communiques and the socalled six assurances toward taiwanremain in place today but many other factors have changed dramatically the prc itself is rising global economic power scarcely resembling the country it was at the nixon opening in the 1970s us economic and political relations with the prc have expanded and become more diverse playing more complex role now than they did then in us calculations of its own interests chinas military has grown as well with much of its strategic planning focusing on taiwan contingency that may lead to conflict with us military forces taiwan once an authoritarian oneparty government under martial law has become fully functioning democracy in taiwans 2000 presidential election chen shuibians upset of the long dominant ruling party in true democratic contest was resounding validation of us ideals and hopes for global democratic development but other aspects of the new governments pro independence views conflict with us policies that support the status quo in the taiwan strait and are unwilling to support taiwan independence taiwanus relations in recent years also have been plagued by other factors including mistrust between the bush and chen administrations mixed bilateral messages decline in the extent to which taiwan is willing to fulfill us expectations about its own selfd efense the fragmentation of the oncepowerful taiwan lobby in the united states perceived declining role for congress and the sheer volatility in taiwans domestic political environment these changes are posing challenges to us policy some observers suggest that as the prc and taiwan have evolved the original us policy fra mework has grown increasingly irrelevant they argue it needs to be reassessed or scrapped others hold that the very constancy of the us policy framework is crucial in managing us relations with both governments they argue it needs to be maintained bracketed by these two options is quiet flow of alternative policy suggestions these tend to advocate various substantive changes in daytoday us relations with taiwan and china that appear defensible within the existing us policy framework these alternative views include more transparent us policy and more open interactions with senior taiwan leaders greater us support for taiwans participation in international organizations more active us role in crossstrait relations more pressure on th prc to talk to the elected taiwan government withdraw its missiles opposite taiwan and renounc the use of force and more overt support for taiwan democratic institutions

political and security interests that is greater than might be expected given its lack of official relations with the united states the political and international status of taiwan has remained key issue for us foreign policy and critical point of contention in uschina relations in important respects what happens in taiwan and between taiwan and the prc has direct impact on us policy decisions and on us security interests the fundamental framework of us policy toward taiwan was laid down decades ago beginning with the nixon opening to the communist peoples republic of china prc in 1971 that resulted in the severing of official relations with the republic of china taiwan in 1979 us policy toward taiwan since then has been defined by four primary documents the taiwan relations act pl 968 enacted in 1979 and three us communiques with the prc the shanghai communique 1972 the communique on normaliza tion of relations with the prc 1979 and the august 17 communique on arms sales to taiw an 1982 in addition us policy has been shaped during these decades by combination of other factors among these are set of six policy assurances the united states gave taiwan in the 1980s the precedents set by collection of sensitive guidelines on taiwan that the executive branch has adopted to define and constrain its actions variety of statements by successive us administrations about the nature of us policy toward taiwan and the prc and periodic initiatives by members of congress intended to affect us policy in some way but while this fundamental framework remains the basis of us policy today many other aspects of the relationships have changed dramatically us economic and political relations with the prc have grown more sophisticated and more strategically complex the prc itself is rising global economic power that scarcely resembles the country it was at the nixon opening in the 1970s taiwan once an authoritarian government under martial law and oneparty rule has become fully functioning democracy with political pluralism the dramatic evolutions in china and taiwan are posing challenges to the longstanding precepts that still serve as the bedrock of us policy toward both governments many hold that the very constancy of the us policy framework itself is crucial in managing the increasingly complex us relations with both governments they argue it needs to be maintained others have suggested that as the prc and taiwan have evolved the original us policy framework has stultified and grown increasingly irrelevant they argue it needs to be reassessed this report will examine us policy toward taiwan within the context of the challenges now confronting it 1 the resources used in this analysis include news media reports within taiwan the united states and the prc

experts at washington think tanks and in academia2 the taiwan issue in us policy is extraordinar ily complex and nuanced and the analysis in this report may not portray the entire range of views variables or options that exist about taiwan and its relations with the united states nevertheless this report does convey important findings of direct relevance to us policy interests and to congressional concerns g18g152g156g156g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g152g143g561g5g155g152g156g156g556g21g157g155g138g146g157g561g5g152g151g143g155g152g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 although the prc frequently states that its intent ions are to assure peaceful resolution to the ultimate status of taiwan chinese leaders have not foresworn the possibility of using force to unify taiwan with mainland china3 to drive home this point the prc on march 14 2005 adopted an antisecession law to bolster its assertion with statutory authority moreover prc anxieties over taiwans status increase whenever either the taiwan or us government takes an action that beijing feels impinges on its sovereignty claims over taiwan this dynamic combined with chinas threat to use force against taiw an the growing economic and strategic importance of the uschina relationship and continuing us security interests in taiwan under the 1979 taiwan relations act tra make crossstrait conflict between taiwan and the prc dangerous possibility for us and global interests 4 while the tra does not mandate the us defense of taiwan it does specify that an attack on taiwan would be of grave concern to the united states and it provides for continuing us arms sales to taiwan for its own defense in addition japans growing security concerns have prompted it to join the united states in outlining more comprehensive vision of the usjapan alliance that for the first time includes peace in the taiwan strait as common strategic objective5 this suggests that potential conflict in the taiwan strait could expand to include not only the united states but other regional powers two further uncertainties are now complicating us policy on the crossstrait stability issue the matter of where provocation to crossstrait hostility may come from and questions about taiwans commitment to its own selfdefense in terms of the former the traditional focusone that is implied in the provisions of the taiwan relations act and in department of defense reports on crossstrait stabilityis on hostile prc intent that culminates in unanticipated and unprovoked prc military operations against taiwan under this scenario many observers 2 discussions for this report included meetings in taiw an with members of the legislative yuan with senior government officials at the highest levels and with us offi cials at the american institute in taiwan ait in taipei meetings and other input from sources in the united states included jeff bader richard bush nat bellocchi coen blaauw michael fonte bonnie glaser mike

but in recent years bush administration officials increasingly have been will ing to shift part of the burden for maintaining crossstrait stability to taiwan warning both the prc and the taiwan governments against taking unilateral provocative acts this shift has led some to question potential us military involvement in crossstrait crisis that is perceived to be caused by taiwans own political actions6 the second uncertaintytaiwans commitment to its own defensearises from taiwans extensive delay in passing defense budget to accommodate purchasing the weapons systems president bush authorized in his approval of substantial arms sales in april 2001 after six years of rancorous debate the taiwan legislature on june 15 2007 approved only fraction about 300 million of the funds toward the 18 billion in defense weapons the united states offered for sale in 2001 many us observers have come to see taiwans passage of enhanced defense spending measures as litmus tests to prove its commitment to selfdefense some us officials have expressed disappointment that the us desire to help taiwan defend itself appears to be outstripping taiwans own 7 in addition us military experts have grown more concerned about the prospect of conflict scenarios in the ta iwan strait that unfold faster than the united states ability to respondscenarios that place further importance on the preparedness of taiwans own military forces8 many taiwan observers on the other hand stress that defense spending measures have become caught up in taiwans internal politics held hostage to political infighting between the ruling and opposition party coalitions some in taiwan question the appropriateness and costbenefits of the us weapons systems offered and appear to view positive action on the proffered package not as national security matter but as political necessity to ensure good relations with the united states 9

cite more strategic policy reasons for the united states to support taiwans importance and viability as distinct political and democratic entity failure of the taiwan polity or the effective absorption of taiwan by the giant prc economy would mean the loss of us military contacts with taiwan it might also lead to loss of the leverage the united states now enjoys with the prc because of the taiwan issue and would complicate the us hedging strategy with beijing10 6 such speculation for instance has been voiced in senate armed services committee hearings march 7 2006 house international relations committee hirc asia subcomm ittee hearings march 8 2006 and hirc hearings on may 10 2006 7 perhaps because america has moved with speed to meet the new prc military challenge

for the united states of taiwan as an asian model for democratic development particularly as model for future prc governance for this reason alone they say the taiwan democratic state cannot be allowed to fail nor can the united states afford to allow the prc to denigrate taiwans democratic government by defining its political processes as mere populism in this view taiwans failure to thrive as democratic entity would undermine us credibility about its commitment to democratic principles 11 taiwan officials themselves profess bewilderment that the united states does not more assertively defend taiwan democracy given the emphasis of and the resources committed by the bush administration to other global democratization efforts on july 27 2007 for instance dpp chairman yu shyikun appeared to question us qualifications to be democratic role model for taiwan should the us oppose taiwans referendum12

effectively the united states ndles the taiwan issue with the prc could have important consequences for continued us leadership in asia and possibly around the world the us commitment to democracy its history of rela tions with and support for taiwan and taiwans importance as us defense and intelligence partner13 according to some significantly raise the stakes of us policy failure if us officials are seen as unable to manage the crossstrait issue in way that avoids coercive prc approach to taiwan then us regional leadership might be questioned and support for it undermined likewise if the united states is seen to be accommodating to prc interests in absorbing democratic taiwan us friends and allies in asia could view the united states as weaker power and less reliable than in the past asian democracies and smaller asian nations could decide that the united states is not likely to be there for them in the event of hostile action from china they and american asian allies may be inclined to recalculate their own political and economic alignments in such way that would give more weight to prc concerns creating geopolitical realignment in the western pacific 14 for instance prc absorption of taiwan might well spur japans military rearmamentpossibly including the consideration of building nuclear weaponsand possibly raise other questions in japan about the reliability of the us defense shield taiwans absorption into the prc also would expand the prcs navalair projection into the western pacific and into potentially key sealanes important to japan 11 coen blaauw formosan

regarding taiwan described earlier in this report were in place by 1982 adopted during time when taiwan was still under martial law and the taiwan government remained oneparty system that permitted political opposition and held democratic elections but taiwans situation began to change in the late 1980s when the government ended martial law and legalized opposition political parties in 1996 taiwan held its first direct presidential election contest won by lee tenghui native taiwanese and the leader of the long dominant nationalist or kuomintang kmt party but the real change in taiwan politics occurred in 2000 when hotly contested threeway presidential race ended in the election of chen shuibian member of ne w opposition party the democratic progressive party dpp president chen was reelected to second fouryear term in 2004 making his two term tenure roughly parallel with that of us president george w bush the dpps electoral success in taiwan has presented the bush administration with some unique challenges president chens stunning upset of the long dominant kmt in true democratic contest is viewed by many as resounding validation of the us administrations ideals and hopes for democratic development in asia and elsewhere around the world on the other hand as the dpp is party that supports taiwans independence from the prc key aspects of its political platform conflict with longstanding us pol icy statements in the three usprc communiques and elsewherepolicy statements that oppose unilateral changes in the status quo in the taiwan strait that appear unwilling to support taiwan independence aspirations and that base the us onechina policy on the acknowledgment of chinese claims that there is only one china and that taiwan is part of it 15 as such the positions and actions of the dpp at times have complicated us policy toward both taiwan and the prc along with these changes in taiwan have been equally important changes in the prc that have further complicated us policy while in 1979 the chinese military had little capacity to threaten or attack taiwan its military modernization since then has given it range of new coercive options any of which might lead to military confrontation between us and prc forces the prcs growing global role and increased importance for us interests suggest to many americans that the us future will be tied to the prc economy for good or ill and affected deeply by prc economic political and strategic interests this also represents significant difference from the dynamics of usprc relations at the outset of their official relationship in 1979 but while taiwan has democratized and embraced political pluralism and open discourse the prc has remained an authoritarian oneparty state unwilling to brook criticism or permit political opposition the developments on both sides of the taiwan strait have contributed to complications for us policy

in the bush administration what they view as president chen shuibians unpredictable political style reportedly has become problematic for ustaiwan relations and for the white houses view of the taiwan government this represents change from the early months of the chen administration in 2000 when initial us concern over the new governments independence aspirations was eased by president chens moderate tone his apparent openness to engagement with the prc and his embrace of the five noes to encompass taiwans policy toward the prc 16 these early steps by the chen government were appreciated by the clinton white house the next us administration of george w bush took an initial approach toward taiwan that was more favorable than that of any us administration since 1979 in april 2001 president bush was quoted saying the united states would do whatever it took to help defend taiwan and the same month the president approved substantial us arms sales package for taiwan 17 the favorable us treatment continued in may 2001 when the white house approved transit stops for president chen during which he visited both new york previously offlimits and houston attended public functions and meetings and met with nearly two dozen members of congress similar us visits were approved fo r taiwans vicepresident annette lu in early january 2002 and for taiwans defense minister tang yaoming march 2002 who attended defense conference in florida and while there met with us deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz and us assistant secretary of state james kelly in octobernovember 2003 the bush administration accommodated president chen with an even higherprofile transit visit to new york citya visit that received wide press coverage in taiwan

administration relations began to melt away in august 2002 when president chen gave video conference in which he stated that there was one country on either side of the taiwan straitor yi bian yi guo

only the first in continuing series of taiwan statements and decisions issued unexpectedly and without apparent regard for us interests20 the surprises included the announcement on september 28 2003 that taiwan planned to hold referendum on new constitution 2004 new years day speech in which president chen defined the territory of the roc as encompassing only 36000 square kilometers and including only its 23 million residents 21 the holding of an islandwide referendum in march 2004 on aspects of taiwans defensive strategy against the prc 2005 new years day speech in which president chen toughened the taiwan position on crossstrait contacts the january 2006 decision and its subsequent implementation that the symbolically important national unification council nuc would be abolished or would cease to function and the june 18 2007 announcement and its subsequent implementation on july 19 2007 that taiwan would apply to join the united nations as full member under the name taiwan according to several former us government of ficials the chen administrations relationship with the bush white house was fatally hurt by chens yi bian yi guo statement and his subsequent statements and actions 22 as consequence according to some observers the white house began dialing back its earlier receptiveness to the chen administrations proposalsa process that has continued23 both the nuc cessation issue and the referendum and application case acted to increase us official concern in the case of the nuc decision us officials had worked to persuade chen to scrap or modify his proposal24

of being abolishedwas regarded as president chens compromise with us concern about the decisions crossstrait implications but when press accounts quoted some taiwan officials as saying there was difference between the nuc being abolished and its ceasing to function the state department issued rare written statement march 2 2006 saying it expected taiwan authorities to unambiguously and publicly clarify that the nuc had not been abolished but that it continued to exist the state department written statement also reiterated that the united states expected president chen to reaffirm

at this juncture also were plagued by what many in the chen administration saw as confusing and mixed us messages to taiwan that included bot h words of caution and expressions of support the prime example of the latter is the nowfamous public comment in 2003 that george bush was president chen shuibians secret guardian angela comment made by therese shaheen who as chair of the washington office of the american institute in taiwan ait was then americas highestranking representative on taiwan28 president chen and many others in taiwan reportedly interpreted this statement as an expression of

in print at the time to the region in early december 2003 by james moriarty then the senior director of asian affairs at the national security council30 moriarty reportedly visited both taiwan and the prc at the height of controversial debate over president chens proposal to initiate an islandwide referendum to gauge public opinion in taiwan according to former us officials moriarty delivered message from president bush to president chen warning taiwan in uncertain terms 31 against holding referendum that could provoke the prc and expressing us opposition to any unilateral effort to change the status quo32 according to some president chen interpreted the message moriarty delivered explicitly to mean that only referendum that touched on taiwans so vereignty or other provocative issues would be of grave concern to the united states referenda on other nonprovocative subjects according to chens reported interpretation would be acceptable after the moriarty mission on march 20 2004 the taiwan government held referendum on what it said was nonprovocative topic whether taiwan should acquire more advanced weapons to defend against prc missiles and whether the taiwan government should engage in negotiations with the prc concerning peace and stability framework for crossstrait interactions 33 number of observers tend to agree that us policy toward taiwan was not as well served in 20022003 as it might have been by the series of mixed or ambiguous us messages some also say that taiwan shares the blame during this period for emphasizing the more favorable parts of the us message and downplaying the less favorable parts 34 still after the yi bian yi guo statement many of the public messages that us officials were conveying to taiwan turned decidedly cautionary change in tone that taiwan officials apparently either missed or chose to ignore days after the reported moriarty trip standing next to visiting prc premier wen jiabao in washington on december 9 2003 president bush used unusually blunt public language to criticize chen shuibian saying the comment s and actions made by the leader of taiwan indicate he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally that change the status quo which we oppose 35 after president chens reelection in march 2004 the tough us statements continued with comments in april 2004 by vice president dick cheney who while visiting the prc stated we oppose unilateral efforts on either side to try to alter the current set of circumstances36 also in 30 among other sources references to the trip can be found in dinmore guy and hille

there are varying accounts of the failure of the moriarty trip to dissuade president chen from holding the referendum one press account refers to an unusually blunt letter that moriarty handdelivered to chen from president bush that sent an unmistakable message warning against referendum suggesting that chen chose to ignore the white house missive others hold that moriartys verbal message to chen

response if such thing were done by china that could destroy much of what taiwan has built and it would damage china too of course we in the united states see these risks clearly and trust they are well understood by president chen shuibian and others in taiwan 37 by most accounts in recent years the mixed signals have stopped and bush administration officials have regained control and

circumstances they are concerned that taiwan now has an image problem in the united states some taiwan government officials are more directly critical of the united states describing us officials as being unappreciative of the heavy domestic pressures on president chen that help form his actions they suggested us officials are being too careless of taiwans democracy and either overly solicitous of the prc or afraid of beijing according to one taiwan official it is difficult to understand why taiwan as democracy does not seem to be higher priority for the united states when democratization is chief preoccupation of the george w bush administration according to another people in taiwan wonder why when china pressures other countries to accept the one china principle the united states does not criticize china for defining taiwan as an inalienable part of chinese territory this theme of problems in ustaiwan communication has been frequently repeated in recent years in discussions with taiwan officials41 taiwans new representative to the united states in 2007 joseph wu formerly head of taiwans mainland affairs council stressed this point to journalists prior to his departure for washington saying that many in taiwan felt taiwan had not been treated fairly by the united states and vowing to try to change this42 dpp candidate for president frank hsieh during his july 2007 visit

different picture with respect to ustaiwan communications they maintain that taiwans assertions that the united states does not communicate regularly and clearly are disingenuous at best us officials see themselves as communicating with taiwan constantly at every level of government but the very highesta view seconded also by some us experts not affi liated with the us government according to us state department official us communication with taiwan including the us militaryto military dialogue with taiwan compares favorably withand in some cases is better thanus diplomatic and military

taiwan and us governments have fundamentally different interpretations of what the status quo is making mutual reassurances on the subject of questionable significance us official statements are interpreted as maintaining that the status quo means taiwans political status remains unresolved pending solution mutually reached by taiwan and the prc that the prc will not use force against taiwan that the united states will continue arms sales and military contacts with taiwan and that neither the prc nor taiwan will make unilateral changes that could destabilize the situation in the taiwan strait when us officials warn taiwan against changing the status quo it is this set of factors to which they are referring but to the chen administration in taiwan the status quo is that taiwan is already an independent sovereign state the chen governments assurances that it is indeed adhering to the status quo are based on an assumption that the issue of taiwans political status is already

self60 the taiwan lobby refers to the network of interests dominated by the kmt and including influential members of the taiwanese and chineseamerican communities that maintained sophisticated and unified lobbying effort in the united states on behalf of taiwan government concerns ironically the fragmentation of the taiwan lobby can be traced to the development of full democracy and political pluralism in taiwan which began the erosion of the organized unified kmt machine that once acted on behalf of taiwans interests in the united states as consequence of political pluralization there is longer single coordinated taiwan point of view presented to us officials and members of congress now there are multiple taiwan messages from variety of messengersoften seeking to denigrate the requests or messages from the other sources according to some congressional observers the lack of unified taiwan message and the carrying on of taiwans domestic political infighting in the

office or tecro which oversees 12 other branch offices in 11 us cities and in guam61 but according to those interviewed the 2000 taiwan presidential election significantly altered tecros status as

allegiances primarily to the former kmt ruling party63 therefore some informed observers have felt that the chen administration did not trust tecro either to be faithful communicator of the governments message in the united states or to present an accurate picture of us views to chen administration officials in move apparently designed to address these issues the chen government in march 2007 appointed joseph wu former head of taiwans mainland affairs council and close associate of president chen as the first dppaffiliated representative ever to head the us tecro office64 according to ddptsu coalition official taipei expects that mr wu will be able to interpret president chens messages to washington more precisely than his predecessorsa circumstance that they claim will reduce misunderstandings and problems between taiwan and the united states but others point to more complex factors determining what is seen to be tecros reduced influence factors greatly influenced by taiwans own internal political circumstances and by deepseated us government concerns about those taiwan policy decisions that are judged to be more provocative according to this view it is th message itself and not how it is delivered that is the issue for us officials in addition as result of changing circumstances tecro once taiwans sole official interlocutor in the united states by 2007 is seen by some as just one datapoint in set that includes the dpps and km ts own party representatives in washington analysts from select american thinktanks and academic institutions proindependenceminded groups like the formosa association for public af fairs fapa those favoring closer and more congenial taiwanprc relations officials from ait and the us government and members of congress 65 given

according to some observers us pronouncements on taiwan routinely run the gamut from dry state department press releases to nothing at all 72 some members of congress have criticized this secretive us

official relations with taiwan in 1979 through the 1990s and into the 21 st century various members of the us congress have championed taiwans democracy economy and international status as important

less pressure from congress on executive branch decisions concerning taiwan85 congressional staff following taiwan issues have commented on the dropoff of congressional hearings on the subject and the mild congressional response particularly in the senate to the us decision in may 2006 to restrict president chens transit stop to alaska rather than allow stops in new york and san francisco as he requested86 some observers point out that the two fta bills in the 109th congress were not acted on by the committees they were referred to in either house and were senseofcongress resolutions rather than bills mandating actio n in addition member and congressional staff delegation visits codels and staffdels to taiwanonce mainstay of taiwancongressional relationshave been described as being down while visits to the peoples republic china are up87 taiwan officials maintain they have trouble securing such visits to taiwan now although they attribute the decline in part to more rigorous us ethics rules on congressional travel there is shortage of possible explanations for this reduced congressional role on taiwan one principal explanation is the continued failure of taiwan to act on defense spending measures that would allow it to purchase us weapons made available for sale in 2001 over the years congress has been particularly active in pressuring us officials to offer greater military support and more advanced weapons sales to support taiwans selfdefense88 many members then strongly approved of the bush administrations 2001 decision to approve large weapons package for taiwan but taiwans failure to act on this offer has effectively removed the arms sales issue as regular vehicle for congressional leverage with executive branch officials on taiwan matters concern over the delay reportedly led members to write letter in 2005 to lien chan then the chairman of the kmt urging his party to stop blocking the defense budget in the legislature 89 undoubtedly reduced congressional attention also can be explained by the rising importance of china for us interests from bilateral trade issues to cooperative international health and environmental initiatives to us efforts to secure prc support on north korea and iran the range of the prcs conversation and interaction with the united states has expanded greatly from what it was in 1979 in comparison the ustaiwan

explanations for declining congressional interest may include the disappearance in 2000 of the annual congressional debate over extending to china mostfavorednation status mfn now permanent normal trade relations or pntr which occasionally served as vehicle for expressions of congressional interest in taiwan another factor is the 2004 enactment of pl 108235 which made it permanent annual requirement for the us gove rnment to support taiwans application for observer status to the world health organization90 until this members had raised the issue each year with oneyear support requirements resulting in annual congressional attention and regular pressure on us government officials the fragmentation of the taiwan message that has come with changes in the taiwan lobby offers another possible explanation finally some support in congress may have weakened due to president chens provocative statements and actions that are seen as dismissive of us interests and over the

its involvement on crossstrait matters in the past primarily because both taiwan and the prc insisted that it do so prc officials routinely warned us officials that the issue of taiwan was strictly an internal affair of china and that us involvement was entirely unwelcome taiwan officials feared that the united states would pressure taiwan to make concessions to china in response us officials in 1982 provided the socalled six assurances to taiwan promising among other things that the united states would not mediate between taiwan and china or pressure taiwan to enter into negotiations with china 92 but some aspects of this taiwanprc dynamic appear to be changing according to us officials both governments in recent years have changed the way they talk to washington about taiwan us officials now are under subtle and perhaps increasing pressure from both governments to become directly involved in some aspects of crossstrait issues 90 pl 108235 refers only to annual us support for taiwans observer status in who on april 12 2007 taiwans foreign minister james huang announced taiwan also would apply in 2007 to join who as full member under the name taiwan pl 108235 does not appear to require us support for such an application 91 examples of some publicly expressed congressional concerns the us under both democratic and republican administrations has done its part to

part members of the taiwan government have begun suggesting that the taiwan relations act needs to be strengthened or reevaluated they have sought us support for chens constitutional reform plans and more visible and routine ustaiwan official interaction as result some observers in both taiwan and the united states suggest that the time may be ripe for the united states to step up its rhetoric and activities to promote crossstrait dialogue nevertheless this receptivity to us involvement has significant limitationsthe chief of which is that each side wants us involvement only on behalf of its own interests taiwan urges the united states to press the prc to renounce the use of force and to agree to preconditions for crossstrait talks the prc urges the united states to oppose taiwan independence and to be more forceful in opposing unilateral changes in the status quo according to many us involvement in such onesided way could help foster rather than ease crossstrait tensions former us officials report that the united states is willing to help in crossstrait dialogue if both sides can reach consensus on the kind of us help they can accept 95

volatility in taiwans own democratic institutions and political environment constitutes another factor influencing us vi ews of taiwan and ustaiwan relations under taiwans former authoritarian oneparty rule its political decisions were predictable closely aligned with us interests and dependent largely on us support but several decades of reforms have made taiwans political environment today both more democratic and less predictable characterized by immense political divisions on ideology and substance some of this political volatility has been attributed to the natural growing pains of taiwans new democracy according to one former us government official taiwan politicians need to develop better appreciation for and experience with democratic institutions in order to move beyond the point where the chief political strategy is pouting in perpetuity at your opponent 96 others argued there are more systemic problems characterizing taiwans evolving democratic institutionsin particular to structural weaknesses that dilute authority and do not sufficiently empower either legislative or executive entities 93 some critics of us policy suggest that the prcs

long as that comes without political preconditions such as defining crossstrait trade as domestic trade according to some taiwan government officials and us observers the dpp has problem integrating its various factions and thus president chen has been faced with particularly difficult challenge in defining vision that appeals to the whole party coalition as result the chen administration has been said to be tacking back and forth according to the prevailing political winds in the coalitiona tactic described by some as not particularly suited for achieving unity and efficiency in office one selfcriticism of some dpp members wa s that the party coalition although now the governing party still has an opposition party mentalitya quality that excites the partys traditional base but doesnt necessarily result in efficient governance according to these observers this tendency has been partly to blame for the partys low rating in opinion polls internal party corruption also was blamed for low dpp numbers although corruption was portrayed more broadly as an endemic problem permeating political life at all levels

appears centered on criticizing dpp shortcomings and offering different approach to crossstrait relations including fewer economic restrictions on taiwan businesses and less offensivebased defense strategy while kmt officials describe the dpp as picking fights at home and aggravating the prc they describe the kmts own defense strategy as putting priority on establishing contacts with beijing and giving the prc reason to attack taiwan former kmt chairman ma yingjeou in particular has suggested that kmtpfp government would be willing to resume discussions with the prc under the 1992 consensus formula reached by the two sides that ostensibly permits differing interpretations of one china one criticism observers raised about the kmtpfp coalition is that combination of the dpps low opinion poll ratings and the ma yingjeou phenomenon referring to the widespread popularity of the former kmt chairman has made the coalition arrogant as if the 2008 presidential election will be an anointment in another criticism the kmtpfp coalition is portrayed as disingenuously having withheld fina ncial political and diplomatic expertise from the ruling dpp then accusing that party of being unable to govern effectively like the dpp the kmtpfp coalition appears plagued by internal disagreements particularly on matters involving the appropriate action on the defense budget on which the dpp is portrayed as being entirely in favor the pfp entirely against and the kmt somewhere in the middle other observers stress that generational conflicts plague the kmt coalition longtime party heavy weights in the coalitionsuch as lien chan and james soongare said to be reluctant to relinquish the reigns of party power to younger generation of party leaders the latter includes ma yingjeou with reputation for integrity but who now stands accused of having misused 98 while official taiwan statistics hold that taiwan has 50 billion invested in the mainland unofficial accounts pl ace this

view of some observers is that the united states has greatly underestimated the importance of the seachange in kmt thinking brought about by the prc visits of kmt chairman lien chan and pfp chairman james soong in 2005 99 those visits according to this view have given prochina interests in the kmtpfp coalition new alternate vision for taiwans future one of the consequences of this new kmtpfp vision according to this view is the growing inuremen t of the panblue coalition to us pressurein particular to us pressure to increase military spending or take legislative action on the defense budgeton the grounds that such expenditures are too high too confrontational and likely unnecessary in light of potential improvements in crossstrait interactions this perception has caused few american observers to speculate on the degree of the panblue coalitions future support for security relationship with the united states 100 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 the complex and dramatic changes in both taiwan and china have resulted in periodic speculation about whether the current us policy framework for relations with taiwan remains appropriate or whether the us government should reexamine its policies and perhaps revise them given developments in us relations with taiwan since 2001 policymakers who are concerned about current trends and the us ability to meet future challenges may consider number of various options for us policy

the official us policy view is that the onechina policy and the fundamental framework surrounding it is an important constancy in an otherwise dangerously fluid and evolving us taiwanprc relationship any alteration or apparent flexibility in that policy would lead to disintegrating policy damaging to us interests 101 in addition according to this view the current policy framework helps protect the united states and us policies from becoming greater factors in the domestic taiwan and prc policy environments the slightest deviation from us policy formulations and actionsan offthecuff comment the use of different wording beyond that already approved visit by more senior us officialcan be and has in the past been seized upon by actors from either side to further domestic political agendas inevitably creating nettlesome diplomatic problems for us policy moreover these proponents say those who advocate scrapping the onechina policy and other aspects of the us policy framework are recklessly discounting prc resolve on unifying taiwan with the mainland and irresponsibly advocating actions that well could lead to the use of us military forces in usprc conflict 99 this was view offered by one us ait official in taiwan 100 this view is also shared by john tkacik at the heritage foundation 101 interview with former us government official june 22 2006

greatest emphasis on the political aspirations and democratic rights to selfdetermination of the people on taiwan the current us policy framework on taiwan is completely out of step with the american emphasis on global democratization according to proponents of this view they hold that as the prc and taiwan have evolved the original us policy framework on taiwan has stultified and grown increasingly irrelevant the onechina policy itself they argue originally was based on the us acknowledgment that both taiwan and the prc held there was only one china and that taiwan was part of it102 they contend that this us policy has become untenable it longer reflects the reality in taiwan and it is based on faulty premise that perpetuates moreorless continual deferral of resolution to taiwans political status therefore they say the onechina policy needs to be abandoned and replaced with onechina onetaiwan policy in which the united states would work toward gradual normalization of relations with taiwan some who advocate this viewpoint believe that the costs of such policy change for the united states would be minimal they believe that prc actions and statements on taiwan are just saberrattling and they doubt that the prc will attack taiwan should taipei declare independence 103 even if the prc should attack taiwan these proponents appear confident that for political and strategic reasons the united states would come to taiwans aid104 to do nothing they say would seriously damage us credibility and influence in asia

comprehensive review of its taiwan policy in order to revis it once again the 19791980 taiwan guidelines that govern us government interactions with taiwan and with taiwan officials reportedly only one such review to update the guidelines has been conducted since 1979the 19931994 taiwan policy review undertaken in the clinton administrationand that review resulted in new approval for exchanges of highlevel official visits in the economic arena 105 but even the high 102 this was the formulation in the usprc shanghai communique of 1972 which held that the united states acknowledges that all

not been pursued with vigor by the current bush administration according to these proponents106 furthermore since the 199394 policy review there have been dramatic developments in taiwans democratization including the firsttime election of an opposition party candidate as president in 2000 in addition since 1995 the prc has undertaken substantial military buildup along the coast opposite taiwan and in 2005 beijing adopted the antisecession law suggesting hostile intent against taiwan these significant developments since 199394 according to this view justify another taiwan policy review to make selected changes in us policy they believe that the importance of taiwan for us interests and of peace and stability in the taiwan strait warrant such renewed policy attention limited changes they argue could result in more rational policy process and could improve communications among the policy changes that have been discussed are more transparent and open interactions with taiwan at the working level including visits between us and taiwan officials in official us government buildings and invitations to taiwan officials to attend special events such as swearingin ceremonies higher level us government visits and exchanges with taiwan counterparts greater coordination within the us governmentincluding regular inter departmental meetings involving the departments of commerce defense state and treasury among otherson policy and substantive issues involving taiwan more open and active support for taiwans participation in international organizations for which

suggesting alternative approaches there appears to be greater sentiment that more active us role in crossstrait matters is both justifiable within the current policy framework and warranted by changing sentiments within the prc and taiwan they maintain that us officials should urge the prc to enter into dialogue with chen shuibian as the democratically elected leader of taiwan they suggest that there is room for us involvement in trying to moderate re shape or suspend the contending positions of the two sides that remain the major obstacle to the initiation of dialogue for the prc this position is that taiwan first accept the one china principle or agree once again on the 1992 consensus formula for taiwan this position is an insistence on preconditions but stated willingness to discuss any subject continued the united states had changed its policy on taiwan in 19971998 the white house made statements that became known as the three noesthat the united states did not support one china one taiwan policy taiwan independence or taiwan membership in international organizations requiring statehood in 2000 the clinton administration made further incremental changes to us rhetoric by adding the us expectation that any resolution to the taiwan issue would not only be peaceful but decided with the assent of the taiwan people for these and other us policy statements see

to broker an interim agreement on th crossstrait issue that would defuse current tensions and cement in place the status quo for specified number of years such an agreement theoretically would require beijings promise th at it would not attack taiwan and taiwans promise that it would not declare independence s upporters of an interim framework argue that such deeprooted political obstacles exist betw een the current generation of leaders in each government that only future generations have hope of reaching fruitful and mutually acceptable resolution these proponents argue that the involved governments in beijing and taipei would have to determine what the specifics of an acceptable agreement might look like but it is only washington they argue that is in position to facilitate and garner support for such an agreement107 g15g152g155g142g561g18g155g142g156g156g158g155g142g561g152g151g561g157g145g142g561g18g20g5g561 another policy view is that the united states s become too responsive to prc sensitivities on taiwan and therefore unwilling to exert more pressure on the prc government to reduce its hostile military posture toward taiwan according to this view the us stakes in maintaining democratic taiwan along with the potential costs of nonpeaceful resolution to taiwans political status are too high for the us government to remain on the sidelines the united states should use more of its considerable leverage with beijing in an effort to being about more conciliatory behavior and promote crossstrait di alogue proponents suggest that us officials could seek reduction of the prc missile and military buildup opposite taiwan willingness to engage in dialogue with taiwans duly elected government and suspension of the prc dialogue exclusively with taiwans opposition political parties revisitation of the 2005 antisecession law which has increased pressure on the taiwan political debate

suggestions supports greater us support for and involvement in taiwans democratic institutions according to this view taiwan has already transformed itself by adopting democratic system of governance it is in the interests of all parties to have taiwans government be as effective and stable as possible but these proponents say that the very newness of taiwans democracy and the infrastructural weaknesses of its political institutions are hampering taiwan governance contributing to crossstrait tensions and posing problems for us policy proponents suggest that the us might pursue initiatives to improve the effectiveness of taiwans governance such as 107 ken lieberthal formerly senior director for asia on the staff of the national security council is chief proponent of the interim
