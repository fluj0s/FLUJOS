considerations in assisting constituents with grant requests before federal agencies jack maskell legislative attorney american law division summary there is inherent ethical problem with members office assisting constituents and constituent organizations with the procedures and applications for federal grants up to and including if the office deems it appropriate contacting federal agency to express interest in and support of the grant application in conducting such assistance three general areas of ethical considerations should be noted 1 in prioritizing grant assistance requests and deciding whether and at what level assistance is to be provided member offices should consider generally the overall public interest and the potential public benefits of the proposal or project one factor that should not be considered is whether or not the constituent or the organization has supported the member financially with campaign contributions and such linkage should be made either internally or overtly 2 if it is decided that proposal has particular merit or would be particularly beneficial to the community the office may contact an agency to express interest in the proposal and may even advocate for the grant proposal it should be remembered however that the administrative agency has the final decision on the matter and that the awarding of grants is generally competitive process in which the agency decision is to be made on the merits of the proposal and not on political considerations it is considered an abuse of members representational role to threaten agency officials or to make promises to the agency in an effort to gain administrative action 3 after official assistance is given to constituent or constituent group the member and the staff should not receive personally anything of value from the group or person as payment thank you or in appreciation of the official duties performed on their behalf ethical basis for constituent assistance

cir 1981which prohibits member of congress or his or her staff from becoming officially involved in private grant application or other request for assistance in matters before federal agency even to the extent of contacting discussing with and representing the interests of ones constituents before federal agency or department furthermore there are certain public policy arguments which have been advanced for members participation in certain matters bearing on the public interest which involve federal agencies and members constituents the house committee on standards of official conduct has noted in the past for example that an important aspect of congressmans representative function is to act as go between or conduit between his constituents and administrative agencies of the federal government1 the noted ethicist the late senator paul douglas of illinois explained the underlying ethical and practical principles as follows the truth is that legislation and administration should not be kept in airtight and separate compartments in order that each group may perform its own job adequately it should within limits interest itself in the work of the other there is then sound ethical basis for legislators to represent the interests of constituents and other citizens in their dealings with administrative officials and bodies besides the ethical justification there is practical necessity for it out of deep instincti ve wisdom the american people have never been willing to confide their individual or collective destinies to civil servants over whom they have little control they distrust and dislike selfperpetuating bureaucracy because they believe that ultimately it will not reflect the best interests of the people they therefore turn to their elected representatives to protect their legitimate interests in their relationship with the public administrators2 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia in sierra club v costle3 has noted that informal contacts in the form of inquiries and expressions of interest by members of congress to agencies on behalf of constituents which are focused and based on the appropriate factors which the agency should consider in an informal agency proceeding are expected and acceptable in our system of governm ent and that such pressures on agencies are merely among the considerations with which public agency must contend americans rightly expect their elected representatives to voice their grievances and preferences concerning the administration of our laws we believe it entirely proper for congressional representatives vigorously to represent the interests of their constituentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21117crs3 4 657 f2d at 409410 see also gulf oil corporation v fpc 563 f2d

agencies engaged in informal general policy rulemaking so long as individual congressmen do not frustrate the intent of congress as whole as expressed in statute nor undermine applicable rules of procedure4 while there are ethical or statutory prohibitions directly on congressional communications or intervention with federal agencies concerning matters of public interest on behalf of constituents there are ethical and other considerations that need to be recognized in carrying out such intervention evaluating and prioritizing assistance requests given the limited time and resources of members office and official staff requests to congressional office for assistance in grant applications and what resources time and effort to devote to such request should be evaluated on the merits of the proposal and project considering generally its impact and importance for the community district or state the house committee on standards of official conduct has issued an advisory opinion concerning congressional assistance and federal agency interventions and has emphasized that such activities should be based primarily on the concept of the overall public interest treating constituents equally and undertaking such actions irrespective of political or other considerations5 in the senate an express senate rule has been adopted concerning communications to agencies on behalf of constituents6 and pursuant to this rule the senate ethics committee similarly recommends that before contacting an agency an office consider the merits of the constituents case the practice in the senate office of providing the requested services for any constituent similarly situated or whether the requested assistance deviates from normal office practice7 the senate rule expressly states that decision to provide assistance may not be made on the basis of contributions or services or promises of contributions or services to the members political campaigns or to other organizations in which the member has political personal or financial interest8 members of congress are understood to represent all of their constituents even those who did not necessarily support the members election the converse of course is also true merely because one has been supporter and financial contributor to members campaign does not exclude such person from representation and does not mean that member or his or her staff should be precluded from assisting that individual or organization conduct in agency contacts if matter is considered to have particular merit or interest to the

the matter generally speaking unless the office is particularly familiar with the matter or with the individual or organization seeking the grant the office may wish in contact to the agency to simply express interest in the matter and request to be kept informed of the progress or outcome of the application process house and senate guidelines on contacting agencies note expressly that it is permissible to request information or status report urge prompt consideration or arrange for interviews or appointments with officials of federal agency if it is deemed warranted member through his or her office may however also express judgment on matter and may present arguments for particular position or outcome based on the law or the public interest in communicating with agencies and advocating position and outcome members and staff are advised to address only the merits of matter and specifically may not use the direct or implied suggestion of either favoritism or reprisal for action taken by the agency contacted9 furthermore members are advised to assure that representations made on their behalf are accurate and conform to the members instructions10 if any matter is in formal adjudicatory stage at an agency or is being litigated then the member and his or her office should be cognizant of the requirements concerning ex parte communications and may need to make communications in that context in more formal manner such as putting correspo ndences in writing available to both sides of controversy and on the public record11 compensation or rewards members and staff should be wary of receiving personally for their own use any gifts presents or anything of value from those whom they have assisted although small gifts and items are generally of little concern under house and senate rules which expressly allow for gifts of under 50 to be accepted by members and staff such things of value if accepted by congressional staff with the knowledge that they are being rewarded compensated or thanked for particular official act performed or to be performed may under close reading of the socalled illegal gratuities clause involve technical violation of that provision12 there is it should be noted express or specific miminis exception to the illegal gratuities provision of federal law however there appears generally to have developed an understanding that the acceptance of small tokens of appreciation for even official services when accepted by federal employees in accordance and conformance with federal agency rules or conduct regulations dealing with the acceptance of gifts would not be conduct that would be subject to criminal law enforcement13 in the house for example the house committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21117crs5 13 continued these regulations were drafted in consultation with the justice department executive order 12674 section 201 april 12 1989 as modified by eo 12731 14 house committee on standards of official conduct rules

personally that is for oneself and not things of value such as campaign contributions that are made to thirdparty entity like lawful campaign committee for use in political campaigns united states v

official conduct has noted that it would not consider it to be violation for an office to receive from constituent as thank you or in appreciation of official assistance perishable gifts of minimis value such as flowers or food which are placed out for the entire office staff and visitors or decorative items displayed in the office14 the making of campaign contributions by constitue nts or by other petitioners who have received assistance from congressional office in the past which are directed to campaign committee even those contributions which are expressly given because of members past help or support like those given because of members positionsor votes on legislation are permissible and anticipated in our system of privately financed campaigns and do not in themselves implicate the bribery or illegal gratuities provisions15 of course prior agreement arrangement or understanding to do any official act such as providing assistance on grants in return for the other party making campaign contributions ie quid pro quo or corrupt bargain should be made in light of the express prohibitions of the bribery statute16 finally it should be noted that congressional staff employee may not act in private nonofficial capacity for the constituent even during offduty time and receive any compensation for representing the constituent or constituent group before any federal agency17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21117crs6 appendix house committee on standards of official conduct advisory opinion number 1 excerpt representations this committee is of the opinion that member of
