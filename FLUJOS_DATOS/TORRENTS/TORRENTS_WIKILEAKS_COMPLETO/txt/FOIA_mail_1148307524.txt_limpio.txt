from martin manning mmanningalnoaagov to jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu caspar ammann ammannucaredu subject re wahl amman paper date mon 22 may 2006 101844 0600 cc bette ottobleisner ottoblincarucaredu eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno wahl eugene r wahlealfrededu tosbornueaacuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk dear peck et thanks for clearing this up the bottom line is that the version of this paper on the ucar site is fine unfortunately though the one we have on the ipcc wg1 web site is not i am attaching copy of that for clarity the metadata in this pdf file indicate that it was created by oyvind paasche from word document in early march when we were asking the chapter teams to provide copies of the unpublished literature it seems that oyvind worked from an earlier and significantly shorter version less text fewer tables and the figures are different as you can see in the attached although to repeat my earlier statement the conclusions of this earlier draft do not appear to to be substantially different based on what we now know the tsu should add the ncar version of the paper to our review web site and we will do that today thanks martin at 0758 am 5222006 jonathan overpeck wrote thanks all who have commented below is the likely final word unless martin needs more clarification seem ok martin sorry for the confusion guess some reviewers are running out of substantive issues so that might be sign that were getting close to the final draft best peck from caspar dear all yes the ucar version can be considered the official one i changed the order of pages because i needed to separate the primary content of the paper from its supplement thus i moved tables xs figure 1s and its caption to the end everything else is identical from keith the differences are as i understand insubstantial and not pertinent to the interpretation used in preparing the draft and gene wahl eugene r wrote hello peck martin bette eystein caspar i just double checked the ucar website version with the pdf version i have and they are identical with the exception that the supplemental tables tables 1s and 2s and supplemental figure caption and figure figure 1s are placed at the very end of the document in the ucar version the content is identical in both versions the text including tables and figure captions of the ucar pdf is also identical to the word text that i sent to peck keith briffa and eyestein jansen on february 24 there was version sent on february 21 which the february 24 version superceded there were 3 words changed on p 17 and some changes made to appendix 1 in the february 24 version perhaps this difference between the 221 and 224 versions is the cause of the differences that martin has seen note i would have sent the graphics separately with these versions and i did not keep copies of the sent files in my email account to deal with memory limits in the system here thus i cannot confirm exactly which graphic files are associated with the february 24 version my apologies in summary the ucar website pdf document should be considered the official one that is acceptedin press formal notification of acceptance from stephen schneider at climatic change came on february 28 the article is still in this status let know if i can help clarify things futher please note that i will be in boulder starting may 27 to be visiting scholar at ncar for month i will be keeping up with email from there peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental studies alfred university 6078712604 1 saxon drive alfred ny

re wahl amman paper hi martin well look into this asap ill cc to caspar and gene to see if they can clarify the situation and make sure we have the correct version ill also cc bette since she may see caspar around ncar and make sure he knows we are trying to clarify things with his paper more soon thx peck dear eystein and jonathan it has been pointed out to us by reviewer that the version of the wahl and amman paper accepted by climatic change on our review web site differs from the version that is available publicly from the ncar web site at 2httpwwwcgducareduccrammannmillenniumrefswahlammann_climaticchange_inpress pdf 3httpwwwcgducareduccrammannmillenniumrefswahlammann_climaticchange_inpress pdf although the differences are not in my view substantial the paper on the ncar web site is apparently dated feb 24th ie before the date of final submission of the sod it has additional figures and data and the running header says feb 24 in press could you please clarify which of the two versions of this paper would reflect most accurately the status of the paper as used by the chapter 6 team when preparing the sod that has been our basis for deciding on which version to include on our reviewer web pages up until now but we are now reconsidering whether to also include updated versions of unpublished papers as well if you have any thoughts on that please let know best regards martin recommended email address mmanningalnoaagov please note that problems may occur with my noaagov address dr martin r manning director ipcc wg i
