to seek relief when they believe they have been injured by the effects of trade trade remedies the primary means of such relief are designed to counter the economic effects on us producers of imports sold in the united states at unfairly low prices or of exports that benefit from foreign governments domestic or export subsidies they might also be sought to reduce the impacts of surges in

international trade rules notably those under the world trade organization wto multilateral agreements and the north american free trade agreement nafta1 on the one hand other countries utilizing various wto and nafta rules and procedures can and do challenge the legality of some us actions taken under its trade remedy laws on the other hand when such us laws are applied in conformity with the

act of 1974 provides for the imposition of temporary duties quotas or other restrictions on imports that are traded fairly but which cause or threaten to cause injury to domestic industry the us international trade commission itc makes the determination of injury this provision is intended to provide relief from injurious competition when temporary protection will enable the domestic industry to make adjustments to meet the competition from imports also unlike antidumping and countervailing duty cases see below safeguard cases encompass imports from throughout the world not specific countries safeguard procedures safeguard procedures can be invoked by petition from affected parties an association industry group or other organization presidential request request of house ways and means or senate finance committees or the itcs own initiative industry petitioners are encouraged to submit along with their petition plan to promote positive adjustment to the competition from imports during the course of its investigation of the petition or request the itc must take into account all relevant economic factors including certain specific factors enumerated in the statute and must consider the condition of the industry over the relevant business cycle if the itc determines that imports have been substantial cause of serious injury or the threat thereof to the industry it recommends remedial measures which must include an increase in tariffs on the imported product tariffrate quota trq quantitative restriction adjustment measures or combination of those measures the itc submits its recommendations to the president who decides whether or not to impose the import restrictions in making decision about what action is appropriate the president must consider such factors as the industrys adjustment plan the plans probable effectiveness to promote positive adjustment other factors related to the national economic interest and the national security interest the president can impose safeguards for an initial period of up to 4 years and may extend the action one or more years but the total period or import relief may not exceed

as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers in that territory of like or directly competitive products the contracting party shall be free in respect of such product and to the extent

of multilateral trade negotiations this wto agreement provides rules for the application of article xix of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 19473 rules negotiated in the agreement provide for greater transparency in procedures and limitations on the duration of relief measures expanding on article xix the agreement provides that wto member country may not exercise its right to take retaliatory action during the first 3 years that safeguard is in effect provided that the safeguard measure resulted from an absolute increase in imports and otherwise conforms to the agreement us obligations under nafta also affect the use of safeguards visavis canada and mexico chapter 8 of nafta provides among other things that escape clause measures against nafta members generally last more than three years section 311 of the nafta implementation act pl103182 19 usc 3371 provides that relief action is not to apply to imports from canada or mexico unless they account for substantial share of total imports of good countervailing and antidumping duties4 trade law provides also for the imposition of countervailing duties on goods imported into the united states if the department of commerce doc determines that countervailable subsidy is being provided by foreign government and if the itc determines that the imports are causing or threatening to cause material injury to us industry the purpose of cvd law is to offset any unfair competitive advantage that foreign manufacturers or exporters might have over us producers because of foreign countervailable subsidies countervailable subsidies could include wide range of practices such as export subsidies import substitution subsidies and domestic subsidies provided to specific industry or to inputs used by an industry httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs4 5the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of 2000 now requires the us customs service to redistribute duties collected under ad and cvd orders to affected domestic parties and agricultural petitioners have been receiving such monies see byrd amendment discussion on page 15trade law also authorizes antidumping duties on imported goods if the doc determines that an imported product is being sold at less than its fair value and if the itc determines that us producer is thereby being injured dumping is form of price discrimination whereby goods are sold in one export market at prices lower than the prices of comparable goods in the home market or in other export markets cvd and ad procedures although cvd and ad laws are aimed at different forms of unfair trade they are similar procedurally and substantively cvd and ad investigations may be initiated by the doc or by an intereste d party interested parties may be manufacturer or producer union or group or workers representative of the affected industry trade or business association coalition of firms unions or trade associations or coalition or trade association representative of processors or in the case of processed agricultural products processors and growers petitions are filed simultaneously with the doc and the itc if the doc decides the petition is legally sufficient to commence an investigation one is initiated with respect to imports of particular product from particular country the itc makes preliminary determination as to whether there is reasonable indication that imports in question are causing or threaten to cause material injury to the industry an affirmative decision allows the investigation to proceed negative decision terminates the investigation the doc then must make preliminary determination whether dumping or subsidies have taken place and if so make preliminary calculation of what the dumping or subsidy margin would be regardless of whether the docs preliminary determination is positive or negative the doc continues the investigation and makes final determination of dumping or subsidies and final calculation of duty margins the investigation is terminated if doc makes negative final determination in the event of an affirmative final determin ation then the itc continues its investigation and renders final determination of material injury or threat thereof negative itc determination terminates the investigation if the two final determinations are affirmative then extra duties are placed on imports to be paid by the importer the determinations are subject to judicial review and also may be challenged in the wto dispute settlement mechanism5 both the doc and the itc must take into account number of criteria in making their respective determinations in cvd cases the doc must consider evidence of direct subsidies or upstream subsidies subsidies provided to inputs the benefits of which are passed on to the final producer if found the doc must determine what would be the net countervailable subsidy in ad cases the doc must first determine the normal value of the import based on the price in the exporting countrys home market on the price of the export of the product to third country market or on constructed price depending on the availability of data the doc must compare the normal value with the actual price of the import in question tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs5 determine whether dumping is taking place and if so what the dumping margin is in either procedure the itc must make two determinations 1 is the domestic industry being materially injured or facing threat of material injury 2 are the imports in question cause of the material injury us law establishes time frames within which the respective agencies must make their determinations trade obligations as in the case of safeguards ad and cvd actions must be applied in conformity with trade agreements entered into by the united states in particular the tokyo round subsidies code the uruguay round agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures and the nafta the peace clause see below in the uruguay round agreement on agriculture uraa has particular relevance for the use of countervailing measures for agricultural products in the tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations 19731979 subsidies code governing the use of subsidies and countervailing measures was negotiated and signed by the united states the code provided for improved procedures for notification consultation and dispute settlement and application of remedial measures or countermeasures through the dispute settlement process under the code countries could take traditional countervailing duty actions to offset subsidies upon showing material injury to domestic industry because of subsidized imports the code also sets out criteria for determining material injury during the uruguay round an agreem ent on subsidies and countervailing measures was concluded that goes beyond the tokyo round subsidies code and applies to all wto member countries only gatt member countries that had signed on to the tokyo round subsidies code were bound by it this agreement provides among other things definitions of such terms as subsidies and serious prejudice for the first time in gatt agreement prohibits export subsidies based on the use of domestic instead of imported goods requires most developing countries to phase out export subsidies and import substitution subsidies and applies the wto dispute settlement mechanism which prevents subsidizing government s from blocking the adoption of unfavorable panel reports to countervailing and antidumping cases in nafta chapter 19 permits final determinations in cvd and ad cases involving another members goods to be reviewed by binational panels rather than domestic courts if requested by nafta partner the peace clause and cvd article 13 of the uraa commonly referred to as the peace clause is an agreement among wto countries to refrain from challenging certain of each others agricultural subsidy programs in domestic countervailing duty proceedings during 9year period 1995 through 2003 the peace clause applies also to other wto dispute settlement proceedings in situations where countries might allege adverse effects serious prejudice or nonviolation nullification and impairment of benefits actions under article 13 governments must refrain for the first 9 years that the uraa is in effect from taking action under domestic countervailing duty proceedings so long as the subsidies in question are socalled green box that is not considered to be tradedistorting subsidies article 13 also deals with possible challenges to

are to exercise due restraint in initiating investigations similarly with export subsidies member countries are to exercise due restraint in initiating investigations section 3016 title iii of the trade act of 1974 as amended provides the authority and procedures to enforce us rights under international trade agreements and to respond to certain unfair foreign trade practices these provisions which together are commonly referred to as section 301 provide that if the us trade representative ustr determines that foreign act policy or practice violates or is inconsis tent with trade agreemen t or is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts us commerce then ustr must act to enforce us rights under the trade agreement or to obtain the elimination of the act policy or practice subject to the specific direction if any of the president section 301 empowers the ustr to take several forms of action to deal with unfair practices ustr can 1 suspend withdraw or prevent the application in the foreign country involved of benefits from concessions made in trade agreement 2 impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods and services of the foreign country for such time as the ustr deems appropriate 3 withdraw or suspend preferential duty treatment under various trade preference schemes or 4 enter into binding agreements that commit the foreign country to eliminate or phase out the act policy or practice eliminate any burden or restriction on us commerce resulting from those acts policies or practices or provide the united states with compensatory trade benefits that are satisfactory to the ustr under section 301 ustr can take all appropriate action including retaliation to obtain the removal of any act policy or practice of foreign government that violates an international agreement or is unjustified unreasonable or discriminatory and which burdens or restricts us commerce section 301 procedures any interested person may file petition with the ustr requesting that action be taken under section 301 investigations also may be initiated by petition filed with the ustr by an affected party or parties or on ustrs own motion if ustr makes determination to initiate an investigation it must at the same time request consultatio ns with the foreign country concerned regarding the issues if consultations with the foreign country in question do not resolve the issues and the investigation involves trade agreement then ustr is obliged to resort to dispute settlement procedures provided for under that agreement trade obligations sections 301309 are the us domestic counterparts to the wto consultation and dispute settlement procedures set forth generally in articles xii and xiii of the gatt 1947 as elaborated on by agreements reached during the tokyo round and in the uruguay round understanding on rules andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs7 7a trq combines two policy instruments historically used to restrict imports that compete with domesticallyproduced commodity or product quotas and tariffs in trq the quota component works together with specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection imports

disputes these sections contain the authority in us domestic law to take retaliatory action including import restrictions if deemed necessary to enforce us rights against violations of trade agreements by foreign countries and unjustifiable unreasonable or discriminatory foreign trade practices which burden or restrict us commerce former agricultural trade remedies formerly certain us agricultural producers also might potentially benefit from import relief under another measure commonly called section 22 which refers to provision of permanent agricultural law the agricultural adjustment act amendment of 1935 allowing the president to impose import fees or import quotas to prevent imports from nonwto member countries from undermining the price support and supply control objectives of domestic farm programs legislation implementing nafta and the wto uraa exempts nafta and wto member countries from section 22 quotas and fees under both trade agreements the united states converted thenineffect section 22 restrictions eg affecting cotton peanuts dairy and sugar into tariffrate quotas trqs7 another import relief mechanism was the meat import act of 1979 which required the president to impose quotas on beef veal mutton and goat imports when aggregate quantities of imports of such products were expected to exceed prescribed trigger level although voluntary restraint agreements negotiated with affected countries were used to avert such quotas with the uraa trq replaced the previous meat import restrictions choice of trade remedy 8 agricultural industries have some latitude in determining which remedy for import relief to pursue factors involved in the choice of remedy include the causation and injury standards to be met the procedures involved and the manner by which the remedy is treated in trade agreements the causation and injury standards applied in safeguard determinations are higher than those applied in cvd or ad cases section 201 requires that imports be substantial cause of or threat of serious injury substantial cause is defined in the statute as cause which is important and not less than any other cause serious injury is injury that is significant overall impairment to the position of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs8 9trade remedy law reform in the 107th congress crs report rl30461 p 5 domestic industry in contrast cvd and ad statutes require the determination of material injury defined as injury which is not inconsequential immaterial or unimportant cvd and ad statutes require that the injury occur by reason of the subsidized or dumped imports less precise and lower causation standard than under the safeguard statute in addition to stricter causation and injury standards procedures for safeguard relief entail decisions with respect to import relief that are made at higher policy level the president and possibly congress than in ad and cvd procedures9 the president has wide discretion including taking action at all in deciding what if any safeguard relief to implement congress also may have role in the process if the president does not follow the recommendation of the itc in contrast such discretion exists in cvd and ad cases relief as determined by the doc is implemented by doc antidumping or countervailing duty order without presidential or congressional involvement the higher injury standards and more demanding procedures for safeguard relief reflect the fact that the statute involves fairly traded imports from all sources in addition the president in deciding on the actions to be taken must take into account factors related to national economic and security interests foreign countries whose trade will be affected by safeguard actions will seek to encourage the president to refrain from imposing or otherwise to moderate the safeguards the stricter standards and procedures are probably significant reason why us industries including agriculture have sought and received relief much more often from ad and cvd procedures than from safeguards see below also recent experience with wto dispute settlement involving us impositi on of safeguard actions particularly in regard to wheat gluten and lamb imports discussed below may discourage parties who claim importrelated injury from using section 201 in both cases the wto questioned the methodology used by us itc in determining injury caused by imports and overturned the remedy invoked by the president us agricultural cvd and ad decisions have faced much less scrutiny in wto dispute settlement agricultural cases

petitioned the itc under section 201 for the imposition of safeguard measures against the eu imports after the itc found that such imports were substantial cause of serious injury to the us industry the president on may 30 1998 proclaimed an annual import quota for wheat gluten for 3year period ending june 1 2001 starting at about 126 million pounds in the first year and rising to 142 million pounds in the third year the eu in mid1999 challenged the wheat gluten safeguards and wto dispute panel in december 2000 concluded that the itc had not ensured that injury caused by other factors was attributed to imports once the wto had ruled that the us safeguard was in violation of the safeguard agreement the eu subsequently retaliated by imposing special duty on imports of us corn gluten feed on june 1 2001 the bush administration announced that it would not extend the wheat gluten quota following the lifting of the us quota the eu announced it would discontinue the tariffs on corn gluten

american sheep industry association asi and others the itc on february 9 1999 found that increased lamb meat imports were substantial cause of the threat of serious injury to the us lamb meat industry subsequently president clinton announced on july 7 1999 an import relief package for the us industry that included both 3year 100 million initiative to help the industry improve productivity and tariffrate quotas on lamb meat imports from australia and new zealand which account for 99 of such imports following complaints filed by the two countries wto dispute panel ruled on december 6 2000

occurring doc imposed provisional duties on imports from the two countries ranging as high as 184 ad valorem varying rates apply depending upon the specific importing entity the determination means that importers were required to post bonds or make cash deposits in the appropriate amounts to cover the duties until the end of the process when either final orders with countervailing andor anti dumping duties are issued or else the cases are terminated by doc or itc us honey producers subsequently prevailed when the doc issued final ruling that dumping andor countervailable subsidies were occurring and the itc determined that the us industry is being or threatene d with being materially injured on december 10 2001 doc issued final ad order imposing import duties on argentine and

established banana import regime that favored imports from eu countries former colonies especially in the caribbean and that restricted access to bananas produced in latin america at the request of us banana interests operating in latin america section 301 investigati ons were undertaken into whether the eu policies and practices were discriminatory following series of bilateral and multilateral consultations ustr took the issue into the wto dispute settlement process where in 1997 the wto found that the eu banana import regime was inconsistent with eu trade obligations by 1999 the eu with 5 billion banana market had not implemented the wto reforms so the united states imposed wtoapproved retaliation in the form of 100 tariffs on nearly 200 million of eu exports to the united states in april 2001 the united states and the eu reached an agreement that resolved the banana dispute in response to the eus agreement to increase market access for us banana distributors the united states lifted its retaliatory duties on july 1 2001 the agreement provides for transition to tariffonly system of imports in 2006 in the period until 2006 the eu is establishing quotas and licensing system based on historical trade shares that should increase the prospect s for latin american banana imports in the eu market especially bananas marketed by us firms like chiquita brands international under the agreement banana imports from developing countries that are former eu member country colonies the socalled acp countries in africa the caribbean and pacific will continue to enjoy preferential entry trade ministers in the fourth ministerial conference of the wto held in doha qatar from november 911 2001 agreed to grant the eu waivers from its nondiscrimination obligations in order to enable it to give preferential tariff concessions to the acp countries and to augment the quota for latin american bananas as result full implementation of the agreement can now proceed14 european union meat hormone directive section 301 actions were instituted to challenge an eu ban which took effect in 1989 on imports of meat derived from animals treated with growth hormones the united states contended

products at least in the near term both sides still express desire to reach an amicable settlement but none was at hand as of early 200215 mexico high fructose corn syrup section 301 investigation was initiated in early 1998 after the us corn refiners associati on alleged that the mexican government had denied fair and equitable marketing opportunities for us high fructose corn syrup hfcs by fostering collusion between the mexican sugar and soft drink industries nafta and wto dispute proceedings already were underway to address the us contention that mexico had failed to abide by its own laws when it imposed in january 1998 antidumping duties ranging from 55 to 175 per ton on us hfcs imports nafta and wto panels both have since sided with the united states essentially agreeing that mexico had not proven that the imports injure or threaten to injure domestic industry that could lead to retaliation in the form of 100 tariffs on some asyet undetermined value of mexican imports however the hfcs dispute is closely tied to ongoing negotiations on market access to the us market for mexican sugar starting october 1 2000 mexico under nafta became eligible to ship much more sugar duty free to the us market than the 25000 metric tons allowed to enter in earlier years us and mexican negotiators continue to disagree however over just how much sugar mexico actually can export to the united states an agreement was reached in december 2001 between mexico and the united states to attempt to find negotiated settlement in the dispute while leaving the hfcs duties in place however the sweetener issue became more contentious when mexico imposed on january 1 2002 new tax of up to 20 on soft drinks containing hfcs this tax too could be challenged under nafta or wto provisions16 canada wheat ustr initiated on october 23 2000 section 301 investigation after the north dakota wheat commission filed petition alleging that the canadian government and the canadian wheat board were engaging in anticompetitive practices in thirdcountry markets ie offering to undersell us wheat with lower prices in some markets and charging higher prices in others to make up the difference earlier

monopolistic canadian wheat board ustr press release february 15 2002analysis does not support the charge that the canadian wheat board is systematically underpricing exports in us or third country markets however on february 15 2002 ustr released an affirmative finding that the government of canada grants the canadian wheat board special monopoly status that gives it competitive advantage that harm us producers ustr said it would aggressively pursue several avenues to address the finding 1 examine whether to take dispute settlement case to the wto 2 work with the north dakota wheat commission and the us industry to examine whether to file us cvd and ad petitions with commerce and the itc 3 with industry identify specific impediments to us wheat exports to canada and to negotiate with canada to ensure fair two way trade and 4 complement the first three actions with the administrations ongoing commitment to vigorously pursue comprehensive and meaningful reform of state trading enterprises in the wto agriculture negotiations ustr said it would not impose tariffrate quota at this time contending that it would violate nafta and wto commitments could attract canadian retaliation against us agriculture and would not achieve durable solution to the market distortions caused by the canadian wheat board monopoly18 recent policy developments variety of measures have been passed or proposed in recent years aimed at improving us producers ability to obtain relief from what they view as unfair import pricing andor barriers to their own exports in some cases these measures have been offered primarily in response to concerns raised by us agriculture often they have been fueled by the trade problems experienced by other us industries but nonetheless are or would be applicable across the economy including agriculture some argue that agriculture deserves special treatment under us trade policy in general and trade remedy legislation in particular due to its unique characteristics characteristics often cited as in support of special agricultural treatment include the highly perishable and cyclical nature of agricultural products and the importance of financially healthy farm sector in ensuring adequate food at reasonable prices howeve r counterargument could be made that modern us agriculture has become far more integrated into and similar to much of the rest of the us economy making special treatment unnecessary besides it could be argued the sector already is supported far more than other industries through an array of extensive and costly price and income supports export programs and other government spending that helps to cushion and insulate farmers from trade problems this section surveys number of legislative and trade policy developments with potential implications for agricultural producershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs16 byrd amendment senator byrd successfully sponsored an amendment to the fy2001 agricultural appropriation pl 106387 section 1003 that requires that antidumping and countervailing duties be redistributed to the domestic industries found to be injured by the imports and subject to the ad and cvd orders the provision entitled the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of 2000 applies to all industries and not just agriculture it requires the us customs service to deposit the duties into special account rather than into the general treasury as previously customs then must distribute the funds to eligible firms farmers or other producers that were petitioners in the original ad or cvd cases to offset certain expenses they incurred as result of the dumped or subsidized imports customs published on august 3 2001 list of ad and cvd orders and the names of affected domestic producers potentially eligible under the byrd amendment for redistribution of fy2001 duty collections customs on january 30 2002 released details on the first disbursements under the byrd amendment which totaled approxima tely 200 million much of the 200 million went to us manufacturers of ball bearings and other steel products about 22 million of the 200 million was for agricultural ad and cvd cases generally those in table 2 on page 11 most of the agricultural disbursements were for petitioners in the italian pasta cases see table 2 notably to hershey foods at approximately 8 million and to american italian pasta at more than 7 million customs reported that another nearly 2 billion was being held as of october 1 2001 in clearing accounts awaiting final liquidation some but not necessarily all of it ultimately will be paid to adcvd petitioners about 121 million was for agriculturerelated cases the byrd amendment has been controversial initially because of criticism that it was inserted into the legislation during conference without committee consideration in either chamber and more recently because of budgetary and international trade concerns in late 2000 and early 2001 the eu japan and 10 other countries lodged complaints with the wto charging that the amendment violates wto obligations see below concluding observations carousel retaliation section 407 of the trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 directs the ustr periodically to revise the list of products subject to trade retaliation revision is not required if the ustr determines that implementation of wto obligations is imminent or the ustr and the petitioner agree that revision is unnecessary impetus for the provision grew largely from the difficulties the united states had in forcing the eu to change its banana import regime and its beef hormone ban see page 13 even though wto panels had ruled for the united states and permitted it to impose retaliatory duties against various imports from the eu proponents of the carousel provision contend that rotating the list of products subjecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs17 19 the administration already had the authority to rotate product lists but had not taken such action see crs report rs20751 pdf trade retaliation the carousel approach and the foreign sales corporation fsc export tax benefit and the eti replacement provisions in the crs trade electronic briefing bookto retaliation would bring more pressure to bear on the offending party by exposing broader swath of its economy to economic pain19 the ustr began implementing the provision in late may 2000 but product lists have not been changed the ec has challenged the carousel provision in the wto as violating the dispute settlement understanding the proceeding is still in consultations the united states also reportedly is reluctant to employ carousel because of other sensitive useu trade matters particularly in light of wto panel decision that us tax benefit provided to us foreign sales corporations violates trade rules which could potentially subject the united states to as much as 4 billion in retaliatory tariffs the amount of retaliation is currently in wto arbitration other proposals to change current trade remedy laws several bills have been introduced in the 107th congress that would make potentially significant changes in existing trade remedy statutes for example hr 518 s 979 and hr 1988 contain various provisions aimed at easing the requirements for determining that imports have caused or threatened to cause material injury to us industry including but not limited to agriculture proposed provisions would among other things specify that imports could be one of the causes of injury they longer would have to be the primary cause for gaining import relief other examples include s 1869 and hr 3571 both of which would provide for expedited antidumping investigatio ns when imports increase materially from new suppliers after an antidumping order has been issued s 979 and hr 1988 which are companion bills also contain language related directly to agriculture in determining whether injury has occurred the itc effectively would be required if it determines that product is perishable agricultural product with short shelf life to measure the economic effects during the course of the products defined production period or season ie not over longer period when the effects of an import might be diluted statistic ally several provisions also specify several factors that should or should not be weighed in determining economic injury agriculture in trade promotion authority legislation the administration and congressional supporters are seeking to renew authority for the president to negotiate trade agreements with expedited procedures for legislation to implement those agreements this authority is commonly called trade promotion authority tpa or fasttrack authority as in the past many although not all agricultural groups are among the exportoriented interests that support such authority it is expected that final tpa law will include language that recognizes the industrys special status andor makes other special concessions to ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs18 20examples of other objectives include reducing or eliminating import tariffs export subsidies and trade distorting domestic support maintaining bona fide food assistance programs and preserving us market development and export credit programs for more information see crs report 97817 agriculture and fast track or trade promotion authority on december 6 2001 the house narrowly passed largely along party lines tpa bill hr 3005 that would authorize the president to negotiate trade agreements reached by june 30 2005 with 2year extension possible the senate finance committee cleared its version of hr 3005 on december 18 2001 full senate consideration is expected shortly in part to shore up support for tpa among agricultur groups and also to address their specific trade concerns proponents of hr 3005 have included extensive provisions regarding negotiating objectives and consultation requirements for agriculture hr 3005 includes among numerous agricultural negotiating objectives eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in perishable or cyclical products and addressing their trade problems and ensuring that import relief mechanisms for such products are as accessible and useful to us growers as they are to producers in other countries20 also to garner more support from agricultural members the bills house sponsors added language expanding the consultation requirements that us officials must follow before undertaking tariff reduction negotiations on agricultural products considered importsensitive defined in the house version as those subject to the minimum 25 annual reduction required under the uraa the ustr would have to identify such products likely more than 200 specific items ranging from cheese and many other dairy products to various fresh fruits and vegetables sugar and other sweeteners beef and lamb oilseeds wine tobaccos cotton wool and chocolate and consult with congress on how domestic producers would be affected by tariff cuts among other requirements the senate version contains somewhat different language but with the same intent some analysts note that while hr 3005 and the senate bill give the president the authority he has sought to proceed with negotiations provisions in those bills will make it difficult for the president to achieve stated negotiating objectives for agriculture in particular analysts say both bills requirement to consult in advance with congress before negotiating cuts in tariffs on importsensitive products make negotiating tariff reductions more difficult and prevent negotiation of tradeoffs between sectors the administration however has expressed the view that while the fast track bills pose additional hurdles for lowering tariffs on importsensitive products in the longrun they provide better basis for negotiations trade adjustment assistance for farmers several proposals have been offered to extend trade adjustment assistance taa to farmers taa programs are available for workers through the department of labor and for firms through the department of commerce they provide funds for training and other adjustment measures to those who can demonstrate an adverse impact from imports many economists prefer this option over trade restrictivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs19 21trade remedy law

eligibility for taa for any agricultural commodity involved in an usitc safeguard investigation 24for background see crs report rs20848 farm commodity programs short primer and crs report rl31195 the 2002 farm bill overview and status remedies because it directs assistance to those most affected and does so without distorting prices but taa programs as currently designed and administered have been criticized by labor advocacy groups as ineffective in responding to workers needs in globalizing economy21 they also may be of limited value for agriculture current legislative authority for taa for workers and firms expired at the end of fy2001 and the 107th congress has been considering legislation to extend it22 proposals to include farmers have been offered and are included in the major vehicles now under consideration senator conrad introduced on june 26 2001 the trade adjustment assistance for farmers act s 1100 which would add new chapter to title ii of the trade act of 1974 the

december 4 2001 under s 1209 group of agricultural producers could petition the secretary of agriculture to be certified as eligible for taa the secretary would have 60 days to determine that the national average price for the affected commodity or class of goods from that commodity for the most recent marketing year was less than 80 of the average price for the prior 5 years and imports of like items contributed importantly to the price decline23 once such determination was made each member of the eligible group could apply to the secretary for cash payment equal to onehalf of the difference between the most recent years national average price and 80 of the preceding 5 marketing years times his or her production for the year an individuals benefits would be limited to 10000 per year and all claims could be decreased proportionately if necessary to maintain the total national cost of the program at proposed authorized funding cap of 90 million annually several bills with similar farmer language have been introduced into the house including hr 3359 and hr 3670 current taa eligibility for workers is based on loss of job the language in s 1209 ties payments to the price

ways and means committees the report noted that from fy1994 through fy2000 of 2616 certifications of petitions filed with dol for worker assistance only 21 were in agriculture the commerce taa program for firms between fy1994 and the first half of fy2000 certified 29 incorporated agricultural firms covering fresh flowers pears pineapples carrots maple syrup oysters crabs salmon and other fish of the 29 firms 21 actually submitted adjustment proposals for which more than 750000 in taa funds had been allocated to 20 of themthe labor report on taa for agricultural producers observed that the existing programs for workers emphasize retraining those who have lost their jobs so that they can find other occupations any modifications to these dol programs such as to provide financial assistance to workers to remain in their current occupatio ns runs counter to the emphasis of these important readjustment programs the commerce taa program for firms provides opportunities for agriculture commodity producers who have been injured by lost sales and reduced the number of their employees due to increased imports to receive limited technical assistance on cost shared basis that will help them regain their economic competitiveness however the program has funding limitations and authority to provide any direct financial assistance in the form of loans loan guarantees or income supplements to trade injured firms usda officials noted in the report that low commodity prices and reduced farm income are not due primarily to increased imports thus taatype programs with their linkage to increased imports would not help address low prices faced by agricultural commodity producers the labor report concluded should the senate finance and house ways and means committees consider legislation designed to assist agricultura l commodity producers and workers adversely affected by low prices as result of imports who desire to remain in their current occupations we recommend that it be enacted separately and apart from the current trade adjustment assistance for workers or firms programs25 concluding observations as agricultural trade grows us producers are exposed not only to new sales opportunities overseas but also to stronger price competition at home as food and farm imports from other countries increase often certain groups of commodity producers perceive such imports as threat to their livelihoods and seek relief from the government either under existing statutes as described above or through new legislative proposals some of which have attracted congressional interest generally trade remedy legislation receives the most support from industries whether agricultural or nonagricultural eg steel textiles etc that appear to be the most sensitive to foreign competition however opposition to such legislation often is found among other domestic interests notably us businesses that rely on imports and consumers who face potentially higher prices due to import restrictions other possible costs of trade remedies are the extent if any to which they mighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs21 26september 17 2001 wto press release on

inefficient us producers heighten international trade tensions andor increase government outlays trade remedy laws already have come under scrutiny and challenge by the united states major trading partners and by the wto itself noting that the united states has continued to make use of ad and cvd measures the wto recently stated initiations of investigations may have chilling effect on trade with preliminary duties applied in most cases turning to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act the byrd amendment the wto quoted president clinton as saying it would provide select us industries with subsidy above and beyond the protection level needed to counteract foreign subsidies while providing comparable subsidy to other us industries or to us consumers who are forced to pay higher prices on industrial inputs or consumer goods as result of the anti dumping and countervailing duties26 however the wto also has pointed out that the united states is not alone in its use of various import protections for agriculture and other products regarding special agricultural safeguards in particular the wto reported that 38 of its member countries currently have reserved the right to use combined total of 6072 of them which it defines as contingency restrictions on imports taken temporarily to deal with special circumstances such as sudden surge in imports these are permitted generally under the ur safeguards agreement27 with the united states in mind the european union and japan for example have called for review of the antidumping practices of wto countries in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations which are now getting under way the united states had opposed such review however us negotiators subsequently agreed to language in the november 2001 doha declaration that began new round of multilateral trade negotiations that calls for simplification and clarification of countries laws on antidumping and safeguard laws ustr zoellick recently told the senate finance committee that the language is intended to encourage developing countries to bring their own trade relief measures up to us standards and to replace language that potentially would have been more unfavorable to the united states however several committee members sharply criticized the ustr for exposing the us trade relief laws to potential weakening in the multilateral negotiations28 meanwhile the us position continues to be for further reductions in agricultural trade barriers some foreign governments might suggest that this position is inconsistent with the us opposition to examining antidumping practices still us producers are likely to resist changes in us law and possibly to push for stronger protections so long as they perceive foreign competitors engaging in unfair subsidization of their own agricultural producers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31296crs22 29 sources uruguay round trade agreements text of agreements implementing bill statement of administrative action
