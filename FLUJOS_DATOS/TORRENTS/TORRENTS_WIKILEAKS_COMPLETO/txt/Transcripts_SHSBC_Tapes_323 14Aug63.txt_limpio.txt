getting into the medical scene im swapping terminals how are we today nurse get the bedpan well you should be having demonstration of course today but theres lot to of ground to cover one way or the other and i11 try to give you some helpful hints in auditing which will make up for it first and foremost this is what audience 14th fourteenth august you surely keep my time track nice and straight thank you 14 august ad 13 saint hill special briefing course we have lecture on auditing style kind type how do if you must audit why audit to gain the customer is always right i mean the preclear is always right its true the significance the significance is less important than the ta action ta action on the right significance brings about faster clearing the benefit is in the word faster the right significance and ta action equals case gain keep the itsa line in get ta action when training an auditor get him to figure out how many ways you can cut an itsa line and maybe dawn will break the smoothest auditing is the auditing which least cuts the itsa line auditor means listener it takes lie to hold aberration in place serious aberration surrenders easily its the mediocre that takes the long haul mediocre type aberration the primary difference between scientology and psychiatry is that psychiatry is authoritarian and tells the person whats wrong with him often introducing new lie scientology finds out whats wrong with the person from the person and then knows more about it than the person but listens anyway listening is the badge of superior knowledge he who has superior knowledge is privileged to listen its only he who has superior knowledge that talks all the time confucius now you got these maxims and pearls of wisdom in actual fact with that data you could go straight out and evolve all of scientology just like that its remarkable isnt it but you mustnt in actual fact discount just because its discounted to the pc you mustnt discount the backbone and body of knowledge of scientology soon as you tell somebody that hes lived for the last thirty trillion years of course thirty trillion years is drop in the bucket soon as you tell somebody hes lived the last thirty trillion years and so on hes liable to be hit with feeling of unreality that unreality busily boils off but he natters while its being boiled off how its all unreal and that sort of thing well hes actually running off unreality and you shouldnt pay much attention to it remember hes now talking about an unreality and he never talked about that before and in the process of talking about it he actually is raising his arc with whatever it is even though he may do it very slowly now there are two kinds of talk that pc indulges in two kinds of talk talk one is theta talk and talk two is entheta talk its theta talk that brings you out of the woods with pc and the entheta talk is the symptom of an arc break so auditing actually divides down into two actions is getting theta talk out of the pc thats one action and thats keeping your itsa line in because its the theta hes generating thats blowing his bank apart you see and the entheta talk is handled by locating the impeded charge of theta which is barriered in the bank we call this bypassed charge in other words theres two actions here one you can let him talk and keep his attention directed indifferently sometimes but keep it directed in the direction of the right significances dont keep it directed to such degree however that he ceases to get tone arm action and ceases to talk see the other action is in actual fact putting in the itsa line for the pc and thats how you cure an arc break you find out by assessment what trapped charge has been ticked and is trying to get loose hell just natter as long as that charge is trapped and the auditor can then locate that trapped charge and free it hell desensitize it so theres two auditing actions in actual fact you see this first and foremost is listing with tone arm action and then secondarily locating by assessment or any other means the trapped charge now pc who is who is talking smoothly and on and on and on even if the pc is crying about it is not interfered with see dont interfere with that line thats interfering with the itsa line just let the pc roll see but the pc is not talking about the bank but is talking up out of the bank natter natter natter natter natter its all bad theyretheyre after theyre caving in what youre doing to what everybody is doing to how bad they are you know talks like newspaper then you realize at that point that this talk is really not doing the pc any good at all this pc is in an arc break hes protesting cut communication lines you see in his environment usually and so forth hes protesting unrealities hes protesting lack of affinity or its absence and whats happened there is that charge has been ticked and missed and unless the auditor gets very very busy and locates that charge and indicates it and lets the pc see it and figure it out why that pc is going to go on nattering and youre not then going to get an increase of case now in the old days we said that if pc could talk his havingness down remember that audience mmhm yes well now youve probably wondered how that sits today that only applies to case two which i have just given you pc only talks his havingness down when hes natter natter natter natter natter and youll find in case one where the pc is talking about his case is talking about his bank is talking about himself his past and so forth and youre getting tone arm action youll find out that the longer he talks the better his havingness gets do you see that of course the whole phenomenon of havingness is raising his arc with his environment so if he is in situation where hes he himself is cutting his arc with his environment then of course his havingness will drop because his arc with the environment is what we call havingness havingness is simply can be defined as arc with the environment thats all that should be very elementary to you but now lets see how many ways can you cut an itsa line now the best way to do this is to get somebody the graph of i was it 2 august the hco bulletin that has the big graph on the back of it that gives you the cut itsa line shows you what the cut itsa line is audience fourth august fourth august thank you hcob 4 aug 63 emeter errors comm cycle error now that 4th august bulletin has nice graph there and you should in training an auditor youre going to make youre going to make marvelous strides if you do this in training an auditor if youll just give him that graph and youll say now go ahead and list the number of ways you could cut this itsa line when hes done that why give an example of each one of these thats your practical aspect you see give an example of each one of these cut things and then give an example of each one of these things how that neednt have been cut or you would overcome it if you did this inadvertently in other words get him thinking on this subject get him to comb his hair out on this subject so that he is not walking around in fog because its one of the most complex things you ever heard of if you want to make it complex and everybodys going to have different bug on it now i can draw you up the communication cycles which are contained in the auditing cycle and these are all very neat and therell be drills for each one of these things eventually but it all comes down to this initially getting the pc insession which is interested in his own case and talking to the auditor and then keeping the itsa line in in such way as to give maximal tone arm action now when we state it that way were stating it the way very skilled auditor would look at it see this is the hallmark of very skilled auditor and its simply an expansion of highly elementary definition which i gave you in the first place now thats this where the skill comes in thats skilled auditor in other words he can get somebody interested in his own case and talking to the auditor about it and then keep the itsa line in directed in such way as to give maximal tone arm action and if you add to that and knocking out the significances necessary to resolve the case fastest now you have the supersupersuperskiiled auditor and there you have actually delineated the various levels and grades of auditing thats just to the degree that you expand to the last definition i give you now if you want to move an auditor downstairs in terms of level i mean if you want to get an idea of the lower levels of auditing then the upper levels all you have to do is keep snipping pieces off of that definition and youll get lower and lower levels of auditing till you even snip off tone arm action and assessment at the level of book auditor you dont expect him to know anything about tone arm you dont expect him to be able to give an assessment if he wasnt getting tone arm action so you just define for him that you keep somebody talking about his own case and you continue to listen to him and the odd part of it is that hes going to get lot more results than mucking up crisscrossed actions that he doesnt understand you see youve given him enough right there and youre going to give him an emeter now and he doesnt know anything about an emeter and youre going to give him an emeter and hes going to wonder lets see the tone arm is that this knob at the bottom that snaps that thats not it uh and tone arm action tone arm action what does quite that mean and hes watching this tone arm action hes putting down 3001 hes gotten so he can read verniers you see 3002 3001 pc is getting tone arm action you see obviously adequate tone arm action in other words you get the idea youve got to keep giving him these significances and keep giving him these significances and keep giving him these and finally train him in on what tone arm is well youve been over that yourselves so often and so long that it appears absolutely ridiculous that nobody would know anything about it well just sometime just hand an emeter to well psychiatrist or somebody and say how do you operate this thing bud and keeping his professional lingo see how do you operate this thing bud and he comes up with the same thing hes told the food and drug administration of the united states it cures things cures things thing is around for eighty years measuring emotion and so forth in the world of psychology and thats the best technical opinion that they can come up with it cures things i dont know i think they seven and half volts through the thing that put on the person you see and if it runs through his hands for little while why then he ceases to get speckled fever or something i dont know i dont understand this you see you give piece of equipment or something like that or you give complication to somebody and they q and with the complication by making it far far far more complicated to point where it longer means what it meant see you can just chase this thing over the far horizon it ceases to have any value at all so it is better to stay now listen because youll be training lot of auditors now listen here remember remember pound one simplicity home dont make it complicated just pound one simplicity home at time and youve got it made youve got some people on coaudit just keep him talking and when youre absolutely sure hes shut up and hes said everything that hes going to say on the subject why you just look at him intelligently and you just ask him for something else and thats all we want see and thats all we want we want you sitting there and when he finally see you dont even have starts of sessions or anything else see and when hes finally finished up talking and saying what he wants to say then you say one of these questions to him you see and its here and we dont even care if its the same question every time or another question or something but your idea is to keep him talking about himself you got the idea and thats all we want we just want you to keep him talking about himself thats really what we want and lets not get off into your inability to duplicate the auditing command or youre waiting there to get in new auditing command lets not get in there about whether you acknowledge what he has said lets not add any complication to it at all that appalls you suddenly as you take look at it you take all those things in as automatic dont you how cati you get along without them well its up to you to find out because at that level of auditing all you want to have happen all you want to have happen is somebody telling b telling about their troubles we dont care what they say hes not going to have tone arm to look at hes not going to have any complications like this so hell want to know how can you tell so you add then the next step the pc gets brighter and talks better thats his index of success you would express that as more arc and thats the most elementary basic of auditing there is you could take some oldtimer and you could take his own auditing trained patterns and you could say if you were auditing you if you were auditing you what part of your case would you start for sit back man thats it tone arm sit there and move beautifully clean up all his past auditing everything else now ive given you there the various levels of auditing see if youll only recognize it see those are the various levels of certification that that actually automatically establishes your zones and patterns of training now where we exceed those things we lose it would take quite while to get administration wrapped around that much simplicity but you eventually will get to point where youll see that simplicity achieved and thats the ideal that is your ideal now as you move along in auditing case youre going to be confounded with this basic problem soon as we move up and put the emeter in somebodys hands of course were confounded with this problem before but because we havent got that level of skill in the auditor we dont pay any attention to the problem and the second that we graduate somebody up to putting meter in his lap then we want to see that ta move and when that ta moves weve got charge coming off and theres your basic problem is how do you keep ta moving thats going to worry you that worries mary sue on your cases that worries on her case that worries people people people that worries mary sue in auditing anything how are you going to keep that ta moving now that is the deepest problem in auditing at this moment not what to audit that is not the deepest problem that problem has been solved the other problem is how do you keep the ta moving on that particular pc that is the problem man and when you walk upstairs to the highest level of skill you of course keep it moving by addressing the case to certain significances how do you keep it moving this gives you lot of problems i could delineate these problems by the hour now were getting into complexity so youre now going up to supervisory level of auditing takes quite lot of knowledge how do you keep ta moving well the basic stop of ta is time the reason they stop is time and the biggest time stopper is the gpm i beg your pardon thats as far as thats as far as an incident type of incident is concerned thats great time stopper but gpm never becomes terrific time stopper until it has been grouped in one of these betweenlives screens or some analogous type of incident where things are redated or crossdated or something like that and it gets stuck and at wrong times the gpm is incipiently then if it didnt exist you see you probably would get time stopping at all probably nobody could group bank you you got that that because thats perfectly true i followed this out painfully tagged it out bit by bit the only time my tone arm has ever stopped moving is on gpms ive got good subjective reality on it good objective reality on it and so forth its gpm if it werent there it couldnt get latched up on one of these screens or anything else you see its big time stopper because it gives the mechanism of instantaneousness in present time and it floats in time so therefore it can appear anyplace and then it gets pinned down in these betweenlife area screens and there goes your ta action thud stops thats it so thats all thats all very interesting it sounds terribly final and it doesnt make it simpler problem but if you know that you can get this thing disentangled more easily but thats thats what that is so then we assume then that as far as significance of incidents are concerned why the gpm plus any grouping incident gives you billyo as far as the tone arm is concerned that is what is in the bank that will stop tone arm action you got that now what auditing action stops tone arm action see now this is different problem this is different problem there is an auditing action its the same action its wrong dating you get the wrong date on an incident and your tone arm action starts folding up pc cant even run by the way cant even run the incident youre trying to run cant do anything with it its got wrong date on it youll find that wrong date tends to group incidents it does all kinds of wild things if somebody has got 3d visio of facsimile then i can tell you man youve got the right date and as he runs through it it stays 3d and stays in one place boy youve got the right date dont start worrying about dates but if hes running it and half dozen others at the same time then its leadpipe cinch youve got the wrong date this doesnt necessarily mean that you can find the right date but it means you have got the wrong date got that now when you wrongdate gpm what do you think happens here is your greatest incipient wrongdater anyway it floats in time all over the place and when you get the wrong date on gpm brother that is grim situation it will stop the tone arm almost as though it ran into truck wrong date now this is mixed up with the fact that the gpm is possible to date do you understand how faintly i make that statement it is possible to date gpm that is very faint statement but the mere fact that it is gpm gives you the tiniest possible reads on dates it gives you the tiniest reads and the roughest job of dating of any incident and after youve dated one why that date is as valid as it gets tone arm action but that doesnt mean that half an hour later on redating situation youre not going to find another date how do you like that perhaps you didnt realize that this amount of sneakery was going on with regard to one of these confounded gpms but i tell you this for this reason the way youre dealing with gpms theres sense as an auditor of going into tears back of your meter because lord knows you will feel like it youve just got this thing beautifully nailed down at some incredible date you cant even keep in your head see gorgeous see trillions all over the place and so on boy youre sure glad to have that picture showed up fifteen minutes later pc is going into an arc break or starting to natter about your hairdo or something you give him an assessment and it says wrong date it assesses out to wrong date but how could it assess out to wrong date we just had the right date so we very often would be foolish enough to back off be very foolish you see foolish enough to back off and say we got that one rightdated lets see if we can find something else that is wrongdated you better take whats nearest and dearest to your dating because that gpm probably has another date you probably dated it onto screen in other words this was the screen date thats still right date but its screen date and when you redate it again thats the pc has blown enough charge now to be aware of the wrongness of this date thats all thats happened so you redate the confounded thing and you get it off the screen and it moves someplace else and youve now got right date the difficulty with this the reads are absolutely microscopic hundred and twentyeight on mark v you see all rudiments in all the pc has got to do is you say greater than he thinks less than and immediately you get read on something else and bzzong here we go see so you delicately cat footedly date this thing and you get beautiful read and you get blowdown and you say aahhhhh you know meter is up there at fiveandahalf on the tone arm you got beautiful blowdown when you got this new dateand youre all set and all ready to go you run some more items out of the thing and fifteen minutes later the pc is finding fault with your necktie so you do another arc break assessment and so on pc absolutely cant go on the only time you do one is when the pc just cant hes passed into such stagetwo there that you cant get any auditing at all and you do an assessment and by god it comes up wrong date oh but wait minute you had blowdown on the thing you moved it to another screen nice completely aside from the perils of just plain his rudiments go out so you get wrong date you see youve got the thing that the thing has got lot of dates so you finally get it back and you finally you say i heard ron say something about that one time and im really going to get in this thing real good is this an actual track date and it reads actual track date you didnt also ask on what screen so you get your new date and after that it runs like doll but beware you actually could start dating on certain series of gpms now listen and go seven sessions trying to find the date of the series be wonderful if you kept the pcs itsa line in the whole way and dont turn off that itsa line because youve pulled whole series of gpms off screen after screen after screen youre straightening out his track like crazy but you could sit there and just chop him to ribbons by never letting him help you in any way shape or form take all the data off the meter never let the pc volunteer anything and if you then went seven sessions with all this your pc would be going downhill like mad dont you see you wouldnt be getting any tone arm action either you see the liabilities you see the liabilities of this confounded thing called the gpm false track actually is nothing because it is never false track they might show you some pictures and say that is track but theyre usually still pictures solid pictures and very brief pictures when it comes to track there are false pictures yes but when it comes to track false track actually you shouldnt use the word and i shouldnt have used the word false track because ive since found out what it is when you invalidate somebodys time track hard enough and hit him hard enough he puts dubin over the top of the actual picture and the dubin looks quite like the actual picture but its just little little film over the top of it and as you start to audit it that film comes off and he sees the actual picture and actually it isnt too different than his own track he wont find much variation in his time track by the reason of having had his track invalidated it to dubin ive now found this out you see hes still got his track hes still got his still when he was big thetan he was big thetan you see and when that has happened to him it happened to him he might have oddly askew pictures on the subject and the thing was all grouped in one locale by screen but thats his track when youve run it over the pictures all of sudden start going into 3d and he sees these things as looking bit better than they did and hes got better sense of reality the reason most of you have in pcs particularly find unreality and the pc kicking back is because you havent run across it enough to scrub off the false picture see that is unreal to the pc unreality is force and invalidation dont you see thats what unreality is you ever run car into brick wall things momentarily looked awfully unreal well thats the same phenomenon unreality you hit somebody hard and things get unreal they get unreal down to point of unconsciousness what is unconsciousness but total unreality now thats all unreality is of course unreality stems from the arc pris side of the situation its sudden steep drop in arc that really gives you some weird waves of this thing at the same time hes being hit hes also got not only the arc break with mest but hes got some other consideration on the subject of arc break and it gives him an arc break that that particular thing would hit him see its compounded that he runs the car into the brick wall and the impact and so forth renders him unconscious but hes got another arc break on the arc you see side of the thing this was the mest side of it his unconsciousness you see but his other arc break with magnitude is the fact that that wall would do that to his car see and its an arc break with the circumstances of the situation shouldnt happen you see protest one way or the other now dealing with pictures then you get considerable unreality coming off and when you deal with these pictures you get into arc breaks which is the only point im making here about dating and youll notice that an arc broke pc only reads on the exact subject of the arc break all other reads go out severely arc broken pc then does not read on the meter except on the bypassed charge which caused the arc break thats the one hole in the emeter because it wont read during an arc break well wait minute in gpm youre always auditing an arc break arent you hes arc broke like mad time is all askew and hes been captured and stuck in that thing and oh you know all this kind of stuff going on and of course the emeter doesnt read well hes arc broken with himself for being such fool as to be caught you know theres all kinds of crisscross arc breaks he has arc breaks with matter energy space and time because somebody would it would obey to quote an exact arc break i noticed myself at the beginning of gpm because it would obey such lowtoned people perfectly logical arc break well so the arc broken condition of the pc in the area influences the meter read meter is reading very badly for that area anyway this is the hill that very skilled auditor climbs but now listen to the good news back of it if you just keep trying and dont cut the itsa line you will get tone arm action in your effort to date it and the itsa line and blowing charge will increase the pcs reality on the incident to point where the date is more and more real and you will see bundles of facsimiles start to come apart for gods sakes put this down in letters of fire because someday as an auditor this is well i can give you lot of tips about auditing but someday as an auditor youre going to be sit there and you just just feel the tears under your eyelids its just too desperate you know gawd you tried you dont dare say anything to the pc youre out of communication with the world you know and youve tried is this gpm more than two trillion years ago less than two tr what did you think of oh all right is this gpm more than two trillion years ago is it less than two trillion years ago apparently less than two trillion years ago all right is this gpm more than five hundred billion trillion years ago less thats wrong date excuse one and onehalf trillion years ago less than one and onehalf it doesnt read its all blank lets see have you been thinking of anything well lets do another order of magnitude huh tens of years ago hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago tens of thousands of years ago hundreds tens of thousands of years ago is this gpm tens of thousands of years ago ah is it more than tens of thousands of years ago greater magnitude than tens of thousands of years ago less than is it tens of thousands oh thats good huh nice read see all right is it more than fifty thousand years ago less than fifty thousand years ago its less than is it more than twentyfive thousand years ago less than twentyfive thousand years ago less than is it more than ten thousand years ago less than ten thousand years ago less than is it more than five thousand years ago less than five thousand years ago oh you thought it was greater than fifty thousand years ago oh oh all right all right all right all right was it more than seventyfive thousand years ago less than seventyfive thousand years ago that didnt read did you youre very foolish if you dont interrupt that somewhere along the line well now whats been occuring to you while this has been going on and get yourself little ta action see and bust it down because frankly you can go on like that with very very tough gpm its just like just like trying to catch slippery fish one time its trillions and the next time its thousands and then all of sudden you why does it do that youre slipping it off one screen and another screen you see and its restimulation factors are blowing and so on so youve got to keep your itsa line in while youre dating that is probably one of the toughest things that pro has to do keep the itsa line in while dating you get to sweating over this emeter and you forget about the pc to some degree and if the pc is thinking about it and talking about it why there it is so much so that i like to try to run the tone arm action out of it without dating it directly up get any idea the pc might have of the date and just let him talk himself along the line until he either gets the date and gives it to on silver platter or gives up completely throws in the sponge so it squishes and then go ahead and date and then try if i cant find the date do it all over again and just keep arguing and talking about this you know back and forth and getting my tone arm action because get this now if you just keep trying to find something and keep the itsa line in while youre doing it you will eventually find it clang but this is one of those things that you wouldnt ordinarily discover in the runofthemill activities of auditing you just wouldnt ordinarily discover it because how often are you going to be willing to put in seven separate sessions trying to get the date of one gpm how often would you do this you jolly well wouldnt you know youd say well its amounting to auditing pc every once in while gets arc breaks this is mess im in tears half the time this is the whole thing is just sending straight up the wall and so on well relax because this is stable datum and this is stable datum that you can just put back of your left ear that isnt going to be cancelled by tomorrows bulletin because ive seen this happen now and ive seen it done i know its true you just keep chewing away at trying to date or locate or get the character of something or get the pattern of gpm you just keep the pc headed at it keep that tone arm moving and keep trying to find it and suddenly enough charge will have disappeared off the area so itll all go sssthung and you say there it is like stage set you wonder how in the name of god did anybody ever miss it as i say that is something you ordinarily wouldnt discover because you probably wouldnt give seven consecutive sessions to the just one lousy little subject of auditing like what is the pattern of this wildcat gpm and one minute youre running this youre trying to date it see and your dating is kind of going haywire but youre trying to get the pattern thats what you really want and the pc is down in the cellar his morale is just zero how in the name of common sense is he ever on gods green earth going to get the pattern for this gpm uhhhhh wildcat gpm my god the thing you tried out any other kind of pattern youve asked him about it several times and youve asked him about this and youve asked him about that and it just just uhhh just horrible well maybe the first one is maybe the first one is is to be spirit i think its here i think its goal i i think its goal maybe the first i dont know that there is goal in it you understand but there is certainly positive and negative items or something in it now the more you put the itsa line in with the meter the more you ask the meter for this data the less youre going to win and youve found that to be the case yeah so the pc just chews away and he says i think its spiritednever spirited all right now the wrong thing to do is to shake your head and say that didnt rocket read and so on just go on tell some more about the pattern dont keep him repeating anything and he says well i think the next two items on it are are undoubtaditably to be spirit and doubtaditably to be spirit thats what i think all right well go on go on give some more on the thing your tone arms moving but youre not getting rrs hes going to tumble to it suddenly hell say well hell this thing has nothing to do with spirits its to be drunk you just keep him chewing at it and youll see ta action ta action ta action and all of sudden hell come up with something well all of sudden he leans back if you dont cut his itsa line and chop him up all of sudden well the pattern of this thing is very simple its just plus and minus and then dichotomy see it just goes drunknot drunk sobernot sober i think then it it says to be drunk yeah yeah thats what it is itsdrunknot drunk sobernot soberto be drunk oh yes and then it fires the other way to then it fires with the items reversed to the left and right yes thats the way the thing goes and it goes it goes over here it goes you got got got drunk over here on your on your right now see so it goes now wait minute now wait minute the way this thing goes the way this thing goes is drunknever drunk and boy you see that meter all of sudden take off see getting this one rocket read its drunknever drunk sobernever sober to be drunk i got it now i got it now its sobernever sober drunknever drunk to be drunk you know i think this probably was the root of my alcoholism and you just keep him chewing at it rather than sitting there trying to ride him into hole now the hell of it is is you take anything as complex as the helatrobus implants it takes you longer to get the charge off without the pattern than with the pattern but the pc trying to understand this thing and trying to run this thing and so forth and trying to get grip on it sometimes will kill his own ta action if its too evaluated why the itsa line is being put in for him the itsa lines are being put in for him what is it now meter is very very didactic it reads at lower level of consciousness than the pc but remember its just little bit lower and you blow some charge and the pc will become conscious of what the meter becomes conscious on all meter does is become conscious of something before the pc becomes conscious of it it just reaches the pc it reaches him up just little bit further along the line and therefore gives you preview of coming attractions well now do you understand you could look at the graph you can look at graph of your itsa line whatsititsa see and you see that you can say whatsit and the pc can say itsa and youve got auditing happening ah but what if the pc says whatsit and the meter you use the meter to say itsa you want to see tone arm fold up youve reversed all this now now pcs will do this if you create meter dependency and you should always keep your meter back dont do anything what do you think is very good way although pc sometimes mildly arc breaks on it he very often says yeah but i want to know you say all right horse goat it was goat reads on goat is the safer statement to make is that right is it goat yeah its goat pc is demanding information well this means hes given up now when hes given up you can help him out of course well lets take look here lets take look at this whatsititsa line and supposing the pc you ask whatsit and then put the itsa in on the meter and then you ask whatsit and put the itsa in on the meter and then you ask whatsit and put the itsa in on the meter dont be surprised if your tone arm action ceases to exist i dont know you must be doing some kind of an audit on something but it doesnt have anything to do with the pc dont you see thats the way to get good and messed up you say all right whatsit and then well all right ill help you out here itsa i dont know what the auditors doing there saying whatsit itsa whatsit itsa whatsit itsa whatsit itsa whatsit itsa wheres the session see it isnt anyplace it isnt anyplace at all but your pc must not be pushed down into the depths of despair you say well what do you think the date is its nice way of dating the pc says uhhhhh daaaaoooo i just dont know ijust havent got clue date on the meter for while and youre starting to get near it do you got any idea of the date now oh yeah its soandso and soandso and soandso and you say all right and thats it thats quite common but the reverse can also be true you start dating you got any idea of what the date is and he says well thats soandso its soandso whats it soandso and soandso it might be more than billions but its less than trillions seems like it was just yesterday you know but it isnt really and so on and so on and so on and so its pretty unreal it all and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and well i just dont know my god i just dont know i just havent got clue oh well by all means now in r2h its very simple he says its 58 57 58 57 i dont know whether it was 58 or 57 you say well the meter flicks every time you say 58 all right good is 58 wrong date that doesnt read apparently 58 thats more desirable dont you see than having him quit but look at this trick of using meter well you say well what what do you think the date of this thing was well it might have been this it might have been that but on the other hand it was some tha it might have been this and it might have been that and it might have been something or other and i well bu i give up i dont know i dont know i just dont have clue you say all right well do an order of magnitude on this was it tens of years ago hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago tens of thousands of years ago hundreds of thousands of years ago was it millions of years ago tens of millions of years that reads tens of millions of years ago tens of millions of years ago millions of years ago millions of years agothat reads millions of years ago is the order of magnitude and so on have you got any idea what this date is now what are you doing youre doing different trick arent you the trick youre doing now is using the meter to jog the whatsit line see slippy huh audience mm then the pc will sit there and say millions of years ago lets see was it five million years ago six million they sometimes develop systems the picture comes in clearly on six but doesnt come in on five you know so they say five and half got clear picture so they say it must be five and half then they realize if they say five and quarter it turns on heat must be five and quarter five and third five and quarter five and third five and quarter five and quarter must be five and quarter million years ago does it read on the meter five and quarter million years ago well do you think it was see because if you said oh yes that reads on the meter you know see its the acknowledgment of what theyve just done but at the same time theyre still depending on the meter and you sometimes have them say rather satisfied well its five and quarter million years ago see theyre saying does it read on the meter does it five and quarter million years ago well do you think it is do you think thats the right date see thats way of snapping back your itsa line in see they tried to hand the itsa line to the meter do you think thats right date yeah yeah thats right date thats right date okay you say that reads see by doing it in reverse you see you get them certain and then say well you should have been certain about it all the time because it also reads on the meter see of course they have the feeling that youre sort of spy hanging over their shoulder anyhow because youve got the meter in front of you so theyre afraid to be right and the more evaluative auditors have been to them the more chopped they have beep in their auditing the less itsa line they have had in why the more queasy they are about being right so they will tend to invalidate themselves and yau can just pick up pcs any day of the week they just invalidate themselves like mad all the time all the time all the time invalidate themselves one of the ways they do this is to invalidate what theyve just said and ask you if it reads on the meter in order to be validated by the meter and the more an auditor can do this without being nasty slob about it see well im not going to tell you what it says on the meter you think i want to create meter dependence with you and so forth im afraid that wouldnt be very workable you see but if you can if you can use that meter to boost the whatsit line and coax the itsa line in why youll be very successful with the meter very adroit and only date when the guy just throws in the sponge it goes squash all over the auditors reports you see because you can get up to point of asking him for more than he can give and thats one of the ways of cutting an itsa line see every time the guy gives you something ask him for some more ill give you way ive done this see pc very proudly says i got picture here color picture got got color picture of some mountains hes very satisfied at this point hes communicated the whole lousy lot see and you say well what kind of mountains are they well theyre just mountains mountains any anybody in it any people on theres people in it we can just hear their tone come right on down so after the guy has said i cant find this date i dont know what this date is after guy has chucked in the sponge and you say oh come on give the date cut your throat you see because what youve done is stretch an itsa line beyond its ability to stretch what you need to do is plug in little bit more restimulation see so youve actually bled off all the restimulation that is there so you just use the meter to knock another block off the glacier and let the pc clean it up order of magnitude blablablowow blababababow blablowblowblow blablablablaw bla bowbowbow bow all right you ge coming any closer to what the date is now oh hell say yeah yeah you say you say the thing is is millions of years ago and its yeah yeah yeah its so on and so on and so on and there it is and so on its five five and quarter million years ago whats it say on the meter oh all right well is that right is that five and quarter million years ago is that okay well yeah thats okay whats it say on the meter you say well it says youre right or it isnt reading on the subject at the moment slippy dangerous awful dangerous territory to be haunting around very much but i want to know what it says on the meter well at the moment it doesnt say anything on the meter all right then it must be some other date the guy says all right now you dont ask him well what is that other date see say you want to do another order of magnitude that isnt necessary i think the thing actually is trillionsthree trilliontrilliontrillion not trillionstwo that must be what it is that must be what it is all right will you check it for see youre on the spot now youre on the spot its very very slippery little contest that you can run in this particular line its perfectly all right to tell the pc what meter is reading what his tone arm is doing that sort of thing hed be quite relaxed about this thing the moment the pc starts relying on the meter instead of looking at it himself whyyoure in trouble you get him in too much of thats relying dependency let him create that dependency and youve spoiled some of his case youve spoiled his sense of time and that sort of thing so its very nice point its very nice point and you have to solve that by being alert and the basic rule is is use your meter to get in the whatsit line and coax the itsa line and at last resorts such as howling arc break of course the only thing youve got left is your meter the pc isnt talking or thinking thats the last resort so now you do arc break assessments and that sort of thing that applies to sessions by the way doesnt apply to you giving an arc break assessment down oh peter landed with all four thuds down there in australia and and he got everything wheeling and dealing in hurry things were going in all directions quickly he had this congress laid out and he hes fast you know he picks this thing practically up off of his bulletin line you know off his desk and goes down to the congress and puts six auditors to work doing arc break assessments on every congress attendee he put them in booth outside so here were six auditors you know all during the congress going bangetybangetybangety bangetybangety doing arc break assessments you know and theyre just cleaning up arc breaks all over the place and everybodys saying hurrah wonderful marvelous you know hes industrious ill bet he didnt even get chance to read the bulletin himself hes quick anyway now it doesnt matter whether somebodys arc broke or not arc broke see you can give them an arc break assessment out of session or any place else or every friday in central organization or something like this and keep things wheeling and dealing but you can cut an itsa line to ribbons with arc break assessments man you can just cut them to ribbons swishswish slashslash well i dont know if ive got the right item here or not lets see oh well ill do an arc break assessment sounds incredible well i dont know i dont know if this is quite the right goal or not lets see this well right goal or not we might have bypassed something here it might be something all right ill do an arc break assessment cut your throat man thats putting in the itsa line with an arc break assessment dont do it an arc break assessment has its value after all else has failed and thats almost the same with the meter the meter needle has its greatest value when all else has failed arc break assessment has its greatest value when all else has failed because the most operating thing youve got anywhere around you actually is the pc you can take data from this pc you get surprising data from the pc pc will sit there and barketybarkety bangetybang he can give you more darn data just because pc says oh i dont know is i doesnt look right to theres something wrong here something wrong i dont thats reason for you to do thing i know you have consciences you want to get in there and earn your fee earn your keep pay for your own auditing its that sort of thing i know you have an idea that if you just get busy enough and you heave enough bricks through enough windows why everybody will pat you on the back for being so industrious well youre not ever patted on the back for being industrious youre only patted on the back for getting case advances see well great day then the pc says rrrr something wrong here someuhrmmmmmmmmmmmmm i dont care how long he goes mmmmmmmmmm let him go on and mmmmmmmmmm just as long as that ta moves thats all im interested in and he can mutter and fumble and stumble and bumble all he wants to as long as the ta moves im not asking precise data from this pc thats whats wrong with this pc this pc has lot of imprecise data very imprecise data lets take an arc break assessment also his confidence in his own bank is very very poor lets take an arc break assessment and youre going down the arc break assessment bark bark bark bark bark and the pc brightens up all of sudden and you youve got two choices here and one of them is wrong the choice is to go on and complete the arc break assessment thats wrong thats wrong every time the pc suddenly looked bright see he didnt even say he had anything to say oh you know youll see it actually sometimes flash on the meter while youre doing the assessment if youre not looking at the pc you think of something anything yeah yeah its actually the unknownness of the whole thing i didnt know anything about it i didnt know the guys name you see everybodys trying to tell his name was joe but in actual fact i didnt know his name and that that was what that arc break is was all about heh thats it and you didnt get chance to earn your keep man you know what youre supposed to do youre supposed to go down the whole list now if you say to the pc at this point well all right well now how do you feel about that arc break the meter goes tick you say is there something else about that that you havent told yet oh well yeah maybe you didnt get that see the guy the guy i didnt know his name but they said his name was joe and i had never found out what his name really was they just said it was joe you understand they just said it was joe and i dont know that his name was joe see and i never did find out the guys name i dont know what his name is and thats thats what the arc break assessment is all the time they were trying to put this this was i guess its false datum and you say all right good how do you feel about that arc break assessment clear as bell see he thought hed interrupted you and he didnt quite get it across to you and he had various explanations dont you see why maybe he didnt have his itsa line in on you because he had distracted you and kept you you see maybe from assessing and earning your keep you know pcs have lots of weird reasons like this but you shouldnt automatically assume i know because i myself have had this happen in session while i was auditing and its very embarrassing you say does that clear it all up clang see you say all right is it all right if i go on with the remainder of the assessment the pc glummer glummer needle getting dirtier dirtier dirtier look it would be better to leave the charge on it than it would be to arc break the pc about it do you follow that that applies also to gpms you can sometimes arc break the pc like mad on some wildcat gpm just because you were trying to be precise all the time and the pc is arguing with you i myself ran into an arc break as pc one time on the subject of i had to listen i saw to listen come out of the floorboards of one of these gpm rooms i saw it come out i couldnt understand why id seen these words come out because i ordinarily dont do that in session see so i said i just saw to listen come out of the middle of the floorboard we must have some kind of goal in here like that and the and the auditor looked at the meter and said it didnt rr that frankly was the end of that facsimile it was being held there by two frayed hairs anyway very highly charged area preceded by lord knows how many gpms the reason i got to the place nobody will ever find out but thats all it took see and the gpm folded up denial of the pcs perception of the gpm actually it took it little bit longer than that to fold up it took another slight blunder immediately afterwards but that was the reason it folded up see it was just pc all of sudden originated and said the auditor knows hes trying to run the goal let us say to catch or something you see and the pc says hey you know coming right out of the floorboards here is these words to listen and never saw anything like this before oh that doesnt rocket read well the pc didnt give damn whether it rocket read or not you get that he didnt care he didnt care for minute whether this rocket read or not very often in putting together gpm pc will be going and giving you the items bang bang bang bang bang bang giving you the items repeating them few times and all of sudden will get to the next pair get to the next pair and the next pair dinning his ears in and the auditor says go back and clean up the old pair what do you do in case like this its very interesting because if you leave partially charged items on the thing the pc is going to arc break and if you dont take the pcs next items hes going to arc break what do you do well youre an auditor thats one of the perils of existence there is solution you can hastily write them down so he wont forget them you can say ive got note of those and go on and get your items clean thats just one solution did you ever think of the solution of going through gpm and then through it again thats totally possible too but also dangerous because all sorts of weird things are liable to happen dont you see so the contest of how you get gpm discharged without cutting the itsa line is one of the more interesting things that an auditor can do and it takes very very skilled auditing in order to accomplish this fact and the variations of it are so many that you couldnt possibly cover all possible cases your job is to get the gpm discharged and keep the pc in an enthusiastic state of mind so he will discharge the gpm because the pc in lowered state of mind cant discharge the gpm now your whatsit your whatsit line uniformly completely totally thoroughly means just that whats it its called whatsit because those exact words raise the tone arm and the itsa line is called itsa because those exact words lower the ta or in lowta case i think reverse it although i myself havent seen this as an auditor yet too new now if that is the case then we would say that the solution of mystery was the resolution of case and the restoration of ta action and as i told you little earlier your cessation of ta action is your heaviest auditing problem ta isnt moving thats the case that drives you around the bend case will also drive you around the bend in numerous other ways but when the ta stops moving youve got headach thats worry right now right now thats worry so id like to give you clue as to why this is whatever else you say about gpms or time or anything else this is certainly true that the pc is stuck on whatsit for which he has itsa eolementary my dear watson doctor watson now by the way that was his gag i took it from him now did you ever think of the possibility that the pc might have asked his own whatsit now ill give you an exact example they do this all the time its not once in while now this pc pc sitting there gives you the itsa itsa itsa in the process of giving you the itsa itsa itsa gets in two whatsits on himself all right now they got clear as bell everything was fine and you went just little bit further and all of sudden the pc felt foggy the pc felt foggy because of the two whatsits these are two new auditing questions if you please but you didnt ask them but the pc asked them and now youve got some charge in restimulation thats not been itsad and so the pc feels foggy youll sometimes get this toward the end of session you were doing fine and you asked one question too many and then you cant get the ta down and you dont know what happens well ordinarily it stems immediately back to question the pc asked themselves now the most common cause of ta going up in break is the pc asked themselves whatsit audience mmmm that break gives them short period of time without the auditing question in which they can demand of themselves whatsit now you of course because theyve forgotten the whatsit they never give the itsa and youve got high ta and you sometimes will struggle around endlessly and fruitlessly and forever trying to get this ta to do anything put in your since mid ruds and every other confounded thing to get it to come down the one thing that you seldom ask for is what whatsit did they ask of themselves could be put in other numerous ways did you speculate about anything in the break now the funny part of it is is asising whatsits does not give you auditing ive tested this out thats interesting isnt it you dont asis whatsits whatsit you cannot runa case on solid mystery in other words it sounds impossible but if you just get the idea of questioning things thank you get the idea of questioning things thank you you would just drive the tone arm up and it wouldnt come down why because the bank is composed of cure to the problem or as reg was saying few minutes ago the puzzle see and the reason the puzzle is hung up is because theres something in it which was cure cures brought about problems and to asis problems you have to pick up the itsas that itsa was always cure to some problem which is now holding it in place so it takes both the whatsit and the itsa to get the stable datum and the confusion off the whatsit is the confusion the itsa is the stable datum so you announce the confusion and the pc gives you the stable datum and of course you get restoration of balance you get the thing blowing off actually in tiny vignette this is the mechanism of gpm and its just the common questions that you use you see you would have to ask somebody what have you been puzzled about what was the answer to it thats little bit blunt what answers might there have been to it twoway comm is something that drives some auditors around the bend they dont realize that twoway comm maybe wont run an engram but it will blow off all the locks so you could say when did you first become aware of this problem that first is bad thing to use but it nevertheless keeps somebody diving at it give time you became aware of this problem that starts twoway comm cycle dont you see pc says i have big present time problem about something or another see big present time problem all right well what solutions have you thought of have you ever had similar problems in the past how do people ordinarily solve such problem when did you first become aware of need to resolve this problem now youre drifting off back into the whatsit dont you see but you can get the itsas of almost anything i think its interesting isnt it therefore auditing questions to be valid must balance between announcing the puzzle and getting the cure but if you have him inventing cures then the puzzle will get more puzzling so you the only way you really produce gain gain in auditing the only way you ever really produce gain in auditing is having him become aware of the problems and the solutions which he has had for those problems and then you get tone arm action thats theoretical dissertation but its also quite empirical takes the whatsit and it takes the itsa and if you never let the pc reach any of his own itsas of course you dont get ta action there are many ramifications to this there are different types of processes produce different potentials of ta action theres lot you can go into about this it will continue to be worry but im giving you the exact fundamentals of what causes it to cease when tone arm stops okay audience mm were way over time thank you very much end of lecture _
