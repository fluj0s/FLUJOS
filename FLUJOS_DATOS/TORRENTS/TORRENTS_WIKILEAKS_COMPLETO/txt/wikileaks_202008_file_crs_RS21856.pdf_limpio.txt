background the political situation in serbia has been notable for high volatility at least since the end of the kosovo war in mid1999 in october 2000 wartime president slobodan milosevic was forced from power by prode mocracy forces including opposition parties and grassroots civic groups these forces mostly encompassed in the broadbased democratic opposition in serbia dos co alition came into office and launched new reforms but progress stalled in part because of interparty disagreements the rivalry between thenyugoslav president vojislav kostunica and his party the democratic party of serbia dss and thenserbian prime minister zoran djindjic of the democratic party ds became particularly divisive the tiny republic of montenegro continued to press for independence from serbia but acquiesced in 2002 to an eubrokered arrangement to realign the old federal republic of yugoslav ia into loose state union of serbia and montenegro which came into force in februa ry 2003 in march of that year serbian prime minister zoran djind jic was assassi nated allegedly by or ganized criminal groups threatened by djindjics reform policies power was smoothly transferred to successor dsled government but early parliamentary electi ons held in december produced strong results for serbias nationalist parties with the extremist radical party winning the

although not enough to form government after months of negotiations kostunica became prime minister of dssled minority coalition without the radical party in march 2004 while the ds opted to go into opposition milosevics socialis t party supports the kostunica government in parliament in part because of ongoing political instab ility serbia has lagged in some aspects of reform and in its efforts to integrate with the international community and overcome serbias troubled recent history at the same time developmen ts in serbia and montenegro can strongly influence regional stability and affect broader regional issues such as the unresolved conflict in kosovo the status of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty and eu enlargement plans in the western balkan region for these reasons the mid2004 serbian presidential election attracted great deal of attention within serbia nd without while the actual powers of the republican presidency are not very extensive the election outcome was expected to loom large in serbian national politics and influence serbias relations with the international community serbian presidency the limited powers of the serbian presidency derive from the serbia and montenegro constitutional charter that came into force in february 20031 and the serbian republic constitution wh ich is currently under revisi on the serbian president is directly elected and has certain appoi ntive and policyrelate d powers at both the republic and union levels tably the two republic presidents serve on the supreme defense council along with the union presiden t however most governing power lies with the republiclevel prime minister and cabinet moreover the state union remains single international entity nd retains among its few powers the conduct of international relations therefore the serbian presiden t representing constituent republic does not act as sovereign head of state in an international context the last person to hold the post of president of serbia on fulltime basis was milan milutinovic who is currently in custody at the hague and charged with war crimes relating to his decisionmaking author ity during the 1999 kosovo conflict after milutinovics term expired at the end of 2002 serbia held three direct presidential elections prior to 2004 in october and d ecember 2002 and in november 2003 each time the results were invalidated due to low voter turnout less than 502 in the 2003 vote serbian radical party ca ndidate tomislav nikolic came in first with about 46 of the vote some parties boycotted that

representative of the government than either prime minister kostunica or deputy pr ime minister labus four th prominent candidate was bogoljub karic an independent businessman and media mogul the inclusion of many additional candidate s was thought by some to encourage greater turnout in the first round although others feared that the participa tion of many nonserious candidates could feed voter apathy most preelection opinion polls showed kolic leading with about 30 or higher levels of support in many polls tadic cam in second with about 20 or higher with marsicanin ranking third depending on the poll however large share of persons polled said they were undecided the level of tur nout was considered to be another key factor in the final outcome3 notably absent from the 2004

of the election campaign it was apparent that the democratic bloc would remain fragmented by virtue of its inability to back single candidate before the vote government leader s argued that it would have been impossible to support tadic since his mocratic party was in the opposition and they therefore put forward marsicanin as the coalition candidate the bigger question that was left open to speculation was whether all prodemocracy parties would unite behind nonnationalist candidate in the second round if the race came down to one of them against the radicals nikolic prior to the first round however such cooperation at least between the dss and ds appeared questionable officials from both parties exchanged sharp recriminations on range of issues prominently feat ured dispute involve d the circumstances surrounding the 2003 djindjic assassination the ensuing enforcement actions of the successor ds government and the alleged complicity of both parties in the murder some media commentary observed that the bitter campaign disputes could negatively affect voter turnout among supporters of moderate candidates nd thereby work to boost the proportional strength of the extremists

concerns and voter discontent with social and economic conditions he campaigned on assura nces that his victory would not lead to serbias isolati on however eu officials warned that serbia under radical party leadership could not count on eu support eu members had already expressed concerns about political developments in serbia following the december parliamentary vote4 the outburst in midmarch 2004 of deadly ethnicallymotivated attacks against serb communities in kosovo returned the volatile and unresolved issue of kosovo to the serbian political scene5 in response the kostunica g overnment put forward detailed plan to create autonomous units for kos ovo serb residents as part of larger decentralization effort for the kosovo provin ce while the plan itself has received mixed initial reactions abroad some observers believe that th serbian government has benefitted politically from its pr ompt and internationally engaged response to the recent violence moreover swift serbian govern mental and parliament ary approval of the decentralization plan for kosovo helped to remove the hotbutton issue of kosovo as central theme and potential rallying point for nationalist forces in the presidential campaign in early may the serbian political s cene was further shaken by the sudden appearance and voluntary surrender in belgra of milorad legija lukovic the prime suspect

off some of nikolics poten tial supporters marsicanin the governments candidate came in disa ppointing fourth with 1330 voter turnout in the first round was 4775 in the immediate aftermath of the first r ound there was widespread speculation that in response to marsicanins poor showing prime minister kostunica might resign and thereby bring down the government and tri gger early parliamentary elections after kostunica issued formal denial to these ru mors the next question was whether he would back tadic for the second round the three dss coalition partners g17 plus serbian renewal

ound thirdplace candidate karic also backed tadic however it remained to be seen to what extent the voter base of these parties would abide by the endorsements of their party leaders or even participate in the process therefore another preoccupation for the refo rmist parties before the second round was to counter apathy and encourage greater voter participation am ong their supporters in the second round on june 27 tadic feated nikolic by vote of 5353 to 4510 among the motivating factors favor ing tadic according to some media analyses may have been concerns about th consequences of nikolic victory and perception among voters that ta dic was better suited to lead the country out of isolation promote international support for serbia and improve economic prospects nikolic conceded defeat but upheld his call for early parliamentary electi ons with the apparent expectation of another strong radical party result with the backing of much broader base than the traditional democratic

obligations with regard to the war crimes tribunal the situation in kosovo and serbias efforts to join natos partnership for peace program at the least it appears that the worst case scenario for bilateral usserbian relations has been averted many observers feared that multiple negative ramifications would result from presidential victory for nikolic and the radical party nikolic victory would have most likely immediately brought down the kostunica government and ushered in more unstable political environment and further fragmentation of the democratic bloc the ascendance of th radical party would likely have reduced prospects for constructive in ternational dialogue on kos ovo led to more problematic serbian relations with monten egro and added additional stra ins in relations with the international community including further isolation and limits on financial assistance nevertheless it may be too early to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of the tadic victory until the overall political situation in serbia becomes clearer as noted tadics position as currently mandated ca rries few governing powers while the presidential vote victory has boosted the democr atic party tadic s stated that it will neither join the kostunica coalition government nor seek its fall where the kostunica government stands as result of the vote what the relationship will be between the prime minister and president and how cohabitation might work remain open questions the prospect of early general elections will likely overshadow most other issues on the policy agenda in the near term at the same time serbias leaders still need to meet the conditions of the international community especially on cooperation with the war crimes tribunal fo r the country to move forward on closer ties with and assistance from the united states and other western nations and institutions pursuing further reforms will likely again require the consolidat ed support of serbias democratic forces
