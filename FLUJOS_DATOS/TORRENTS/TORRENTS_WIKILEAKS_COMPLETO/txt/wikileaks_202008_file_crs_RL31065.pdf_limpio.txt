numerous programs to support management of state and private forests these programs are under the jurisdiction of the agriculture committees and are often examined in the periodic legislation to reauthorize agricultural programs commonly known as farm bills the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 included forestry title with numerous provisions and forestry activities were included in several other titles as well congress might oversee the implementation as well as the funding of these programs forestryspecific assistance programs as opposed to agriculture conservation programs that include forestry activities are all administered by the usda forest service fs with permanent authorization of funding as needed some prog rams provide technical assistanceinformation advice and aid on specific projects other programs provide financial assistance typically through grants with or without matching contributions from recipients or costsharing with varying levels of contributions from recipients many programs provide both most of the programs provide assistance to the states the state agencies can use the assistance on state forestlands or to assist local governments or private landowners how the states use the funds is largely at the discretion of the states within the authorizations of each program however the 2008 farm bill added national priorities for state assistance and statewide assessments and strategies to focus state efforts on achieving the national priorities funds are appropriated for planning and implementing forestry and related land management practicessite preparation for reforestation tree planting thinning pruning fertilizing prescribed burning restoring watersheds improving wildlife habitats and other activities other programs provide support for protecting forestlands from wildfires insects and diseases and from clearing forests for nonforest uses such as growing crops or building houses two programs are designed specifically to assist landowners to recover or restore forests following catastrophic events such as wildfires additional programs provide economic assistance for communities in or near federal forests whose economies have traditionally relied on forests and forest resources in addition international forestry is often included as forestry assistance program because it provides technical forestry help and because it has often been funded out of fs appropriations for forestry assistance programs finally states are authorized to request consolidated payments for flexibility in program administration and several coordinating or advisory groups exist to coordinate programs or for specific purposes under one or more programs funding for the forest management assistance programsforest stewardship and urban and community forestryhave fluctuated over the past five years forest protection programsforest health for insect and disease identification and control fire assistance and forest legacy for

management on state and private forestlands primarily administered by the forest service fs in the us department of agriculture usda the house and senate agriculture committees often examine these programs in the periodic legislation to reauthorize agriculture programs commonly known as farm bills the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 contained forestry title as did three of the previous four farm bills and addressed forests and forestry practices in several other titles 1 congress provides annual appropriations for these programs and may oversee their implementation this report describes the current

efforts began with the creation of the usda division of forestry in 1881 to complement forestry research begun with funding in 1876 forestry assistance and research programs grew slowly and in 1901 the division was upgraded to the usda bureau of forestry in 1905 the usda bureau merged with the interior departments division of forestry which administered the forest reserves later renamed national forests and became the usdafs forestry assistance the primary mission of the state and private forestry spf branch together with forestry research and management of the national forest system comprise the three primary fs missions authority for the forestry assistance programs was reestablished and coordinated in the clarke mcnary act of 1924 ch 348 43 stat 653 this law guided these programs for more than half century until it was revised in the cooperative forestry assistance act of 1978 cfaa pl 95 313 16 usc 2101 et seq the cfaa has been amended several times including in the four most recent farm bills the food agriculture conservation and trade act of 1990the 1990 farm bill pl 101624added and rewrote several of the cfaa sections the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996the 1996 farm bill pl 104127made few additions and modifications to the cfaa as amended the farm security and rural investment act of 2002the 2002 farm bill pl 107171replaced two cfaa provisions as amended with new provision and create d another new program finally the food conservation and energy act of 2008the 2008 farm bill pl 110246established national priorities and process for states to address them while adding and modifying other programs there are currently more than dozen forestry assistance programs as shown in table 1 the programs are administered by the fs with

wildfire insects diseases and for preventing conversion of forests to nonforest uses eg agriculture residences table 2 shows these as forest protection programs forest health and community fire protection activities can be applied on private lands with the cooperation of the landowner most other forest protection programs provide financial andor technical assistance to government or quasi government entitiesstates local governments communities volunteer fire departments indian tribes the new community forestry and open spa ce conservation program also allows grants to nonprofit organizations two programs provide funding directly to private landowners in response to disasters the emergency reforestation program was created in 1990 and has not been funded since 1993 the emergency forest restoration program was created in the 2008 farm bill as an amendment to an existing agricultural conservation program to assist landowners in recovering from natural disasters two other programs provide assistance to communities whose economic wellbeing has traditionally depended on federal forests these are shown as economic assistance programs in table 2 in addition international forestry has been included because it provides technical assistance to other nations on forestry matters and b it has often been funded out of fsspf appropriations table 2 also shows the type of assistance available under each program some programs provide only technical assistance which can range from relevant existing information to advice and aid on specific projects other programs provide financial assistance typically these programs are grants with or without contributions from recipi ents or costsharing with varying levels of matching contributions from recipients though two programs have other financial provisions 1 forest health protection funds fs activities to survey and to control insects or diseases on state or private lands with the consent and cooperation of the landowner and 2 forest legacy includes federal purchase of lands or easements as well as grants to states many programs include both technical and financial assistance

environmental protection on nonfederal forest lands the secr etary of agriculture acting through the fs6 is authorized to encourage the longterm stewardship of nonindustrial private forest lands these lands are defined as lands with existing tree cover or suitable for growing trees and owned by any private individual group associati on corporation indian tribe or other private legal entity7 forest stewardship is not defined directly in the statute or indirectly by reference to any listing of forest stewardship practices or standards section 8001 of the 2008 farm bill added set of national priorities for forest stewardship of private forest conservation through federal support for state assistance national priorities including for allocating funding are conserving and managing working forests for multiple values and uses protecting forests from threats including catastrophic wildfires hurricanes tornados windstorms snow or ice storms flooding drought invasive species insect or disease outbreak or development and restoring appropriate forest types in response to such threats and enhancing public benefits from private forests including air and water quality soil conservation

g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 the program provides technical assistance to private landowners to help them evaluate alternative actions including managing and enhancing the productivity of timber fish and wildlife habitat water quality wetlands recreational resources and aesthetic values investing in practices to protect maintain and enhance resources ensuring that afforestation reforestation improvement of poorly stocked stands timber stand improvement practices to improve seedling growth and survival and growth enhancement practices occur where needed to enhance and sustain

the secretary of agriculture even though the laws typically specify action by the secretary 7 typically nonindustrial private forest lands exclude forest lands owned by companies engaged in manufacturing wood products but the definition for the forest stewardship program in 16 usc 2103ac apparently allows the program to be available for timber industry lands as well

for planning and implementing forest management practices eg tree planting site preparation for reforestation thinning pruning fertilizing prescribed burning and other activities and sometimes practices to enhance other resources eg restoring watersheds improving wildlife habitat and other activities some programs have been combined through the appropriations process additional programs provide financial and technical support for protecting nonfederal forests from wildfire insects diseases and clearing for nonforest uses these programs cover many continuing threats to forests although global climate change could exacerbate the effects of these threats furthermore for the forest health program more funds are used to protect federal lands than cooperative lands forest legacy can help prevent forest clearing the community fire protection program can assist communities prepare for wildfires while the two emergency programs can help landowners restore forests after the
