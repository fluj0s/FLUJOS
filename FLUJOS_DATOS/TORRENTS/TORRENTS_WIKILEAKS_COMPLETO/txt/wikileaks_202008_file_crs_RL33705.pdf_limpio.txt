congress summary during the past two decades while us oil imports and consumption have steadily risen oil spill incidents and the volume of oil spilled have not followed similar course in general the annual number and volume of oil spills have shown declines in some cases dramatic declines the 1989 exxon valdez spill in alaskan waters played large role in stimulating actions that contributed to this trend particularly the decrease in the annual spill volumes the exxon valdez spill highlighted the need for stronger legisla tion inflamed public sentiment and spurred congress to enact comprehensive oil spill legislation resulting in the oil pollution act of 1990 pl 101380 this law expande d and clarified the authority of the federal government and created new oil spill prevention and preparedness requirements moreover the 1990 legisla tion strengthened existing liability provisions providing greater deterrent against spills after 1990 spill volume from oil tankers the vessels that carry and have spilled the most oil decreased significantly considering that us oil consumption and oil imports have steadily increased the trend of declining spill incidents and volume in past years is noteworthy yet recent annual data indicate that the overa ll decline of annual spill events may have stopped although energy information admin istration projections indicate that oil imports are expected to decline in coming years the united states is projected to continue importing more than 50 of th oil it consumes the threat of oil spills raises the question of whether us offici als have the necessary resources at hand to respond to major spill there is some c oncern that the favorable us spill record has resulted in loss of experienced pers onnel capable of responding quickly and effectively to major oil spill moreover the level of funding required to respond to such spill particularly its aftermat h may be currently inadequate according to us coast guard reports recent oil spills into san francisco bay november 2007 and the mississippi river july 2008 have genera ted further interest and debate concerning oil spill policy issues such as oil spill response and prevention oil spill is entirely benign even relatively minor spill depending on the timing and location can cause significant rm to individual organisms and entire populations marine mammals birds botto mdwelling and intertidal species and organisms in early developmental stages eggs or larvae are especially vulnerable to nearby spill however the effects of oil spills can vary greatly oil

united states supplying the nation with approximately 40 of its energy need s its use is widespread providing fuel for the transportation industr ial and residential sector s vast quantities of oil continuously enter the country via vessel or pipeline and are then transported to destinations throughout the nation w ith such widespread use and nonstop movement it is inevitable that some number of spills will occur one continuing policy issue is whether the nation has the necessary resources and personnel in place to respond to major spill several major us oil spills have had lasting repercussions that transcended the local environmental and economic effects the most notable example is the 1989 exxon valdez spill which released approximately 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound alaska the exxon valdez spill the largest and most expensive oil spill in us waters to date1 produced extensive consequences beyond alaska according to the na tional academies of science the exxon valdez disaster caused fundamental changes in th way the us public thought about oil the oil industry and the transport of petr oleum products by tanke rs big oil was suddenly seen as necessary evil so mething to be fear ed and mistrusted2 this report focuses on oil spills3 in us coastal waters4 the first section highlights background issues including oil spill statistics and potential environmental impacts the second section discusses the legal framework that governs oil spill prevention and response the third section examines the threat

these sta ndards and the us law are discussed later in this report 6 exxon has so far paid approximately 3 billion for the sp ill 2 b illion for cleanup activities and 900 million in civil settlement for natural resource damages in june 2006 parties filed for an additional 92 million for damages per reopener provision in the civil settlement on june 25 2008 the supreme court ruled on punitive

source prepared by crs with data from the united states coast guard uscg oil spill compendium available at httpwwwuscgm ilhqgcpcomrelfactfileindexhtm the decline of spill incidents is likely related at least in part to international oil pollution standards that went into ffect in 1983 these new standards were implemented in the united states by the act to prevent pollution from ships5 the substantial drop in the annual spill volume is most attributable to the decline in volume spilled by oil tankers and barges the vessels that transport oil and have historically spilled the most oil as shown in figure 2 the volume of oil spilled from vessels in us waters in the 1990s differed dramatically from the volume spilled in the 1980s the exxon valdez spill of 1989 and the resulting oil pollution act of 1990 opa played key roles in th subsequent spill volume reduction the 1990 act discussed below ma comprehensive changes to us oil pollution law by expanding federal response authority nd increasing spill liability the high costs associated with the exxon valdez spill6 and the threat of broad liability imposed by opa in some scenarios unlimited liability have likely been the central

aquatic environments oil spill is entirely benig n depending on timing and locati on even relatively minor spill can cause significant harm to individual organisms and entire populations9 oil spills can cause impacts over range of time scales from days to years or even decades for certain spills impacts are typically divided into acute shortterm and chronic longterm effects both types are part of

administration noaa personnel 2008 12 nrc report p 120 13 nrc report p 121 14 nrc report p 134acute impacts depending on the toxicity and concentration of the spill acute exposure to oil spills can kill various organisms and cause the following debilitating but not nece ssarily lethal effects10 reduced reproduction altered development impaired feeding mechanisms and decreased defense from disease birds marine mammals bottomdwelling and intertidal species and organisms in their developmental stages eg fish eggs and larvae are particularly vulnerable to oil spills11 in addition to the impacts to individual organisms oil spills can lead to disruption of the structure and function of the ecosystem certain habitats such as coral reefs mangrove swamps and salt marshes are especially vulnerable because the physical structure of the bitats depends upon living organisms these potential acute effects to indivi dual organisms and marine ecosystems have been unambiguously tablished by laboratory st udies and wellstudied spills such as the exxon valdez 12 chronic impacts longterm chronic exposure typically occurs from continuous oil releases leaking pipelin offshore production discharges and non point sources eg urban runoff althoug h spills are normally associated with acute impacts some oil spills have also demonstrated chronic exposure and effects13 there is increasing evidence that chronic lowlevel exposures to oil contaminants can significantly affect the survival and reproductive success of marine birds and mammals14 however because of the complexity of factors including longer time period and presence of other pollutants determining the precise effects on species and ecosystems due to chronic oil exposure in particular locale is difficult for scientists as result studies involving ch ronic effects are often met with debate and some controversy ecosystem recovery interested parties may ve differing opinions at to what constitutes ecosystem recovery at one end of the spectrum local groups may demand that an ecosystem be returned to prespill conditions noaa regulations 15 cfr section 99030 state that recovery means the return of injured natural resources and services to baseline in ot her words return to conditions as they would have been had the spill not occurred baseline conditions may not equate withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33705crs6 15 the average cleanup cost is three times higher in the united states than in europe based on 1997 data and excluding the exxon valdez costs see etkin dagmar estimating cleanup costs for oil spills paper presented at the 1999 international oil spill conference 1999 citing data from the oil spill intelligence report international oil spill databaseprespill conditions multiple variables affect local speci and ecosystem services for example one species at spill site could have been on the decline at the time of an incident because of changing water temperatures for example these types of trends are considered when trustees evalua restoration efforts restoration leaves room for sitespecific interpre tation which in the case of the exxon valdez spill and cleanup continues to generate considerable argument economic costs of oil spills the economic costs that can result from an oil spill can be broken into three categories cleanup expenses natural re source damages and the various economic losses incurred by the affected community or individuals cleanup costs the cleanup costs of an oil spill can vary greatly and are influenced by mix of factors locati on characteristics oil type and oil volume location is generally considered the mo st important factor because it involves multiple variables areas with less water movement such as marshlands will generally cost more to clean up than open water tourist destinations or sensitive habitats such as coral reefs will likely re quire more stringent cleanup standards thus increasing the costs the political and social culture at the spill site plays part as well spill in highprofile ar ea eg the november 7 2007 spill 53000 gallons from container ship into th san francisco bay will likely receive special attention major oil spills especia lly ones that affect shoreline ecosystems are often met with extensive media coverage placing pressure on parties to take action coupled with this pressure author ities federal or state at these locations may require extensive oil spill response re quirements which can influence cleanup cost the united states likely meets this description because its average cleanup cost per barrel of oil spilled is considerably higher than in other parts of the world15 the more persistent and viscous oil types such as heavy crude oil and intermediates known as bunker fuels are mo re expensive to clean up gasoline and other lighter refined products may re quire only minimal cleanup action these materials will evaporate or disperse relatively quickly leaving only small volume of petroleum product av ailable for recovery compared with other factors spill volume is less important major spill away from shore will likely cost considerably less than minor spill in sensitive location certainly the amount of oil spilled affect s cleanup costs because all things being equal larger spill will require larg er and more expensive cleanup effort however the relationship between clea nup costs and spill volume is not linearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33705crs7 16 this is primarily due to the fact that spill of any size eg in sensitive area will require that equipment and response experts be sent to the scene see etkin dagmar estimating cleanup costs for oil spills pa per presented at the 1999 international oil spill conference 1999 p 5 17 for more information see noaas damage

the continuedcleaning up smaller spill is likely to cost more than larger spill on pergallon basis16 natural resources damages this category of costs relates to the environmental impacts caused by an oil spill pursuant to opa the party responsible for an oil spill is liable for any loss of natural resources eg fish animals plants and their habitats and the services provi ded by the resource eg drinking water recreation when spill occurs natural resource trustees c onduct natural resource damage assessment to determine the extent of the harm trustees may include representatives from tribal governments as well as official s from state agencies designated by the relevant governor and federal agencies designated by the president such as noaa17 the oil pollution act opa of 1990 states that the measure of natural resource damages includes the cost of restoring rehabilitating replacing or acquiring the equivalent of the dama ged natural resources the diminution in value of those natural resources pending restoration and the reasonable cost of assessing those damages18 pursuant to opa noaa developed regula tions pertaining to natural resource damage assessments in 199619 natural resource damage s may include both losses of direct use and passive us direct use value may rive from recreational eg boating commercial eg fishing or cultura l or historical uses of the resource in

expenses or damages to natural resources an oil spill can disrupt business activity near the spill particularly businesses that count on the reputation of the local environment for example th local tourist industry may be affected in some cases wellpublicized oil spill can weaken th tourist industry near the spill site regardless of the actual threat to human health created by the spill local infrastructure and services can be disrupted by an oil spill port and harbor operations may be interrupted altering the flow of trade goods power plants that use cooling water systems may need to temporarily cease operations for example the salem nuclear plant the s econd largest nuclear plant in the united states was forced to halt activity due to substantial oil spill more than 250000 gallons in the delaware river in november 2004 unlike natural resource damage claims which are brought by the appropriate natural resource trustees the costs described in this section would be submitted as claims by the thirdparties suffering the specific loss oil spill governance when the exxon valdez ran aground in march 1989 th ere were multiple federal statutes state st atutes and international conventions that dealt with oil discharges the governing framework for oil spills in the united states remains combination of federal state and international authorities within this framework several federal agencies have the authority to implement oil spill regulations the framework and primary federal funding pro cess the oil spill liability tr ust fund used to respond to oil

valdez spill section 311 of the cwa established requirements for oil spill reporting response and liability the act also created fund 311 fund maintained by federal appropriations that could be used for cleanup and natural resource restoration deepwater port act 197424 this statute addressed oil spills and liability issues at deepwater oil ports the act also set up the deepwater port fund to provide for prompt cleanup and compensate damages above liability limits th fund was financed by per gallon tax on oil transfe rred at deepwater port transalaska pipeline au thorization act 197325 this act covered oil spills and liability relating to the transalaska pipeline system taps although the pipeline is constructed over land spills from it could reach coastal waters via inland rivers the act created trust fund financed through lessee fee that could be used to respond to spills and damages from the pipeline outer continental shelf lands act amendments 197826 this act established an

the above legal collection as an ineffective patchwork arguably each law had perceived shortcomings discussed below in the context of post exxon valdez legislation and none provided comprehens ive oil spill coverage for more than 15 years prior to the exxon valdez incident congress made attempts to enact unified oil pollution law several contentious issues produced deadlocks hindering the passage of legisla tion one of the central points of debate state preemption dealt with whether federal oil spill law should limit states ability to impose stricter requirements pa rticularly unlimited liab ility ot her liability questions also generated bate for example if an oil spill occurred should the owner of the cargo ie oil be held liable as was the sh ip owneroperator another point of contention was whether oilcarry ing vessels should be required to have double hulls although proponents argued that second hull would help prevent oil spills the shipping industry raised concer n that implementing such mandate would disrupt oil transportation nd potentially affect the nati onal economy final issue involved the interaction between domestic legislation federal and state and international measures some were concerned that if the united states became party to certain international agreem ents under consideration in the 1980s30 the international standards woul d preempt federal and stat laws especially those establishing liability limits proponents argued that these concerns were overstated and stressed that joining the international agreements was especially important for the united states because of the international nature of oil transportation and associated pollution following the 1989 exxon valdez spill members faced great pressure to overcome the disputes discussed above31 the spill highlighted the inadequacies of the existing coverage and generated public outrage the end result was the oil pollution act of 1990 opa32 the first comprehensive law to specifically address oil pollution to waterways and coastlines of the united states oil pollution act of 1990 with the enactment of opa on august 18 1990 congress consolidated the existing federa l oil spill laws under one program the 1990 law expanded the existing liability provi sions within the cwa and created new freestanding requirements regarding oil spill prevention and response

government termines the level of cl eanup required although the federal government must consul t with designated trustees of natural resources and the governor of the state affected by the spill the

comparable risk from an oil spill moreover the international standards for oil spill prevention43 apply to tanker and nontanker vessels alike thus the 2004 am endment brought the us law more in line with international provisions doublehull design for vessels the issue of double hulls received considerable debate for many years prior to opa and it was one of the stumbling blocks for unified oil spill legislati on proponents maintained that doublehull construction provides extra protec tion if vessel becomes damaged44 however opponents argued that doublehulled vesse l might cause stability problems if an accident occurred thus negating the benefits45 stakeholders also highlighted the impacts that doublehull requirement would entail for the shipping industry eg cost and time of retrofitting ship availability46 the opa requirements for double hulls reflected some of these concerns the act required new vessels carrying oil and operating in us waters to have double hulls47

central policy debate how should policymakers allocate the costs associated with major accidental oil spill what share of costs should be borne by the responsible party eg oil vessel owneroperators the oil industry and the general treasury background prior to two separate actions by the 109th congress the trust fund was particularly vulnera ble in 2005 congress reinstated the 5centperbarrel tax on oil thus providing dedicated source of revenue for the trust fund86 in 2006 congress raised the vessel lia bility limits thus requiring the responsible party to pay greater proportion of the oil spill costs87 before these changes fund managers projected the fund would be completely depleted by fy200988 with the 2005 legislation in effect the most recent pr ojection june 2007 indicates that the fund will reach 1 billion by fy2008 figure 3 however this projection does not account for possible claims arising from recent spills including the 2007 spill into san francisco bay the 2008 spill

occur the vesse l liability under the new limits would be capped at either 285 million s inglehull or 181 million double hull cleanup costs and damages in excess of th liability limits could be covered by the trust fund93 opa section 900194 established perincident expenditure caps more than 1 billion or the maximum amount availa ble in the fund for all eligible costs and more than 500 million for natural re source damages thus major spill particularly one in sensitiv environment could threaten the viability of the fund possibly depleting it entirely in addition the above scenario assu mes that the owneroperator can take advantage of the liability limits provided by opa eg obeyed relevant regulations and did not act with gross negligence or willful misconduct if liability is not capped the owneroperator could be liable for all costs however in the case of significant spill akin to the exxon valdez some owneroperator companies may go bankrupt before paying for the entire cost of the spill such scenario may also threaten the trust fund potential options the following options are among several that congress might consider to ddress these concerns first congress could maintain the status quo in which the costs are shared between responsible partie s the oil industry and general taxpayers responsible parties ie owners operators of vessels and facilities are liable up to their liability caps if applicable the trust fund which is funded through the tax on the oil industry covers costs above liability limits general treasury funds would cover costs if the trust fund is depleted second congress could further increase the liability limits for vessels so that the responsible party would be required to pay greater portion of the total spill cost before accessing trust fund dollars third congress could increase the 5centperbarrel oil tax to more quickly raise the funds balance cl oser to its ceiling of 27 billion fully funded osltf would be more capable of absorbing the costs in excess of spillers liability limit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33705crs24 95 the house version of the bill 101st congress hr 1465 would have held under certain conditions oil owners liable for 50 of the costs and damages 96 the bush administration maintained an anal ogous view of the polluter pays principle in the context of whether or not to rein state the superfund tax on the chemical and oil industry see crs report rl31410 superfund taxes or general revenues future funding issues for the superfund program by jonathan l ramseur mark reisch and james mccarthyfourth policymakers may consid er expanding liable parties to include the owner of the oil bein g transported this option was considered during the development of opa95 the coast guard authorization act for fiscal year 2008 s 1892 would among other things alter the liability structure of opa to make owners of oil liable for spills under certain conditions considerations for policymakers the above options spotlight central policy debate how should polic ymakers allocate the costs associated with major accidental oil spill the first option would maintain the stat us quo which represents costsharing structure currently respons ible parties and the oil indus try bear the costs for all but the most significant spills general treasury funds are needed if the fund is depleted some groups may contend this conflicts with the pollute r pays principle arguing that general treasury funds should never ve to pay for oil spill cleanup or damages some combination of options two three nd four could reduce the possibility of this occurrence the second option would help preserve the trust fund by increasing the liability limit of the spiller setting lia bility limits is challenge because lawmakers must apportion the risk of costly accidental sp ill fairly between the responsible party and the trust fund the shipping industry would likely argue that fu rther increase would be disruptive due to the cost of maintaining additional financial assurance considering that the limits were increased substantially in july 2006 this option might be the least feasible the third option would increase the cost share borne by the oil industry overall some would argue that this follows the polluter pays principle one view holds that the relevant industry oil transportation and the oil i ndustry in general should bear the environmental costs that may velop during the course of business different interpretation of th polluter pays principle fi nds that only the responsible party not industry overall should pay one with such view might conclude that the third option increasing the per barrel tax is overreaching and unfair because it increases the costs borne by the entire i ndustry instead of on the actual responsible party96 there are likely many economic polic arguments both for and against an additional perbarrel tax on oil for in stance some groups may claim that an additional oil barrel tax will be reflected in higher energy costs gasoline home heating oil for consumers which coul d disproportionately affect lowerincome households in general these types of tax policy debates ar beyond th scope ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33705crs25 97 in addition this change would arguably ma ke opa liability more in line with the liability structure of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund pl 96510 which gove rns releases of hazardous substances 98 although record profits for certain oil comp anies have been highlighted in recent years it is beyond the scope of this report to assess the extent of profits and financial worth of the oil industry overall or the percentage of firms that achieved record profits 99 in fact one argument against preemption was that existing requirements under particular state laws would be diminish ed or negated entirely see benjamin grumbles and joan manley the oil pollution act of 1990 gislation in the wake of crisis natural resources and environment 102 1995 p 38 this report however policymakers might consider whether any negative consequences from an additional tax on industry would outweigh the potential benefits of allocating the costs to the oil industry the fourth option if imple mented would potentially subject oil companies to liability from sp ills of their own oil in line with one view of the polluter pays principle some may argue that oil owners should be at least par tially responsible for the various costs associated with spills of their own oil97 oil industry stakeholders would likely argue that this option is unfair because for example they would have limited control besides selecting carrier over the transportation of their cargo moreover the oil industry would likely point out that they are already supporting oil spill cleanup generally through the 5centpe rbarrel tax thus they would likely argue that attaching direct liability to cargo owners would be an inequitable distribution of costs policymakers may find the fourth option attractive because of the financial strength or perceive d financial strength of the oil companies98 if the united states faces multibillion dollar oil spill and the vessel owner operators are unable to pay some may argue that the oil ow ners should absorb the costs above the limit of the trust fund rather than funds from th general treasury howe ver this particular liability issue is complicated further legal andor policy issues associated with this liability change are beyond th scope of this report state laws as mentioned above multiple states d oil spill liability laws before the passage of opa in 1990 during the 15 ears prior to opas passage the issue of whether or not to preempt state liability laws was perhaps the primary obstacle to enacting unified oil spill legislation propone nts of preemption argued that differing state laws particularly the various levels of liability frustrate the shipping industry and are contrary to the goal of comprehensive fe deral legislation preemption opponents maintained that states should be allowed s with most other federal environmental statutes to set stiffer standards regarding liability compensation and cleanup99 in the aftermath of the exxon valdez spill the scales tipped to the side of antipreemption according to opa section 1018 referred to as savings clause the act will not preempt any state from imposing additional liability or requirements with respect to the discharge of il or related
