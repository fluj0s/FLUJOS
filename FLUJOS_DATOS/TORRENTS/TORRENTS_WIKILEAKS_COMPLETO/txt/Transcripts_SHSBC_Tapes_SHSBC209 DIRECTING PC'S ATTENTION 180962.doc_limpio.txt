directing pcs attention lecture given on 18 september 1962 well thats very nice of you thank you very much well this is what audience 18 september ad 12 eighteen september female voice 12 ad ad 12 you realize your chances of getting out of here clear actually occur in the first six weeks of your presence here somebody sighs some old student sighed it was too true wasnt it you dont think it was true he he came clear and he hasnt been the same since male voice thats right yeah well im here now ill fix it ill fix it i know what you got overts on you didnt take seriously did you male voice yeah you should have well now on the boat when i was down in the cabin working like mad and other people i wont name were up swimming and dashing about the decks and looking athletic and enthusiastic remark was made to that on the first night back with all the data i had to give you well youll probably be here till 1230 i wish to disabuse you of this particular fact and say that why dont i just make this ten fifteen minute lecture and then we all go home wouldnt you rather do that audience all right well anyway i will give you some of the data tonight but it might take till 230 anyhow thats i probably should tell you something about what happened over in washington but i couldnt get it into five or six hour lecture schedule this was very adventurous i left here tired i arrived in washington tired i finished the congress tired i finished my stay in washington tired always looking forward to this next moment when i was going to get some rest you see and then finally came back to saint hill tired i have never done so much auditing looked over so many goals done so many dynamic assessments talked to so many people and few people who were at the congress were aware of the fact that i spent most of the congress off the stage auditing i was making very sure we had goal to announce by congress end you see and also we were straightening up some of the organizations in the states the best way to straighten things up is an emeter and id like to give you tip instead of reaching for an argument reach for an emeter thats nice tip and if you followed that tip more often life would run like summer dream that is so overbearingly true for instance amongst the adventures which assailed on this rapid passage was fellow coming into my room in 1827 just as we had all the baggage stacked up in the hall and insulting he said the one unforgivable thing that mustnt be said to on the subject of how i was responsible for everything everyplace and i promptly barked growled headed him backwards over stacks of luggage it was very disgraceful i mean cameras and briefcases went in all directions and he got out the front door and i hooked him back in the front door on the realization that this was not way to resolve case and so i hooked hand around his neck and threw him back into the house and hooked the hand around his neck the other way and threw him into my room and gave him good shove in the chest and he sat down i opened my emeter case it was all packed we were just about to leave for new york we were going to leave for new york at two oclock and something came up and then we postponed it till three and something came up and then we postponed it till four and something came up and i think this happened at five anyway i just sat there and pulled his missed withholds put the cans in his hands put on my auditor hat and just as though nothing had been happening just sat down and pulled his missed withholds just like that one right after the other and cleaned three buttons in the space i dont remember what the auditing period was but it couldnt have been more than about half an hour to thirtyfive minutes and i cleaned three buttons and i wish to recommend this to you as an auditing job three buttons clean in about thirty or thirtyfive minutes as follows what have we failed to find out about you meaning all scientologists everyplace what have i failed to find out about you and in this session have i missed withhold on you all three clean slick as whistle he was giving nicer and nicer answers the answers were sweeter and sweeter and he was more and more pleasant and i think somebody out on the other coast had given him twentyfivehour intensive to clean up these buttons but hadnt ever scratched them thats interesting isnt it and at the end of that time ran security check on him this is in the last five minutes told him that his goal was in opposition to scientology after i had done so this was this was the last minute was dynamic assessment and told him his goals were in opposition his goal was in opposition to scientology and that was why hed been acting that way because thats what the meter said and he said well what do we do about it and i said well i said you go on and get yourself some auditing and ill see to it somebody finds your goal somewhere along the line and he got up and shook by the hand and he said thank you very much he said im going to make you good auditor now the number of hours of administrative time that this person had already occupied on various lines in various places had amounted to minimum of fifty or sixty and if you dont like administration use an meter get the idea and when you use an emeter get something done now that may be novel thought that may be novel thought when you use an emeter get something done i see that lands more or less on deaf ears an emeter is not something that you should spend lots of time on an emeter is something you should do something with you can do great deal with an emeter somebodys busy arguing with you left and right somebodys busy knocking your head in somebodys getting very uppity and monkeyed up well youre lucky if you can get to him with an emeter youre very lucky because sometimes you cant such as the building youre sitting in is illegal and town and county planning are corresponding now im sure this will take great many hours to settle but if i could get these cottonpicking monkeys on the other end of an emeter id pull the withhold fast we might even arrange it oh well thats another story anyway scientology is to be used its for use it is something you can use and it isnt something that you pick up and use in an auditing session necessarily but its something you can use all the time but when you do decide to do something scientologywise well be effective and do it yeah thats all just do it and most of the rules which are laid down in auditing and in clearing are all devoted to keeping you from doing ineffective things these rules are path of effectiveness now remember men have been talking to men for number of millennia ever since they came out of the trees and theyve been talking and theyve been doing lot of talking some of them are still in the trees in fact i saw psychiatrist the other day wearing swallow tail coat and he had to and the general position of talking and discussing and so forth has been that it has been waste of time now how is it in auditing that we can use talkingness and suddenly something happennesses see how come how come this occurs and the rules by which you audit are the rules of an effective path to an accomplishment of reaching someone of bettering someone of obtaining agreement and improving existence but its highly circumscribed path now if you were to if you were to look over great many activities in the past which were supposed to cure people or supposed to make them sane or supposed to make them happy or something of the sort you would be amazed at their numerousness theyre just almost without number we know few of them as the witch doctor the rrarh psychoanalyst the aesculapian school of healing these things i could go on and on and on and name and name and name and name and name and youd all come down to something quite interesting is that it had to do with talking to somebody about something or listening to somebody about something thats been assisted from time to time with puffs of smoke and pinches of pepper as in the case of the witch doctor juju horsetail flies with fleas in them all of these things have have talkingness reachingness an effort to reach connected with them for instance by the simple expedient of scattering fleas all over somebody with horsetail fly the juju doctor creates confusion into which he can put his implant you recognize that its fellow wouldnt pay much attention to what was coming in it would just go in at that moment the well most old witch doctors had to learn how to scream and you got an interrupted scream theyd scream loud enough to kick your eardrums in and then say something and then continue the scream and the patient thereafter didnt know they had stopped screaming but of course had sandwiched implant with the statement in the middle of the scream you see being an implanted suggestion of some kind or another usually in that stage of medicine the suggestion was something on the order of youre going to die theres always been talkingness and reachingness in other words we found axiom 10 operating throughout efforts to overwhelm efforts to heal efforts to control efforts to make sane efforts to better efforts to become better all of these various things have axiom 10 running through their midst now how is it that we in scientology can suddenly come along and by certain applications of this same talk that has been going on since time immemorial without effectiveness with this same talk being effective how do we do this thats something to think about isnt it now many student misses this they miss the fundamental of auditing the most fundamental fundamental there is auditing has to do with the communication formula and when person says something and somebody acknowledges it if the statement is truthful and the acknowledgment is received can blow erase eradicate deintensify mental charge its on that fact alone that auditing works auditing is based upon that fact there is other erudite fact on which it is based its axiom 10 now it actually isnt whats said by the person who is being treated it actually isnt whats said by the person who is acknowledging it to very marked degree is what is said by the person doing the treating in the first place this causes momentary restimulation and that restimulation is picked up by the pc recognized verbalized and blown by the moment when the acknowledgment is received somebody has heard him now thats your thats the cycle of auditing the question or the command directs the persons attention to certain area of bank and the person perceiving that area of bank responds and knows he has responded when he is acknowledged and receives that acknowledgment and that is the cycle of an auditing command now it is to maintain purity of cycle that you find most auditing rules growing up these rules occur to maintain the auditing cycle and techniques specify what is to be restimulated in what sequence now if youve done that right and you know what button should be hit and what responses should be given you only need add to it repetitive question and repetitive response order of question that is the sequence of questions asked by the practitioner each one followed by the same cycle as i have just named to obtain state of release or clear or theta clear or operating thetan in other words its that magical formula which leads all the way out and dont you forget it that is the only reason anybody goes out it is not the charm of the practitioner the nameplate on the emeter its not that the person believes or disbelieves scientology because let point out i think the fellow youd say fellow who has been yanked around by and javelined all over the front hall would not be in very receptive state in fact hed be in very repressed state of some kind or another to audit yet the exact button processed on the person relieved the state in other words the auditing was greater than the wooling now what what might somebody come to believe well if you want list then just take all the asininities that have been written in the books of philosophy on any planet in this universe take the lot make your list and youll get how many departures there can be from the auditing cycle and thats an awful lot so theres really not much reason to go into it salesman depends on some kind of cycle in order to sell he says to somebody here is an automobile buy it and the person is supposed to say okay here is my check and then the salesman is supposed to say okay take it away and do you know most cars are sold on that simple formula guys already seen the car he wants car he walks in and he says do you have cars for sale is that car is that that purple car in the window for sale and the fellow says yes yes we just have one left and the fellow says all right oil it and grease it up ill drive it out the rear door actually thats what would more or less be called the majority of sales now salesman believes of course he has to sell the car and that is what cancels the majority of sales now that even goes so far in some places which have done cycle of action on the subject of business which is gone into fine games condition where the seller will not permit the buyer to have the product now that can be attained too i remember one time spending an hour and half in my office selling an addressograph salesman on the idea of selling us machine well thats because aberration is entered into it but there are certain cycles of action that go along with selling and there are certain cycles of action that go along with teaching which are quite different than these auditing cycles of action and then there are all these varied cycles of action that have turned up in philosophic tech since time immemorial zen buddhism that gives you stack of them that gets nobody noplace by the time it had gotten out to japan they didnt know much about buddhism i say that advisedly because im authority on zen buddhism im still sane such practices try to handle some ramification of axiom 10 all of them and they all go off in different directions now you get this fellow thats been salesman for the last twenty nine to the twenty ninth power lives and you make him an auditor you try to make him an auditor you see so he sells the pc engrams and the pc takes them away with him too hell sell clearing and the thetans lucky to get away from there with any body left because it goes from nowhere in other words hes trying to handle cycle of communication which is pertinent to some other field and he doesnt see that auditing is its own cycle of communication had an example called to my attention the other day pc comes in and he says well he says ive been up all night and uh i been auditing myself and uh i kind of messed up and uh so forth and uh tsk well thats it and the auditor flies into the d of p or the auditing supervisor just breaks off the session right there at that point and says oh my god i cant possibly audit this fellow because he you know what hes just told hes told that hes been auditing all night and what can you do about that aaaaah ow do about that everything about that that can be done has already happened the pc has told him you get the idea i mean everything that youre going to do about it has already occurred well an auditor who will do that is on some other communication cycle see hes trying to sell planets or something hes not auditing i dont know what he i dont know what he thinks auditing is if he does something like that or what is supposed to happen in an auditing session i have run into students sometime ago who actually thought the meter fell on the sound of their own voice weve been curing this up in other words when the auditor spoke the emeter reacted i think thats marvelous you know because it shows comprehension of the auditing cycle because this immediately lends itself to some weird old past track idea of some kind or another whereby it is the practitioner who wears the case of the patient and by speaking about it gets it to react on the meter and now that the pc or the patient witnesses it becomes well now i hate to burden your wits with that one but im just showing you theres another cycle of action now youve seen characters laying on hands well this is not disgraceful activity as matter of fact touch assist is always welcome but how come this communication cycle of we lay on the paw and draw the pain out of the wound and experience the pain in the paw and then shake it away like dog coming out of the water youve seen that havent you well its an interesting cycle of action now we take somebody who of course is totally addicted to another cycle of action of some kind or another and never sees the auditing cycle of action and what do we get out of this after he reads the emeter see got the emeter there and he says have you sinned now hes better do you get that it is totally totally possible this sounds utterly mad but im only calling this to your attention because the basic of auditing is an auditing cycle of command which operates as an attention director call it restimulator if you want but its an attention director eliciting response from the patient to asis that area and who knows he has done so when he receives from the practitioner an acknowledgment that it has occurred now that is the auditing cycle and any departure from that auditing cycle will wind you up in the soup now that auditing cycle all by itself is sufficiently powerful to get gains matter what button you direct lets be very very very puristic about this lets remove all significance from it as an action and see if anything happens to the pc let us tell him from where he is to get the idea of looking at his left ear and thank him and get the idea of looking at his right ear and thank him and get the idea of looking at his left ear and thank him and get the idea of looking at his right ear and thank him well what happens is hes not going to wind up without ears but the mere fact of directed attention and the acknowledgment that he has directed his attention just that fact all by itself operates as therapeutic action see theres significance in the command it just says inspect your right ear inspect your left ear see and that just run bang bang bang bang now just doing it once might not be observably therapeutic doing it twice probably not but here is new thing that enters into it repetitive the repetitive action duplication is added to the communication formula which contains duplication anyway so of course youve taken the apparency of duplication pardon youve taken the apparency of communication and increased it enormously by the fact of duplication this fellow really knows hes being communicated to now and he can direct his attention better and better and better and better and he knows something is happening because somebody has told him so every time the acknowledgment occurs now what occurs this way the person will become aware of some other being in existence will become aware of mass will become aware of the fact his attention is easy to shift or hard to shift various things will occur his awareness of these things will increase and his attention becomes free it becomes freer and freer and freer now the thing is limited because he wots not of what hes looking at nobody has asked him for any sense to it it takes longer now in essence those are your cchs its the nonsignificance of directed attention and those of you who are still trying to read all kinds of significance into the cchs should just tear that little chapter out of the book and go over in the corner quietly and read it because the cchs present different ways of directing the pcs attention with minimal significance and of course your worseoff pc does very well on them because he finds out that there is matter energy space time and somebody else alive in the world its probably one of the greatest cognitions that an individual can have if he doesnt know it its almost with horror that he realizes it for the first time how do you suppose the great criminal manages to live with himself how does he manage to live with himself its just that nobody else exists so therefore it doesnt matter what he does and there he goes how are you going to get this fellow out of it well you cant tell him think of the significance of this or that and the other thing most of the time because the significance would never arrive he this he could not duplicate he cannot duplicate the significance of looking at it the significance of looking at significance he cant do that but he can duplicate the relatively nonsignificant action of simply directed attention if you want to make some pc feel like hes being hypnotized when he isnt set up two bottles in front of him and tell him to look at the left one and then tell him to look at the right one and then tell him to look at the left one and tell him to look at the right one and tell him to look at the left one and tell him to look at the right one and tell him to look at the left one and all of the sudden hell get some weird feeling of becoming hypnotized of course he isnt becoming hypnotized hypnotism is running off and if you do it for little while after he first begins to feel that hes being hypnotized hell realize actually what is happening hes waking up sleeping beauty now there you see new idea in the communication cycle its communication without significance beyond the significance of what the attention is directed to now many an activity has directed attention but not duplicatively and that is one of the secrets of scientology processing and why it works duplicative one of the reasons this was never discovered was because most people cant take it its the practitioner who cant take it not the patient therefore at hca level we like to have lot of op pro by dup and somebody comes through and says well should op pro by dup be run just during the auditing periods for three days in order to get in or four days in order to get in eight hours of it or should it be run all at once or should it be so and should it be so on you see theyre so starved for significance they wont just do op pro by dup i dont care how its run run it see but of course every time the fellow says that he cannot walk over to the book one more time at that moment you assist him thither it must be run and where everybody is busy worrying about how its run they very often neglect that it must be run if you ever wanted to see scientologist natter find one that early in his career was run on op pro by dup by consent of the pc on this basis the pc says hes getting tired so the auditor says all right sit down and take rest the pc says he cant tell just now so the auditor lets it skid and boy whats happened there the cycle of action is entirely and completely mishmashed you dont get the intention of the practitioner expressed in the direction of attention of the person it is being run on and therefore then you dont get the acknowledgment and its very weird but theres very basic action and you could do this in single action basis but it doesnt make space and it tends to make the guy feel kind of stacked up when you say you see that black spot all right look at that spot thank you look at that spot thank you look at that spot thank you look at that spot thank you look at that spot thank you look at that you havent got two points so of course youve space and the odd part of it is this black spot will start to look closer and closer and closer and closer and the guy will begin to believe hes kind of being pulled out of his head toward the black spot because he cant make space so therefore he doesnt know where he is so two is always better and then of course two adds to the element of duplication we got twopole universe and weve got duplication going and here we go op pro by dup becomes killer but recognize that you could direct attention repetitively in duplicative fashion on and on and on in almost any fashion and achieve renewed awareness on the part of another being for yourself and for the world around him see it isnt any other significance in it than just that there is further significance in that action than that there is actually further result in that action than that either somatics will turn on and off and youll think hes getting rid of lots of somatics and youll run to them run into them later on to the place where he is going to and there theyll be waiting on the track again but thats beside the point the person has become aware hes become more aware and to that degree he has enormously improved now this does very interesting things in terms of improvement it improves iq it improves alertness it improves sogginess of one kind or another in life itll do all kinds of things you could write up bill of bill of health on the thing and put it on slab board outside that lot of customers would be very very happy to come in and get that to happen to them but its an elementary purity op pro by dup other activities as i was just about to say have done repetitive commands various activities have done this there is onecommand process which is used over in the heights of the himalayas which deletes these things and that is regard your navel the command is given once and twenty years later the fellow is still sitting there its not optimum auditing its called an auditor comm lag but recognize that as cycle of action of sorts recognize that somebody writes down in book what you want to do is regard your navel all right so the fellow says fine ill regard my navel hes got one auditing command and one navel and he gets stuck because the acknowledgment is missing even for that one command the author of the text never comes out afterwards through the pages of the book and sort of breaking the fellows attention off as its staring downward and says thank you very much you go around to somebody if you want to produce shock of magnitude on some monk of tibet why learn this in tibetan itd probably get you past many monastery doors theyd be so flat on their backs after you said it that nobody would stop you and that would be thank you very much for regarding your navel guy has been waiting for it you know now if you you see that then the there are different cycles than the auditing cycle and it is very easy to fall into these other cycles because men have been in them for long time theres lots of them on the track theres an enormous variety of ways to handle communication theres for instance cycle theres cycle that might go something like this hello dear bang you see the acknowledgment comes with the greeting well we see this in less domestic ways on such thing halt or ill shoot bang you see its like the captain walking past the guardhouse one day and new sentry said to him halt or ill shoot halt or ill shoot halt or ill shoot and fortunately before he got the last syllable completely out the captain reached over and shook him and said hey whats going on whats the matter whats the matter well sergeant said to say that three times and then shoot well thats another cycle of action now wherever youve got communication line set up you have some kind of response system on this line and itll go through some kind of cycle there are some marvelous cycles i wouldnt spend any time studying them particularly but if you know there are different cycles of communication or action then youll see that it is unique cycle the auditing cycle of action is unique and frankly you could sit down and study it for quite while with considerable amount of benefit you could say what is this thing all about you utter command or ask question and this directs the pcs attention and then youd realize that the question or command also unseen directs the attention of the pc by pulling the reactive bank up around the pcs ears which is operating independent of the intention of the pc and is more responsive to the practitioner than it is to the person i can always make peoples somatic strips go tearing around its very fascinating any outsider has more control of persons reactive bank than the person himself of course its on that additional point that auditing is to some degree based this fellow sits inside of his skull and he says ill restimulate it and then ill asis it and ill restimulate it and ill asis it and ill restimulate and ill asis it and ill restimulate it and ill asis odd part of it is it has some workability but he gets stacked up after while you see because he actually isnt asising some of it and never notices when he goes off of it he isnt good director of his reactive bank because the common denominator of the reactive bank is otherdeterminism so auditing basically requires practitioner that is because an otherdeterminism handles the otherdeterminism of the reactive bank much more easily than the individual himself did you ever think of that so when the auditor isnt following through the cycle of action of auditing the cycle of an auditing command then nobody else is going to adjust the bank for him and an auditor who wont help him out by adjusting the bank for him of course is leaving him in the soup and the pc feels like hes getting auditing if you go ahead and study the cycle ive been talking to you about in this lecture you will see most of the mistakes of auditing you will see how these things grow and come about first by habit pattern from other eras and scenes and activities and second by not recognizing that it is set pattern that youre following there is set pattern it is very set auditing has very precise cycle and if that cycle isnt followed auditing doesnt occur the next thing that you should recognize about this is that pc whose attention cannot be controlled cannot be directed into areas of significance which dont reactively want to have any attention directed into let us say this pc has goal never to look and youre busy trying to find goal never to look only you dont know what the goal is oh coo i invite you to try to find this on pc whose attention you the auditor does not do not control you see what would happen the bank has more authority over the pc than the auditor now this pcs attention can be directed so and the auditor is skilled at directing his attention not diverting it by dropping emeters or comments on the weather and there is point in the session when this ridge or whatever the buildup is which sort of surrounds this goal first appears over the reactive horizon and it says never to look and of course the auditor has more control of the pcs attention than the pcs own bank so therefore the pc looks straight at it and tells the auditor exactly what it is and you write down the goal never to look on the pcs list and when its tiger drilled you find it now pc who is gloriously out of session we call it that is pc whose attention is not being directed by the auditor he hits this one and he obeys the bank and he doesnt look over there bank says never to look thats it pc doesnt look over there do you see how it is now all goals lists contain goals of this character this is not peculiar to one pc for one pc to have this as goal would be an individualism of one kind thats the pcs goal but all goals lists contain goals of this character and you can almost this is just hazarded guess here look over the list of the pc whose goal is not being easily found and you will find on it complete absence of goals which command the attention to go the other way therell never be anything on it like never to look not to talk to be silent these things will not appear on that pcs goals list and the pc whose attention can be directed by the auditor will have great many of these on the list thats just an educated guesstimate not based on very much observation but im just giving you just look at it so you wonder why pc as goal cannot be found and pc bs goal can be found it again comes down to the auditor and to nobody else there are good pcs or bad pcs there are only pcs there are good auditors and there are bad auditors and good auditors use communication cycle and get it executed and bad auditors monkey along and never direct the pcs attention therefore you have fast goal finding and slow goal finding you have fast auditing and slow auditing you have all the varieties of auditing which are presented to your eye by any group of pcs passing through an hgc or private auditors hands thats the way it is now we say well some pcs attention is harder to direct than others and i say its still the auditor its sometimes an auditor has to work harder than others and thats about all that you can say about it if you look over your own auditing on the basis of the cycle of auditing and if you look over any pc that you are auditing on the basis of is his attention being directed by and can i count upon the fact that it is you will learn great deal about what is going on both with your auditing and with that pc and the relationships in between okay thank you
