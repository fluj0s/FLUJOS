affected the executive branch does not currently have authority to set or change the times of elections power reserved for congress under the constitution although congress may be able to delegate such authority either congress or the states might also pass legisl ation in response to terrorist attack that would change the timing of any elections that were affected some states have enacted statutes providing for th temporary postponement of elections many state statutes also grant the governor the power to suspend certain state laws during an emergency those statutes might also be able to be used to postpone the general presidential election in the state during an emergency actual postponement of elections has occurred in relatively few cases over the last 150 years the best known recent examples are the new york state primary scheduled for september 11 2001 and the florida primary scheduled on september 1 1992 shortly after hurricane andrew in new york the entire election was rescheduled in florida only dade count was rescheduled in many other cases in the united states and other countries elections have b een held despite difficult situations arising from natural events or conflicts it is generally the responsibility of state and local governments to provide security at polling places state and local laws regarding police presence vary with some states prohibiting and others requiring it federal law prohibits the use of federal military forces at the polls except to repel armed enemies of the united states recently released guide for state electionsecurity planning recommends establishment of planning teams and prep aration for range of possible scenarios reactions of state and local officials have varied with some intending to make as few visible changes as possible and others planning to increase police presence or even move polling places whether congress considers actions to safeguard elections may depend on events associated with us elections or those in other countries among the options are to take legislative action to exp licitly delegate authority to the executive branch to the extent permitted by the constitution to provide mechanisms for improved coordination and to encourage early and absentee voting all these options have some potential benefits but also signifi cant potential

considered by many to have had significant impact on the outcome of that election1 many observers believed th at such was their intent concerns then arose that terrorist attacks in the united states near the time of the november 2 federal election could also be aimed at affecting the outcome of that election in early july news media be gan reporting such concerns from the bush administration and that the department of justice was considering the question of federal authority to postpone the election2 subsequently administration officials emphasized that the election would proceed as scheduled for example on july 13 election assistance commission eac chairman deforest soaries released public statement declaring there are circumstances that could justify the postponement or cancellation of presidential election in the united states3 however the question of polling place vulnerabilities persists as result questions have arisen about what respons might be taken both to prevent such attacks and respond to them should they occu r deliberations have been affected not only by concerns about homeland security in the wake of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 but also by the expected closeness of the presidential election and the resulting highly charged nature of the contest deliberations and debate have centered largely around two questions if terrorist attack occurred

it has rarely exercised that authority except with respect to the question of enfranchisement of voters however in response to th problems arising from the november 2000 election for president

senators and representatives shall end january 3rd 7 despite modern state practice providing for popular voting for electors the appointment of presidential electors was historically and re mains today power of the state legislatures for instance state would still retain the aut hority to use an alternative method of choosing presidential electors besides popular elections 8 for instance the supreme court has allowed congressional regulation of political committees which seek to influence presidentia l elections arguing that such legislation is justified by the need to preserve the integrity of such elections see burroughs v united states 290 us 534 1934date of elections appears to derive principally from two constitutional provisions article i 4 cl 1 and artic ii 1 cl 4 the text of the constitution does not appear to contain constitutional role for the executive branch in such decisions the supreme court and lower courts have interpreted the language of article i 4 cl 1 to mean that congress has exte nsive power to regulate most elements of congressional election5 it would appear that cong ress would therefore have broad authority to postpone elections so as to account for emergency situations although congress has set the election date by statute it would still appear to be within congresss power to postpone house and senate election6 while the power of congress to regulate presidential elections is not as extensive as its power over house and senate elections7 article ii 1 cl 4 does provide that congress may determine the time of c hoosing presidential electors although congress does not have the explicit authority to regulate other aspects of presidential elections case law does i ndicate that congress may have powers extending beyond establishing th time of choosing the electors8 the power of congress to protect the integrity of th presidential election combined with its authority to set the time of election woul d also seem to

citizens under its emergency powers see harold relyea national emergency powers crs report 98505 23 september howeve r exercise of such power would not appear to have the legal effect of delaying an

the court rejected the argument that the taxing cl ause us const artic i 8 cl 1 should be treated differently for purposes of delega tion we discern nothing in the placement of the taxing clause that would distinguish c ongresss power to tax from its other enumerated powers such as its commerce powers its pow er to raise and support armies its power to borrow money or its power to make rule s for the government in terms of the scope and degree of discretionary authority that c ongress may delegate to the executive in order that the president may take care that the laws be faithfully executed but see amy continuedstate elections congress does not have gene ral legislative authority to regulate the manner and procedures used for elections at the state and local level congress does have extensive author ity under the civil war amendments9 the 19th amendment10 the 24th amendment11 and the 26th amendment12 to prevent discrimination in access to voting and it s exercised that power extensively over state and local as well as federal elections13 however absent some relationship to the issues addressed by these amendments such as the postponement of state election to deal with issues of discrimina tion congress would not appear to have the authority to regulate the time of the state elections executive branch power the executive branch does not appear to currently have the authority to establish or postpone the dates of elections at either the federal or state level even in an emergency14 the question arises however whether congress could dele gate power to the executiv branch generally under separation of power doctrine congress may delegate power to the executive branch so long as it includes standards so that court can ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed15 there is apparent reason why this doctrine would not extend to the power of congress to set the time of national elections16 thus ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32654crs5 16 continued keller

of kauai wrought by hurricane iniki was governed by two main factors first th lieutenant governor who was the states chief election official concu rred with the election staffs philosophical approach that there was little that should cause an elec tion to be postponed second the primary did not fall on the day of the hurri cane but came eight days later mr yoshina said that the election staff

decisions to postpone elections the domestic and international examples of elections that were either postponed or held under difficult conditions suggest there may be circumstances where general

conducting federal elections despite uniform election day requirements the following examples suggest that postponi ng an election for catastrophic event would not necessarily lead to controversy the

cans that occurred in the region during the last quarter of the 19th century and continued until the 1960s98 concluding observations about election postponement the presumption that elections are held on schedule in the united states is strong one the fact that federal elections were held in the united states during the civil war99 and every other war declared or undeclared since that time is often cited as rationale for the principle that federal elections s hould not be postponed the postponements discussed bove suggest however that there are events that may cause election administrators to consider interrupting or postponing general election regardless of that presumption these incl ude peril to life and extensive damage to infrastructure the examples suggest that if state or locality decided that catastrophe required the interruption or post ponement of the general election for the presidency and congress congress would tend to accept the delay so long as the rescheduled elections were held before the date in december when the electoral college casts its ballots and the beginning of the next congress respectively if catastrophic event were to occur on election day state and

when the out age occurred how long it lasted and what voting systems were in use the relativ size of the electorate underscores the reliance on technology as large numbers of voters could be affected

requirements and the desire for speed in reporting results security at the polling place there are about 180000 voting precincts in the united states102 just as elections are administered by state and

and incidents both before and on election day contingency plans for those scenarios should address sp ecific issues relating to communication and coordination authority and responsibility and public

secureimpact of early and absentee voting an increasing number of states permit voters to cast ballots in person before election day early voting or to mail in ballots absentee voting without providing specific approved reason this is sometimes called excuse voting111 increasing numbers of voters have been casting ballots using these alternativesystems in recent elections and that trend is expected to continue use of them can mitigate concerns about security in at leas t two ways first it can reduce the impact on the election of any attack or other emergency that woul d affect polling places for example oregon votes entirely through mailin balloting so there are polling places to attack 112 second to the extent that it reduces the number of voters who go to the polls it can make providing security for them much easier it is not clear whether security concerns among voters will cause higher numbers than usual to use these alternative methods in the current and future elections options for congress whether congress considers taking any actions to enhance election security may depend to significant degree on events ssociated with the november 2004 election or elections in other industr ialized nations however some observers argue that even in the absence of any immediate problems consideration of legislative options would be prudent given both the likelihood th at concerns about terrorist attacks will continue and that natural di sasters are always possible on or near election day among them weather events such as major stor ms and earthquakes or volcanic eruptions among the options congress might consider are the following take action state and local jurisdicti ons after all have primary responsibility for elections under the u s system of government while hava gives the federal government some specific responsibilities in election administration it gave the new agency it cr eated the eac regulatory authority as described in this report states alr eady have considerable authority to provide security for elections and to postpone them if necessary hava also arguably concentrates responsibilities for election admin istration at the state as opposed to the local level of government in the absen ce of specific problems requiring federal solution it may be most appr opriate to not attempt to modify those responsibilities it can also be argued that decentralized approach enhances security in that it can make targeting by terrorists more difficult and provide broader range of defenses than centralized approach in addition congress could respond to any specific emergency after th fact as new york stat did after september 11 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32654crs23 113 for information about cog and coop see r eric petersen

resultant diversity of procedures can lead to variations in vulnerability that potential attackers might identify and exploit second it can make ffective coordination more difficult in the event of nationa l emergency related to an election delegate authority for safeguarding elections to the executive branch as discussed earlier congress may be able within constitutional limits to delegate authority to the executive bran ch to postpone an election in response to an emergency further congress could direct the executive branch to assist states in providing security for elections through the eac dhs or even the military however since security of the polling places has traditionally been controlled by state and local authorities the degree to which the constitution would allow congress to direct or supplant these functi ons may be at issue to the extent such actions are constitutionally permissible th ey could create the capability of quick decisive response in the case of threat or attack howeve r such an approach would likely also raise concerns about the risk of politicization of ch actions and the concentration of executive power over central component of the machinery of democracy treat security as an aspect of continuity of government some observers have proposed that elections are essentially an element of critical government infrastructure and as such should be considered as part of the developing framework to ensure continuity of gove rnment cog and tinuity of operations coop in the event of crisis or emergency113 however so far election administration has
