from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to kevin trenberth trenbertcgducaredu subject re fwd re zero order draft of chapter 3 ar4 ipcc date fri feb 4 172332 2005 kevin i was concerned about splitting too and suggested as way of getting through the work little quicker pairs will also work as long as we choose the right ones agree we need to separate the major from minor so anything that can be done there in april will be good i suspect the comments from the nominated reviewers will all have to answered in formal way as dry run for the fod and sod on the figures we need to compare notes on these in few weeks and assign particular people to them we both worked with dave on the set of trends they may not be perfect but they are better than some of the others i think we will need to do more of this giving responsibility for handful to some of the is possibility well need to give clear instructions though and expect loads of iterations i can deal with 32 with david and the hc if we can agree on what and how we want them most of the other sections require much more thought ill work on this i agree 100 with you on the tc section this will get scrutinized by many more now ill report back on the ccsp review apart from lindzen the panel seem pretty good so ill gauge what the key issues appear to be in the panels minds agree that we shouldnt treat its conclusions as gospel otherwise why are we bothering but treat it as very very major review article must go home now have good trip back to nz cheers phil at 1639 04022005 you wrote phil i tried to attach the ppt with all the figues but it is too big for your server kevin original message subject re zero order draft of chapter 3 ar4 ipcc date fri 04 feb 2005 093600 0700 from kevin trenberth 1trenbertcgducaredu to phil jones 2pjonesueaacuk references 3420248527060406cgducaredu 4612002005020414454503dd6830popueaacuk hi phil not sure how to handle all this recall how it was done for gcos i dont think that worked the official version requires each comment to have name etc on it so it can be carved up the cas wont do that so i think we have to treat each ca separately or at best broken up by section i can try to get my admin to work on it if we have clear guidelines i am also concerned about splitting there are lot of things that can be done by working in pairs in previous ipccs we broke up into sections two people worked on each section in parallel lots of things can be done that way but there are some major things that we have to build consensus on of all of us i now have particular interest in making sure the hurricanes are done well i also am concerend about the uamsu etc and clearly you and i should both be engaged there so sorting out the fairly minor from major points will be key task i am not taken by our set of figures if i look at them and try to create story eg by ppt i think they are lacking i am attaching the ones i have assembled i am away next week in hawaii at the chapman conference agu then i am briefly back and then i am gone and out of touch in new zealand on personal time 20 feb to 3 march kevin phil jones wrote kevin at least two of the cas have already begun reading the zod i hope your clear message is followed by all the cas glad you sent the pdf and not the doc version tracked changes would be nightmare with all these comments i presume well both assemble all the ca comments wgi will get comments from our nominated and their referees i presume wgi will somehow collate these so for example all comments on section 37 or 371 will be together is there way we can collate all the ca comments similarly i guess we can decide this later when some more have come in i reckon well have to split the group in beijing if we are to get through all the comments in the 35 days so separating them would prove useful would an email to wgi be useful to see if they can do it for us just thought as you saw ive reminded our with responsibility for linking with other chapters look at that chapter as well chance so far to look at the ccsp vertical temp trends 6 sections each of 4070 pages away from today feb 610 in madrid eu project meeting 1220 in pune extremes workshop the last one in the current round for south asia and 2225 at ohare hilton for the ccsp report only here 11th and 21st should have email contact in madrid and chicago but pune may be hit and miss still not much need for too much contact at this time ill give the diagrams and other issues some thought whilst away albert will be in pune have good few weeks and i hope the landsea issue has subsided cheers phil at 1550 03022005 you wrote dear ca the zero order draft of chapter 3 of the wg1 ipcc ar4 report is now available your contribution has helped us put together this draft and we thank you very much however it is not yet the first draft we recognize that it is incomplete in some places for instance where some cas did not come through or through oversight and we have not even reviewed it fully ourselves given the tight timetable so we are seeking constructive comments and your assistance on developing the first draft what is most helpful is for you to suggest new text and references and explicit changes not such and such is bad or needs fixing we can not promise to use the new text because there are 60 cas who may well suggest different things we also have to limit page numbers so we especially welcome suggestions for shortening if you care to rewrite section more succinctly then we will gladly consider it the figures are all preliminary and will be thoroughly examined in beijing in may so suggestions of improved or more recent figures are welcomed we also welcome copies of any papers submitted or referred to i am sending this out in two parts this part has the text attached as pdf it is order 1 mb the second part includes the figures many in color and it is 37 mb we need you comments by 1 april 2005 at the latest if you prefer to focus only on the section in which your contribution appeared then that is fine but you are welcome to comment on other parts as well if you can not comment or prefer not to for some reason or another message to that effect would also be welcomed so we can track responses please send your comments preferably in word with your name on each page and clear identification of section page and line number or figure number you may like to make comment followed by explicit suggestion for addition or change please do justify and argue why the change is needed please send comments to kevin trenberth and phil jones who will assemble them many thanks for your help kevin trenberth 5trenbertucaredu phil jones 6pjonesueaacuk kevin trenberth email 7trenbertucaredu climate analysis section ncar 8wwwcgducareducas p box 3000 303
