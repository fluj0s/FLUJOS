that it is the practice of us attorneys for the district in which the violation was alleged to have occurred not to prosecute this violation in 1987 this provision was clarified to make sure that the

basing dismissal on the standard of whether the matter warranted further investigation see s rept 100123 supra at 11 hearings held within the committee indic ate that the attorney general has misused
