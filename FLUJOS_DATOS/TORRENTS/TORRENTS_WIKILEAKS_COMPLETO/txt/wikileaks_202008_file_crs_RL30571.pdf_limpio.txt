or all of their social security contributions directly in the markets or 2 having governme nt appointed entity invest some of them in the markets for the social security trust funds the current system is collective one its resources are shared in the sense that it does not set aside persons social security taxes for his or her own use social security benefits are based instead on persons average earnings and most of persons taxes are used to pay the benefits of todays recipients any surplus is recorded to the trust funds for the potential future benefit of all recipients proponents of more individualized system of personal accounts say that taking peoples money and using it to pay for someone elses benefits is unfair they argue that it would be better if people invested some or all of their own money for their own retirement in this way they contend people would feel they had gotten what they paid for based on their own decisions if they want to take more risks they should be able to if they want to be more cautious they could do that too simply stated individual account proponents argue that people should have more choices proponents of the current system say that it protects society as much as the individual against poverty they argue that in the absence of social security widespread destitution would exist among the aged and disabled they do not dispute the claim that people should be able to choose how to save and invest but through their personal savings and private pensions not through social security elements of both camps say that investing in the financial markets can help make the nations retirement system more secure proponents of the current system who do so recogn izing that not all do contend that the higher yield from investing portion of the trust funds in the markets could help reduce the systems longterm funding problem proponents of personal accounts generally distrust the government to invest without interfering with private enterprise and would prefer that people grow their own accounts to supplement social security perhaps allowing future social security benefits to be constrained enough to make the system solvent while shoring up the system is the catalyst for discussion much of the debate emanates from philosophical conflict about how much the government needs to be involved in securing retirements proponents of the current system argue that to adopt more individualized system where how well one invests becomes critical to ones retirement well being would be too big risk for many of societys economically vulnerable people they see the current program as necessary role for government in assuring minimal standard of retirement income others contend that society has changed and is much more capable today than in the 1930s of sustaining system that does not rely on mandated transfer of income from workers to recipients they argue that given adequate incentives perhaps even mandate people could effectively save the same social security tax dollars on their own possibly achieving greater economic returns than afforded by politicallydriven governmental systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571contents overview of the issue 1 the case for collective investment 5 the case for individualized accounts 17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl305711 benefits are computed

beyond are included in the calculation at their nominal valuesocial security reform the issue of individual versus collective investment for retirement overview of the issue while myriad of issues have been raised in the current social security debate perhaps none is more complex than the question of whether and how the nations financial markets might be used to reform the system in its simplest form the question of how it might be done has brought attention to two possible approaches 1 allowing or requiring individuals to invest some or all of their social security contributions directly in the markets or 2 having the government or some quasi government entity invest them for the collective good of all recipients the issue may sound academic but its not at its core it is not about how retirement investments are made or what the investments are it is about who bears responsibility for the decisions that are made it is about individual versus collective preparation for retirement who makes the investments who bears the risks who reaps the rewards individuals or society in general the current social security system is collective one its resources are shared broadly amongst those who are insured since participation in the system is mandatory insured means most people who work its purpose is to minimize the risks of destitution in old age or because of disability for all who participate as well as their dependents its resources are shared in the sense that it does not set aside persons social security taxes for his or her own use instead those taxes are pooled for the collective use of all recipients simply stated there is savings account to which the taxes that each individual pays are credited the social security administration keeps record only of persons earnings not of his or her taxes moreover the amount person pays does not determine how much he or she receives social security benefits are based instead on an average of persons career earnings and the formula used is deliberately tilted to favor low lifetime earners1 most of persons social security taxes are used to pay the benefits of todays recipients any surplus is recorded to the social security trust funds for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs2 2 the costs of the social security program both its benefits and administrative expenses are financed by tax on wages and selfemployment income commonly referred to as fica and seca taxes because they are levied under the federal insurance contributions and self employment contributions acts these taxes flow each day into thousands of depository accounts maintained by the government with financial institutions across the country along with many other forms of revenues these social security taxes become part of the governments operating cash pool or what is more commonly referred to as the us treasury in effect once these taxes are received they become indistinguishable from other monies the government takes in they are accounted for separately through the issuance of federal securities to the social security trust funds which basically involves series of bookkeeping entries by the treasury department but the trust funds themselves do not hold money they are simply accounts similarly benefits are not paid from the trust funds but from the treasury as the checks are paid securities of an equivalent value are written off the trust funds 3 the secretary of the treasury basically follows passive investment policy under which the management of the federal securities acquired and held by the trust funds is dictated by an administrative process that does not involve the secretary in buying and selling securities in the financial markets the process is largely an inhouse operation the secretary does have authority to buy and sell federal securities in the open markets on behalf of the trust funds but since the programs inception has rarely done so the implied policy is that such action would be taken only to stabilize the markets the secretary also has authority to buy and sell other securities for the trust funds that are guaranteed as to both principal and interest in the past the trust funds have held such securities in the form of obligations of the federal national mortgage association government national mortgage association and federal home loan bank boardpotential future benefit of all social security recipients2 and perhaps most pertinent to this discussion neither the individual nor the trust funds account manager who by law is the secretary of the treasury makes investment decisions about what to do with social security funds3 proponents of more individualized system say that the current system is unfair that it takes peoples money and uses it to pay for someone elses benefits they argue that it would be better if people invested some or all of their own money for their own retirement in this way they contend people would feel they had gotten what they paid for based on their own decisions about how to prepare for retirement if they want to take more risks they should be able to if they want to be more cautious they could do that too simply stated proponents of more individualized system argue that people should have more choices proponents of the current system say that it serves social purposes as much as those of the individual that it protects society as much as the individual against poverty they argue that in the absence of social security widespread destitution and income disparity would exist among the aged and disabled the cost of which would have to be borne by society in some way through higher welfare spending higher governmental spending on social and health services less tax revenue and other adverse social effects they do not dispute the claim that people should have investment choices but contend that the current system should continue as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs3 4 in signing the original social security legislation the social security act of 1935 pl 27174th congress on august 14 1935 president franklin roosevelt described the concept in this way we can never insure one hundred percent of the population against one hundred percent of the haza rds and vicissitudes of life but we have tried to frame law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of job and against povertyridden old age 5 the social security board of trustees comprised of three members of the presidents cabinet the commissioner of social security and two members representing the public at large annually projects the longrange financial condition of the social security system traditionally the board uses valuation period extending 75 years into the future although the measure of solvency was refined in 1991 to encompass shorter and more recent periods of valuation generally longrange solvency or what is technically referred to as close actuarial balance is assumed to exist if the systems average income over the 75year period as whole is projected to be within 95 of its average costs see 2000 annual report of the board of trustees of the old age survivors and disability insurance trust funds government printing office washington dc march 30 2000 6 not all proponents of the current system support using the financial markets to help shore up the system vice president gore for instance supports using current federal budget surpluses to reduce outstanding government debt and crediting the social security trust funds with portion of the interest savings the crediting would be only in the form of federal securities as is the practice today although not yet proposing or endorsing specific reform plan presidential candidate george w bush has stated that he favors allowing people to use some of their social security taxes to create individual accounts that could be invested in the financial marketsbedrock of protection against the vicissitudes of life4 they argue that people can still make choices but through their personal savings and private pensions not through social security which should provide foundation of economic security elements of both camps say investments in the nations financial markets can help make the system more secure although the systems income currently exceeds its outgo social securitys current board of trustees projects that over the next 75 years the systems expenditures will exceed its income by 14 on average and by 2037 its trust funds will be depleted5 at that point its ongoing receipts would be sufficient to cover only 72 of its benefit commitments by the end of the 75year period its expenditures would exceed its income by nearly 46 proponents of current system who support collective investment ie who support investing portion of the social security trust funds in the markets contend that the higher yield to the funds from doing so could eliminate some or all of this problem without modifying the basic structure of assured support proponents of individualized investment distrust the government to invest without intruding into the investment process and private enterprise and would prefer that individuals grow accounts on their own that would provide supplement to social security perhaps allowing future social security benefits to be constrained enough to eventually balance the systems income and outgo6 while shoring up the system is the catalyst for discussion much of the debate emanates from philosophical conflict about how much the government needs to be involved in securing workers retirement incomes in the 1930s when social security was established the condition of society was much different from circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs4 7 reinhart hohaus an actuary with the metropolitan life insurance company and member of two of the earliest social security advisory councils wrote in 1938 that social insurance aims primarily at providing society with some protection against one or more major hazards which are sufficie ntly widespread throughout the population and far reaching in effect to become social in scope and complexion usually these risks are not many in number yet if not guarded against by some organized means they produce large dependency problems that take their toll in terms not only of financial but of human values as well directed against dependency problem social insurance is generally compulsory not voluntary giving the individual for whom it is intended choice as to membership nor can he as rule select the kind and amount of protection or the price to be paid for all indeed social insurance views society as whole and deals with the individual only as so far as he constitutes one small element of that whole consistent with this philosophy its first objective in the matter of benefits should therefore be that those covered by it will so far as possible be assured of that minimum income which in most cases will prevent their becoming charge of society from reinhart hohaus equity adequacy and related factors in oldage security the record v 37 american institute of actuaries 1938today the country was just emerging from depression unemployment was high and poverty was widespread in the aggregate the nation is much wealthier today in 1935 the unemployment rate stood at 20 down from 25 in 1933 for much of 1999 it was under 45 disposable per capita income adjusted for inflation is more than four times higher now average earnings similarly adjusted are 23 times the 1937 level by some estimates in the early 1930s more than half of the elderly were in state of economic dependency in 1998 the overall poverty rate for people age 65 and older was 105 lower than the rate for the total us population while much of the drop can be attributed to social security 63 of the elderly had income in 1996 from personal assets and 41 from other pensions almost half of employed workers over age 15 today have employerprovided pension coverage 62 of fulltime yearround workers age 2554 have it some 41 of households own stock 43 have iras keogh plans or other taxfavored savings arrangements 31 have life insurance 23 own savings bonds and 65 own their own homes with an even higher percentage between 70 and 80 for the elderly while these figures show gaps as well as economic advancement they raise the question of whether the program established in the 1930s is the program needed for the 21st century and specifically whether the societal floor that social security affords todays retirees needs to be as large and extensive in the future as was assumed necessary in the past those who advocate for the current system argue that while economic conditions have improved social security still fulfills much of its original purpose when the system was created its role was generally viewed as earnings replacement not wealth accumulation it was response to the dire economic conditions of the early 1930s and its proponents saw it as an eventual means of keeping large segment of the workforce from slipping into poverty in old age it was to provide lasting floor of protection means of affording the nations workers with at least minimal income during retirement without having to rely on welfare7 while on the whole the elderly are much better off today in many respects they have achieved economic well being equal to or greater than the nonelderly social security remains the dominant source of their retirement income all other things held constant social security lifted some 41 of the elderly out of poverty in 1996 certainly for some it simply adds to their wealth augmenting an already ample income from other sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs5 8 the social security tax rate is divided into three components under the law one is for the old age and survivors oasi part of the social security system the second is for the disability insurance di part and the third is for the hospital insurance hi part of the medicare program the combined rate of tax for the three parts paid by employees and employers is 153 106 percentage points are credited to the oasi trust fund 18 percentage points are credited to the di trust fund and 29 percentage points are credited to the hi trust fund employees and employers each pay half of these rates on the earnings of the employee in 2000 the oasi and di portions are levied on earnings up to 76200 indexed continuedhowever the elderly are economically diverse while only 4 of aged married couples had incomes below the poverty line in 1996 the figure for single men was 13 and for single women 20 to the extent that census bureau surveys accurately reflect the elderlys wellbeing social security accounted for 40 of the aggregate income of the population 65 and older as such it was their largest single source of income with earnings from work pensions and asset income running distant second third and fourth for 66 social security represented more than half of their income for onethird of social security recipients it represented 90 of their income and for 18 it represented 100 calling it the nations most successful social program advocates of the current system seek to preserve its socalled safety net features and want its benefit provisions held constant to the maximum extent possible they contend that to adopt more individualized system where how well one invests becomes critical to workers eventual retirement well being would be too big risk for too many of the most economically vulnerable in society they see the current program as filling necessary role for government arguing that it would be too difficult for too many to successfully navigate personal investments into an adequate retirement income others however contend that society has changed that its large middle class is much more capable today than in the 1930s of participating in retirement investment system that does not rely on the government and that doesnt have at its roots mandated transfer of income from workers to the aged and disabled they argue that social security perpetuates itself as the dominant source of retirement income because people have become too dependent on it they argue that employers workers and the nations infrastructure of financial and investment institutions have evolved to the point where provision of retirement safety net longer needs to be as large governmental function as it is today they argue that given adequate incentives and governmental encouragement perhaps even mandate people would be able to use the same social security tax dollars to save effectively for retirement on their own possibly achieving greater returns and economic wellbeing than afforded by politicallydriven governmental system the case for collective investment the investment process used by the current social security system is collective one meaning that it is for the benefit of social security recipients overall not any one recipient social security taxes go into the us treasury and two social security trust funds are credited with federal securities8 there is segmenting of these trusthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs6 8 continued thereafter to wage growth the hi portion is levied on all earnings approximately 67 of aggregate social security tax receipts are currently credited to the oasi fund 11 are credited to the di fund and 22 are credited to the hi fund 9 workers social security record is credited with earnings derived from the annual submission to the government of w2 information by employers and schedule ses from the self employed this action occurs totally independently of fica and seca taxes being withheld and deposited in the treasury the social security record does not nor is there any need for benefit or eligibility purposes reflect whether and how much tax worker actually pays 10 in the year 2000 tax income credited to the system is estimated by the trustees at 501 billion expenditures are estimated at 410 billion in effect 82 of the systems current income goes to meet current expenditures tax income is projected to fall below expenditures in 2015 and remain so indefinitely thereafter 11 it should be understood that the commingling of funds is different than that practiced by any large financial institution the treasury in this case operates as cash management device as in bank the depositors money doesnt sit idle for the subsequent use of the depositor it is put to work by the bank to make loans or to meet the other immediate cash needs of the bank the depositors account is credited and when subsequently drawn upon the bank makes good using whatever funds it has available from the cash it has on hand 12 section 201d of the social security act states that such investments may be made only in interestbearing obligations of the united states or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the united states 13 section 201d allows the secretary to purchase interestbearing obligations of the united states or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the united states on continuedfunds into separate accounts for each taxpayer and persons social security record is credited or in any other way affected by the payment of these taxes as with income taxes and other levies the government takes in social security tax dollars are commingled in the treasury for general use not for any one individual an individuals social security record reflects only the earnings and wages on which his or her taxes were levied9 the benefits recipient receives are not based on the taxes he or she paid as they would be in an ira or 401ktype account but on record of those earnings averaged over much of the persons working years formula is applied to that average and benefit is then derived that benefit is paid from the treasury and the balance of the social security trust funds is reduced accordingly in most months the aggregate benefit outgo to all recipients is relatively close to the aggregate income received from all taxpayers10 since the money is commingled any excess social security cash the government receives is used for any of the governments many other functions the trust funds are then given higher level of federal securities to reflect the excess11 the securities represent the investments of the trust funds which are limited by law to us government or governmentbacked securities12 the range of investment options has been deliberately limited to federal securities since the inception of the program and even with this constricted practice the treasury department has rarely been market player13 instead of going into the markets to buy and sell federal securities thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs7 13 continued original issue or at the market price only where he determines that the purchase of such other obligations is in the public interest the treasurys longheld view is that it will obtain or issue marketable securities to the trust funds only if there is some reason of overriding national policy as matter of practice the secretary of the treasury has made such judgments sparingly and confined the acquisition of marketables for the trust funds to meet perceived need to stabilize particular market not the general market in federal securities most notably when prices were falling or in need of support 14 the value of these securities upon issuance ie their par value never changes they are always recorded on the trust funds at their par value regardless of market conditions as such they are referred to as special issues the only thing that varies with market conditions is the interest rates assigned to them section 201d of the act states that these bonds shall bear interest at rate equal to the average market yield computed by the managing trustee the secretary of the treasury on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue on all marketable interest bearing obligations of the united states then forming part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of 4 years from the end of such month treasury department issues and redeems special nonmarketable securities directly to and from the trust funds what is basically an internal bookkeeping practice securities that bear an approximation of current market interest rates but whose principal does not fluctuate with changing market conditions14 as such the investments of the trust funds merely mimic the market in federal securities the purpose being not to interfere with the market nor to advantage or disadvantage the social security trust funds as practical matter the trust funds represent an authority to spend operating more or less like large checking account for the recipient population as whole meaning that as long as there are federal securities posted to them the treasury department has legal authority and is required by law to issue benefit checks to recipients perhaps the most important distinction is that these trust fund investments do not enhance an individuals social security benefits in fact it is largely irrelevant to the individual what the trust fund investments earn since the investments are not earmarked for any single person if the trust fund balances rise or fall more than expected it does not affect the level of individual social security payments it is only the individuals earnings history the benefit formula and the related benefit computation rules in the law that will affect the benefit amount except in relatively abstract sense the individual has stake in the investment outcome of the system obviously there would be an effect if the system were unable to finance his or her benefits because of an inadequate income stream number of proposals have emerged over the past few years calling for more expansive investment policy among them is plan proposed by president clinton that calls for investing portion of the trust funds in the financial markets the belief is that an actively managed fund that took advantage of investment yields from stocks and corporate bonds would raise the income of the social security trust funds this was part of the presidents january 1999 plan to credit the funds with portion of the projected federal budget surpluses some 28 trillion worth over the next 15 years and use portion of this amount to buy stocks it was similarly reflected in his latest plan january of 2000 to credit the funds with the interest savings resulting fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs8 15 his january 1999 plan called for crediting the trust funds with 28 trillion worth of 49 trillion in projected federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years and using 21 of such amounts to buy stocks 6 trillion revised plan he announced in june 1999 called for crediting the funds with the interest savings resulting from using social security surpluses to reduce publiclyheld federal debt in the form of stocks until the stock portion of the overall trust fund holdings reached 15 in draft bill sent to congress on october 26 1999 subsequently introduced as hr 3165 gephardt s 1828 moynihan and s 1831 daschle he dropped this part of the plan the trust fund infusions were instead all to be in the same form as todays trust fund holdings special nonmarketable federal securities however in his budget for fy2001 he proposed partial stock investment again in the same form as his june 1999 plan the new trust fund infusions would begin in fy2011 the social security administrations actuaries estimated that they would range from 987 billion in fy2011 to 2049 billion in 2016 and thereafter with all such infusions ending in 2050 and that plan would extend the life of the system until 2054 16 see social security administration report of the 19941996 advisory council on social security washington january 1997 17 in making longrange projections of the impact of various social security reform plans considered by the 19941996 advisory council the office of the actuary relied on analysis of joel m dickson of the vanguard group inc which indicated that the real yield on stock continuedproponents of collective investment argue that more expansive trust fund investm ent policy could lessen the need for eventual tax increases and spend ing cuts to shore up the systemreduction of publiclyheld federal debt engendered by his plan in the form of stocks15 the same theme can be found in one of three alternative proposals suggested in 19941996 social security advisory council report the socalled maintain benefits plan which would have kept the systems benefit structure essentially intact by addressing most of the longrange problem with revenue increases including an eventual rise in the payroll tax and minor benefit cuts to close the remaining gap its proponents suggested that congress consider authorizing investment of up to 40 of the social security trust funds in the stock market16 it also is reflected in hr 633 and hr 990 bartlett hr 871 markey hr 1043 nadler and hr 2717 defazio in the 106th congress hr 336 solomon in the 105th congress and to proposals of former social security commissioner robert ball and brookings institution economists henry aaron and robert reischauer most call for creation of an independent or quasigovernment board to manage the funds foremost among the arguments for more expansive investment policy is that it could lessen the need for tax increases or benefit cuts to restore the social security systems long range solvency based on historical average investment returns from stocks and corporate bonds the office of the actuary of the social security administration has consistently projected higher investment income from proposals that would invest portion of the trust funds in the financial markets17 with congress having tried twicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs9 17 continued ie discounting inflation averaged approximately 7 annually from 1900 to 1995 this was greatly in excess of the projected 23 real annual yield assumed at that time for continued trust fund investment in government bonds since that time in analysis of numerous alternative proposals the actuaries have continued to project higher yield on stocks than government bonds albeit projecting higher real return on bonds in the latest social security trustees report ie 3 annually than in 1995 although there also has been some recent debate about methodology and technical adjustments that might justify projected return on stocks of say 6 or 65 annually see for instance november 1999 report of technical panel on assumptions and methods of the social security advisory board the actuaries continue to reflect substantial premium for investments in stock over the current investment practices employed for the trust funds 18 major reform packages enacted in 1977 during the carter administration pl 95216 and in 1983 during the reagan administration pl 9821 included various combinations of tax increases and spending constraints including payroll tax hikes partial income taxation of social security benefits revised benefit formula phasingin of higher ages for receipt for full benefits delay in costofliving adjustments and mandatory coverage of employees of the federal government and nonprofit organizations 19 it should be understood that just because the actuaries project higher return from stocks and bonds it does not necessarily mean that it is likely the actuarys basically are looking at past performance of the markets for guidance in making projections they are more able to project future returns than any other forecasters in the securities business as stated in all mutual fund prospectuses past returns on investment are not predictor of future performance and the future is as uncertain for the actuaries as it is for any other forecaster of economic eventsin the past 25 years to shore up the system with incremental tax increases and benefit constraints the systems defenders are somewhat wary of doing so again while acknowledging that some such actions may be necessary from political perspective they consider none of them good the message such changes send is that you again need to pay more taxes for less benefits18 while the purpose ie achieving solvency may have positive ring another round of tax increases or spending cuts may be met with considerable doubt thus to the extent the status quo can be maintained by showing of higher potential investment income options are avoided that could further sap public confidence19 an underlying objective of this approach is to preserve the social nature of the system which its defenders view as setting it apart from other means of retirement saving from their perspective it provides society with insurance against poverty other system with the exception of welfare programs attempts to assure the elderly as group of minimal retirement income unlike an employer pension plan social security provides lower wage earners with greater return on their social security taxes than it does for higher wage earners and it pays extra benefits if worker has dependents including dependent spouse while benefits are indirectly related to the payment of payroll taxes the earned right notion embedded in social security is not complete not exact supporters feel however that the flavor it carries of being an earned right that is paid for has been strong basis for the publics general support of the system if taxes were to rise too much they fear public support could be eroded by perceptions that people were not getting their moneys worth that they are paying too much for too little return or converselyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs10 20 these are mutual funds or related financial instruments whose holdings represent the stock of companies who make up one or another of the stock markets composite indices such as the sp 500 these funds attempt to mirror the performance of the particular index involvedarguing that if the markets can be used to enhance the wealth of individuals collective investment proponents ask why cant they be used to increase the return for the social security systemif benefits were to fall significantly the safety net features of the system would be diminished they fear that the result of turning social security into an individualized system would be that the most economically vulnerable and unfortunate would be forced to rely on welfaretype programs and that welfare programs do not fare well in the allocation of public resources ultimately they fear greater disparity of wealth among the aged and disabled an economic phenomena that already is evolving in society as whole as the very well off get richer while lower and middle income segments see little or only modest economic improvement while social security may be an inefficient incometransfer program they see it as hedge against rising income disparities and as an effective means of keeping major segment of the aged and disabled out of poverty without the trappings denigration and public distaste of welfare programs in political sense promoting an expansive investment policy takes advantage of an idea that the systems advocates would not otherwise be expected to pursue ie they would not instinctively seek to make use of the financial markets calling for such has been mantra of those seeking to individualize or privatize social security proponents of an individualized account system have argued for years for use of the investment potential of the markets to power system that does not rely on taxes and the government the systems defenders attempt to coopt the issue by arguing that if the markets can be used to enhance the wealth of individuals why cant they be used to increase the return for the social security system in sense their approach is to share the advantages of markets with the group as whole they recognize that the public has misgivings about having the government invest in private businesses and that policymakers have resisted such practice but they contend that an effective means can be established to insulate the trust funds and therefore the nations businesses from political influence and manipulation they advocate creation of quasigovernment investment board or entity to manage the funds similar to that used for the federal employees thrift savings plan with perhaps the independence and stature of the federal reserve board to avoid preference being shown for one industry or company over another they recommend the use of market index funds20 they contend that state and local governments have engaged in market investments on behalf of their pension systems for years without adversely affecting the returns those funds earn nor exercising undue influence on the businesses they invest inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs11 those pursuing market investment of the trust funds contend that doing so disper ses risks inherent in an individualized account systemmuch of the appeal of individual accounts emanates from the dramatic gains seen over the past two decades in stock indices such as the dow jones industrial average and the standard and poors 500 sp 500 moreover the proliferation of 401k plans and other employmentbased individual account arrangements has demonstrated the popularity and workability of an individualized retirement savings system however individual accounts do put the risk of adverse market performance on the individual not the employer or the government the social security systems defenders argue that the tendency to look at averages of past market performance and deduce that individuals can achieve those results indefinitely in the future oversimplifies the complexity of investing and minimizes the effects of individual responses to risk and expanded choices markets are volatile and do not always go up moreover they dont have predictable pattern and investors timing may be off simply stated when they enter and exit the markets is important the dow jones industrial average has risen 10fold from 1983 to the present but it began and ended the preceding15year period at the same level individuals also may suffer from the choices they make assuming individua l stock choices were to be permissible under reform arrangement even within generally uptrending market there are always sectors that do poorly and studies of 401k behavior show that large number of people who participate have invested far too conservatively undercutting the potential of longterm compounding of market returns and tax deferrals if annuitization is mandated the value of the account will be fixed at the point of retirement even if the account accumulation has been eroded by temporary downturn in the market critics also contend that the potential market returns that individual account proponents cite ignore the potential costs of annuitization annuity providers assume the risk of underestimating longevity and changes in interest rates they therefore exact price from annuity purchasers for assuming that risk as well as for the administrative and marketing expenses they incur critics contend that these costs can be large and significantly erode the net returns achievable through individual investment accounts in contrast to these approaches proponents of collective investment point out that it not only shares the markets gains but disperses its adversities by protecting the individual from volatility social security takes an element of fear and uncertainty out of retirement social security portfolio of marketable securities might drop during an adverse period but the amount of an individuals benefits would be unaffected they contend that just like the gains the losses would be absorbed by the system as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs12 proponents of collective investment contend that it has built in economies of scale not achievabl under system of individual accountsproponents of collective investment also argue that it is likely to carry economieso f scale not achievable in an individualized account system in an individualized system millions of investors could potentially make millions of trades daily each with some form of transaction charge ie broker commission under collective approach stocks and bonds would be purchased in large blocks presumably at lower per unit cost by fund managers with more investment expertise than most individuals would be expected to have in effect in system of collective investment society would reap the benefits of the markets without much of the transaction costs that individuals would incur supporters of individual accounts counter that the use of limited number of investment companies and investing only through market index funds could mitigate such costs but supporters of collective investment contend that even these changes could not match the institutional savings inherent in collective approach less transaction costs would result not only from buying and selling in large blocks but from less trading and churning of the markets under an individualized system each account holder would have stake in the outcome and thus potentially would become market player as such they would likely trigger considerably more turnover of assets than if an equivalent amount of funds were collectively invested manager investing in particular sector on behalf of the social security trust funds might buy 10 stocks month individuals wanting to do the same might collectively drive millions of buy orders and sell them sooner than experienced stock managers who would be expected to be more deliberative and disciplined in their approach and longer term in perspective collective approach also would avoid the creation of sales and marketing costs as well as employee investor educational expenses in effect society would avoid whole layer of business activity designed to attract and educate millions of individual investors supporters of collective investment view these as dead costs as dollars that could be more effectively employed as investments if single board or quasigovernmental entity were responsible rather than millions of account holders funneling money into the markets through numerous investment companies in other countries where individualized systems were adopted marketing expenses intended to attract individual account holders to specific investment companies are alleged to have detracted heavily from the potential returns moreover educating the workforce to become savvy investor s would create an expensive societal overhead cost someone would have to pay the employer the investment company and perhaps the government if paid by the employer less contributions would be made to the individuals account or some other aspect of employee compensation would be reduced ie be less than it otherwise would be if paid by the investment company the return on investment would be eroded if paid by the government the tax burden would be higher there would be free lunch people would have to become educated investors and someone would have to pay for that education proponents of collective investment contend that these costs are not minor that they would put substantial drag on the true returns people would be able to achieve in an individualized systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs13 those wanting to strengthen the current system through collective investment feel that it avoids the inherent complexities and anxieties of growing individual accounts some economists argue that collective investme nt approach potentially avoids or lessens savings leakages that woul d arise under an individualized systeman individua lized system also would be expected to add new dimension of complexity to peoples lives the simplest manifestation of this effect is in the increased record keeping it would dictate for the employer employee account manager and the investment company making the market transactions even in an era of advanced automation more accounting also means more errors at any stage of human involvement mistake can be made errors are time consuming and expensive to fix since corrections are not usually subject to automation social security now has relatively low error rate simply stated an individualized system by definition requires more attention moreover critics of an individualized system contend that attentiveness to the process does not assure better outcomes too much attention could lead to too much market churning in an exaggerated sense individualized accounts could turn the nations workers into society of market players with all the potential trappings of obsessive attention to the vagaries of market behavior more choice also means more complexity in peoples lives with the likelihood of increased anxiety about and during retirement in effect there could be psychological costs for society as whole in addition while it is likely that people generally would become better investors they would be diverted to some undefined extent from other potentially more productive facets of their lives economists generally are agreed that to the extent the nation can save at higher rate in the coming years the potential demographic strains imposed by the baby boomers retirement and the gradual aging of society could be more easily accommodated some express cautious note about converting social security into an individualized system pointing out that because large number of people save today on their own creation of new savings system might cause them to reduce the savings they already do through other means as people see their new accounts grow they might ask themselves why they need to save as much elsewhere such as in their 401ks or iras to the extent they reduce those other savings national savings are less simply stated critics of individual accounts contend that they are likely to cause leakages in the nations savings system they argue that collectively investing portion of the social security trust funds would have fewer such effects individuals would not see the accumulation of wealth through new individual accounts and to the extent they do not see any obvious changes in their potential social security benefits they would be less inclined to alter their other savings behavior hence advocates of collectively investing given sum of social securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs14 21 the new rothtype iras also can be annuitized at any age prior to retirement once theyve been held for 5 yearsothers contend that collectively investing through social security potentially avoids pressures to make alternative use of monies intended for retirement defenders of the current system argue that it provides more stable base of retirem ent income for workers to build upon than an individualized system woulddollars argue that doing so would have greater positive economic impact on the whole than the same amount invested in individual accounts advocates of collective investment contend that individualized account s might create other types of savings leakages as well namely consum ption of the accumulated sums before retirement social security allows for the pre retirement payment of benefits only for disability or death the exclusivity of these nonretirement uses has held up for 60 years critics of individualized accounts contend that the assets that would build up in them even if intended for retirement purposes are likely to be eroded by demands to make them available for other nonretirement purposes they believe that demands for early liquidation for variety of lifes needs would become too strong and eventually the political process would succumb other existing tax deferred savings vehicles 401ks and the like already allow for loans and lumpsum withdrawals to be made prior to retirement even when sometimes subjected to considerable penalty iras can now be drawn down to purchase house finance the cost of education and cover extraordinary medical expenses21 critics of individualized accounts argue that given the political pressures that are likely to emerge the expectation that new personal savings accounts would be viable replacement for social security retirement benefits may be illusory they argue that social security offers much greater assurance that funds collectively invested in the markets will be preserved for retirement defenders of the current system also argue that the beauty of social security is that it provides stable base of retirement income for workers to build upon they see it as form of societal guarantee while acknowledging that social security does not provide the degree of certainty of contractuallyprescribed benefit they contend that the economic factors that influence its financial viability are much less volatile than the financial markets people dont suffer abrupt changes in their social security benefits because interest rates change suddenly or the market rises or falls sharply they argue that social security allows people to better plan for retirement because it provides relatively predictable source of retirement income ie at least in terms of the amount of preretirement earnings it will replacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs15 22 unified budget surplus represents surplus of governmental tax receipts taking virtually all of the governments many functions together including social security and other programs accounted for through federal trust funds these surplus receipts dont sit idle in the absence of legislative measures that would increase spending or reduce taxes the excess money is automatically used to reduce the debt it happens as the treasury department pays off holders of federal securities public debt when they mature and when it buys up outstanding federal securities in the open markets as part of its debt management responsibilities the reader should note that the federal debt is comprised of two basic parts debt held by the public and debt held by governmental accounts such as the social security trust funds when policymakers discuss using budget surpluses to reduce the governments debt they are talking about reducing the portion held by the public this is the only portion that influences the financial marketssome argue that collectively investing in the name of social secu rity carries potentially larger fiscal policy benefitmany proponents of individualized accounts contend that minimum guarantees investment limitations and strong regulatory oversight can be employed to effectively provide an equivalent amount of societal guarantees critics contend however that the more this is done the less the market returns would be and the more the new system would look like reshuffled social security system that it wouldnt be better just different they contend that the more proponents of an individualized system attempt to achieve social ends the more illusory their goal becomes advocates of collective investment also see fiscal policy benefit to their approach using some or all of annual social security surpluses for investment in the markets reduces the overall amount of budget surpluses available to federal policymakers for tax reductions or new spending programs it has the same or similar positive effect on the economy as reducing the amount of outstanding federal debt since money that would otherwise be used to pay off holders of government debt would be invested directly in the markets debt reduction has been major theme of the current administration and congress in theory reducing the portion of the federal debt held by the public frees up money in the financial markets for savings and investment when the holder of government security is paid off the perception is that most of the proceeds are reinvested in private securities or enterprises this makes more capital available and dampens interest rates ultimately this influx of new capital could lead to larger economy in the future one that might be better able to sustain the rise in projected government entitlement expenditures when the baby boomers retire proponents of collective investment contend that it is more effective approach to guaranteeing the use of budget surpluses for economic growth than trying to hold an elusive political consensus to reduce the governments outstanding debt22 while the current administration and congress appear committed to making debt reduction priority use of budget surpluses the politics of this issue could change at some future point it may be difficult for later president or congress to fend off calls for tax cuts or spending increases recession

congressional budget office cbo estimates there will be unified budget surplus of 176 billion in fy2000 of that amount 153 billion is attributable to social security the remaining 23 billion is attributable to the rest of the governments activities this latter figure however reflects the effect of making 67 billion in intragovernmental payments to the social security trust funds representing interest and other internal credits from the government to the trust funds as internal payments they create real governmental outlays but for accounting purposes they show up as receipts to the trust funds and outlays to the rest of the budget if these internal payments are ignored the portion of the estimated budget surplus due exclusively to excess social security tax receipts is only 86 billion using the former scoring approach cbo estimates that 23 trillion of its projected 32 trillion in cumulative unified budget surpluses over the next 10 years would be attributable to social security using the latter scoring approach 1 trillion would be attributable to social security derived from cbos the budget and economic outlook january 2000 and other unpublished cbo estimatessome feel that investing part of the trust funds in the markets provides the current system with protective financing cushion long rangefor new spending social security is sometimes referred to as the third rail of american politics touch it and you die thus proponents of collective investment argue that if the law called for use of social security surpluses for investment in the markets the public could be expected to raise clamor if someone wanted to use them for some other purpose the claim could be made that the budget surpluses involved are excess social security dollars and are needed to make social security investments to use them in some other way would weaken the system thus the specter of misusing social security funds would emerge raising formidable rhetorical obstacle against any attempt to use that portion of the budget surpluses for some other purpose23 proponents of this approach also see secondary benefit in the long range in addition to potentially increasing the rate of return on the systems current holdings they perceive market investment of some of its assets as giving it protective cushion from the perspective of an investment manager the system would gain the benefit of diversification although debt reduction may be priority of federal policymakers today many uses have been proposed for newly emerging budget surpluses in fiscal policy sense collectively investing some or all of the portion attributable to social security surpluses would provide more secure store of assets for the system in the long run it would be different from simply crediting the trust funds with more government securities and then attempting to use the cash for debt reduction in the latter case while the money would be credited to the social security system the budget surpluses themselves could be used for something other than debt reduction namely tax reductions or new spending once enacted those alternative uses might be difficult to roll back under this scenario the government would have created other longrun fiscal pressures less revenue or more spending on other activities and potentially higher interest costs from not having used the money for debt reduction thus when the social security system needed to draw on its reserves of government securities to help meet its future benefit obligations there would be other

64 of currently working respondents stated that they did not think the social security system would have the money available to pay their expected retirement benefits gallup poll done in june 1999 found that 58 of the respondents felt the system needed major reforms or to be totally overhauled only 13 said it was fine the way it is 25 among them are great britain and chile whose reforms set

1994pressures on the government from decisions made today to commit budget surpluses to things other than debt reduction proponents of investing portion of the next 15 years of social security surpluses in the market argue that it has the dual benefit of 1 making less of the looming budget surpluses available for new spending and tax cuts and 2 giving the trust funds nongovernmental assets to liquidate ie an alternative source of financing when it longer has enough incoming receipts to cover its benefit commitments the case for individualized accounts proponents of creating system of individualized accounts see the current social security system as dinosaur relic of the depression era while the system has had its detractors since its inception todays proponents of an alternative non governmental approach are benefitting from sizeable degree of public discontent and apprehension about the current systems longrun viability as well as an unprecede nted run up in the stock market over the past two decades24 they also have been buoyed by reforms undertaken by other nations number of which had social insurance programs that predate the us system these countries have not only acceded to changing public sentiment about how to prepare for old age but have looked to reform of their governmental systems as tool of economic stimulus and advancement25 they contend that people will save for old age on their own provided the right savings incentives or mandates the use of payroll deductions and direct deposit strict governmental oversight of the investment institutions involved and appropriate limitations on the preretirement draw down of assets this they contend has been amply demonstrated by the proliferation and popularity of 401k and related taxdeferred individuallybased savings plans in the united states they argue that society longer needs big government tax and transfer system they concede that 65 years ago the nations employers and financial

for an individualized nongovernmen tal system has become possible they stress that the issue they are raising is not about whether people need to save for retirement death or disability they accept the necessity of having national mandate and structure to do so but more about how even those who propose voluntary personal account system argue that it would be voluntary only in the sense of substituting for persons social security participation not whether the person should be able to opt out of both they view the antipoverty role the government now plays as excessive while agreeing that there is still very much need for governmentrun safety net program they consider the dimensions of the current system too large they contend that there is need to transfer 500 billion annually of workers incomes to the elderly to deal with an aged poverty rate that is currently under 11 rate as low or lower than that of the other age group of the population and that the cost of alternative government run antipoverty efforts could be considerably less26 while it is alleged that social security keeps 41 of the elderly out of poverty they argue that the same or greater percentage could be kept out of poverty through mandatory employmentbased nongovernmental system they argue that the current system crowds out other means of retirement savings in two ways by imposing too large tax burden and by creating too much reliance on governmental income during retirement they contend that an individualized system is the only way to truly advancefund future retirement claims not only making them more secure than under governmental tax and transfer system but augmenting future economic growth with more politically resistant savings mechanism they dont refute the idea that people like social security today but contend that its acceptability does not emanate from it being an inherently better system they contend that its hard for people to question the worthiness of something that has evolved into being such substantial part of current retirees well being they view the statistics of how many people depend on social security as the problem not measure of its success contending that average workers today put so much into the system they havent got enough left over to save in more productive fashion if people could put some or all of their social security taxes elsewhere they argue that social security would be far less important source of future retirement income and that would happen by choice the widerange of ideas that proponents of an individualized system are pursuing reflects an entirely new way of looking at alterations to social security unlike past attempts to shore up the system it is not about changing the systems benefit rules or making modest changes in its revenues or other sources of financing these traditional approaches are not central to the newer thinking of proponents of individualized accounts they want to take the debate

benefits would eventually need to be constrained the presidents january 1999 reform plan included similar approach allocating portion of the then projected budget surpluses to new personal accounts supplemented by workers own contributions and government match the new accounts were to be targeted toward low and moderate income workers the administration has since given mixed signals as to how the proposal was to be viewed although there was some initial expression that these accounts were to be viewed as part of social security reform plan and thereby as supplements to social security benefits administration officials subsequently stated that the proposed accounts were to be viewed as free standing savings instruments designed to fill gaps in the nations private pension system the context for presentation was changed not the reality of their being supplements to social securityall of them have in common is that the current system would be smaller and perhaps eventually phased out entirely it is only at that juncture however that there is commonality for the ideas range from massive nearly immediate overhaul to gradual transformation taking half century or more to complete single idea best reflects what advocates desire for some participation in new individualized system would be voluntary for others it would be mandatory some would keep large remnant of the current system either as matter of principle to keep some continuity of government supported safety net or simply to reflect the eventual lack of resources that the current system is projected to face others see the current system being phased out completely some would do it quickly others contemplate long transition some provide considerable freedom of investment choices while others confine them to very regimented choices managed by limited number of investment companies finally some involve carving out resources for the new accounts from existing social security taxes while others would use additional wage withholding or alternatively general government resources ie budget surpluses in its most modest form the creation of an individualized account system would be done without altering social security this approach reflected in number of recent bills would require that future budget surpluses be used to set up personal accounts with market investment options for people currently paying social security taxes the expressed view is that social security will eventually have to be constrained and the creation of these accounts could help fill the benefit gap in the future27 at the other end of the spectrum are proposals that would rapidly transform social security into new individualized system hr 249 sanford and hr 874 porter of the 106th congress would allow workers to divert 8 and 10 percentage points respectively of the current 106 oasi tax rate ie the employeeemployer combined rate into new personal accounts these are often referred to as carve out plans since the

gradually replacing its retirement benefits with flatrate governmental benefits based on length of service and private personal savings accounts funded with 5 percentage points of the oasi tax rate

points for the period from 2026 to 2038 and an amount thereafter based on the yearly excess of aggregate social security revenue over expenditures at retirement each participants social security benefits would be reduced by the amount of hypothetical annuity derived from their accounts30 examples of partial approaches include one proposed by two members of the 19941996 advisory council on social security including the chairman of the council and referred to as the individual account plan which would have required workers to contribute an extra 16 of their pay to new personal accounts to make up for social security benefit cuts the plan called for to restore the systems long range solvency another add on type plan ie funded with monies other than social security taxes suggested by

describe the rate of return that the trust funds are expected to earn as the rate of return that workers can expect to receive on their social security contributions they are different the trust fund rate of return does not effect the computation of workers benefits as previously explained social security is not defined contribution system where the value of ones benefits is based on the amount

potential to outgrow the value of future social security benefitsperhaps the foremost argument made by proponents of individual accounts is that they have the potential to grow much larger retirement incomes for people than the current social security system there isnt much debate about the markets averages outperforming social security in recent years while as social insurance system the potential rates of return vary considerably for people of different incomes and marital status the tilted benefit formula favors lowwage earners and the provision of dependent spouses benefits favors oneearner couples estimates by ssas actuaries in 1996 suggest that for people born the following year with subsequent careers of average earnings the real return on their social security contributions would be only 1 or so for lowearning workers it would be around 2 and for high wage earners it would be zero or negative ie they would not get back the value of their contributions33 they acknowledge that left to their own devices people dont achieve rate of return equal to stock market averages even experienced portfolio managers have difficult time doing so and most dont but they argue that with the emergence of index funds limitations on switching and mandated withdrawal annuitization and liquidation schedules many of the protective features of social security can be replicated while still allowing people to achieve larger retirement income from their private accounts than from social security they contend that even if people earned only longbond rate of return on their assets now

their self interest to feel so nonetheless opinion polls repeatedly suggest that there is considerable public skepticism at all ages and that it is most pronounced among younger workers the systems critics contend that younger people are not secure and dont feel good about the program many complain about having to pay more in social security taxes than income taxes and in their view the injustice is only compounded by expectations that they wont get their moneys worth proponents of individualized accounts say that younger workers frequently see advantages in saving through 401ks and other deferred compensation arrangements although social securitys defenders say it may be illusory to view ones 401k as more secure than social security its critics contend that there is tangible feeling of worth from direct ownership of ones individual savings account feeling not present under social security35 they argue that recognizing this is fundamental in addressing the publics

unpublished plan description prepared by mr ballperhaps the foremost argument made for an individualized system over colle ctive investment is that it avoids the issues of government intrusion in the nations businessessome contend that building an individual account component into the current system could actually strengthen its image even if the systems taxes were raised and benefits constrained to address its eventual insolvency the longrun outlook is for continuing decline of the rates of return the system will afford raising taxes or constraining expenditures to deal with its insolvency will only worsen those returns by incorporating new individual account feature into the system one that takes advantage of the present period of surpluses the shrinkage in the systems returns could be mitigated by the more favorable market returns earned by the new accounts as well as giving workers periodic measure of increasing net worth the perception is that growing retirement savings accounts could restore credibility in the entire system36 perhaps the foremost argument against collective investment is that it directly or indirectly makes the government market investor and given the sums of money involved potentially principal stockholder and thus owner of many of the nations businesses since the programs inception this has been the fundamental impediment to market investment of social security funds ie the fear of government intrusion into private enterprise the problem with government ownership of stocks is the potential for politics rather than the workings of competitive free market to determine the course of much of the nations business it steps across fundamental boundaries between the roles of government and private enterprise the fear is of the political manipulation of pressure being imposed on businesses to behave in manner that serves the best interest of political leader political party or ideological or vested interests other than those whose assets are at stake in the context of social security the concern is that political opportunity would take the place of serving the best interests of workers and future recipients it probably would not be blatant in fact most proposals attempt to guard against such however critics are concerned that with the trust funds being public enterprise whose charter is granted by law there are inherent pressures on policymakers that over time would blur any initial commitment to keep public and private policy interests separate they argue for instance that there would be an inevitable clash between achieving maximum investment returnshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs25 37 for discussion of these issues among state and local government plans and sampling of examples see crs report rl30218 state and local pension plans economically targeted investments and social responsibility screening by celinda franco edward rappaport and james storey may 25 1999those who are apprehensive about collective investment believe that governmental investment process could truly insulate business from political influenceand the holding of socially acceptable investments with private fund the fund manager is required to put the best interest of the fund participants first whether companies sell politically incorrect products ie potential carcinogens or fall into public disfavor as polluters alleged monopolists international opportuni sts or for having poor labor practices are less relevant factors in addressing whether pension plan should acquire their stock when the pension plan is the social security trust funds however there is clear public interest in the investments of the funds why some might ask should the trust funds own tobacco stocks or that of companies who export manufacturing jobs gouge consumers or sell products that harm the environment even if stock index were used why it might be asked not exclude them from the index critics of collective investment contend that there is end to where the line can be drawn between public and private interests they claim that there are clear examples of such behavior among state and local government pension plans that have invested in the markets37 generally they argue that an individualized system is the only way to avoid most of the issues of government intrusion into private enterprise particularly if investment discretion rests with the individual proponents of an individualized system feel strongly that body created for the purpose of conducting collective investment can be truly insulated from political influence ultimately federal law would dictate the creation of any investment board or governing body and the law that made it can be changed whatever the process appointments have to be made they allege that how they are made and why they are made cannot really be shielded from partisan or other related political influences they acknowledge that an investment body could be created with safeguards bipartisan representation rules mandating that the best interests of the covered workers be served the use of index funds guidelines for selection of investment companies sec oversight etc but contend that any such body would be independent in name only over time there would be erosion because there would not be enough individual self interest to truly guard against it in most instances individuals would not see nor could they be shown direct harm from any alleged political decision their benefits would not be impacted per proponents of individualized accounts contend that concern about such decision would not be nearly as large as if an investment body were directly responsible for ones personal wealth and well beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs26 advo cates of personal accounts contend that fear of the market is overblown and that ultimate pension risk is not confined to market volatilitycritics of an individualized system contend that whether policymakers want to create new individualized system or opt for market investment of the trust funds the action to do so could only occur through enactment of law they contend that just as congress would have to create board to undertake market investment of the trust funds it would have to set up an entity of some sort to oversee an individualized account system thus they argue that there really is difference in the potential political influence that could be exerted under either approach proponents of individualized accounts counter however that there is fundamental difference stemming from the fact that the money in the trust funds does not belong to any single individual whereas the money in an individual account does they argue that individuals would more readily react to political decision affecting their personal accounts than one affecting trust fund arrangement having direct bearing on their benefits simply put they contend that people are more apt to object to something that directly alters their own personal net worth as evidence of this they point out that change has been made in the now 13year old stock index fund the c fund of the federal employees thrift savings plan which is an individualized savings arrangement for federal workers similar to private sector 401k plan they also contend that fear of the markets volatility is overblown they argue that people participating in 401ks and like arrangem ents have generally learned to accept the markets fluctuations that they have learned to contend with the volatility or have opted for less risky investments eg bonds they argue that large share of the public owns stock has seen the markets occasional wild gyrations and have learned not to panic at each turn buy and hold diversification and averaging in are understood to be effective investment concepts and mutual funds portfolio management and money markets are modern phenomena that operate today with considerable success in mitigating the risks of total loss they argue that defenders of social security use periodic stock market declines to attempt to instill fear of moving social security to an individualized system and to intensify the perception that social security as it stands is more secure they argue that time is proven remedy for market drops once fallen does not mean that the equity values will never return and after 30 or 40 years of building an account retiree will not suddenly need to spend all of his or her depressed assets when the downturn occurs most of the account accumulation will not be needed for current consumption and will have time to recover its value they further contend that social security has its own set of risks foremost being the demographic risk associated with not having enough workers in the future to pay the taxes needed to make good on the promised benefits they point out that social securitys benefit package has been unilaterally changed in the past the full benefit age has been raised from 65 to 67 the benefit formula has been altered to reduce its generosity and colas have been delayed and can be changed again by some future congress thus they argue social security is subject to its own set of uniquehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs27 some argue that individualized accounts offer more secure way of earmarking budget surpluses for economic growthdemographic and political risks moreover while the stock market may be more volatile than the economic factors that effect social security over time social securitys finances can be adversely effected by business stagnation and deteriorating economic trends high inflation and unemployment triggered rapid erosion of the systems trust fund balances in the mid 1970s and early 1980s forcing congress to address both near and longterm problems with revenue increase s and benefit constraints proponents of individualized accounts contend that system public or private can optimally anticipate all the risks that may eventually alter its benefit streams they argue that the biggest risk in the current debate is that fear and complacency about how to save social security will cause the nation to miss an opportunity to build larger and more secure retirement incomes for future retirees proponents of individualized accounts also believe that it is more effective approach to guaranteeing the use of the emergin g budget surpluses for economic growth than using them to build larger social security trust funds regardless of whether budget surpluses were used to buy stock for the social security trust funds or used as means to reduce publicly held debt the ultimate disposition of the surpluses rests not with the taxpayers whose money creates them but with federal policymakers in other words individuals would not have direct say in how the money is used proponents of individualized accounts contend that there is big difference in the political sustainability of earmarking money for government trust fund or for debt reduction than earmarking it for individuals personal accounts if future federal policymakers decide that budget surpluses should be used to expand or create new programs or benefits one individual taxpayer can say that money is being taken from his or her account the impact is not discernible on an individual level however if policymakers wanted to forego depositing money into an individuals personal account so that some other use could be made of it there would be complaints by many of those affected while proponents acknowledge that in theory the law can be changed in either case ie to reduce the amounts earmarked for the social security trust funds or for individu accounts they contend that altering the rules for personal accounts would be much harder decision by policymakers today to invest part of budget surpluses in stock for the social security system could be superceded by policymakers in 2002 or 2004 or at any later time who decide to spend the money instead there might be heated rhetoric ie social security was being touched but there would be direct economic impact that individuals could see changing the rules so that less of the budget surpluses would go to individual accounts on the other hand would be direct and highly visible each individual having an account could be shown how much less they would get hence proponents of individualized accounts argue that these accounts are more politically secure way of ensuring the use of budget surpluses for increasing capital and economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs28 proponen ts of individualized accounts contend that it is real fix in contrast to collective market investment of the trust funds proponen ts of individualized accounts further argue that it would be better to enact the constraints needed to restore the current systems longrange solvency and buffer them with the creation of an individ ualized account systemproponents of an individualized system further argue that market investment of the trust funds is merely palliative in contrast to enacting tax increases or spending reductions that redefine the parameters and value of the system collective investment would not really alter the system its effectiveness as remedy to the systems financial woes relies directly on favorable market performance in order to have any positive effect the trust funds new investments would have to outperform government bonds return equal to that of bonds would be about the same as current law timing also is factor if the market does not produce premium over bonds early enough in the 75year projection period there would not be the extra build up of reserves needed to sustain the system beyond its projected insolvency point 2037 early capital growth in the system is necessary to get the benefit of compounding they further point out that if all that collective investment does is help bring the system into balance there would be room for misestimate and future social security benefits could be threatened in effect critics argue that if the market is risky for individuals in terms of rendering reasonable retirement income from personal accounts it is equally risky for the existing system as whole in terms of achieving financial solvency if the market doesnt perform but the impact is confined to individual accounts the social security system is not threatened as it would be if it also relied on market performan ce they charge that the only reason the systems proponents are advocating collective investment is to avoid having to take the hard medicine of raising taxes or constraining the systems future benefits they argue that it would be better to enact the necessary constraints to the system and buffer them with the creation of an individualized account system in this way they believe that the systems solvency would be better assured and even if the market did not perform well individuals would still be building something on their own to buffer any future social security cuts they contend that it would be easier to enact the constraints today and allow for their gradual implementation than to wait until insolvency is imminent they speculate that if the projections upon which the benefit reductions were based proved to be pessimistic there would be room to raise benefits in the future politically it would be easier to raise them then than to cut them once againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs29 38 in the case of fleming v nestor 363 us 603 1960 the supreme court took the position that workers interest in social security was not contractual and cannot be soundly analogized to that of holder of an annuity whose rights to benefits are bottomed on his contractual premium paym ents to engraft upon the program concept of accrued property rights would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to ever changing conditions which it demands in contrast to the creation of individualized accounts some fear that buildi ng larger trust fund could become an irresistible source of future spendingthe financing concept behind collective investment is that the building of larger trust funds than under current law will provide needed resources to draw on when the systems income longer is sufficient to meet its expenditures in theory its purpose is to advance fund more of the resources that will be needed in the future while not different in an economic sense from advance funding future retirement incomes through individual accounts there is large difference in who controls the disposition of the funds proponents of individual accounts argue that an individual controls the ultimate use of the money that is drawn from them third parties ie federal policymakers control the disposition of the social security trust funds if an individual account were to grow larger than expected the individual would decide what to do with the extra money ie spend it or save it the money is theirs in contrast greaterthan anticipated success with trust fund investments in their view would lead to larger trust fund balance providing future politicians with welcome surpluses to spend for instance to the extent the economy did better than expected or demographic conditions improved larger trust fund might provide funds for general expansion of the program even though an individuals taxes helped create the surplus that person would have direct say on how it was used proponents of an individualized system contend that it is very hard for lawmakers to resist the many complaints and inequities raised about social security and point out that the urge to fix them is evident in the many bills routinely introduced to address myriad of issues created by the systems current structure and benefit rules they contend that payasyougo financing of the current system gives it needed discipline by its nature payasyougo requires careful scrutiny of possible new benefits as such it creates needed firewall between politically popular ideas and good public policy when they clash policymakers can always argue that taxes would have to be raised or the systems financing would be threatened if every great new idea were enacted in effect it tests policymakers resolve they further argue that government doesnt need to advance fund mandatory pension system when it can alter the systems benefits or financing arrangements unilaterally this right of the federal government was long ago tested in the courts38 recognizing this flexibility early on the notion that the system would be financed on payasyougo basis was decided with passage of amendments in 1939 the year before it began paying benefits and in the years since as long as its future income and outgo were estimated to be in reasonable balance its trustees havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30571crs30 declared the system to be financially sound critics of collective investment accept the justification for contingency reserve to assure the treasury department does not have to return to congress every year or frequently to obtain the right to pay benefits they see it however only as reserve of spending authority not reserve of real resources from which funds are actually drawn to pay benefits why invest reserve in the markets that is needed only as contingent authority to write checks the money ultimately comes from the governm ents authority to tax under the constitution they contend that reserve for more than contingencies is simply an invitation to spend for benefit increases
