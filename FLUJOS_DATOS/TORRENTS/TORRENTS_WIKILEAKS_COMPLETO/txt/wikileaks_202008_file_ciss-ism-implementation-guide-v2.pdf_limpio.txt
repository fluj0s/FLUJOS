information officer release 203 15 february 2006unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide preface preface this implementation guide is part of the documentation set for the common information sharing standard ciss for information security marking ism the other part of the set is data element dictionary appendix b reference 3 this guide serves to instruct managers and deve lopers on the processes and methods required to adhere to this standard in the collaborative and collateral shared spaces defined by the ic system for information sharing icsis and on implem enting and extending this standard to meet organizationspecific needs ciss ism is an implementation of the world wide web consortium w3c specification of the extensible markup language xml appendix b reference 5 it consists of set of xml attributes that may be used to associate securityrelated metadata with xml elements in documents webservice transactions or data streams it is distributed as both an xml entity set and w3c xml schema wxs so that the xml attributes defined in the standard can be incorporated into any xml document type definition dtd or schema made available along with the ciss ism entity set and wxs are controlled vocabularies of terms that are used as the sources for the values of the ciss ism attributes the first section of this implementation guide is an introduction that addresses applicability and the target audience the second section is description of th xml components that constitute the ciss ism entity set and wxs the third section explains how to include the ciss ism entities or attribute groups in xml dtds or sche mas accordingly and how to extend the entity set and wxs to support local requirements sec tion 4 contains illustrations of graphical user interfaces as the preferred method of specifying values for the ciss ism attributes section 5 explains how to use the attributes to cr eate portion marks security banners and

implementation guide introduction 1 introduction 11 what this publication is all about this implementation guide explains how to use the common information sharing standard for information security marking ciss ism standa rd to apply classification and controls tokens to extensible markup language xml documents and data streams the ciss ism consists of vocabulary of agreedupon xml attributes that were developed by panel of the intelligence community metadata working group ic mwg to support the controlled access program coordination office capco guidelines for security markings appendix b reference 2 this guide will help organizations tag xml data in such way that capcocompliant security markings can be generated using standardized transformations and formatting this guide should be used in conjunction with the ciss ism data element dictionary ded version 10 appendix b reference 3 the ded contains definitions of all of the ciss ism attributes 12 applicability this guide applies to intelligence documents or serialized data streams created in xml format for interchange within the national security community the intent is to provide common set of classification and controls xml attributes that may be associated with any xml data elements and used for categorization and selection as well as formatting of portion marks security banners and classificationdecl assification blocks ciss ism is not intended to address business rules associ ated with using security metadata and is therefore not replacement for capco re quirements or the understanding of those requirements users of ciss ism may develop specific but separate programming interfaces to implement their required business rules for populating and using the ciss ism attributes the ic mwg developed ciss ism as part of the odni cio executive council commitment to interorganization interoperability ciss ism is based on number of data modeling activities that have occurred in the national security community over the last several years 13 the target audience this implementation guide is intended for use by developers and it support personnelnot analysts and other users the guide provides implementation details that should be transparent to authors editors and reviewers users of this guide are expected to have at l east basic knowledge of xml the guide has been written with the assumption that readers understand xml syntax angle brackets names name tokens unique identifiers elements attributes et xml namespaces andto very limited degreexml document type definitions dtds and w3c xml schemas

the ciss ism attributes are provided as an xm l entity set for dtds which is available from the ic xml registry as an xml schema document with the name ciss_ism_entities the entity set may be downloaded from the ic mwg web sites as well the file name for the entity set is cissismv1ent the ciss ism attributes are also provided as w3c xml schema wxs which is available from the ic xml registry as an xml schema document with the name ciss_ism_wxs the wxs may be downloaded from the ic mwg web sites as well the file name is ciss ismv1xsd the dtd entity set consists of two xml parameter entity declarations that declare entities named securityattributes securityattributesoption version 203 15 february 2006 2 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation

both must be used whenever security attr ibutes are specified for an element with respect to validation of the attributes as they appear in instance documents the dtd and the wxs are functionally equivalentwith one im portant exception the wxs has an associated xml namespace for more on this see section 33 below 23 the controlled vocabularies capco is the authority for the development and use of the classification marking system for the national security community this system employs uniform list of security classification and control markings authorized for all dissemination of classified and unclassified information including hardcopy and electronic documents by components of the national security community the ic mwg has developed set of controlled vocabularies consisting of valid xml name tokens which are associated with the various general categories of security classification and control markings the name tokens used in the controlled vocabularies that populate the ciss ism attribute values are based on the authorized portion marking abbreviations specified in the capco authorized classification and control markings register appendix b reference 1 in most cases name token used in controlled vocabulary is identical to the actual capco authorized portion marking abbreviation in those few cases in which capco abbreviation does not meet the syntax requirements of an xml name token this standard uses substitute for the abbrevia tion controlled vocabulary may be contained either within an enumerated list internal to the declaration of an attribute or within an external document version 203 15 february 2006 5 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide ciss ism components an internal enumerated list is used for attribute classification in dtd syntax this list is called name token group in the wxs syntax it is set of enumerations of type name token the list is built into the declaration of the attribute as its d eclared value the list provides choices to be used for the attribute value in th dtd syntax the name token group is u c s ts r nu nr nc ns nss nsa cts ctsb ctsbalk ctsa nsat nca this list is

xsdrestriction attribute declassmanualreview also uses an internal name token group in the dtd syntax that group is true false in the wxs syntax declassmanualreview is declared to have the builtin data type boolean which by definition means that the pe rmissible values are true and false the ciss ism dtd and wxs do not include enum erated lists for the other attributes the permissible values for those attributes are more subject to change and consequently users are expected to refer to authoritative sources for those lists in order to support implementation of ciss ism however several controlled vocabularies have been created and registered in the ic xml regi stry as domain value sets usage of the domain value sets is described and illustrated in section 6 below as sample one of the domain value sets for intnonicmarkings20040430 is listed in appendix d in section 7 where applicable the domain value set for an attribute is identified version 203 15 february 2006 6 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide ciss ism components 24 specifying attribute values for attributes classification and declassmanualreview the value must be one of the name tokens in their internal controlled vocabularies for example to associate classification with an xml element named figure that contains confidential information use start tag like this figure classificationc for attributes classifiedby classificationreason derivedfrom and declassevent the declared values are character data cdata in the attr ibute definition list in the dtd entity set as shown in figure 1 and figure 3 these same attributes are declared to be of builtin data type string in the wxs therefore the value for any of these attributes is simply literal text string which may contain alphanumeric characters spaces symbols and other legal xml characters however this is not to say that the format and content of value can not be further restricted through configuration of authoring software by implementing organizations in fact it will at times even be necessary to restri ct an attribute value in this way in order to comply with capco guidelines for example security derivedfrommultiple sources although the decl ared value of derivedfrom is just text string that string must be restricted to one of several forms it may specify the title and date of classification guide the title and date of source document or the literal string multip sources this can only be enforced through software configuration the definitions of attributes declassdate and dateofexemptedsource differ in the dtd version from the wxs version in the dtd version th attributes are declared to be of type nmtoken this means that the value may co nsist only of the alphanumeric characters and the special characters hyphen underscore _ period and colon it is intended that the value be an iso 8601compliant date such as 20040430 since this date format conforms to the syntax of name token pars er can perform at least rudimentary check that the value is of an appropriate type in the wxs version we take advantage of the bu iltin data type named date this data type constrains the attribute values to the form yyyymmdd for each of the other attributes the declared value is nmtokens short for name token list this means three things 1 an attribute value may be single name token or it may be spacedelimited list of name tokens where each name token is taken from th associated external controlled vocabulary 2 each name token must conform to the syntax of an xml name token that is it may consist only of the alphanumeric characters and the sp ecial characters hyphen underscore _ period and colon 3 the attribute values are case sensitive for example si and si are not equivalent the reason that these attributes are declared to be of type nmtokens is that multiple controls may apply to the corresponding info rmation for the categor of control marking associated with the attribute version 203 15 february 2006 7 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide ciss ism components take these two examples classificationts scicontrolssi classificationts scicontrolssi tk b in example the scicontrols attribute contains single value si in example b however the scicontrols attribute contains two independent va lues si and tk the embedded space between the name tokens is only delimiter we know this because the declared value of scicontrols is nmtokens note also that since all of th values in these examples consist of just alphabetic characters they conf orm to the syntax of name token here is another example in which the releasableto attribute value is spacedelimited list of four name tokens classifications disseminationcontrolsrel releasabletousa aus can gbr it should be pointed out that the values in the ciss ism controlled vocabularies have been chosen so as to be valid xml name tokens in the great majority of cases the au thorized portion marking abbreviations in the capco register already are valid name tokens however in few cases modified versions of the authorized portion marking abbreviations are used in the controlled vocabularies because the abbreviations as they ap pear in the capco register do not qualify as valid xml name tokens for example for the dissemination control restricted data sigma 1 marking title the capco authorized portion marking abbr eviation is rdsg 1 the space between sg and 1 would not be permissi ble in an xml name token therefore for ciss ism rdsg1 is used in the correspondin g controlled vocabulary it is up to xslt stylesheets to transform the name tokens appropri ately to generate the correct security markings 25 attributes with dependent or conditional relationships numerous and perhaps sometimes obvious dependent or conditional relationships do exist between attributes between attributes with ce rtain values between i ndividual spacedelimited name tokens within an attribute value or between attributes and elements few examples are 1 attributes classification and ownerproducer must be used together both are required in order to specify whether document is us document nonus document or joint document see sections 71 and 714 below 2 when and only when typeofexemptedsource is used dateofexemptedsource must also be used see sections 718 and 74 below 3 when and only when disseminationcontrols contains the rel or eyes values releasableto must also be used see sections 710 and 715 below 4 individual values within certain multivalued attributes should be listed in specific order for example the usa value iso 31661 country code trigraph should always be listed first in the value of the releasableto attribute see section 715 below 5 manyin fact halfof the ciss ism attributes are meaningful primarily at the product level to provide the values for the classificationdeclassification block and the declassification parameter of the banners these should be used as attributes of portionlevel element only when the intent is that the portion will be reused version 203 15 february 2006 8 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide ciss ism components these relationships are rooted in the business rules resulting from compliance to capco classification and control marking guidelines other relevant governances like executive order 12958 and isoo directive 1 and ic mwg guidelines an xml parser program will not and cannot force these business rules nor should xslt stylesheets be expected to account for incorrect or inappropriate application of attributes or attribute values within xml documents business rules like these must be enforced through software configuration as part of the process of applying security marking metadata to xml documents within the digital production authoring environment or other applications that create xml data streams one approach by which implementing organizations can enforce business rules is briefly introduced in section 4 26 attributes with specific rules the fgisourceprotected attribute has dual purpose with in icsis shared spaces the attribute serves only to indicate the pres ence of information which is cat egorized as foreign government information according to capco guidelines for which the sources of the information is concealed within icsis shared spaces this attributes value will always be fgi the attribute may also be employed in this manner within protected internal organizational spaces however within protected intern organizational spaces this attribute may alternatively be used to maintain formal record of the foreign count ry or countries andor registered international organizations that are the nondisclosable owners andor producers of information which is categorized as foreign governme nt information according to ca pco guidelines for which the sources of the information must be conceale d when the resource is disseminated to icsis shared spaces if the attribute is employed in this manner th additional measures must be taken prior to dissemination of the resource in an form to icsis shared spaces so that the non disclosable owners andor producers of foreign government information within the resource will be concealed due to the similarity in function of attributes fgisourceprotected and ownerproducer at the portion level if attribute fgisourceprotected is being employed in the manner described above to maintain formal record of protected fgi sources within protected internal organizational spaces attribute ownerproducer may also potentially contain metadata concerning protected fgi sources therefore similar additional measures must be taken with respect to attribute ownerproducer prior to dissemination of the resource in any form to icsis shared spaces so that the nondisclosable owners andor producers of foreign government information within the resource will be concealed version 203 15 february 2006 9 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide guidelines for

cissismv1ent is uniform resource locator url for the entity set file entity cisssecurityentities system cissismv1ent next place parameterentity reference in the dtd at the point at which the ciss ism entity set should be included the following example shows parameterentity reference when an xml parser encounters this reference it will retrie ve the file cissismv1ent and read it as if it were part of the parent dtd at the location of the reference cisssecurityentities because the ciss ism dtd entity set is itself t of parameter entity declarations it should be included near the beginning of dtd before any references to the ciss ism entities are used once the ciss ism entity set has been included the ciss ism parameter entities may be referenced in the attribute definition list of an element

as shown above the wxs version of ciss is m declares an xml namespace for the schema the name of that namespace is urnusgovicism the purpose of declaring such namespace is to facilitate importation of the ciss ism schema into another schema without having to be concerned about conflicts between distinct attribute types that have the same name for example the ciss ism attribute classification can be used within another schema even when the other schema also declares an attribute named classification in instance documents the name of an attribut is considered to include the namespace name consequently the full name of classification becomes urnusgovicismclassification in order to avoid unwieldy names prefixes are us ed in place of namespace names in the example of element target in the preceding section the prefix that was assigned to the ciss ism namespace name was ism in document that is to be validated against wxs the element would be used like this version 203 15 february 2006

consequently the examples do not show namespace prefixes 34 xml registry xml registries are vital component in the implementation of shared data exchanges developers looking to express information using xml need support in establishing common lexicons and grammars registry should be the reference point for obtaining the latest dtds schemas controlled vocabularies templates and sample documents currently the ic xml registry httpdiidesncrdisamilxmlreguser indexcfm contains the latest ciss ism components and documentation implementing organizations are encouraged to register any extensions to the ciss ism dtd entity set and schema so that developers may avoid repeating efforts underway at other agencies reduce overall development effort s and ensure compatibility 35 customizing the ciss ism dtd tity set or wxs for internal use ciss ism has been specifically designed to allow for extensions changes to the standard may be necessary to support internal requirements of specific agency or comm unity of interest any extensions or changes made to the standard should be maintained as separate organizational representation organizations may extend the ciss ism entity set and schema for internal use only the goal of such extensibility of security metadata is to meet each organizations internal or bilateral requirements while maintaining common set of security metadata to allow sharing of information throughout the ic version 203 15 february 2006 12 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide guidelines for interoperability 351 extending or restricting the attributes the extensible nature of xml allows ciss ism to be customized for additional attributes in this way agencyspecific attributes may be incorp orated into document model this is best accomplished through the use of locally declared parameter entities in an agencyspecific dtd or locally declared attributes or attribute gro ups in an agencyspecific schema the agency specific dtd or schema sometimes called driver dtd or driver schema would define all agencyspecific extensions and call in all external modules including the ciss ism entity set or ciss ism wxs this method keeps the ciss ism entity set and ciss ism wxs free from internal modification later if the ciss is m entity set and ciss ism wxs are revised the new versions can replace the older versions without impacting local modifications in the following example part illustrates ho w an organization can declare local parameter entity that has as its replacement text the meters for two

creating stylesheets one of the guiding principles of xml is that information content within an xml document is independent of any presentation format to the greatest degree practical formatoriented

into the model business rules regarding security metadata are constantly under revision the model can be customized to meet the requirements of each organization it will be an organizations

all of the valid capco security marking options for the context in which she works business rules to support relationships of the capco security markings can be incorporat ed into the gui however most likely the gui itselfthat is the formwill not provide the logic for validating the overall classification of product the use of rollup scripts and human review will ensure the information is properly

assisting with the entry of correct classification markings can be devised th is figure serves only to illustrate the idea it illustrates selection options for us classification and controls this particular user interface makes use of xml he lper files that contain the requisite controlled vocabularies the data stored in the helper file s is used to populate the dialogs list boxes and checkboxes this method keeps the controlled vocabularies external to the gui code so that changes to the controlled vocabularies do not necessarily render the code obsolete the xml helper files are

20 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide operations on the security attributes 5 operations on the security attributes once the ciss ism attributes ar populated in an xml document or data stream the attributes can be used for several key requirements 1 formatting portion marks the top and bottom security banner and the classificationdeclassification block for display in authoring or editing applications in web pages or in printoriented outputs such as portable document format files 2 rolling up the attribute values assigned to child elements in order to determine the classification and controls of the parent element and 3 filtering documents that have been written for multiple security domains in order to produce domainspecific outputs for dissemination 51 creating portion marks the values of the ciss ism attri butes for any given portionlevel element will be used to format the corresponding portion mark for display purposes an xslt stylesheet may be used to create the portion mark string based on the values of the attributes consider the following exam ple for an element named in an xml document classifications ownerproducerusa

document data stream or block element based on all of the classification and control marking attributes and attribute values for subordinate elements found within the document data stream or block element the security rollup process is most of ten associated with determining th set of productlevel security attributes which are used to form the security ba nner highwater marking that is displayed at the top and bottom of document and to form documents classificationd eclassification block the security rollup functionality and methodology may be simple or very complex depending on the extent of security markings for which an organization needs to account with respect to the process of authoring document security rollup may be repeatedly performed while document is being authored within the authoring tool the author may call the rollup function manually at any time andor rollup will be performed automatically prior to closing any authoring session and saving the document from an authoring standpoint security rollup can ensure that the documents highwater marking will be at least at the level necessary based on the classification and control markings of the documents current content when rollup is performed an author can then verify that documents highwater marking is appropriate with respect to the cu rrent content and then either acce pt the results of the rollup or modify the results to designate hi gher classification level if necessary version 203 15 february 2006 21 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide operations on the security attributes as part of postauthoring process security ro llup can be included in filtering process for domain transformation discussed below any automated rollup processes should be followed by human review and verification to ensure proper markings before dissemination of the documents to the community space the name token values in the ciss ism controlle d vocabularies duplicate in almost all cases the abbreviations used in portion markings au thorized by capco this facilitates the straightforward generation of capcocompliant portion markings with minimum of transformation effort using attribute values containing name tokens from the controlled vocabularies however the generation of capcocompliant security banner markings from the productlevel security attributes will require more significant transformation 53 performing domain filtering the ciss ism dtd entity set and wxs enable the process of domain filtering through automated methods domain filtering allows document or portions of document to be filtered and combined using xslt stylesheets to form products that can be disseminated to various networking domains based on the classification ndor releasability requirements of the domain for example top secret portions of document can be automatically stripped out using an appropriate xslt stylesheet so that the resulting document can be disseminated to secret network single xslt stylesheet can be used to perform all domainfiltering activities however it may be more practical and feasible to modularize the filtering process across multiple stylesheets version 203 15 february 2006 22 unclassifiedfouo unclassifiedfouo ciss for ism xml implementation implementation guide using the controlled vocabularies 6 using the controlled vocabularies as noted above an xml name token nmtoken consists of string of one or more letters digits hyphens underscores periods and colons most of the ciss ism attributes require name token or spacedelimited list of name t okens as values as also noted there are relatively small number of instances when capco authorized abbreviations do not qualify as name tokens and substitutes are used the name tokens that are the permissible values for the various ciss ism attributes are specified in controlled vocabularies for attribute classification the controlled vocabulary is built into the attribute declaration as name token group in the dtd entity set and as list of enumerations in the wxs validating xml parser will use the name token list or enumeration list to ensure that the value of classification is one of the permissible values the controlled vocabulary for classification is internal to the dtd entity set and wxs because it was the expectation of the ciss ism developers that the permissible values were very stable and would change only infrequently for the other attributes with controlled voca bularies the vocabularies are not built into the declarations they are ex ternal domain value sets they were kept out of the declarations in anticipation that they would change relatively frequently they are documented in this guide and they exist in digital form in the ic xml regist ry it should be understood that there is mechanism by which an xml parser can ensure that the name tokens it finds are actually taken from any of the external controlled vocabularies all the parser can do in this case is verify that an attribute value is in fact name token or spacedelim ited list of name tokens it is the responsibility of implementing organizations to provide means for authors an d editors to have access to the associated controlled vocabularies when selecting valu for the ciss ism attributes and to restrict the population of attribute values to name tokens contained in those controlled vocabularies in some cases the domain value space of an attribut consists of two domain value sets this is true for those attributes that specify both iso 31661 country code trigraphs and capco defined registered international organization tetragraphs 61 replacing extending and sharing replacing or extending the controlled vocabularies to meet the internal requirements of an organization is rather trivial remember an xml parser does not validate the actual name tokens used it only checks for unallowable characters in the name tokens in order to replace or extend the controlled vocab ularies an organization should first determine which of the current name tokens are relevant for its use and then define any additional name tokens if necessary the organization should distribute the list of new name tokens to authors and reviewers within the organization see section 42 or integrate the new name tokens into xml helper files for security gui as suggested in section 41 obviously because of the probability of manual input errors checks must be utilized to ensure consistent marking and conformance to the new controlled vocabularies similar checks should be utilized if these controlled vocabularies are shared with other organizations caveat any agencyspecific name tokens must be removed prior to dissemination of the documents contents
