popular opinion on the merits of free trade economic theory concludes that free trade is mutually beneficial because it allows countries to focus on producing the goods for which they have comparative advantage by contrast many people believe that free trade is harmful because it destroys american jobs or lowers wages this report looks past theory at the empirical evidence to see which side of the argument is supported by the data economists do not deny that some american workers will lose their jobs because of import competition greater imports will cause gross job loss but theory predicts the job loss will be offset by gross job gains among exporters recipients of foreign capital inflows in the case of trade deficit and the economy as whole because of general increases in efficiency caused by comparative advantage the result economists believe would be net change in total employment this report uses regression analysis of quarterly national data from 1948 to 2005 and sub sample from 1980 to 2005 to answer three questions first do higher imports systematically correspond to periods of high unemployment or low employment growth second do higher trade deficits correspond to high unemploymen t or low employment growth third do higher imports or trade deficits correspond to weak growth in average worker compensation the findings of this report generally support economists views on trade and employment for several reasons first most of the findings on the link between imports and unemployment or trade deficits and unemployment are statistically insignificant that is by the accepted standards of research it cannot be ruled out that imports and the trade deficit had effect on unemployment at all second the regressions generally had low rsquared values which means that imports and trade deficits explain very little of the variation in unemployment third when the relationship between the variables was statistically significant it was too small to be economically meaningful and in some cases moved in the opposite direction from the relationship assumed by some free trade opponents for example one percentage point increase in imports as share of gdp reduced the unemployment rate by 010 percentage points all else equal the relationship between trade and average worker compensation tended to be statistically significant but these regressions also had low rsquared values and were too small to be economically meaningful the effect of imports on worker compensation was the opposite of that predicted by some free trade opponents trade deficits on the other hand were associated with low growth in worker compensation but the effect was small one percentage point increase in the trade deficit as share of gdp reduced worker compensation by 079117 all else equal it should be noted that average worker compensation does not address the question of how trade affects wage inequality among workers of different income levels it does however address the question of how national income is divided between workers and owners of capital this report will not be updated

nearly unanimous that free trade raises economic wellbeing overall for example 93 of economists surveyed in the early 1990s generally agreed with the proposition or agreed with provisos that tariffs and import quotas usually reduce economic welfare1 the general public tends to have different view of trade in polls taken in june 2005 and around the time the economists survey was published 48 of the public believed that trade was threat to the economy while 44 believed it was an opportunity for economic growth 2 the economic case for free trade starts with the principle of comparative advantage which can be summed up with the adage focus on what you do best the insight behind comparative advantage is that even if country is better th an country b at producing everything called an absolute advantage there will still exist some goods that country b is less bad at producing and if it produces and trades those goods with country both countries can consume more than if each tried to produce all types of goods by itself this principle applies not just to trade between countries but every market transaction that occurs between individuals in one famous example it explains why michael jordan does not mow his own lawn although his athletic ability allows him to mow faster than anyone he can hire he is better off paying someone else to do it and spending the time he saved on basketball or endorsements 3 this logic is considered so airtight by economists that little empirical research has been done lately to try to confirm it but theory makes little impression on worker who is told that he or she has lost his or her job to overseas competit ion this report looks at empirical evidence of what has happened historically to trade and employment in evaluating this evidence it is important to distinguish between the gross effects of trade on employment and the net effects economists would not dispute that trade causes some workers in the us economy to lose their jobs but they contend that other jobs are created by trade and the efficiency gains that result from trade so that trade has net effect on employment 4 this report analyzes empirical evidence and finds support for economists contention that trade has net quantitative effect on employment this report focuses on the nations overall welfare and does not address the issue of trades effect on gross employment flows that is it doe s not analyze whether workers in certain regions income cohorts or sectors of the economy benefit or suffer from trade more than others5 congress may find this evidence useful in considerin g any future free trade agreements that result from ongoing bilateral and multilateral negotiations6 1 richard alston jr kearl and michael vaughn is there consensus among

winners and losers is value judgement that cannot be answered by economic th eory however it is useful to note that all market activity including competition among domestic firms and technological innovation creates winners and losers most economists argue that in principle nobody need be made worse off from trade since the gains from trade allow the winners to compensate the losers and still be better off themselves of course effective compensation is difficult to design in reality the trade adjustment assistance program is one real world example of how such compensation can be structured 7 economic theory cannot address the question of how much assistance those workers who are harmed by trade deserve to receive that is social issue

at the simplest level by looking at the data in figure 1 imports have been growing steadily as share of gdp over the past 50 plus years but unemployment has not imports and unemployment were both very low in the 1950s the data in the bottom lefthand corner of the chart trade opponents might blame imports for the rise in unemployment in the 1970s and 1980s but since the 1990s unemployment has steadily fallen while imports have continued to rise the data in the upper part of the chart if imports are to blame for job loss why didnt the relationship hold over time continued the us economy by

between the two variables with any quantitative precision to do that this report uses the standard tool of empirical research in economics regression analysis see the appendix for more details regression analysis relies on finding large enough sample and looking at variations in employment levels and trade levels across each unit of the sample while holding other causes of variation constant to estimate how much employment will change when trade levels change 8 the units making up the sample will be the us economy as whole over time measured quarterly if the argument made by some trade opponents were correct it would be found that in quarters when imports were high unemployment would be high if the relationship were strong enough it would be said to statistically significant which means that by commonly accepted standards of research the relationship is strong enough to rule out that it was caused by random chance alternatively if economists were correct that trade has net effect on overall employment then statistically insignificant relationship between the two variables would be expected economic time series variables often have rising trend over time therefore the effect of the trend in pertinent 8 economists would consider trade and employment to be two endogenous variables in larger system of equations describing economic activity on the whole therefore one could not consider employment to be simply caused by trade since they are jointly determined solvin g this system of equations would be incomprehensible to lay readers and does not directly address the concerns of tr ade opponents so the method will not be employed here technically the results in this report can be considered to show whether periods of high imports or trade deficits are systematically associated with periods of high unemployment or low worker compensation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33454g22g155g138g141g142g496g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g496g561g138

data looking at changes in values rather than the values themselves so that spurious correlation does not occur9 using sample of all available data spanning from 19482 to 20054 table 1 shows the effect of trade measured as imports as share of gdp on the unemployment rate in simple bivariate regression between unemployment and imports using the ordinary least squares method shown in the first row of the table the relationship is not significantly different from zero and is in the opposite direction of what some trade opponents claim taken literally these results called an estimate of beta coefficient suggest that wh imports rise by 1 of gdp unemployment falls by 005 percentage points the results are statistically insignificant however despite relatively large sample size which means the variables are so weakly related that zero effect cannot be ruled out the rsquared measure for this regression is zero which means that the independent variables in this case just imports explain none of the movements in unemployment 10 for these estimates to be valid the relationship between trade and employment must not be fundamentally altered over time some might argue that looking at more recent period would give better idea of the effect today since the economy has changed over time for example economic variables such as employment and imports are less volatile now than they were several decades ago and the exchange rate changed from fixed regime to floating regime in 1971 therefore all of the regressions in this report are also estimated over subsample of 19802005 over that subsample the estimated effect of imports on unemployment is larger the beta coefficient is now 069 but still statistically insignificant t able 1 impor ts and j obs independent variables impor tsgd p

different measurements of labor markets and see if similar results are found when employment as fraction of the total adult population to control for population growth is substituted fo r the unemployment rate the effect is highly statistically significant 11but causes employment to rise not fall now an increase in imports equal to 1 of gdp causes 030 percentage point rise in the employmentpopulation ratio using the entire sample and this result is statistically significant at the 1 level the rsquared for this regression is also extremely low 004 so the re gression can only explain 4 of the change in employment over time similar results are found over the more recent subperiod the regressions presented so far are simplistic and few modifications can make them more realistic and hopefully more accurate first the regressions presented above assumed that nothing affects unemployment except imports in reality there are many other variables that one would expect to affect unemployment while it is beyond the scope of this report to consider them all very simple one can be addeda dummy variable for whether or not the economy is in recession if it is accepted that higher imports do not tend to cause recessions then it can be controlled for the predictable effect of recession on unemployment to analyze whether the remaining variation in the unemployment rate can be explained by changes in imports this small change can make large difference for example when recession variable is added the effect of imports on the employmentpopulation ratio is longer statistically significant and the effect is only onethird as large for brevity these results are not presented in table 1 second regression analysis is based on the assumption that the units in the sample are independent of each otherone unit is not systematically influenced by another for many time series this is not the case two different methods are used next to correct for this fact because labor markets adjust slowly the unemployment ra this quarter can help predict what the unemployment rate will be in the next quarter this can be controlled for using the first method called autoregression empirically if it can be controlled for the effects that the unemployment rate had over the last two quarters on unemployment in the current quarter empirical tests suggests that the statistically significant effects come within two quarters it can then be evaluated whether the remaining variation in unemployment is caused by imports as seen in table 1 when this is done the effect of imports on unemployment doubles and becomes significant at the 5 level 12 the relationship becomes statistically insignificant when confined 11 significance at the 1 level means that in 99 out of 100 cases the effect of imports on employment would not be zero 12 although the results are not presented for the sake of brevity the effect of imports is statistically insignificant if the employmentpopulation ratio is used as dependent variable instead of the unemployment rate also the results presented in the table include the recession dummy variable and two lags but the results are not qualitatively different continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33454g22g155g138g141g142g496g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g496g561g138 g151g141g561g25 g138g144g142

that higher imports are associated with lower unemployment because causation runs in the opposite directionwhen the economy is booming and unemployment is low import demand rises the rsquared for this regression is very high 096 which illustrates that past unemployment rates are much better determinant of current unemployment than trade also imagine that the effects of imports on unemployment do not all occur immediately perhaps because labor markets adjust slowly the effects of change in imports on unemployment take few quarters before they are fully felt using the second method distributed lag model this hypothesis can be investigated measuring the effect of imports on unemployment over the next two quarters leads to higher imports causing unemployment to rise but the results are not

opponents of trade concede that balanced trade can be beneficial but argue that trade is harmful to jobs when it results in trade deficit they reason that because americans are buying imports jobs are being destroyed but because fo reigners are not buying american products in exchange american jobs are being created economic theory suggests that trade deficits create jobs in the interestsensitive sectors of the economy because trade deficit is matched by foreign capital inflows that reduce domestic interest rates lower interest rates stimulate spending on us capital investment residential investment and in terestsensitive consumer durables again the net effects of the jobs created and lost from trade deficit would be expected to roughly balance assuming the change in the trade deficit was smooth economic theory also suggests that trade deficit is more likely to occur when overall spending in the economy is strong since this is when the demand for borrowing would be greater if the trade deficit is caused by strong aggregate spending demand by definition it woul d be associated with high employment 14 turning to the data in figure 2 it can be seen at first glance that the largest trade deficits during the past 5½ decades have been associated with lowerthanaverage unemployment rates most of these large trade deficits were recent most of the quarters in which trade deficits exceeded 25 of gdp have occurred since 1999 during that period the unemployment rate has varied from 39 the lowest rate in 30 years to 61 the highest unemployment rates over the sample were mostly associated with trade deficits much smaller than the recent ones and also included few periods with small trade surpluses continued if the recession variable is omitted linear trend is co ntrolled for or four lags are used instead of two 13 the relationship is the opposite but still statistically insign ificant if the employmentpopulation ratio is used as dependent variable instead of the unemployment rate it is also insignificant if the recession variable is omitted different lag lengths were used and the relationship was insignificant in each case 14 for more information see crs

would rise although compensation in the united states is high relative to the world average unit laborcosts are unlikely to be prohibitively high across the economy for two reasons first us labor productivity is also relatively high second most us trade is with other wealthy nations but for the remaining trade with low income nations it w ould be expected that low income nations would have low unit labor costs for laborintensive industries and high unit labor costs for skillintensive or capitalintensive industries this suggests that the compensation of highskilled us workers would rise with trade and the compensation of low skilled us workers would fall or rise more slowly so that unit labor costs across countries moved closer together on average the effect would be theoretically ambiguous and cannot be predicted without empirical evidence it is important to note that average compensation includes both highwage workers and lowwage workers an increase in average compensation may mask divergent experiences for highwage and lowwage workers for example if one groups wages rose while the others fell the changes would cancel each other out 16 but average compensation can address another argument that capital owners benefit from trade at the expense of workers because trade holds down wages so that profits flow to owners instead of workers at least one standard trade model the hecksher olin model used by economists with its prediction that trade will make wage and capital income equalize across countries suggests that this is possible but some economists argue that this model makes unrealistic simplifications that would prevent this from happening in reality 17 for example income may already be equalized because of capital mobility as first step this report looks at what has happened to average real workers compensation wages and benefits adjusted for inflation as trade has increased as can be seen in figure 3 compensation rose in most but not all quarters there is clear pattern but on balance more of the quarters where compensation fell occurred when imports were relatively low 16 this evidence is examined in crs report 98441 is globalization

argue that free trade is mutually beneficial because it allows countries to specialize in what they do best thereby employing their resources in the most efficient way they argue that trade neither creates nor destroys jobs on net because jobs destroyed by trade are replaced by new jobs elsewhere in the economy and the economy is capable of reaching full employment regardless of what happens to imports or the trade deficit some opponents of free trade argue that imports destroy jobs or trade deficits destroy jobs or trade lowers wages this report looks at quarterly national data from 1948 to 2005 to try to clarify some of these issues the first set of regressions performed in this report can be thought to answer the first of the three questions posed in the summary do increases in imports systematically correspond to periods of high unemployment or negativelow employment gr owth the empirical evidence disputes that claim on three counts first most of the evidence is statistically insignificant meaning that it cannot be ruled out that any correlation found between the variables is simply random chance this means the evidence does not meet generally accepted standards of professional research some of the evidence that is statistically significant becomes insignificant with small modifications in methods or data if relationship between variables were fundamentally strong it would be expected to hold under many different statistical specifications second the r squared measure for these regressions is very low except when lagged values of the dependent variable are included which means that very little of the variability in unemployment or employment can be explained by imports finally even when the results are statistically significant they do not support the position that imports have negative effect on employment in one case one percentage point increase in imports as share of gdp was predicted to increase the employmentpopulation ratio by 030042 percentage points all else equal in another case one percentage point increase in imports as share of gdp was predicted to decrease the unemployment rate by 010 percentage points all else equal the second set of regressions answers the second question do increases in the trade deficit systematically correspond to periods of high unemployment or low employment growth here too the empirical evidence is weak most of the evidence is statistically insignificant and explains little of the variation in unemployment or employment growth in this case the relationship is consistent with the predictions of some free trade opponents but is too small to have significant economic impact in one case one percentage point increase in the trade deficit as share of gdp was predicted to reduce the employmentpopulation ratio by 017020 percentage points all else equal in another case one percentage point increase in imports as share of gdp was predicted to decrease the unemployment rate by 010 percentage points all else equal all of these results were only marginally statistically significant and lost significance over different time periods or using different methods the third set of regressions answers the third question do increases in imports or the trade deficit systematically correspond to periods of weak growth in worker compensation for these regressions the results were more consistently statistically significant with all the results significant over the period of 19802005 the results still had low rsquared measures however imports consistently had the effect that some free trade proponents predicteda one percentage point increase in the importgdp ratio led to 081158 increase in worker compensation all else equal trade deficits consistently had the effect predicted by some free trade opponents although the effect was small one percentage point increase in the trade deficit as share of gdp reduced worker compensation by 079117 all else equal these

how trade affects income inequality among workers at different income levels these results may seems surprising to noneconomists but they are generally consistent with events in recent decades imports have been steadily rising as share of gdp for decades and yet the economy has mostly maintained full employment over that time the 1990s serve as an example of period of low unemployment ra pid employment growth and steady compensation gains in the midst of high imports and large trade deficits recent experience provides another example imports and the trade deficit reached record highs in 2005 and the unemployment rate fell to 51 these empirical results should be considered sugge stive rather than definitive as more elaborate methods would be required to tease out the true relationship between trade and labor markets for instance trade probably disproportionately affects some regions or occupations or sectors of the economy positively and others negatively nevertheless the results generally confirm the view that on balance trades adverse impact on labor markets overall are small or nonexistent because the negative effects on some american workers are roughly canceled out by positive effects on other workers

techniques used in this report equations estimated by linear regression take their form from some hypothesized relationship in which the behavior of one or more variables the independent variables is held to influence some other variable the dependent variable the application of regression analysis involves fitting straight line to group of observations usually sample selected from the universe of those variables that are suggested by the hypothesized relationship the straight line is fitted such that the deviations of the actual observations from t hose suggested by the straight line are minimized the value of the slope of that line then gives the effect of the independent variable or variables on the dependent variable while the calculated value of the slope of the line may be positive or negative or even zero its true value may not be statistically significantly different from zero because this is so it will be necessary to briefly discuss what is meant by calculated value being statistically significant to understand statistical significance say that the calculated effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is 010 thus changes in the independent variable by one unit change the dependent variable by 010 this assumes of course that the value 010 is really different from zero recall that it was calculated not from the universe of the independent variable but from sample taken from that universe thus it is possible that our assumption that the true value of the effect of this variable on the dependent variable is different from zero is wrong it is however possible to control for making this type of errorthat is for accepting as true relationship that is in fact not true it is common to set the control factor at 1 to 5 chances in 100 of accepting the hypothesis that the variable is different from zero when it is not if the calculated value of the independent variable lies within range that limits the error to 1 to 5 it is said to be statistically significant or statistically significantly different from zero the rsquared measures goodness of fit the rsquared is designed to measure the fraction of the variation of the dependent variable that is explained by the variation of the independent variables the rsquared ranges in value between 0 and 1 the higher the rsquared is the larger is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the variation of the independent variables g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 marc labonte
