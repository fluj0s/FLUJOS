collapse of the soviet uni on in 1991 many western analysts have viewed stable independent and sovereign ukraine as key element in european security pointing to its size strategic location and economic potential those who are concerned about russias motives and goals in the region see an independent ukraine as guarantee against the revival of russian empire that would threaten the security of central europe conversely analysts worry that weak or unstable ukraine could fall under russian domination or become focus of conflict between russia and the west the spillover effects of crime illegal immigration and other problems from an unstable ukraine could hurt other countries in the region ukraine continues to undergo difficult transition from communism to democracy and free market economy it is also undergoing re lated search for its international identity whether as an independent cen tral european state or as state closely aligned with russia with which most of ukraine has close linguistic cultural and historic ties series of recent events have clouded ukraines relationship with the united states in november 2000 an audio tape produced by former bodyguard of ukrainian president leonid kuchma purporte dly captured kuchmas orders to top officials to neutralize independent jour nalist georgiy gongadze whose headless mutilated body d been found by police in september 2002 the united states authenticated another tape which implicated kuchma in the possible sale of sophisticated antiaircra ft radars to iraq these inci dents led to deterioration of usukrainian ties however relati ons improved in 2003 when ukraine deployed 1650 troops to iraq as part of polishled peacekeeping force however despite recent setbacks there is consensus among us policymakers that strong multifaceted relationship with stable democratic prosperous and sovereign ukraine integrated with europe and the wider world is key to europes stability vital us interest the united states has tried to bolster ukraine with political support and over 3 billion in us aid from fy 1992 to fy 2001 although aid has declined in recent years us po licy has had notable successes particularly in the areas of security policy and nuclear safety achievements since ukraines independence in political nd economic reform have been significant but us policymakers have often been frustrated by ukraines sl owness to reform and fight corruption congressional s upport has remained consis tent despite ukraines troubles ukraines current problems raise important issues for us policy one problem is how to deal with president kuchma nd the opposition to his rule more broadly the united states must decide how to better support the building of the political economic and social infrastructure that will provide foundation for democracy rule of law and market economy in the long term another problem us policymakers face is how to support ukraines sovereig nty and independence and promote closer ties with the west efforts could in clude helping reduce ukraines energy dependency on russia and prom oting greater security ties with the united states and nato in the face of possible russian pressure

than dozen years after achieving independence ukraine continues to undergo difficult transition to democracy and free market economy it is also undergoing related search for its iden tity as either an independent central european state or as close partner of russia with which most of ukraine has close linguistic cultural religious and historic ties the possibilities for ukraines long term future run spectrum from participating in prosperous democratic free market europe to being part of poor semiauthoritarian corrupt postsoviet region since the collapse of the soviet ion in 1991 many western analysts have viewed stable independent and sovereig n ukraine as key element in european security they point to ukraines size about the same land area as france its population of nearly 50 million people its natural resources nd strategic position on the black sea between russia and central europe they focus on the positive influence that stable and prosperous uk raine could play as neighbor to nato and the european union some hope that ukrain could one day join one or both of these organizations ukraine could also play an important role as regional leader among former soviet countries s eeking to retain their sove reignty and independence those who are concerned about russias motives and goals in the region see an independent ukraine as guarantee against the revival of russian power that could threaten the security of central europe conversely analysts worry that weak or unstable ukraine could fall under russian do mination or become focus of tension between russia and the west the removal of nuclear weapons from ukraine which was completed in 1996 improve d ukraines relations with the west and diminished western fears about the impact of possible instability in ukraine however concerns remain about the possible pr oliferation of weapons tec hnologies and spillover effects of crime illegal immigration and other problems political situation in ukraine ukraines political system may be described as mixture of democracy authoritarianism and oligarchy independent ukraine has held three parliamentary elections and two presidential elections in 1996 the country adopted new more democratic constitution re placing one from the sovi et era after the 1994 presidential vote power changed hands peacefully from incumbent leonid kravchuk to leonid kuchma kuchma was reelected in 1999 in an elected that international observers viewed as less than free and fair variety of views are expressed in ukraines parliament the s upreme rada few indepe ndent media voices exist inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs2 ukraine often providing highly critical perspective of those in power although these have faced harassment and persecuti on by government authorities broadcast media are under the control of s upporters of president kuchma the countrys regional diversity has d an important impact on the countrys political scene there are cultural religious linguistic and historical differences between western ukraine and the eastern and southern regions of the country however in contrast to other parts of the former soviet ion there has been significant ethnic tension or vi olence in ukraine in general western ukrainians are more nationally conscious than those in other regions western ukraine played catalytic role in the drive for ukrainia n independence in the early 1990s although it has become politically marginalized as leaders from eastern and southern ukraine where most of ukraines industry is centrated have gained power people in eastern and southern ukraine subjected to centuries of russification tend to look more skeptically on ukrainian nationhood or ar indifferent to it people in these regions are more likely to support econo mic andor political union with russia like other countries of the former soviet union ukraines democratic development remains deeply flawed president kuchmas powers under the constitution are formidable and give him significant authority over the government as well as the legislative and judicial branches president kuchma rules through large presidential administration and ne twork of presidential appointees reaching down to the local level he also controls the interior ministry intelligence agencies and the tax authorities he has used th as weapons to harass political opponents and independent media associated with kuchma are prominent businessmen often dubbed oligarchs who receive lucrative c oncessions from the state in return for providing political and financ ial support to kuchma so oligarchs are linked to organized crime figures ukraines current prime minister viktor yanukovych is representative of the powerful donetsk oligarchic clan viktor medvedchuk leader of kievbased oligarchic group heads the presidential administration both these groups and third oligarchic cente r based in dniprope trovsk hold other key posts in the government parliament and other institutions kuchma has tried to balance these oligarchic groups against each other in order to preserve his own power current issues despite government efforts to use their control of the media and administrative resources to bolster their supporters par liamentary elections in march 2002 resulted in victory for our ukraine an oppositi on proreform bloc led by former prime minister viktor yushchenko our ukraine won the largest share of the vote but fell short of majority it currently holds about onequarter of the seat s in the parliament the communist party suffered heavy def eat partly due to alleged fraud by local officials in the donetsk region where the communists had traditionally done well kuchma was able to cobble together shak parliamentary major ity of prooligarch factions part of his succe ss was due to efforts to coopt some members of parliament including our ukraine by using material incentives and threats nevertheless the progovernment bloc is riven with conflicts due to the competing interests of the oligarchs who strongly mistrust each other httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs3 1 patrick tyler from under couch an effort to stop ukraine corruption new york times february 26 2001according to recent public opinion polls kuchma has extremely low public support with popularity ratings in the single digits in addition to public dissatisfaction with living standards nd widespread government corruption kuchmas public image has been tarnished by scandal in november 2000 an audio tape produced by former kuchma bodyguard purportedly captured kuchmas orders to top officials to neutralize independe nt journalist georhiy gongadze whose headless mutilated body had been found by police the bodyguard who produced the tapes claims that they show that kuchma is at the center of vast criminal enterprise involving the oligarchs the police and security services1 ukraines current political scene is dominated by the question of who will succeed kuchma as president or if the political system should be changed to make that point moot kuchma is constitutiona lly barred from running for third term as president after his current one expires in october 2004 kuchma and the oligarchic groups are reportedly concerned that they may not unite on viable candidate to defeat yushchenko in the 2004 vote who remains ukraines most popular political figure the current leadership fears th at the westernoriented yushchenko could move to clean up corruption if he is ected which could expose kuchma and other current leaders to criminal prosecution even if yushchenko and other opposition leaders guaranteed that they would not prosecute kuchma and others in exchange for allowing free and fair elections kuch ma and his supporters may not trust them given that the new leadership would be supported by new woul dbe oligarchs bent on seizing property held by the old regimes supporters in order to avoid possible yushche nko victory kuchma and his powerful chief of staff viktor medvedchuk head of the antireform kievb ased political clan have put forward political reform pla n this proposal to amend ukraines constitution which was adopted in firs t reading in december 2003 would reduce the powers of the presidency provide for presidential election for shortened term from 2004 to 2006 when new parliamentary ections are scheduled and call for the election of new president in 2006 by the parliament not the public this plan may have been designed to hamper yush chenko from being elected in 2004 to full term as president with the posts current extensive powers in february 2004 the parlia ment approved an amendment to the bill dropping the election of president by the parliame nt the amendment thereby removed the most objectionable part of the bill to some observers however the revised bill may still serve the purposes of the ruling elite in that the future president perhaps yushchenko will still have weakened power s and the government including prime minister yanukovych will be strengthened it remains unclear whether oligarchic groups can secure the n ecessary twothirds majority in the parlia ment to adopt the revised bill the communists and socialists whose support is vital to final passage condition thei r continued support on having the parliament elected entirely by propor tional representation proposal not favored by some in the propresidential camp w ho could lose ground under such system tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs4 groups with stronger party organizations ch as the socialists and communists until recently it was believed that ku chma was constitutionally barred from running for third 5year term as presid ent after his current one expires kuchma himself has said repeatedly that he is not interested in third term on december 30 2003 the ruling elite further hedged its bets by securing constitutional court ruling that would permit kuchma to run for third term however since the decision kuchma has repeated that he will retire from politics at the end of his current term economic reform ukraines efforts at economic reform ve been marked by modest successes and periods of inertia ukraine has genera lly pursued responsible monetary and fiscal policies since 1994 with occasional but sign ificant lapses macroeconomic stability permitted ukraine to successf ully introduce new currency the hryvnya in 1996 however this stability was in part achieved in part by huge arrears in payments of wages and pensions enterprise tax arrears and tax exemptions for politically powerful sectors have had negative impact on ukraines budget living standards for most of the population have declined in 1999 real wages were half of their 1990 level real gdp fell by about 60 from 1991 to 1999 in addition to this mixed record in macroeconomic stabiliz ation ukraine has achieved only limited results in restructuring its economy privatization of most small firms was completed by the end of 1997 however ukraine needs to make greater progress in such areas as agricultura l reform energy sect or reform including privatization of the coal industry restru cturing of the banking sector and improving public administration includi ng deregulation reducing th size of the government bureaucracy and fighting corruption priva tization of agricultu re has progressed since december 1999 decree by president ku chma abolishing collective farms but has not yet led to substantial impact on the sectors productivity the country once the soviet unions breadbasket is famed for the fertile black soil that covers its key agricultural regions ukraines economic reforms received boost from the election of viktor yushchenko as prime minister in april 2000 as head of ukraines central bank in mid1990s yushchenko was credited with keep ing inflation in ukraine at moderate levels and successfully launching the hryvny he is considered by many to be ukraines leading reformer and among its most westernoriented political figures yushchenko attempted to implement an am bitious reform program including cuts in government spending tax reform acceler ated privatization of industry rapid privatization of land and re ductions in the size of the government bureaucracy the government also attempted to make taxation and government spending more transparent and to increase cash payments to the state instead of barter these moves were aimed in part at c hoking off s ources of corruption ukraine registered gdp growth in 2000 for the first time since i ndependence real wages also showed modest growth httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs5 2 global insight report on ukraine september 11 2003 3 oxford analytica daily brief february 16 2004 4 economist intelligence unit country report on ukraine april 2003yushchenkos government was toppled in vote of noconfidence by the parliament in april 2001 with the tacit support of presid ent kuchma nevertheless ukraines economic rebound s continued fueled in large part by economic expansion in russia gross domestic product grew by 91 in 2001 48 in 2002 and 85 in 20032 the government has pursued effective macroeconomic policies inflation was 83 and ukraine ran state budget surplus in 2003 salaries rose by 228 in nominal terms in 2003 however living standards for most ukrainians remain low the average monthly sa lary in 2003 was less that 100 per month3 the government of prime minister yanukovych has scored several legislative successes including the adoption of antimoney launde ring legislation pension reforms and some tax reforms nevertheless the vested interests of the oligarchs who tend to favor the status quo stand in the way of more sweeping economic reforms the impending presidential succession may also limit reform efforts this year4 ukraines foreign policy ukraines foreign policy has been successf ul in some respects ukraine has established good relations with the unite d states other west ern countries and leading organizations such as nato and the european union it has also built excellent ties with its neighbors includi ng nato and future eu members poland hungary and the czech republic ukraine formed loose association with georgia uzbekistan azerbaijan nd moldova dubbed guuam ll former soviet states wanting to preserve their independence in its potentially most troublesome relationship ukraine has avoide d major crises with russia and has secured at least nominal recognition of ukraines sovereignty on the other hand critics note certain ho llowness to ukraines foreign policy ukraines foreign policy moves often lack the political economic and military underpinnings that are needed to improve the stability security and prosperity of ukraine in concrete and durable ways president kuchma describes ukraines foreign policy as having multivector approach observers note that this strategy involves balancing prowester n and prorussian moves depending on the direction from which the regime is feeling the greatest pressure at particular time however these efforts are not usually translated into binding longterm commitments ukrainian political leaders and oligarchs feel that they can not afford to alienate moscow with which they have close econo mic and other links but nevertheless need to keep lines of communication open with the west to avoid becoming wholly dependent on russia scandals in the past few years such as the murder of gongadze and the alleged sale of sophisticated air fense equipment to iraq as well as ukraines overall lack of progress in democratization and market reform have lowered ukraines international standing at least among we stern countries it should be noted thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs6 ukraines foreign policy reflects not just the political strategies of one man but lack of consensus among ukrainian elites on the countrys identity and its geopolitical orientation this lack of c onsensus reflects political regional and social cleavages within ukrainian elites and society ukraines future between russia and the west analysts have expressed concerns about some aspects of ukraines relationship with russia observers have noted th at under russian president vladimir putin russian policy toward ukraine has become more pragmatic than during the yeltsin era instead of sweeping if vague promises of partnership russia has increasingly focused on concrete concerns such as repa yment of ukrainian energy debts to russia and bilateral trade frictions some analys ts are concerned that kuchma has sought support from putin in exchange for greater russian political and economic influence in ukraine another potential cause for concern according to some experts is surge in russian investment in ukraine in recent years russian firms flush with cash as result of high oil prices have bought key industrial firms in ukraine while russian investment in ukraine could be highly be neficial to ukraines economy some fear that russia could come to dominate ukra ine politically and economically if the russian presence is overwhelming ukraines future may also be affected by the domestic political and economic climate in russia russias improving economic situation has benefitted ukra ine due to the close links between the two countries however russias apparent drift toward less democratic political system could have negative impact on ukraine by encouraging authoritarian tendencies there the russian government and gazprom th partly stateowned natural gas giant have pressed ukraine to hand over control of the ukrainian pipeline system to gazprom in payment for ukraines energy debts to russia us policymakers have expressed concern about an october 2002 agr eement between kuchma and putin which foresees the creation of russianukrainian consortium to control the ukrainian natural gas pipeline system the largest in the world the consortium is 5050 split which could give russia veto on key issues however final agreement on the issue has not been reached due to continued ukrainian reluctance to give russia such large measure of control over vital sector of its economy ukraine is trying to reduce its dependence on russia oil by completing an oil terminal at its port city of odesa and constructing pipeline from the terminal to brody poland ukraine and its partners in guuam have explored options for supply route from gas and oil fields in az erbaijan and central as ia to ukraine and western europe that would bypass russia after discussions on the issue between prime minister viktor yanukovych and vi ce president dick cheney ukrainian officials opened talks with with chevront exaco on using odesabrody to transport caspian oil to europe in august 2003 the stateowned russian oil pipeline company transneft cut off oil shipments to odesa claiming that it l acked oil to supply to port transneft has used the same tactic to pressure latvia to sell part of its ventspils oil terminal to transneft some observers believe that the move was meant to signal russianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs7 5 discussions with us and european experts on ukrainedispleasure about the odesa brody project russia and russian oil firm tnk which has been bought by british petroleum are pr essuring ukraine to reverse the flow of the odesabrody pipeline in order to export russian crude oil from odesa border dispute between russia and uk raine has increased tensions between the two countries in october 2003 russia began construction of dike to link russias taman peninsula to the tiny island of tuzla which lies in the kerch strait between the black sea and the sea of azov ukraine strongly protested the construction of the dike toward tuzla which it views as its territory russia responded by questioning ukra ines claim to the island after buildup of ukrainian forces in the area to defend ukraines claim to tuzla moscow and kiev agreed to negotiate over the issue in wider economic and territorial context including on the use of the sea of azov and the kerch strait by both parties the attitudes of ukraines oligarchs may be an important factor in determining ukraines position between russia and the west at present ukraines oligarchs have not assumed high foreign policy pr ofile even on issues one might believe would be of interest to them such as world trade organization membership rather than developing coherent foreign policy approach they have instead made ad hoc decisions aimed at consolidating their internal economic and political positions within ukraine they have generally been reluctant to take steps to alienate moscow given their close economic ties with russi ukrainian oligarchs are wary about letting their russian counterparts gain too mu ch power in ukraine fearing that the richer and more powerful russians could dominate them5 another important issue will be the impact of european union and nato enlargement eu enlargement into cent ral europe to include poland hungary and the czech republic may help stimulate ukraines econom but may have negative psychological consequences as well as practi cal ones such as visa restrictions for ukrainian migrant workers and reductions in ukrainian exports to the new eu states ukrainians may feel increasingly excluded from europe this is especially true given that eu officials say they do not believe that ukraine should become candidate for eu membership in the near future give n its slow progress on political and economic reform eu officials claim that ukraines economy will be enhanced in the long run by eu enlargement nato enlargement and ukraines aspirations to join nato could lead to increased russian pressure on ukraine to distance itself from the alliance particularly if c onservative forces gain more power in moscow advocates of enlargement say that ukraines security will be enhanced by bringing closer to ukraines borders the zone of security that nato represents us policy on the eve of ukraines independen ce and in the early postindependence period usukrainian relations were difficult in 1991 president bush urged ukraine to remain within the soviet union warning of suicidal nationalism nevertheless the united states recognized ukraines independence after the collapsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs8 6 state department press briefing september 24 2003 7 remarks by stephen piferof the soviet union in the early post independence period us ukrainian ties were troubled by ukraines reluctance to pe rmit nuclear weapons on its soil to be withdrawn without guarantees of its security turning point was reached in january 1994 when the united states russia and ukraine signed trilateral statement that committed ukraine to transf er nuclear weapons on its territory in exchange for russian fuel for its nuclear power plants and security assurances that the united states and russia would respect ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity while ukraines reluctance to give up nuclear weapons on its territory irritated us policymakers it may have also helped to form the current us policy consensus that strong multifaceted relationship with stable democratic prosperous and sovereign uk raine integrated with europe and the wider world is key to europes stability vital us interest usukrainian relations suffered rious setbacks from late 2000 until early 2003 us officials repeatedly expresse d concern about political pressure on the media and the harassment of journalists the united states called on the ukrainian government to conduct credib investigation of the g ongadze affair in 2001 the united states granted political asylum to mykola melnychenko the exbodyguard who had produced the tapes allegedly implicating kuchma in the murder of gongadze however perhaps the lowest point in usukrainian relations was reached in late 2002 in september 2002 the administration announced that it had authenticated conversation taped by melychenko in july 2000 in which kuchma gave approval for the sale of four kolchuga early warning radar systems to iraq sale banned by secu rity council arms embargo6 november 2002 us and british factfinding mission to kiev issued report saying that kiev had been evasive in its response to the group the i nvestigators said they could not rule out the sale of the systems but had clear proof they had taken place either there have been public reports of us forces finding kolchugas in iraq after the defeat of saddams army in 2003 in the wake of the kolchuga incident the administration conducted review of its ukraine policy in early 2003 it c oncluded that despite recent setbacks the united states continues to ve an interest in ukraine s development as modern democratic state integrated into euroatlantic institutions and that the united states must continue to be engaged with ukraine in wide variety of areas7 usukrainian ties have improved substantially as result of the war in iraq the administration listed ukraine as member of the coalition to disarm saddam hussein before the war ukraine deployed 200man nuclear bi ological and chemical weapons defense battalion to help kuwait to defend against possible attack in august 2003 ukraine deployed 1650 troops to participate in polishled peacekeeping division in south central iraq ukrainian officer commands one of the brigades in the force while spain and poland lead the two others the united states is also cooperating w ith kiev to promote closer ties between ukraine and nato in may 2002 ukraine announced for the first time that it was seeking nato membership despite the fallout from the kolchuga affair ukrainehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs9 8 state department fy2005 foreign op erations congressional presentation and nato agreed on natoukraine action plan at the november 2002 nato summit in prague the plan which appears to be modeled on natos membership action plan program but does not commit nato to supporting ukraine as candidate for membership includes series of commitments by ukraine to meet objectives in political economic and military reforms us officials have said that if ukraine takes real strides toward reform and meets the qualifications for nato membership it should have the opportunity to join the lliance most analysts estimate that nato will not embark on another round of enlargement until 2007 at the earliest nevertheless the woeful state of ukraines armed forces will require rapid moves toward reforms to meet even this hypothetical deadline the united states is also trying to help ukraine prepare for world trade organization membership progress on this issue has been slowed by resistance from members of parliament from rural areas and by some oligarchs who fear foreign competition another stumbling block to wt membership for ukraine is its failure to respect intellectual propert rights of us firms the oecds financial action task force fatf imposed sanctions on ukraine in early 2003 for not doing enough to stop money laundering the sanctions were lifted in february 2003 after ukraine passed an anti money laundering law in february 2004 ukraine was removed fro m the fatfs blacklist of non cooperating countries reflecting an eval uation that ukraine is implementing its money laundering legisla tion effectively us aid to ukraine foreign aid has been an important tool of us policy toward ukraine this assistance has gone to support efforts to build democracy civil society and the rule of law in ukraine and to promote econo mic reform and the development of small and mediumsized businesses us aid has also been spent to destroy nuclear weapons on ukrainian territo ry and help ukraine prevent the proliferation of technology that could be used in creatin g weapons of mass dest ruction the united states has provided humanitarian and other ssistance to help ukraine deal with the consequences of the chernobyl nuclear accident and promote nuclear safety the united states has provided security assistance to help ukraine participate in joint exercises under natos partnership for peace program the united states provided funding for ukraines par ticipation in kfor the natoled peacekeeping force in kosovo in joint unit with polish troops it is also providing assistance for ukrainian forces in iraq us aid to ukraine has been substan tially reduced in recent years in its fy2005 foreign aid request the adminis tration proposed 795 million in freedom support act assistance for political and econo mic reform in ukraine in fy2003 the united states provided 1387 in fs aid and an estimated 926 million in fy20048 the administration has propos ed 65 million in foreign military financing fmf aid for ukraine in fy2005 up from an estimated 3 million in fy2 004 the administration has justified the reduction in fsa funding by assertinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs10 ukraines successes in reform permitted the reduction it said it was developing multiyear strategy leading to ukraines graduation from us foreign aid other analysts have noted that funding to uk raine may have been rendered vulnerable by other more pressing needs such as fundi ng the reconstruction of iraq and assisting us allies in the fight against terrorism including fsa recipients in central asia and the caucasus region us aid to ukraine has had notable successes particularly in the security sphere and with regard to nuclear safety specific achievements include the complete withdrawal of nuclear weapons from ukra ine and the destruction of associated infrastructure remaining in the country c ooperation in heading off the transfer of nuclear and ballistic ssile technologies to rogue reg imes and ukraines closure of the chernobyl nuclear plant in 2000 achiev ements in political and economic reform have been significant but less clearcut us aid has helped to support independent media in ukraine and build nascent civil society and small business sector however us policymakers have often been frustrated by ukraines slowness to reform some areas of its economy and fight corruption particularly since president kuchmas reelection campaign in 1999 us officials have also expressed concern about ukraines democratic development including the governments treatment of independent media and ngos this situa tion appears to have worsened as the october 2004 elections has approached congressional role ukraine has enjoyed strong across theboard support in congress since independence in the early 1990s congress pushed the bush and clinton administrations for more aid and comprehensive relationship with ukraine as opposed to nearexclusive concern with nuclear weapons issues congress has often underlined its support by specifically earmarking funds for ukraine at times in the past decade ukraine was the third largest recipient of us aid after israel and egypt congress has focused particular attention on issues with humanitarian dimension such as providing aid to ukraine to help it deal with the consequences of the chernobyl nuclear disaster hivaids and other public health issues and assisting efforts to fight trafficking in women serious problem in ukraine this support has been due to number of factors one is ukraines perceived strategic importance in us interests in europe also at least initially ukraines foreign policy was perceived as generally prowestern in congress and the us ukrainian relationship did not have the obstacles that the us relationship with russia has had such as the war in chechny and proliferation concerns with iraq iran and other countries another impor tant factor in cong ressional interest in ukraine is the role of ukrainianamericans while not large in number when compared with other ethnic groups that influence us foreign policy many ukrainianamericans live in states in the midwest and northeast that often play key role in national electi ons in addition the ukrainianamerican community has been active in lobbying congress and th ere are several members of ukrainian ancestry there is also congressional uk rainian caucus an informal organization that promotes awareness of ukrainian issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs11 however congressional attitudes toward ukraine have also been marked by disappointment concerns have focused on the relatively slow progress in economic reform and rampant corruption members of congress have increasingly expressed concern about the state of democracy in ukraine especially since the gongadze murder as well as other crimes allegedly detailed on the audio tapes from kuchmas office including corruption and manipula ting the 1999 presidential election these problems are of course not unique to ukraine they are seen in many countries in the region after several american businessmen ch arged that they were cheated by their ukrainian partners congress added certification provisions to us aid to ukraine in fy1997 fy1998 and fy1999 the provisions called for part of us aid for ukraine to be withheld until the secretary of state certified that there had been progress in resolving these issues the secretary of state made the required certifications but criticized the pace of refo rm in ukraine the certification process was dropped in 1999 as potentially counterpr oductive and as pr ogress was made on individual cases in fy2000 fy2001 and fy2002 congress sw itched to soft earmarks for ukraine which specify that the adminis tration should provi specified amount to ukraine but do not formally require it the fy2002 bill pl 107115 required report by the state department to the appropriations committees on the progress made by ukrainian authorities in investigating and bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of ukranian journalists in the fy2003 bill pl 1087 congress did not earmark an overall figure for ukraine and said that of the funds expended for ukraine 20 million should be made available for nuclear safety nd 15 million for mine safety the bill also contained provision stating that funds could be made availa ble for ukraine until the secretary of state certified that ukra ine had not facilitated or engaged in arms deliveries to iraq since september 30 2000 however this aid cutoff would exclude aid for fighting infectious di seases nuclear safety stoppi ng trafficking in persons and denuclearization assistance the fy 2 004 omnibus appropriations bill pl 108 199 does not contain an earmark for total aid to ukraine although it does contain subearmark of 19 million for nuclear r eactor safety initiatives and 15 million for mine safety program policy issues ukraines current problems raise important issues for us policy one issue is balancing ukraines usefulness to the united states in iraq with less desirable aspects of its behavior in other areas including whether the united states should overlook the possible involvement of president kuchma and other highranking officials in the kolchuga affair now that ukraine is coopera ting with us policy on iraq another concern is whether the warming trend in usukrainian ties will serve to bolster the legitimacy of the kuchma regime and cr eate the perception among regime supporters that the united states is turning bli nd eye to the undemocratic actions of the regime this is particularly important issue given the fact that the ukrainian political elite is currently engaged in struggle to determine who will succeed kuchma when his term expires this year us policymakers could influence thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs12 9 testimony of adrian karatnycky to th commission on security and cooperation in europe may 2 2001 see also karatnyckys ar ticle in foreign affairs meltdown in ukraine mayjune 2001process by making clear that efforts to keep kuchma in power by unconstitutional means would lead him to be viewed as an illegitimate leader by

presidential elections should th united states support yushchenko as the leader of the opposition such moves coul d have negative impact on relations with kuchma and the government they coul d discredit opposition leaders among some ukrainian voters some analysts believe that the united states should avoid becoming directly involved in the political conflicts in ukraine and instead stress its support for the rule of law and fr ee and fair electoral process there is also the issue of whether the united states should reach out to selected oligarchs while many of them have engaged in questionable activities they also represent an important power center in th country perhaps far more important than many proreform groups some of them may also have an interest in developing the rule of law in order to safeguard their property which currently can be placed in jeopardy with reversal of their political fortunes us policymakers could try to convince them to encourage smooth trans ition of power to mo re democratic post kuchma future although these questions are significant many experts stress that ukraines problems do not stem from the personal failings of one or another leader and conversely that ukraines success does not hing on the fate of particular reformer ukraines problems they underline are mo re fundamental these analysts call on the united states to focus on helping to build the political economic and social infrastructure that will provide foundati on for democracy rule of law and economic reform in the medium and longterm they advocate emphasis on aid to independent media thinktanks and ot her nongovernmental organi zations and small business they say more of this aid should take the fo rm of direct grants rather than technical assistance9 many also call for an expansion of exchange programs between ukraine and the united states to introduce emerging leaders in ukraine to the us example however us policymakers may face in creasing difficulties in achieving these goals given the substantial decreases in aid to ukraine planned for fy2005 and subsequent years another problem us policymakers face is how to shore up ukraines sovereignty and independence and promote closer ties with the west perhaps the biggest obstacles to this goal are ec onomic ukraines sovereignty would be bolstered if the united states and other western countries could help ukraine deal with such issues as ukraines energy pendency on russia solutions could include new pipelines from the caspian sea region to diversify ukraines sources of energy supplies upgrading ukraines current pi peline system and reform of the energy sector and restructuring of ukrainian industries to make them more energy efficienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30984crs13 to achieve these goals ukraine needs balanced investment both from the west and russia but while russian firms are adept at fishing in the murky waters of ukraines political and economic system western firms demand transparency and have been reluctant to invest in ukrain the us government can only play limited role in encouraging private investment except by continuing to push for transparency in ukraine and by helping u s firms learn of opportunities that emerge if the situation improves the united states is also trying to help ukraine prepare for world trade organization membership pr ogress on this issue has been slowed by resistance from members of parliament from rural areas and by some oligarchs who fear foreign competition ukraines announced desire to join nato and its deployment of forces to iraq also open up increased possibilities of coopera tion in the security sphere the united states and other nato count ries can offer much to ukraines military including aid to promote military reform in ukraine such aid could help not only ukraines military solve its real problems including low living standards and the impact of downsizing the officer corps but could also raise its prestige in ukrainian society
