edition 1 fouo i edition 1 fouo how the iraqi army operates contents of this document are all from unclassified and ope n sources it has been submitted for review and foreign disclosure edition 1 fouo ii edition 1 fouo introduction this smart book is designed to provide transition teams and organizations that are partnered with iraqi forces with baseline reference on p rocesses and procedures integral to the iraqi army it attempts to connect theory to practice by providing means by which transition teams and partner units can differentiate between how things are supposed to be done and how they are being done this smart book does not address procedures internal to the transition teams partner unit s and their chains of command the repetition and refinement of processes within the iraqi army directly supports reduced dependence on coalition forces and ulti mately leads to capable competent iraqi army prior to solving problems through coalition support partner units and transition teams must exhaust the range of options provided by the iraqi army and its supporting establishment partner units and tr ansition teams in concert with their iraqi army counterparts ultimately create t he processes and procedures which produce sustainable force there are several important caveats t hat must be declared to the warfighter using this smartbook the iraqi army is rapidly evolving organization as such many of the processes described in this smart book are undergoing r apid change deployed transition team or partner unit is advised to contin uously seek updates on procedures from multinati onal forces iraq mnfi multi national security transition command iraq mnstci iraqi assistance group iag and other headquarters the best source of information on processes may be the iraqi units themselves many of the processes described in this book were designed by coalition forces it is clear that these types of processes mirror similar aspects of the us dod transition teams and partner units must make clear analysis of how closely iraqi units are following proc esses defined by the coalition in some cases they may be using process from the legacy of the iraqi army prior to oif or have modified coalit ion designed process to suit their needs all of the source material used with in this smart book was collected from sources subordinate to or within mnf i the preponderance of the source material is us some of the source material is iraqi and was translated from arabic it is likely that there are numerous procedures that are viewed differently by the iraqis and the coalition due to differences in translation and culture this smart book is divided into 11 chapter s that describe many of the battlefield and support systems this is the first edi tion notes pages have been provided in edition 1 fouo iii edition 1 fouo the smart book for coalition personnel it is through these notes and feedback on the iraqi army processes and procedures t hat each

armed forces 1 under the constituti ons framework iraqi milit ary power operates for and under the conditions determined by the people th rough their elected representatives it is subject to ultimate civilian control and command at all mes in war as well as peace this political context establishes the objectives and the li mits of legitimate military action in peace crisis and conflict wit hin iraq and along its borders 2 the armed forces of iraq fulfill the constitutional imperative to provide the common defense defense of nati onal sovereignty territorial integrity societal values and national interests is the essential goal and measure of value of the profession of arms in iraqi society b history of the iraqi security forces 1 the brief history of the isf has seen numerous organizational changes mission changes redesignations and component mergers in january 2005 what had been the iraqi national guard ing and ear lier the civil defense corps was merged into the iraqi army 2 between april and june 2005 almost ev ery iraqi army unit at battalion and brigade level was redesignated to fit into pa ttern where battalions and brigades were numbered sequentially within t heir parent brigade and division generally speaking even numbered divisions 2d 4t h 6th 8th 10th start ed out as regionally organized ing units while odd numbered divisions 1s t 3d 5th began as iraqi army units recruited at the national level 3 in addition to the iraqi army which falls under the ministry of defense the ministry of the interior fi elds sizeable force of land forces under the umbrella of national police units and the positional forces the bor der police and iraqi police service 4 the coalition provisional authorit cpa officially disbanded the former baathist regime iraqi armed forces on 23 may 2003 the cpa started the process to establish new iraqi armed forc earlier the same month edition 1 fouo 2 edition 1 fouo 5 in june 2003 the cpa tablished the coalit ion military assistance training team cmatt while cmatt was institut ing new iraqi army the cpa started paying stipend to former iraqi army nco s and officers roughly equivalent to their former salaries this stipend would last for year originally the new iraqi army was envisioned as small threedivision force wh ich would be recruit ed nationally and have the mission of defending the country from limited external th reats the first battalion of this force began training at kirkuk in august 2003 6 in addition to this small force under the new ministry of defense mod in september 2003 the ministry of the interior moi began formi ng local militiastyle units for internal defense called the iraqi civil defense corps icdc the icdc while under the moi was formed initially on decentraliz ed basis at company level by coalition forces the icdc eventually created ba ttalions brigades and divisions and was transferred to mod control this force was later redesignated as the iraqi national guard ing and in early 2005 merged with the iraqi army it is important to remember that while the iraqis have proud military tr adition that traces back centuries the current configuration of their military forces has existed for only short period of time and experienced several major organizational shifts 2 iraqi security forces the iraqi security forces are currently controlled by several diff erent ministries the minister of the interior is scheduled to absorb all the other security forces that do not belong to the ministry of defense figure 11 illustrates the complexity of the moi struct

fouo 7 edition 1 fouo notesedition 1 fouo 8 edition 1 fouo notesedition 1 fouo 9 edition 1 fouo chapter 2 cultural considerations 1 general as with many national armies the iraqi army is composed of individuals from the general population with deeply ingrained cultural pers pectives and biases the iraqi army and coalition forces must consider these cultur factors during operations and training understanding the cultural fr amework of the iraqi army will not guarantee success but failing to understand it will certai nly lead to frustration and possible failure in building credible and viable security force this short chapter provides basic level of detail necessary to understand the complexity of the iraqi culture and its affects on iraqi army force generation and perations the intent is to point out to the planners advisors and trainers that cult ure will impact operations if t hey dont try to understand the culture they may not understand why their efforts are not having the desired effect 2 cultural factors iraqs culture incorporates m any aspects of traditional arabislamic culture the cult ural mix presents very complex set of circumstances in developing courses of action to organize equi p train and advise iraqi army forces as means to understand the perc eption and approach of ia mbers there are several key cultural factors that influence thei r behavior gender family origin subtribe affiliation ethnicity religion political affilia tion and current or forme r occupation while these factors do not repr esent all of the influences on an iraqi or the ia unit they are the most significant in terms of assessing the re lationships they may establish with other personnel units or government organizations figure 21 represents sample of the influences of these factors

affecting relationships edition 1 fouo 10 edition 1 fouo gender iraqi males and females have significantly differe nt view of their roles and responsibilities than in western cult ures while there ar changes in the roles and responsibilities that women fill in the iraqi army there is still significant separation between the genders women are placed in s ubservient role but at the same time protected or restricted from interaction with outsiders b family in iraq the family remains the central p illar of the stru cture of the society the honor of and yalty to the family and tri be are pervasive throughout the iraqi approach to life as in many patriarchal societies t he male children learn the trade of their father and follow in the same occupati on the context for re cruits for the iraqi army comes from this cultural approach of veneration and respec t for their family c subtribe loyalty and association with tribe serves as the basis before all else family first tribe cond and government last the father and male elders of tribe are respected and revered and they dictate t he loyalties of the family or tribe if they dictate that education is of little purpose for or particularly daughter the n the children will in most ca ses not attend school with in iraq there is widespread illiteracy with only 58 of the population achieving basic level of education of that 58 the literacy breakdown among the sexes is 71 for males and 45 for females d ethnicity the iraqi army faces t he challenge of organization with soldiers from several different ethnic groups often with longstanding an imosities many factors impact the effectiveness of an iraqi army uni t starting with its ethnic composition of arabs kurds and turkmen ethnic perceptions and biases of ia uni ts will significantly affect interaction with the population or other groups such as the iraqi police religion in addition to ethnicity religion is ma jor factor with the various islamic sects such as sunni and shia further stra tified by mixture of tribes or families the majority shiite religious group is further divided into followers of various imams such as the grand ayatollah ali alsistani of najaf and muqtada sadr one of the few surviving descendants of grand ayatollah mo hamed bakr alsadr equally fractured are sunni religious groups seeking to rest ore or strengthen their position in the new iraq f political under the fo rmer regime the number of political parties was limited due to repression but under the new iraqi constitu tion there is such restriction the result of the new iraqi constitution and dem ocratic process created numerous political parties the heavy political involvement of the iraqi population gave birth to numerous parties and one party holds enough political power to control the parliament political parties form coalitions to gain eno ugh influence in the polit ical system to give voice to their desires and point of view wh ile iraqi army military members retain the right to vote the new constitu tion prohibits organized political action by units or lead ers g occupation current inductees in the iraqi army join the force with the knowledge that they place not onl their lives but also those of their family in jeopardy from attacks by insurgent and terrorist ements unconfirmed estimates place the number of casualties in the iraqi rmy and police forces between june 2003 and november 2006 at 5736 knowledge of the hi gh number of casualties and the perils of military service do not dissuade iraqis from continuing to volunte er for service personnel with previous army or police service under the former regime also have edition 1 fouo 11 edition 1 fouo certain cultural approaches to security oper ations that may not fit with the currently approved methods 1 military iraqi milit ary history and culture also create some of the context for development of the new ir aqi army while coaliti on forces and the new iraqi government seek to create military that responds to the civilian government with the capability to protect and defend the nation t here are many elements of the previous force that linger with the soldiers and leaders that make up the new force the history of the iraqi military created under the former regime sa w the military and intelligence services used to control and suppress the iraqi population and ensure that those forces remained loyal to the regime while cert ain elements of the intelligence services focused on external issues and carried out operations against opponents of iraq and saddam the majority monitor ed interrogated coerced and took direct action against the population saddam used the intelligence apparatus to ensure his continued control of the iraqi populati on and military forces as the former intelligence organizati ons brutally maintained saddams control over the population great deal of hatred mistrust and fear towards the intelligence apparatus remains in the population the former iraqi military forces combined elements of british and sovi et doctrine coupled with thei r own combat experiences gained during the iraniraq war to form their struct ure and ttps as found throughout arab culture there is general submission and obedience of superiors projecting paternal image leaders securely occupy the t op of the pyramid of authority with little history of delegating au thority to subordinates b leaders in the new iraqi army will approach their leadershi p roles and responsibilities based on their historical and cu ltural perspective on military service through interviews with former iraqi regime fficers there are some indicators of the perceptions of military officers from that period those ia officers that transitioned into the new ia developed much of their militar culture based on experience gained during the period leading up to oper ation iraqi freedom oif c after desert storm the iraqi army attempted to gather insights and lessons from experiences during the conflict bec ause saddam believed the iraqi ground forces had generally performed well during the war t he officers compiling their lessons learned focused on peripheral and irrelevant elements of their warfighting effo rts the resulting review of wartime operations diverted or avoi ded constructive criticism of iraqi military operations and in some cases turned negatives into positive observations one finding stated that the republican guar d actually won the war by avoiding annihilation the logic of the observation was that with the superiority of the coalition forces the republican guard succeeded by hiding to avoid annihilation repetition of these lessons concerning dispersion construction of deep bunkers and hiding equipment actually became the operati onal doctrine of the ground forc the result was that leaders and the army l onger measured success by units ability to engage and defeat an enemy force but rather by how we ll commander or leader avoided combat and conserved his forces d commanders and unit leaders also operated in an severe at mosphere of suspicion paranoia and distrust saddams security apparatus cond ucted extensive edition 1 fouo 12 edition 1 fouo spying and surveillance of unit leadership to ensure that there was attempt to overthrow the government leaders were ften subjected to spies and technical surveillance within their units the result wa s military culture t hat avoided contact and coordination with other units and was suspicious of the mo tives of anyone that was not of proven personal loyalty the command and control conditions produced leaders that expected great deal of micromanagement from the upper levels of the gov ernment bureaucracy while retaining the responsibility for unit perfo rmance commanders routinely saw subordinate units ordered into action or to new loca tions without their knowledge extreme suspicion on the part of saddam and the seni or leadership made it very risky for unit leadership to move their forces for traini ng or other operations these conditions created perception by unit leadership that the regime security spie s were out to set them up or find some mistake cons equently unit leaders avoided taking action remained as isolated as possible from other commanders or leaders and avoided contact with their higher headquarters if possible f largely based on the histor ical military culture leade rs in the iraqi army will seek to establish and hold their position based on whom t hey know and trust previous loyalties will be very strong influence in the command and contro l of the new iraqi army for instance battalion commander may hold what we would think of as unusually strong influence with the divisi on commander based not on performance or efficiency but rather on family tribe or previous personal relationship g other cultural influences in addition other cultural conditions will directly affect development and operation of the new iraqi army some approaches or perceptions by ia members ar formed from the previous m ilitary culture religious or family influences examples of some of those conditions are 1 discipline in the fo rmer iraqi regime forces wa s very harsh by western standards unit leadership was subject to ex ecution if their subordinate units were defeated soldiers were s ubject to amputation of hands being thrown off buildin gs beatings with whips or canes stoning and cutting out tongues for variety of infractions ranging from criticism of saddam to capitol crimes such as murder 2 iraq is primarily cash based soci ety because of distrust of banks by the average person lack of pervasive technical capabilities within the financial sector and policies of the previous regime soldiers will require cash payments on payday creating the need for pay officer security and accountability procedures 3 religious requirements such as holidays and prayer times can dictate operational tempo the ram adan holiday starts on the begi nning of the ninth month based on lunar calendar year and is roughly month long bservance its start date shifts forward by approximately eleven days ev ery year in relation to the gregorian calendar the faithful obser ve strict fast and celebr ate the end of ramadan with eid alfitr the feast of breaking the fast wh ich lasts for three days another sacred observance eid aladha the feast of sacrif ice occurs at the end of the hajj on the tenth day of the twelfth mont h and lasts for three days ob servance of these religious holidays will disrupt training and operations of the ia edition 1 fouo 13 edition 1 fouo 4 there is reluctance to share in formation because of belief that holding information strengthens persons power base there is also th tendency towards paranoia caused by the pervasive spying and m onitoring the military forces experienced under the former regime 5 family responsibilities can dictate military procedures soldiers receive their pay in cash and travel home on leave to give it to their family serious family need for assistance can cause ia soldiers to abandon t heir responsibilities and travel home to respond 6 patriarchal authority is strong soldier may leave his unit if his father or clan sheik directs him to come home for some purpose 2 police the primary iraqi security force that the ia will interact with in their area of operation will in most cases be the iraqi police generally the iraqi military and police security forces do not enjoy simila r culture in their approach to security operations the different operational approaches used by t he army and police at times may impair the intended security objective in an area of operation basic difference in security operations is that the police stay in the same precinct district or community whereas assignment of ia units depends on the security situation and mission task organization personnel that form the ip forc in given area will most likely share the same cultural factors as the local populati on the ia units on the other hand may be from other provinces wit h other cultural traits as result there are obstacles to effective cooperation and coor dination between the two elemen ts that require concerted efforts to overcome 3 operational impacts to assess the affects of cultural factors on operations transition team tt mem bers analyze the unit and its functions by answering questions focused on the cultural factors as the analysis occurs the tt also identifies means and methods to mitigate or alleviat any adverse cultural impacts on ia unit effectiveness the example leading question s below are not checklist to follow but rather are intended to assist tt members in building an understanding of the cultural conditions impacting their ia unit in addition the mitigation action s do not apply in all cases and are only startpoint for further deve lopment members of tt fo cus on developing new skills methods and approaches with the soldiers and l eaders of the ia tigation of cultural impacts must in many cases take the form of selling the new idea or method to the ia unit and leadership leader to subordinate relations leading

memorandum of under standing between the iraqi ministry of defence and coalition forces mou it is critical for deploying partner units and transition teams to familiarize themselves with this mou and the other documents referenced within it this memo randum describes command relationships within multiple contexts there are many po ssible permutations of these relationships therefore understanding this process is critical despite what may be written differing tactical situations and differe nt personalities of coalition and iraqi commanders will have the largest impact on the true meaning of

associated with command relationships fo r the iraqi army it is even more complicated the paragraphs below describ most of the factors that will exert influence over who or what organization controls and infl uences operations it is important for each partner unit and transiti on team to precisely understand their command relationships on both the iraqi chain and the coali tion chain these command relationships may change from operation to operation the definitions of adcon tacon and opcon are detaile d below because the definitions offered in the memorandum of understanding be tween the iraqi

relies on personal re lationships in daytoday interaction so to does the intelligence proc ess the most pervasive intelligence collection capability in the ir aqi security forces is the development and use of human intelligence humint under the forme r regime military intelligence services monitored the activities of commanders and units the focus of the intelligence services in the new ia is the insurgent thre at hiding in the civilian population b iraqi security forces excel at the ability to gather and assess the relevance of information gathered from sources in the population difficulties remain in the capability to assimilate transmit and analyze intelligence at the operational and strategic levels iraqi army units are adept at collecting tactic or local level information and putting it to use but the capability to analyze and send the resulting hu mint to higher levels is still not fully developed much of the collect ed information serves narrow purpose at the battalion and possibly the brigade level but the synchronization to gain full benefit continues to require development edition 1 fouo 73 edition 1 fouo 3 capabilities the path of the intelligence f

section performs screening interro gation and reporting under the supervision of the senior interrogator edition 1 fouo 80 edition 1 fouo figure 57 tactical interrogation section c the senior interrogator supervises the interrogation process the senior interrogator ensures the interrogation process is started immediately upon receipt of the source this process is continuous and can become confused if the senior interrogator does not closely supervise the timely and orderly conduct of each step in the process 1 screening screening determines who will be interrogated on priority basis and in many cases how many times source will be interrogated fo r this reason the successful accomplishment of the intelli gence collection effort depends on qualified screeners the senior interr ogator designates his most qualified interrogators as screeners he should not assign himself to screening operations this cannot always be avoided however but must be k ept to minimum he is r equired to supervise all steps of the interrogation process 2 interrogation the senior interr ogator ensures that detainees are assigned for interrogation according to the screening re sults this method of assigning assures the highest probability of obtaining the maximu m amount of pertinent information within the time available is chosen the senior interrogator then assign s his subordinates to interrogate screened detainees he does this by comparing information gained during the screening process to the abilities linguisti c skills technical expertise and special knowledge of his subordinate in terrogators he then selects the interrogator best suited to conduct the interrogation of particular detainee 3 reporting the senior interrogator ensures that all repor ts are prepared and submitted in an accurate and timely manner reports must be generated immediately upon identification of information which sati sfies an intelligence requirement other reports which are generated

into the mission planning process requires specific focus in the traini ng program the g2s2 provi des critical products for the mission planning process that are essential to ffective staff functions at all levels the iraqi s2 and s3 must work together to understand the situation and develop credible edition 1 fouo 83 edition 1 fouo courses of action for mission pl anning the cultural propensity is for unit commanders to plan the mission using the executive dec ision making approach training and practice must ensure that the s3 and s2 develops the ssion analysis briefs the mission to the commander and the commander then provides his inpu t after they are finished b another aspect of intelligence capabilit ies that requires focused attention is detainee operations intelligence operations must mature to accurately document and track detainees as well as ensur that the results of inte rrogations are both legal and useful use of coercive interrogation chniques generally does not produce reliable information from detainee coalition forces must assist iraqi intelligence in developing useful tools and procedures that document and track information collected from detainees and that support the intelligence co llection process not only is there requirement to collect as much useful intellig ence as legally possible from detainees it is also essential that clear means exist to document evidence of criminal activity intelligence operations are often the first point which documents the collection and preservation of evidence against an insurgent c cultural aspects can significantly ffect the intelligence operations of iraqi army units few examples follow use of information or intelligence as power restrict the flow in information or inte lligence to avoid attent ion or criticism providing generic intelligence analysis to avoid blame for faulty analysis d integration of computers or ot her automated systems into the intelligence analysis and dissemination process increases the challenge for soldiers that are not computer literate or comfor table with technical systems the g2s2 may use stereotypical per ceptions of other ethnic or

transition teams assess the operation of the intelligence section of various iraqi army forces several questions listed below may assist in developing an ssessment of their performance these questions are not all inclusive but indicate areas that are us eful in determining the capability of the intelligence operation does the intelligence section understand their role in missio n planning does the intelligence section communicate ffectively with the unit commander and staff in developing common operational picture of the battlefield edition 1 fouo 84 edition 1 fouo does the intelligence section effectively int egrate all available intelligence to form credible assessment of the threat are there ethnic or religious cultural attit udes that restrict the effectiveness of the intelligence operation are detainees treated humanel interrogated expeditiously and the resulting information analyzed and passed to the appropriate levels does the unit commander interfere with t he flow of

iraqi ministry of defense logistic support is performed across two dimensionscapability s upport and operations supporteach with distinct characteristics and requirements while the director general acquisit ions logistics and infrastructure and joint headquarte rs m4 share responsibilitie s within the ministry of defense for acquisition logistics base m anagement and infrastructure they focus on different dimensions as follows 1 director general acquisitions logi stics and infrastructure the director general acquisitions logistics and infras tructure focuses on the capability support dimension or support over the life cycle of its capabilities it encompasses the logistics of acquiring and determining the logistics arrangements required to support particular capability the outcome is to have prepared capabilities to support the armed forces logistic mission 2 joint headquarters m4 the joint headquarters m4 focu ses on the operations support dimension or logist ics supporting operations it encompasses the support needed to be planned to deploy sust ain and reconstitute force tailored to meet particular operation the outco of the operations is the mission there are two basic subdivisions of operations support for the iraqi army the first type of logistics uni t is unit that reports to the iraqi armed forces support command subordinate to the joint headqu arters these units are garrison organizations that provide logistical suppor t to geographic region an example of this type of unit is garrison suppor t unit figure 7 1 depicts the command relationships of support command units the second type of logistics units are edition 1 fouo 88 edition 1 fouo those which fall under the c ontrol of the operational army they are directly subordinate to tactical organizations and re ceive their orders from the same an example of this type of unit is motorized transport regiment each iraqi army division has logistical units within their c hain of command some of these units will be directly subordinate to the division and some of these units will be directly subordinate to infantry battalions or brigades figure 61 command relationships edition 1 fouo 89

personnel organic to the unit using portable tools and lim ited range of fast moving repai r parts in the main this grade is restricted to common minor r epairs involving adjustment and quick replacement of repair par ts and minor assemblies 2 medium grade repairs medium grade repairs are those maintenance tasks that require greater engineering c apacity than can be provided by unit maintenance personnel in the main t hese tasks are limited to assembly and module replacement medium grade repairs ma include some repairs to assemblies and modules including those repair tasks which need light machine tool support and wider range of repair parts and specialized facilities 3 heavy grade repairs heavy grade repairs are those maintenance tasks that require extensive engineer ing facilities these range from repairs to individual components and overhaul of assemblies and modules to overhauls and rebuilds of major items of equipment heavy grade repai rs are generally time consuming and require the use of extensive machine t ools test equipment and facilities they require comprehensive range of repair parts heavy grade repairs generally require some form of equipment exchange fo r the customer unit for this reason supply chain repair pool is usually required f equipment condition c odes the iraqi army uses simple set of three codes to identify equipment conditions these codes are u equipment is safe and usable ur equipment is usable with restrictions nu equipment is not usable g readiness reporting the ia fo rm 406 is reported each week up the chain of command to provide the current maintenance status of units equipment h maintenance information systems i the national maintenance contract 8 supply the supply support concept aligns strongly with the logistic support concept in particular there are three levels of supply support and four lines of supply support there are however specif ic differences in supply that apply to maintenance edition 1 fouo 109 edition 1 fouo levels of supply support 1 strategic level of supply the primary focus of the strateg ic level is to ensure sufficient stocks of all classes of supply are provided from the international and national supply chains to sustain the oper ational and tactical levels with delivery either to the tadji national depot or the regional support units and to establish and manage national level supply contracts the director general of acquisition logistics infrastructure wit hin the mod holds responsibility for oversight of the strategic level of supply 2 operational level of supply the operational level focuses on using the stocks provided by the strategic level to support the tadji national depot to support 4th line supply support to t he regional support units and to support the regional support units 3rd line supply support to their s upported units the organizations primarily responsible for the operational level of supply are th joint headquarters staff and support command 3 tactical level of supply the tactical level focuses on u sing the supply support provided by the operational level to support operati ons there is not clear line drawn between organizations at the top edge of the tactical level of supply and the operational level of supply for example the tadji national depot and the regiona l support units conduct supply support operations that can be considered both tactical and operational examples of organizations t hat conduct pure tactical supply are motorized transport regiments within iraqi army division logistics battalions within the 9th iraqi mechanized division and h eadquarters and support companies edition 1 fouo 110 edition 1 fouo b lines of supply support the iraqi armed forces has four lines of supply support 1 1st line 1st line supply support is provided by the supply element integral to the organization for example the supply platoon of the organizations headquarters and services company 2 2nd line 2nd line supply support is provi ded by the supply company within any logistic battalion supporting formation 3 3rd line 3rd line supply support is provided by the supply element of the supporting regional support unit 4 4th line 4th line supply support is provided by the national depot at tadji c functions of supply the functions of supply include 1 determination of stockholding r equirements to meet current and future requirements 2 procurement actions to be initia ted through the director of contracting 3 receivingst orageissue of items 4 stocking of items 5 inventorysecuri ty control mechanisms d classes of supply there are 10 classes of supply these classes of supply mirror the classes used within the us dod see figure 616 below edition 1 fouo 111 edition 1 fouo class supplies i

level of the supply chain identified below stocks will be held and managed and requisitions will be process ed there are varying degrees of stocks on hand when expressed as da ys of supply the ability of the iraqi army to accurately forecast demands is limited without automat ed systems to support decision making for example expressing repair parts class ix in terms of days of supply is not likely to produce meaningful result in the iraqi army due to wide variance in types of equipm ent and inadequate automated fo recasting systems figure 617 depicts the flow of requisitions wit hin the iraqi armys supply chain f supply information systems g how to get supplies getting suppl ies requires significant lead time good planning and supervision of t he flow of paper different cl asses of supply

request for miss ion essentialcri tical items edition 1 fouo 113 edition 1 fouo figure 618 request for routine items 1 class i subsistence and water iraqi army units obtain food and water through life support contracts while in garrison an iraqi army unit will eat fresh food provided by their life s upport contract they will so be provided bulk water and bottled water based on these life support contracts when in the field iraqi army units will draw their subsistence and water from the closest tablished base if unable to draw class 1 from nearby base units shoul d deploy with five days of food and water the field ration for iraqi units is the hard rati on halal iraqi army units need to plan for drawing life support from nearby bases if their operation exceeds their capacity to resupply based on the guidelines described above iraqi army units should plan for sufficient lead time to order har d rations prior to executing an operation the iraqi army form 101 is used to order rations from t he next echelon in the supply chain 2 class ii individual soldiers are i ssued equipment prior to arriving to their units of course this does not mean that equipment is never lost figure 618 above illustrates the requisition flow for this ty pe of equipment class ii also consists of clothing tentage organization tool sets maps admin supplies and housekeeping supplies these items are also requisi tioned per the flow depi cted in figure 618 edition 1 fouo 114 edition 1 fouo 3 class iii obtaining bulk fuel s and packaged petroleum products is constant challenge for iraqi units pack aged petroleum products are normally procured through the national maintenance contract bulk fuel is procured through system of vouchers based on units equipm ent density units that are colocated with an rsu may be able to draw their bulk f uel directly from the rsu the ability of unit to obtain fuel depends on veral factors 1 is the unit located with an rsu 2 if the unit is not located by an rs u does its division mtr have the capability to transport fuel if not does the unit have contractor with the capability to transport fuel 3 is the unit authorized to buy fuel on the local economy through fuel vouchers issued by the ministry of oil moi 4 is the unit still working directly with coalition unit for logistics support and therefore draws fuel fr om coalition stocks b essentially the ability to transport st ore and issue fuel at all echelons will largely dictate the method by wh ich an iraqi unit obtains fuel c the fuel voucher process the pr ocess detailed below is normally used to support an iraqi army division operating with the support of an rsu the rsu ultimately provides the information for its s upported units to the ministry of defense m 4 in order to obtain fuel for all of its s upported units including garrison units there will be multiple variations of this proc ess depending on the level of support an iraqi army unit is provided due to the varying degrees of capability and maturity in the overall logistics systems fuel aut horizations are not produced as result of forecasting operational tempo and requirem ents fuel authorizations are produced based on units equipment densit each unit will be authorized the same amount of fuel per month based on the quantity and type of equipment they possess the authorizations below are used to calculate the mont hly fuel allotment for an iraqi unit 1 fuel authorizations per day motorized v ehicles 20 liters b heavy motorized vehicles 40 liters c armored vehicles 40 liters d generators sm med lg xl 20 50 200

the iraqi joint forces 9 challenges facing communication tts one of the major chal lenges in the communications area is transportation the security situation in iraq has unquestion ably affected the rate at which systems have been installed and made operational in particular the security situation has delayed transportation of material and inst allation crews to many locations throughout the republic of iraq nonet heless mnstci in concert with the iraqi mod and jhq completed 100 of dpn installs by the planned ioc date of december 2006 94 of the originally planned idn installs by the ioc date of 2006 and 100 of the c2 radio deliveries within the pl anned delivery window b as the iraqi army activates 9 moto rized transport regiments the number of assets available for protected travel in theater should increase easing transportation scheduling difficulties additionally under iraqi contracts for expanding system capacity contractors will be responsible for their own tr ansportation security which should increase flexibility by reducing t he dependency on scarce military transportation assets c second challenge is the availabi lity of trained personnel the number of trained iraqi communications personnel continues to lag behind the number needed field commanders are reluctant to send troops to training from its that are heavily involved in an ongoing counterinsurgency fi ght moreover an average of 1015 of the troops that arrive for each iraqi signal school class are ble to enter the class because they lack the basic literacy skills required to learn effe ctively delay in the activation of new highercapacity schoolhouse facility also re duced the number of trainees who could be trained per class changes outlined in the iss section above should ameliorate some of these

thority order 22 and transitions to the current iraqi constitu tion both documents specify civilian control of the iraqi armed services and security services with the express goal of defending the nation both the constitution and the cpa order before it also seek to establish fair treatm ent of military personnel in the context of public set of laws and rules 2 historical context under the former iraqi regime the m ilitary conducted operations based on the direction of the president saddam hussein even though there w ere standing laws that guided the actions of the milit ary saddam used the iraqi military to further his own aims often to the detriment of the iraqi populati on and the military itself the former regime often used both military force and acti on by militia type forces such as the saddam fedayeen to isolate and destroy any i ndication of rebellion or dissidence in the population b to further control the possibility of disse nt within the military itself the regime imposed harsh measures under body of military law disci pline in the former iraqi forces was very harsh by we stern standards unit leadershi p was subject to execution if their subordinate units were defeated soldiers were subj ect to amputation of hands being thrown off buildings beatings with whips or canes stoning and cutting out tongues for variety of infractions in some cases military personnel were imprisoned for making simple joke about the security apparatus 3 iraqi constitution the iraqi constitution specifies several requirements in establishing the iraqi armed services article 9 mandates the com position of the forces and several other aspects of the security apparatus intended to defend the nation synopsis follows b the armed forces and security servic are to be composed of all elements of the population with due consider ation given to balance and r epresentation they are subject to the control of t he civilian authority shall defend iraq shall not be used to oppress the iraqi people shall not interfere in pol itical affairs and shall have role in the transfer of authority 1 militias are prohibited outside t he framework of the armed forces 2 political action by members of t he armed forces is prohibited with the exception of the continued right for individuals to ca st their vote edition 1 fouo 177 edition 1 fouo 3 the focus of the intelligence service is to identify threa ts to the nation and report to the iraqi government all intelligence operations are subject to legislative oversight and civilian control all operations shall be in accordance with the law and comply with the recognized principles of human rights 4 the iraqi government will respect in ternational provisions to prevent proliferation of wmd and development of systems to support delivery capabilities of such weapons 5 finally the military services are subj ect to criminal law and provisions that address offenses unique to military operations c as with title x in the us code t he iraqi constitution identifies the required action of the iraqi military in support of the nation the guidance under the constitution is broad and there will continue to be re finement of the vel of authority and responsibilities of the iraqi military services under the cons titutional guidance in the interim many of the cpa orders remain in ffect to describe in more detail the law and its application to the iraqi armed forces iaf 4 iraqi code of military discipline creation of new iraqi armed services mandated the need for new disciplinary code to fill the gap created by the defeat and di ssolution of the former iraqi regime to achieve that end the coalition provisiona l authority published the code of military discipline that continues to serve as the bas is for further development by the new iraqi government the iraqi ministry of defens general counsels office continues to develop more complete military justice sys tem in order to publish new iraqi code of military justice b under the code not only are iraqi army soldiers and officers subject to civil law they also serve under set of laws spec ifically related to military discipline the goal of the new code is to preserve t he commanders inherent right to maintain good order and discipline within the ia while simultaneously preserving the rights of the soldiers of the new ia c ia personnel are subject of the fo llowing set of specific military offenses 1 mistreatment of ia personnel of inferior rank 2 causing or engaging in disturbanc or behaving in disorderly manner 3 behaving in an insubordinate manner 4 striking senior ranking person 5 sentries failing to perform duty as instructed or engaging in misconduct edition 1 fouo 178 edition 1 fouo 6 disobeying lawful order 7 drunkenness resulting in being unfit for duty behaving in disorderly manner or behaving in manner likely to bring discredit on the ia 8 absence without leave 9 avoiding the performance of du ty or

ia property 13 conduct contrary to the good order and discipline 14 behaving in manner likely to bring discredit on the i 5 application of the code of discipline while the enforcement and administration of the iraqi code of military discipline is similar to united states military procedures there are unique aspects that require discussi on disciplinary author ity in the ia rests with junior jdo and senior di sciplinary officers sdo jdos are of the rank of captain or higher who command either company or an equivalentsize unit of which an accus ed is member brigade commander can also appoint jdo in writing to administer disciplinary actio n for an accused soldier junior disciplinary officers have jurisdiction over members of the ia f below the rank of lieutenant for true military ffenses under the iaf code superior commanders cannot retain the authority or rest rict the authority of company commanders in administering discipline for senior nco misconduct b senior disciplinary officers are ltcs or higher in rank who command the battalion of which the accused is member or who the commander of the iaf appoints to be the sdo of an accused unlike t he us military system the code allows brigade commander to appoint in writing jdo to administer discipline in separate or other units that may not have company commander available to fill the role additionally the iraqi s ystem clearly contemplates appointing jdo after the commission of an offense if company co mmander is unavailable or disqualified from administering nonjudicial punishment njp it is unnecessary to resort to the next superior commander because they can appoint jdo to administer the case c sdos authority is considerably di fferent from that of field grades njp authority in the us military system sdo only has or iginal jurisdiction over true military offenses concerning personnel of the iaf in the rank f lieutenant and above as edition 1 fouo 179 edition 1 fouo long as the sdo is at least one rank above the accused they also have jurisdiction over appeals of jdo decisions the juri sdiction of iraqi battalion commanders as sdo is much more limited than that of their am erican counterparts american field grade njp authorities have jurisdiction over all mbers of their comma nd although there are arguably many drawbacks to this limitation in sdos jurisd iction it enforces strict application of the policy to dispose of of fenses at the lowest appropriate level d as with the commanders jurisdiction t he code also contains differences in the available punishments fo r military offenses and their admin istration in the iraqi system jdo can administer the following punishment s in respect to each military offense of which he finds an enlisted iaf member guilty 1 detention for period not longer than seven days 2 fine not exceeding fourteen days pay 3 reprimand 4 extra duties to maximum of seven days 5 in respect of private first class corporal or sergeant reducti on by one rank 6 stoppages of pay in respect to damage or loss caused by the act or acts which formed the basis of t he offense charged not ex ceeding fourteen days pay the iraqi system permits combination of most punishments for finding of guilt for each offense jdo may combine certai n punishments except for reduction in rank that cannot be combined with any other punish ment only corporals and below may be detained and detention can only be comb ined with stoppage of pay jdo may combine both fine and stoppage of pay for single of fense but more than twentyeight days pay may be taken in single disciplinary hearing as the sdos nonappeal jurisdicti on is limited to iaf commissioned officers the punishments available are also very differ ent from those of t he us field grade njp authority the sdos punishment s however are very similar to the junior disciplinary officers punishment though sdo may not impose detention the rules for senior disciplinary officers combining punishments are otherwise identica l to those of the junior disciplinary officers unlike us field grade njp sdo disciplinary actions do not expose ia soldiers to great er maximum punishments additi onally iraqi commanders do not have the variety of punishments availabl as their american counterparts eg restriction to specified limit s the code also lacks provisions to suspend mitigate remit or set aside punishments f during disciplinary hearings the ccused ia soldier enjoys several rights under the code an ia soldier has the right to request the assistance of an officer of his choice to

evidence or speak in mitigation of his punishment 7 the right to remain s ilent and have adverse consideration taken by the exercise of this right 7 operational impacts while there are broad
