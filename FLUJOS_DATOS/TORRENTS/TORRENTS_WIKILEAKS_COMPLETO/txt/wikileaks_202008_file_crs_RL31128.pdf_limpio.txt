elementary or secondary school that is exempted from certain rules and regulati ons otherwise applicable to public schools in exchange for commitment toward attaining positive results in meeting state content and performance standards in acco rdance with the terms and conditions of charter granted by an authorized public chartering agency charter schools may enroll students who reside within particul ar local school distri ct or geographic area spanning number of districts chartering agencies may include state local and intermediate boards of education public nd private universities community colleges municipal governments or other entities authorized by state law depending on how school is chartered it may be treated as an independent local educational agency lea as school within an lea or even as school within school forty states and the district of columbia have enacted charter school laws just as states differ in how they author ize charter schools they also differ in how they fund charter schools states generally require that charte r schools be provided funds for operating expenses on perpupil ba sis however only in some states is perpupil allotment provided specifically for facilities or capital expenses many charter school operators repor t one of their greatest challenges to be obtaining adequate facilities in which to locate their schools specific challenges include limited funding for facilities and capital expenses limited available and affordable space difficulty in securing access to preexisting public sc hool facilities and difficulty in

beryl nelson et rpp international jan 2000 pp 4445 at httpswwwedgovpdfdocs4yrrptpdf hereafter cited as ed the state of charter schools 2000 funding for public charter school facilities federal policy under the esea background public charter schools are publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that are operated according to the terms and cond itions of charters or contracts granted by public chartering agencies charte r schools are schools of choice and thus parents elect to enroll their children in charter school rather than in th school to which they would otherwise be assigned by their lea charter schools typically are allocated funding for operating expenses on perpupil basis however in most states funding for facilities and capital expe nses is not provided on perpupil basis and relatively few states provide substa ntial financial support for charter school facilities among the primary factors affecting ch arter schools succe ss as educational institutions is their ability to provide quality educational facilities to their students teachers and communities the quality or adequacy of the fac ilities that charter school is able to secure depends largel on available funding which in turn is impacted by such factors as characteristic s of its states charter school law the specific terms of its school ch arter state and local public finances and the interaction of these and other factors in study conducted after ch arter schools had been in existence for nearly ten years but prior to enactment of the child left behind act of 2001 nclba pl 107110 charter school operato rs reported that being ab to provide adequate facilities ranked high among th challenges they faced in implementing their charters and in establishing or conti nuing their education programs1 in that study three of the top four issues charter school operators cited most often as challenges involved funding startup costs inad equate operating f unds and inadequate facilities these types of funding issues ofte n were interrelated with respect to f acilities with the adequacy of charter school facilities often pendent upon the availability of funds for startup costs and the level of f unding provided for operating expenses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31128crs2 2 us department of education office of the under secretary evaluation of the public charter schools program final report

programs 4 united states general accounting office charter schools new charter schools across continuedmost charter schools begin operations as newly created school s for example in 20012002 77 of new charter sc hools were newly created schools2 operators of newly created charter schools must not only implement their new education plans but also must surmount the obs tacle of acquiring adequate facilities in which to house their schools in addition many charter sc hools are designed to be smaller in size than traditional public schools and oftentimes charter schools begin operations with only few of their planned eventual grad levels intending to add an additional grade level each successive year these f actors often require ch arter school operators to arrange initially for temporary facilities as they obtain financing for and acquire renovate or build longterm facilities specific difficu lties charter school operators face in obtaining adequate facilities include limited dedicated funds for facilities lack of available and affordable space problems in purchasing leasing or occupying preexisting public school fac ilities an inability to issue bonds or assume debt and difficulty obtaining adequate facilities financing charter school facilities in the states state and local funding state charter school laws generally requi re charter schools to be provided with operational funding on perpup il basis usually certain percentage of the per pupil funding provided to other public schools by the state or lea some states and the federal government also provide limited funding for ch arter school startup costs3 among those states and leas that provide charter schools with support for facilities the nature and extent of this assistance varies considerably it can be difficult to summarize how much and what kind of state and local assistance is made available for charter school facilities due to the considerable variation from state to state in the types of assistance offered an examination of various reviews of state charter school ws illustrates the many different types of assistance made available and the subtle distinctions that may be made when categorizing these types of assistance these reviews do show however that while charter school laws in more th an half of the states with them do authorize some type of facilities assistance in many states this assistance is limited for example in 2003 the general accounting office gao reviewed state charter school laws and found that 28 states includi ng the district of columbia provided charter sc hools either with facilities funding or with other forms of assistance in financing or obtaining facilities4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31128crs3 4 continued the country and in the district of colu

found that 26 states including the district of columbia allow charter schools some type of access to public school facilities 15 states authorize some form of financial suppor t for charter school facilities including public funding loan or credit enhancement programs and only 8 states provide fac ilities funding on perpupil basis6 in 2005 the thomas b fordham in stitute the progress analytics institute and public impact jointly conducted an analysis of funding for charter schools in sample of states and found that on average charter schools receive less fundi ng on perpupil basis than do traditional public schools they also found that this gap is primarily due to charter schools not being provided access to local and capital funding in manner co mparable to that provided to traditional public schools7 these studies show that the nature of support for facilities varies from state to state relatively few states provide perpupil allotments to charter schools specifically for facilities costs some llow charter schools access to funds obtained through local school tax levies or state bonding author ity in some states charter schools are authorized to assume bonded inde btedness plurality of states provide charter schools with some form of access to public buildings such as authorization to lease excess space or the right of first refusal to purchase surplus public

operate more efficiently and at lower cost than conventiona l public schools occasionally it was also presumed that some of the financial suppor t for public charter schools might be provided through philanthropy however while some sc hools have been successful in obtaining funding or the use of space from private donors or the private sector many philanthropic organizations have policies prohibiting th use of funds for capital expenses over the years however number of nonprofit organizations have emerged as providers of facilitie s financing for charter schools8 access to available and affordable space obtaining access to adequate and affordable space has been challenge to many public charter schools as the nations school age population continues to grow there continues to be an increasing demand for education facilities according to the national center for education statistics nces billions of dollars are needed to fund the construction of new schools and large numbers of existing schools are badly in need of repair9 the facility needs of charter schools are not dissimilar to those of conventional public school s with the level of need often varying according to geopolitical and socioeconomic factors majority of charter schools are concentrated in high growth states or in cities with troubled urban school districts in high growth states there is an overall s hortage of public school facilities in these locations both charter schools and conve ntional public schools are struggling to obtain new or expanded facilitie s often conventional sc hool districts welcome the arrival of charter schools becau they relieve some of th pressure for building new facilities in urban school districts it is more likely that existing educational facilities are underutilized howev er often they also are in need of repair or renovation while charter sc hool operators can sometime s acquire excess facilities in which to operate charter school they often must bear the cost of renovation in general the limited amount of funds allocated specifically for facilities and capital expenses has resulted in some char ter school operators experiencing difficulty in obtaining adequate school space in whic h to educate their students resulting at least initially in charter schools bein g housed in nonconventional or less than desirable facilities10 examples of nonconventiona l charter school facilities include churches museums movie theaters and former commercial or industrial buildings places where charter school operators have been able to obtain space at affordable rates while they work to secure more adequate facilities other charter schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31128crs5 11 internal revenue code 103 12 charters in most other states are approved for period of up to five years however they continuedfacilities include space formerly used by private schools or organizations such as ymcas and recreation centers depending on characteristics of states charter school law and the size of the local school age population some charter schools are able to obtain facilities from local school districts options include c onverting preexisting school to charter school and retaining use of the building or occupying excess fac ilities made available by local school district as previously mentioned some state charter laws require local school districts to provide charter schools access to excess facilities either at expense or for nominal fee other st ate laws require school districts to offer charter schools the right of first refusal when existing public school facilities are sold or allow charter schools to purchase public school facilities at discount in many instances the availability of excess public school facilities is str ongly correlated with growth or decline in the local school ag population in high growth areas few if any excess school facilities may be ava ilable and public school districts may be struggling to provide adequate school facilities for their burgeoning student populations in areas with declining schoolage populations while excess school facilities may be av ailable they may be outm oded or poorly maintained facilities financing options whereas conventional public schools ge nerally finance the construction or renovation of facilities through local tax levies or the issuance of municipal bonds in most cases such options are not availa ble to public charter schools however in some states with charter school laws public charter schools are authorized to assume debt for purposes of financin g facilities although the entity ultimately responsible for the debt varies from state to state in some states the charter school is fully responsible for the debt whereas in others the local school distri ct or the chartering authority would become responsible shoul d the charter school become unable to retire the debt in number of states bonding authorities have been established to issue securities to finance charter school facilities access to state or local bonding authority is important because federal tax exemption of interest earned on state and local bonds11 supports the ability of bonding aut horities to issue bonds at lower interest rate than purchasers otherwise might accept if their interest earned were taxable in instances where charter schools are not able to assume debt under state or local bonding authority variety of fact ors make obtaining financing difficult lenders decide whether to provide financing and if so set the interest rate at which they provide financing based on their perception of risk financial institutions have tended to regard charter schools as risk ventures because of their novelty and uncertainty about their longterm viability

presents an 80to1 margin when comparing charter school nd public school district risk13 higher interest rates and shorter repayment peri ods often combine to limit ch arter schools opportunities for financing facilities other observers however have suggested that data on charter school closings must be examined mo re closely while cursory look at the data may make charter school s appear to the real and lending industries as riskier clients than they actually are closer examination shows that some charter schools reported as having closed either did not actually close down but rather continue to operate under new authority or did close down but did not default on lease or mortgage14 in some states financing for charter sc hools facilities is made available through revolving loan funds revolving loan funds may be established by public or private entity and provide capital to charter schools usually at lower interest rate than otherwise might be available as the loans are repaid the capital and interest that flow back into the fund become available to make future loans revolving loan funds have been used to finance charte r school facilities and cover startup costs
