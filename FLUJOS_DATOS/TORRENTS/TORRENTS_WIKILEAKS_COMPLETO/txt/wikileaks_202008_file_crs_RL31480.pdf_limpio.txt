education act idea state grant formulas summary congress is considering revisions to the individuals with disabilities education act idea which is the major federal statute guaranteeing free appropriate public education fape for children with disabilities and authorizing state grants to help fund special education and re lated services for these ch ildren among the areas that could be considered is the funding of the st ate grants programs especially the full funding of the part b grantstostates pr ogram this report examines the formulas for the three idea state grants programs the grantstostates program which serves mostly schoolaged children with disabilitie s the preschool program section 619 which serves children with disabilities ag 3 to 5 and the infants and toddlers program part c which serves children from birth to age 2 the report concentrates on the formula pr ovisions of the part b grantstostates program which accounts for most of th funds appropriated for idea after providing for various setasides amounting to about 2 of th total appropriations for this program the secretary of education allocates baseyear grant to each state which is the amount state received fo r fy1999 of the remaining amount 33 billion for fy2002 85 is initially allocat ed based on states shares of the preschool and schoolage popul ation and 15 is allocated based on states shares of children in the above age gr oup living in poverty finally when appropriations are growing as they have been in recent years state allotments are adjusted so that the growth rate of each states grant closely follows the growth in the overall appropriations for the grantstostates program for example total fy2002 appropriations for the grantstostates pr ogram grew by 188 the state formula limited state grant growth rates to ra nge between 173 and 203 the substate formula for the grantstostates program is based on similar principles as are the state and substate formulas for the idea presc hool state grants program the part c formula differs from and is less complex than the part b formulas funds for part c grants are distributed based on states sh are of infants and t oddlers ie total population below the age of 3 there is onehalf percent minimum state grant amount for the part c formula in recent years congress has been pa rticularly concerne d about funding for special education which has re sulted in substantial increases in funding of the grants to states program from 23 billion in fy1996 to 75 billion in fy2002 despite recent increases some members of congress have also been concerned that appropriations are still far from providing full funding ie maximum state grants authorized by the statute the senate ve rsion of the child left behind act would have appropriated timated fullfunding amounts by fy2007 the final bill did not contain this proposal in part because some members argued that idea needs to be significantly revised before full funding c ould be justified those revisions are now being considered the repor t concludes with discussi on of possible unanticipated and unintended consequences of providing full funding for grants to states

selected issues by nancy l jones and richard n aplingindividuals with disabilities education act idea state grant formulas overview congress is considering whether to ma ke revisions to the individuals with disabilities education act idea which is the major federal statute guaranteeing free appropriate public education fape for children with disabilities and authorizing state grants to help fund special education and related services for these children1 among the areas that could be consid ered is the funding of the state grants programs especially the full funding of the part b grantstostates program this report examines the formulas for the three idea state grants programs the grantstostates program which serves mostly schoolaged child ren with disabilities the preschool program secti on 619 which serves childre n with disabilities ages 3 to 5 and the infants and toddlers program part c which serves children from birth to age 2 as background to the discussi on of specific idea formulas the report begins with an overview of the basic characteristics of federal state grant formulas the report then outlines the three idea state grant formulas it concentrates on the part b grantstostates formula funding programs mostly for schoolage children with disabilities because it is the most co mplicated and deals with the most money the report concludes with discussion and current status of the debate over full funding of the grantstostat formula ie the provision of maximum state grants under this formula overview of characteristi cs of state formula grants formula factors in general federal grant form ulas have one or more factors that are used to make initial allocations as discussed below these initial grants are then usually adjusted before making final allocations these factors usually reflect the grants target population or popula tions and might include for example population and poverty for targeted age group initial allocations are made to states based on their shares of each formula fact or for example s uppose state formula allocated 1 billion based on total popula tion with other requirements if california has 12 of tota l population california would receive 12 of the funds or 120 million if vermont has 02 of total population vermont would receive 02 of the funds or 2 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs2 2 specifically the total amount needed to br ing states up to the minimum grant level is determined then that amount is obtained by reducing all other states allocations proportionallyminimum grants or stop loss formulas often specify minimum grant provisions so that assuming funds are fficient grantee receives less than certain amount these minimums tend to range from 025 to 05 of the total allocation if the above example in cluded minimum grant of 025 vermont wyoming and few other states woul d have their grants boosted to 25 million if the minimum were at 05 other some what larger states for example new hampshire which has about 045 of total population would see higher grants in new hampshires case going from 45 million to 5 million another reason for minimum grants in formulas is to prevent sudden program dislocations and accompanying political cont roversies when new formula goes into effect or when formula factors are upda ted eg when new census figures become available sometimes this is guarantee if funds are sufficient of prior year grant amount or percentage of prior grant in other cases it is tied to the overall percentage change in appropriations these minimum grants are sometimes called hold harmless provisions because they hold grant recipients harmless at some previous grant level because money to raise states to minimum grant levels almost always comes from the states grants that are above the minimum2 congress sometimes puts constraints on minimums so that the full minimum grant is not received this is illustrated in the example discussed below maximum grants or stop gain less often except with respect to minimum grants formulas constrain how much states grants can grow from year to year the main reason for such provisions is to further dampen the impacts of new formula going into effect one approach is to limit the percentage gain from one year to the next which is discussed in the following example hypothetical example table 1 shows simple hypothetical example of how state formula based on total population might be c onstrained by small state minimum 025 hold harmless 95 of prior grant and maximum grant 110 of prior grant to illustrate th effects of these fo rmula alternatives table 1 presents states percentage shares of total appropriati on rather than dollar amounts state share can be translated into dollars by multiplying the share by the total allocation for example californias population accounts for about 12036 of total us population as determined by the 2000 cen if total population were the only formula factor with adjustments and 1 billion were allocated california would receive 12036 of 1 billion or 120 36 milli on wyomings share of 2000 total population is 0175 from 1 billion allocation with minimum grant wyoming would receive 175 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs3 3 these state shares are based on total population from the 1990 and 2000 census and were obtained from the census bureau web site at httpwwwcensusgovpopulationcen2000phct2tab01pdf 4 the states that are slightly larger than thes five smaller states appear to have the same shares in columns 2 and 3 in fact their sh ares are lower in column 3 but these reductions do not show up because only 3 decimal places are shown for example south dakotas share is reduced from 026823 to 026767 5 the states held harmless are the slowest growing states west virginia pennsylvania connecticut maine rhode island ohio iowa new york massachusetts louisiana and michigancolumn 1 of table 1 shows each states share of the total allocation based on its share of total 1990 population column 2 shows the 2000 shares3 the next column column 3 shows the result when minimum grant of 025 of the total allocation is required that is state would receive share of the total allocation that was less than 025 of the total allocated amount in the case of 1 billion total allocation this would result in state receiving less than 25 million this can be seen in the box at the bottom of the table in which the five smallest states which originally had shares ranging from 0175 to 0228 now have shares of 025 the funds to raise these five st ates to the minimum are taken proportionally from the other states note that other states have slightly lower shares for example californias share is re duced from 12036 to 120114 in addition to minimum grants to ensure that grants to smaller states are large enough to be effective fe deral formulas often have minimum state grant amounts ie hold harmless leve ls to ensure that state loses an unacceptable amount when new formula takes effect or when update d data for example when more recent census data become available column 4 of table 1 shows one such example here the minimum share state can receive is the greater of the 025 minimum or 95 of the states share of total population in 1990 the data for new york illustrate the impact of the latter provision in column 3 new yorks share is 6729 in column 4 its share is increased to 6872 which is 95 of its 1990 share of 7234 again funds to raise new york and other states to this hold harmless level come from all other states except from t hose at the 025 minimum notice for example that californias share again is slightly reduced while wyomings share remains at 0255 besides the minimum grants discussed bove column 5 shows the impact of formula provision that restricts states growth in this case state receives percentage share that is more than 110 of its 1990 share this restricts increases for states experiencing hi gh population growth such as georgia arizona nevada and colorado for example georgia s 2000 share under the previous formulas ranged between 291 and 2875 however these shares are more than 110 of georgias 1990 share of 26 so under the formula shown in column 5 georgias share is reduced to 2865 which is 110 of its 1990 share in addition to constraining increases for high growth states cap ceiling or maximum grant can reduce the impact of small state minimum requirement this effect can be seen for some of the states that would receive 025 of total appropr iations without any restriction on growth of state grant see th box at the bottom of column 5 if ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs4 025 share is greater than 110 of the 1990 share states final share is reduced to the 110 cap as it is for alaska vermont and wyoming if the 110 cap is greater than 025 share the state retain s that share see north dakota and the district of columbia table 1 illustrative state formula based on 1990

with the three idea state formulas the part b grantsto states formula which funds special education mostly for schoolage children with disabilities the part b preschool state grants section 619 and the infants andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs6 6 pl 10517 7 this was concern in 1975 and congress put limit on the number of children who could be counted for purposes of the formula but not regarding who must be served 8 the outlying areas are american samoa guam northern mariana islands virgin islandstoddlers program part c the part b gr antstostates formula is the focus here because it allocates by far the largest sh are of the idea appropriation 75 billion of an 87 billion appropriation for fy2002 nd is the most complex of the three idea formulas part b grantstostates formula prior to the 1997 amendments6 part b funds were distributed to states essen tially based on state sh ares of children with disabilities served testimony during reauthorization by the inspector general of the us department of education ed raised concerns that the formula created incentives to overidentify children with disabilities7 the solution to this problem was to change to censusbased formula the decision was to base the formula mostly on population and to lesser extent on poverty because there is at least some relationship between poverty and the incide nce of disabilities however switching completely to such formula would have significantly redistributed idea funds so the congress decided to delay implementation of the permanent formula until overall part b funds surpassed 49 billion wh ich happened in fy2000 congress also included various provisions to dampen th impact of the formula change once it went into effect table 2 illustrates how the idea permanent formula works under current conditions when appropriations are growing the lefthand column shows the formula provision the righthand column shows the resulting amount or percentage for fy2002 the overall fy2002 appropriations fo r part b grants to states is about 75 billion an 188 increase over the fy 2001 amount this percentage increase is important to keep in nd for purposes of the formula prior to allocating funds to the states the secretary first reserves funds from total appropriations for the outlying areas8 for the secretary of the interior for services for children with disabilities attending bureau of indian affairs bia schools and for studies and evaluation the combination of these setasides currently amounts to less than 2 of the to tal appropriation for the grants to states program or about 132 million after accounting for these setasides the secretary allocates for each state the amount it received in fy1999 this is the baseyear part of the grant because fy1999 was the last year before the perman ent formula went into effect these amounts will not change unless appropriati ons drop drastically but will account for less and less of the total gran t if appropriations grow si gnificantly the total amount is about 42 billion which is about 57 of the amount allocated to states for fy2002 of the remaining amount 33 billion for fy2002 85 is initially allocated based on states shares of total population within the age range in which the state provides fape to children with disabilities thus the age range for the population and for poverty vary from state to state depending on the age at whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs7 9 two states have maximum age of 18 two st ates have 19 as the maximum age 26 states have maximum age of 20 and 22 st ates have maximum age of 21services cease all states begin services at 39 the remaining 15 is allocated based on states shares of children in the above age group living in poverty the initial allocation then is the base grant plus th 85 allocation based on population plus the 15 allocation based on poverty there are several minimum grant constraints not all of which come into play under current conditions when appropriations are growin g significantly assuming sufficient funds are appropriated state sh all receive grant less than the greater of the following amounts that is the minimum grant amount subject to further formula provisions discussed below is the largest of these values 1 states prior year grant with current large increases this minimum will be less than other minimums and will not have an impact 2 states base year grant plus onethird percent of the increase between the current year fy2002 for this example and the base year fy1999 this adds about 107 million to the base grant for fy2002 this would increase grants of the smallest states by as much as 50 but these increases are capped by the maximum gain discussed below 3 an increase not less than the overall percentage increase minus 15 percentage points for fy2002 this is 188 15 173 4 an increase that is not less th an 90 of the overall percentage increase for fy2002 this is 188 times 90 169 which is less than the 173 so this minimum grant is superseded under fy2002 appropriations however if the bush administrations proposed increase of 1 billion over the fy2002 amount were adopted for fy2003 this would be about 133 increase and this minimum would come into play that is minimum growth rate of 1195 rather than 118 which would be the minimum increase under number 3 abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs8 table 2

new permanent formula for the gr antstostates program went into effect in fy2000 because overall ppropriations for this program have been growing significantly in recent years and because the formula constrains growth rates of individual states grants little notice apparently has been taken of changes resulting from the formula change fy2002 appropriations represent about 51 increase over the fy2000 amount and about 75 increase over the fy1999 amount because of constraints on growth rates unde r the new formula increases in state grants over the last 2 years have ranged from about 48 to about 54 at the same time some states allocations could have been significantly different under other fo rmula alternatives table 4 shows estimated percentage changes under three alternatives to the curre nt formula the first alternative shows changes if the previous formula had b een maintained that is if funds were distributed based on states shares of number of children with disabilities served under that approach several states for example number of new england states would have received significantly larger grants some other states such as alaska louisiana montana and texas do better under the current formula than they would under the prefy2000 formula the second alternative shows changes if the new formula were implemented with constraints on growth rates th at is each state would receive its fy1999 grant amount plus 85 of the remainde r distributed based on population and 15 based on poverty constraints woul d be placed on how much or how little states grant could grow this approach w ould benefit certain states such as arizona and colorado other states that do not benefit from populationpoverty formula would have lower grant amounts for ex ample massachusetts and new jersey the third alternative distributes 85 of all funds based on population and 15 of all funds based on poverty with minimum or maximum grants this approach benefits states such as calif

activities which include funds for state monitoring for meeting personnel needs and for providing technical assistance and traini ng and development prior to the 1997 amendments the state setaside for these activities had been 25 of the grant the 1997 amendments altered this by requiring the amount for these state activities to be calculated by increasing the prior year reserve by the percentage increase in the state grant or the rate of inflation whichever is less in recent years the increases have been based on inflation because grants are growing considerably faster than inflation the effect of this in recent years has been to ensure state reserves have kept up with inflation but that higher percentages go to the local level closer to 85 rather than 75 under prior law of the total state set aside states may reserve up to 20 or an adjusted dollar amount11 whichever is greater for administration table 5 illustrates how the state setasides are calculated using alabama as an example the increase over the fy2000 setas ide is based on the rate of inflation 34 because the overall growth in the st ate grant 265 was larger increasing the fy2000 setaside of 137 million by 34 results in total fy2001 state set aside of 142 million of this amount alabama may use up to 20 or 28 million for administration the remainder of alabamas fy2001 grant of 1004 million 862 million or 858 is distributed to the local levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs14 table 5 example of calculating state setasides for alabama for fy2001 amount of setaside for administration and other statewide

of inflation states are required to setaside funds for local capacity building grants sometimes known as sliver grants these grants are aimed at improving leas special education progra ms specific uses include direct services for children with disabilities including alternative programs for those expelled from school addressing needs such as personne l shortages identified in the states improvement plan and adopting effective technology instructional practices and materials the amount for states capacity buildin g grants is calculated by taking percentage of the states set aside for the previous year the percentage is the growth rate of the grant minus the inflation ra if this amount is less than 100000 then the grants would not be made moreover these grants only are made with increases above inflation if overall grants are not keeping up with inflation capacity building grants are made the logic behind this provision is that rather than providing the full increase for state activitie s funds for those activities as discussed above are guaranteed at leas t an inflationary increase but anything over inflation in the overall increase in the state grant goes to the local level in this case as capacity building grants table 6 illustrates this calculation for alabamahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs15 12 for further information on the idea preschool program see

state grant is distributed to leas based on formula similar to the state formula once the trigger for the permanent formula went into effect with fy2000 funding states were re quired to use similar substate formula the base grant is calculated for the year prior to the year in which the permanent formula became effective ie fy1999 these are not the actual fy99 lea grants but grant amounts that would have been made if the state allocated 75 of its total grant that year thus these base grants will be somewhat higher than the actual fy99 lea grants of the remainder 85 is di stributed based on leas shares of total public and private school enrollments th remaining 15 is distributed based on shares of their numbers of children livin g in poverty as determined by the sea unlike the state formula there are minimum or maximum grant amounts for leas preschool state grant formula section 619 of idea authorizes state grants for services to children with disabilities ages 3 to 5 since the part b grants to states program also permits funding services for preschool children w ith disabilities section 619 is not so much separate idea program as source of additional funds for this age group12 the preschool formula in s ection 619 is similar to the grants to states formula except it went into effect immedi ately in fy1998 after the 1997 amendments became effective appropriations trigger had to be reached as was the case with the grants to states formula the base grant for each state is the fy1997 granthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs16 the remaining funds are distributed based 85 on states shares of total population ages 3 to 5 and 15 on shares of those in that age group living in poverty the minimum and maximum grant provisions are similar to thegrants to states formula except that the 40 maximum grant does not apply state reserves and the substate formula are similar except there is nocapacity building grant provision in practice as table 7 shows the formula does not make much difference because appropriations have changed ve ry little since 1997 when funding was 3604 million and not at all for the last 3 fis cal years which have been level funded at 390 million so most of the grant is based on what was received in fy1997 amounts that are not adjusted for changes in children with disabilities or changes in population table 7 recent state allocations

respect to the 1975 act see crs report 95 669 the individuals with disabilities educ ation act congressional intent by nancy l jones 15 it is important to remember that the maxi mum funding provision is relevant only to part b grants to states there is full fundi ng amount for the two other block grants 16 for additional information on idea full funding see crs report rl30810 individuals with

richard n apling 17 for example see hconres 84 in the 106th congress 18 for example see s 496 and hr 214 in the 107th congress note that section 611j of current law would permit full funding to be appropriated at any time 19 for example see hamdt 758 to hr 4577 the consolidation appropriations act of 2001maximum funding under part b grants to states background history and rationale in 1975 when the current version of federal involvement in special education began14 congress wanted to guarantee the rights of children with disabilities to free appropriate pub lic education and to help pay for the additional cost of this ducation at that time it was thought that on average these children were twice as expe nsive to educate as were other children congress wanted to pay some of this additional or excess cost not the cost associated with educating all children but the additional cost of educating children with disabilities the national average per pupil expenditure appe was taken as the measure of total excess cost the fi nal compromise in 1975 was for the federal government to pay up to 40 of this ex cess cost or 40 of the national appe specifically the act stipulates that states maximum grant is 40 of the national appe times the number of children with di sabilities served fu ll funding of idea part b grants to states is determined by summing up all the states maximum grants15 for fy2002 that amount was about 182 billion it is important to note that these estimates change usually they go up b ecause the estimate of appe and of the child count are revised from time to time to reflect estima tes of increased costs and estimated increases in number of children served16 recent fullfunding proposals in recent years congress has been concerned about funding for special educa tion this concern can be seen in the substantial increase in funding of the grants to states program from 23 billion in fy1996 to 75 billion in fy2002 more than 200 increase despite recent increases some members of congress have also been c oncerned that appropriations are still far from providing full funding ie maximum state grants authorized by the statute as result congress has taken various actions for example resolutions have been passed calling for full funding17 bills have been introduced to specify authorization levels linked to full funding18 floor amendments have been offered to shift appropriations fro m other education progra ms into idea funding19 the senatepassed version of hr1 wh ich became the child left behind act reauthorizing the elementary and s

2001 p s13327an amendment to idea that would not only have authorized estimated full funding but would have appropriated specific amounts the socalled harkinhagel amendment would have increased grants to states funding by 25 billion per year beginning in fy2002 until estimated full f unding was reached in fy2007 for the next 4 years through fy2011 the amendm ent would have ppropriated estimated full funding amounts beginning in fy 2012 the bill would have authorized such sums as may be necessary without appropriating funds the final conference report hrept 107 334 which was agreed to by both the house and the senate and signed by the president pl 107110 did not contain this amendment to idea debate in the hous and senate outlined reasons for dropping the amendment with the intent to revisit the issue in the context of reauthorizing idea for example representa tive roukema noted the following one of the major hurdles in this confer ence was the issue of full funding of the individuals with disabilities act idea everyone agrees that the federal government is failing to pay its fair shar of the costs of special education and all sides agree on the need for more m oney for students with disabilities the problem is that this bill is not the appropriate vehicle to address the idea funding problem because funding and reform must be linked20 in the senate senator gregg maintained there has been some discussion and i alluded to not agreeing with my colleague on some of his opening statem ent there has been some discussion on the issue of idea this is another ar ea that needs significant attention but the bill we are dealing with today deals with the lowincome child and the title i program which is the most significant federal program in the area of elementary and secondary school education idea and special education is separate issue and should be dealt with as separate issue because the idea issues are equally complex maybe narrower maybe not as many but certainly equally as complex and intensely felt as the title i issues in fact more intensely fe lt in many instances to merge the two and try to solve both of those issues at the same time would have been mistake we have put off the idea funding issue and the other major questions dealing with idea such as overidentification especially of minority groups issues involving discipline issues involving excessive attorn eys fees issues involving excessive bureaucracy being forced on the school systems issues involving whether or not special education child has right to move out of public school and into private school and the payment for those activities all those programmatic issues which are very intricate and very difficult to address should be brought up in the context of full idea reform and reauthorization which will occur next year21 some members listed the dropping of idea funding as reason for voting against the bill the 2nd session of the 107th congress considered reforming andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs22 22 for further information on the presidents commission on excellence in special education pcese see the commissions web site at

completed during the 107th congress although some members disagree on how much idea needs to be changed23 congress is likely to continue considering idea funding and other issues possible unintended consequences of full funding as congress debates idea funding issues it is important to realize that providing funds for maximum allowable state grants ie fully funding idea part b grants to states may have some unanticipated and unintended consequen ces what follows is discussion of some possibl results of full funding determining fullfunding amounts in future years as noted above the senate amendment in hr 1 woul d have appropriated specific funds under section 611j the amendment would have increased idea part b grantstostates appropriations by 25 billion per year til an estimated fullfunding amount was reached in fy2007 beginning in that fiscal year through fy2011 the senate amendment would have appropr iated specified amounts that were estimated to be full funding for those fiscal ears those amounts apparently were based on estimates made by the us department of education ed in 2000 or early 2001 by the end of 2001 new ed estimates we re available for those fis cal years which indicated that the hr 1 appropriations would ve been slightly short of full funding approximately 38 of appe rather than 40 if future bill followed the same strategy of appropriating specific amount s based on estimated fu llfunding totals similar results could occur setasides from total appropriations if funds are appropriated under subsection 611j as the senate version of hr 1 would have done set asides for outlying areas bia and evaluation would co off the top this could raise two problems first slightly less than the fullfunding amount would be distributed to states thus states would receive sligh tly less than their maximum grants second if current percentages were applied very large amounts would go to bia and could go to outlying areas some including ed argue that these funds could not be absorbed and could result in excessive amounts per pupil being provided for example if the fy2001 full funding am ount of 1 78 billion had been provided application of the statutory percentage would have allotted n early 226 million to the department of the interior for the bia based on child c ount of approximately 13000 children with disabilitie s attending bia schools24 this would have amounted to more than 17000 per child whereas th per child amount provided to states would have been about 2800 40 of th national appe of 7006 based on similar concern given the fy2002 increas in appropriations ed apparentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs23 25 if overall growth is less than 15 the minimum growth rate for states grant is 90 of the overall growth ratepersuaded the congress to override this required percentage through appropriations language and determine the fy2002 amount for bia by increasing the fy2001 by the rate of inflation incentive to overidentify children with disabilities full funding is based on providing each state with its ma ximum allowable grant which as noted above the act specifies as 40 of the national average per pupil expenditures times the number of children with disabilities served when f unds were distributed based on numbers of children with disabilities the interim fo rmula in effect until fy2000 when the permanent formula based on population and poverty went into effect there was limit on how many children coul d be counted for the purpose of the formula but not on how many are served prior to the 1997 amendments the act required that for the purposes of allocations children with disabilities ages 3 to 17 could represent more than 12 of st ates total population in that age group in 1997 this provision was not included however crossreference to the prior law was made with respect to the interim formula apparently this re ference does not apply to the maximum grant provision thus there is currently limit on how many children with disabilities states could count for the purpose of determining full funding this could encourage over iden tification which both the previous act under the 12 requirement and current w under the census based permanent formula seek to avoid constraints on growth rates as appropriations for the grantstostates program grow the permanent formula constr ains the growth rate for all states if the overall appropriation grows by more than 15 state growth rates will fall within band between 15 percentage point s below the overall growth rate25 and 15 percentage points above the ove rall growth rate these constraints are likely to cause problems if appropriations were to grow at high rate from one year to the next for example if congress were to appropr iate the estimated full funding amount all in one year rather than moving toward full funding in increments as the senate version of hr 1 would ve done and b in the year in which full funding is reached even under an incremental appro ach such as increases of 25 billion per year as under the senate version of hr 1 for example suppose total appropriations were required to grow by 10 to reach full funding even after several year s of significant increases some states would be very close or even at full f unding in the prior year because over time they had been receiving the higher growth rate the 15 percen tage points above the total growth rate of the appropriations thus these states might need to increase by only 2 or 3 to reach their maximum grants but the minimum they could increase would be 90 10 times 90 90 wh ich would provide grant higher than the maximum grant provision would permit other states those that had been perennially receiving the lowest growth ra the 15 percentage points below the overall growth rate in appr opriations would have to increase by considerably more than 10 to reach their maximum grants however the current formula limits their growth rate to 115 10 15 one result of these problems would be that edhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31480crs24 would be unable legally to distribute all of the funds appropr iated in addition although sufficient funds would have been appropriated to pr ovide maximum grants ie full funding for all states some c ould not receive the full amount because of formula constraints differential bene fits among states the fullfunding provision reflects congressional intent to pr ovide up to 40 of the dditional or excess cost of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities the proxy for excess cost is the national appe however state appes and presumably the excess costs of special education va ry widely thus provision of full funding could result in providing substantially more than 40 of the excess cost in some lower cost states and substantially less th an 40 of the excess cost in other higher cost states diminishing sliver grants once full funding is reached the local improvement grants the sliver grants described above coul d become modest or disappear for some states because these grants are based on the difference between the growth rate of the overall state grant and the rate of inflation in the years prior to reaching full funding part b appropriati ons presumably would be growing rapidly outpacing inflation and ensuring relativ ely large amounts for sliver grants once full funding is reached appropriations i f based on full funding would grow more slowly because full funding is partially ba sed on appe which in turn grows at rates related to inflation in some smaller stat the state could opt not to provide any sliver grants at all if the total availa ble is less than 100000 in other states the amount available could be relatively modest possible lealevel consequences even when full funding for state grants is reached grants to leas will c ontinue to be determined by the current substate formula described above the re sulting substate distributions could have several consequences at the local level first of all there is maximum grant provision for the substate formula thus some leas could receive amounts that are greater than 40 of appe others could r eceive grants that amount to less than 40 of appe since the substate formula is based mainly on overall enrollment and does not reflect local expenditures some leas with lower incidences of children with disabilities or lower costs c ould receive more funding than they can spend for example more than the excess cost of providing fape might be covered since there is reallocation procedure in the act section 611g4 which allows states to redistribute funds if an lea does not need all the idea money to ensure fape for all children with disabilities this may not become problem if states exercise this provision properly in addition current law has state and cal fiscal requireme nts to ensure that maintenance of effort moe for special education is preserved from year to year and that the federal funds supplement not pplant state and local special education funding if the intent of congress in provi ding full funding is to free up state and local special education funding for othe r purposes these fis cal provisions could prevent this from happening
