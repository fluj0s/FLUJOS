proposals hr 6899 the comprehensive american energy security and taxpayer protection act is expected to come to the house floor the week of september 15 2008 the moratoria on oil and gas leasing in much of the ocs has become major issue in congress and also in the presidential campaign this report describes the background of ocs leasing and the various positions taken by proponents and opponents of leasing it then compares the provisions of three bills that have been introduced with reported summaries of the house proposal and the senate proposal the new energy reform act of 2008 on september

of three bills and two proposals hr 6566 hr 6670 hr 6709 hr 6899 the house leadership proposal and the senate draft proposal which address oil and gas development in the outer continental shelf ocs none of the bills has passed its respective chamber the text below provides background on the issues the sidebyside table gives description of selected sections of the bills recent developments president bush announced on june 18 2008 that he would like to open areas of the outer continental shelf ocs for oil and gas development currently under presidential and congressional moratoria discussed in more detail below the president stated that he would lift the executive branch moratoria only after congress did so legislatively but on july 14 2008 president bush reversed his position and lifted the executive ban on the ocs imposed in 1990 by president george hw bush senator john mccain among others has called on congress to lift the offshore drilling moratoria as well further the administration proposes to begin planning its next fiveyear leasing program that would if approved be implemented as early as 2010 two years ahead of schedule the proposed new fiveyear program would supersede the current fiveyear leasing program from 20072012 the administration argues that new fiveyear lease program beginning in 2010 would allow any newly opened ocs areas if the congressional moratoria is lifted this year to be offered in lease sale sooner than if they remained on their current schedule since the president lifted the executive ban members of congress have introduced legislation that would lift the congressional prohibition in part or completely against leasing and development of oil and natural gas in the ocs the legislation section of this report summarizes several of those bills including the house leadership proposal hr 6899 many in congress however oppose lifting the offshore ban they argue that there are still several million acres leased onshore and offshore but not yet producing and that production from these lands could increase us oil supply on september 16 2008 the house passed hr 6899 by vote of 236189 and defeated an alternative bill hr 6709 by vote of 191226 how much oil could be brought into production in the shortterm from non producing leased lands or those under the moratoria and its impact on price is crs2 uncertain an attempt to lift the offshore moratoria with an amendment to the fy2009 interior environment and related agencies appropriations bill during the house subcommittee markup was defeated by vote of 69 meanwhile on june 26 2008 under suspension of the rules which requires twothirds majority for passage the house defeated measure hr 6251 that would have increased rental fees on nonproducing oil and gas leases and denied new federal leases to those not diligently developing the leases they have background oil and gas leasing has been prohibited on much of the outer continental shelf ocs since the 1980s congress has enacted ocs leasing moratoria for each of fiscal years 19822006 in the annual interior and related agencies appropriations bill now the interior and environment and related agencies appropriations bill allowing leasing only in the gulf of mexico except near florida and parts of alaska president george hw bush in 1990 issued presidential directive ordering the department of the interior doi not to conduct offshore leasing or preleasing activity in areas covered by the annual legislative moratoria until 2000 in 1998 president clinton extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012 proponents of the moratoria contend that offshore drilling would pose unacceptable environmental risks and threaten coastal tourism industries whereas supporters of expanded offshore leasing counter that more domestic oil and gas production is vital for the nations energy security the outer continental shelf lands act of 1953 ocsla as amended provides for the leasing of ocs lands in manner that protects the environment and returns revenues to the federal government in the form of bonus bids rents and royalties1 ocsla requires the secretary of the interior to submit fiveyear leasing programs that specify the time location and size of the areas to be offered each fiveyear leasing program entails lengthy multistep process that includes environmental impact statements after public comment period final proposed plan is submitted to the president and congress the latest plan went into effect july 1 2002 public hearings for the 20072012 leasing program are underway states and interest groups are filing comments on future lease sale areas for the 20072012 leasing program2 1 43 usc 1331 et seq 2 federal register notice 70 fr 49669 crs3 states with energy development off their shores in federal waters3 have been seeking larger portion of the federal revenues generated in those areas they particularly want more assistance for coastal areas that may be most affected by onshore and nearshore activities that support offshore energy development proponents of these proposals look to the rates at which funds are given to jurisdictions where onshore energy development occurs on federal lands within those jurisdictions coastal destruction has received more attention in louisiana especially hardhit by hurricanes in 2005 where many square miles of wetlands have been lost to the ocean each year widespread energyrelated development is thought to contribute to coastal losses currently the affected states receive some revenue directly from offshore oil and gas leases in federal waters under section 8g of ocsla and under the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 pl 109 4324 this is in contrast to the 50 share of direct revenues to states that have onshore federal leases within their boundaries opponents point out the budget implications that would result from such loss of federal revenues 3 state jurisdiction is typically limited to three nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured however the state jurisdiction off the gulf coast of florida and texas extends nine nautical miles and for louisiana three imperial nautical miles federal jurisdiction extends typically 200 nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured one nautical mile equals 115 statute miles 4 the 8g revenue stream is the result of 1978 ocsla amendment that provides for fair and equitable sharing of revenues from section 8g common pool lands these lands are defined in the amendments as submerged acreage lying outside the threenautical mile statefederal demarcation line typically extending to total of six nautical miles offshore but that include pool of oil common to both federal and state jurisdiction the states share of the revenue 27 was established by the ocsla amendments of 1985 pl 99272 and is paid directly to the states payments to the states
