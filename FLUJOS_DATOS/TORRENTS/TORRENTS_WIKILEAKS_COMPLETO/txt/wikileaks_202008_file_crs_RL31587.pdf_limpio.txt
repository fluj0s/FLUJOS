separatists orig ins competing ideologies and prospects for resolution of the conflict summary the recent military standoff and threatened nuclear exchange between india and pakistan have lately focu sed congressional atte ntion on the longstanding territorial dispute over the former princel state of kashmir although recent trips to the region by secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and deputy secretary of state richard armitage have dampened the rhetoric of both nations leaders state elections set for october of 2002 on the indian side of the li ne of control raise the specter of more violence in the disputed area and continued threat of wa r and although pakistani president pervez musharraf has largely reduced infiltrations by islamic militants into jammu and kashmir state in india recent reports indicate that this may be an unsustainable longterm policy for any paki stani leader at least in the countrys current political climate thus despite indias insistence that the kashmiri insurgency is domestic issue and adamant rejection of any international intervention the dispute has been seen by many state department officials as that other conflict whose nuclear character may make the dispute as dangerous to regional stability as that of the most r ecent round of israeli palestinia n conflict this report focuses exclusively on the uprising in the indiancontrolled portion of kashmir which has been disputed si nce both countries became independent in 1947 by many accounts the uprising began when anger over an allegedly rigged election in 1987 became militant insurgency by 1989 since the end of the 1999 fighting in kargil which us officials say came close to becoming full scale war the uprising has become the central point of contention between the two countries india believes that pakistan is using islamic militant attacks to fight proxy war over kashmir while pakistan accuses india of refusing to engage in meaningful negotiation examining both the indian and pakistani strategies and perspectives in kashmir this report outlines the various parties to the conflict including descriptions of the main militant groups active in kashmir and provides an analysis of three possible settlements that po licy makers have recently proposed for the region many have argued that militant forces and political leaders in the kashmir insurgency have in recent years begun to fall into two competing groups the first group has kashmiri nationalist or kashmiriyat vision of the form er princely state and is largely struggling for complete independence from both india and pakistan the second group originating in the jihadi subculture in pakistan and afghanistan sees the kashmir dispute as religi ous conflict to free an oppressed islamic population from the rule of neocolonial powers mainly india but also including pakistan some extremist members of this group see th conflict as the first battle in larger struggle to build panisla mic state throughout south asia and re establish central sunni leader or caliph the report outlines the battle that has emerged between the members of these groups and the effect that it has had on the uprising as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587contents introduction 1 t h u s ro in k sh mir n d co n g r ssio n l i n r sts3 k sh mir i d mo g r p h y5 h isto r f th k sh mir d isp u

the washington post pp a1 may 27 2002kashmiri separatists origins competing ideologies and prospects for resolution of the conflict introduction in december 2001 india and pakistans mo re than 50year old dispute over the former princely state of jammu and kashmir once again prompted significant congressional and international fears that the conflict would lead to the first use of nuclear weapons since world war ii just as usled allied troops were battling with qaeda and taliban leaders in the war on terrorism two islamic militant groups lashkaretaiba and jaishemohammad reportedly staged terrorist attack on december 13 2002 on indias parliament building in new delhi in which 14 were killed including 5 assailants india immedi ately accused pakistan of orchestrating this and other attacks by sending islamic militants across the vast himalayan mountain region from training cam ps that reportedly dot the pakistani controlled portion of kashmir the two countries amassed nearly million troops along their common border but under signifi cant us pressure pakistani president pervez musharraf promised to crack down on militant groups from pakistan who were active in the kashmiri uprising lthough the rhetoric between the two nations began to subside in the following months second terror attack near srinagar on may 14 2002 which killed 32 people incl uding 10 children prompted many to question pakistans insistence that it d stopped all crossbor der infiltration of islamic militants into indiancontrolled kashmir india once again threatened to cross into pakistan to bomb alleged terrori st training camps an action which many have argued would have pushe d pakistan to respond with force leading to fullscale war1 although visits to the region by puty secretary of st ate richard armitage and secretary of defense donald rumsfe ld appear to have calmed the rhetoric between the two nations ongoing fall 2002 elections raise the specter of fresh violence in kashmir as islamic militants threaten candidates and enforce boycott of voting us efforts to resolve the dispute between india and pakistan are often complicated by the actions of militant and political leaders who have been active in an insurgency in the indiancontrolle d state of jammu and kashmir since 1989 many have argued that peaceful resolution of this dispute between kashmiri pakistani and indian leaders may be the key to calming relations between the two nuclear armed nations and permanently nding their ongoing standoff but neither new delhi nor islamabad have been willing to consider compromise officials from the us embassy in new delhi reportedly traveled to the state recently to urgehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs2 2 hurriyat dilutes stand on poll participation aphc chief

hurriyat to participate in ptember and october 2002 elections thus supporting key indian goal in resolving the uprising2 although indias opposition to international intervention in kashmir will more than likely prevent direct us involvement in any negotiations with moderate leaders the bush administration took leading role in facilitating this dialogue because of fears that another largescale attack by islamic militants might once again drive india to threaten pakistan militarily the complicated politics of the underlying uprising and the vast number of interested parties to the kashmir disput however have often frustrated the efforts of us leaders in the region the following is an outline of the movement for independence that flared up in 1987 and th internal kashmiri political struggle that has characterized the insurgency including descriptions of the groups involved and analysis of some of the plans that have been recently suggested for peace for description of the overarchi ng strategic struggle between india and pakistan over kashmir see crs re port rl31481 kashmir recent developments and us concerns httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs3 the us role in kashmir and congressional interests us interests in kashmir stem from three important concerns first after both india and pakistan tested nuclear wea pons in 1998 the threat that any conflict between the two nations may escalate to the point of nuclear exchange has sparked increasing concern among us and interna tional officials second because pakistan has become central to the war on terrorism many believe that the kashmir dispute has been used by islamic extremists to create standoff between india and pakistan and thus distract pakistan from its importa nt role in tracking down qaeda forces third members of congress have expressed concern fo r human rights violations allegedly committed by both islamic militants and indian security forces in kashmir as well as for the integrity of the democratic process and the right of self determination many analysts have claimed that the terrorist attack on the indian parliament building in new delhi in december of 2001 was orchestrated by militants from the kashmir conflict given the reported tie s between jaishemuhammad and qaeda leaders many believe that the attack was meant to create conflict between india and pakistan and thus draw pakistani tr oops away from guarding the border with afghanistan just as top qaeda leaders were attempting to escape from the conflict with usled troops at tora bora both the kashmir insurgency and the standoff between india and pakistan which has continued since bot h countries deployed more than million troops along their common border in january 2002 have thus gained an unlikely importance within the war on terrorism similarly there have been some suggestions that qaeda leaders have used parts of kashmir to hide from pakistani and us forces although others st rongly dispute this assertion kashmir is also perhaps the most important challenge to the us interest to promote stability throughout south asia as region although the spring 2002 military standoff appears to ve cooled militant attacks may continue to reignite the conflict especially during elections in september and october 2002 in both kashmir and pakista n many us and internati onal policy makers have raised concern that continued standoff between the two countries may result in nuclear exchange if pakistan allows militants to cross into jammu and kashmir and india decides to retaliate given that more than million south asians lost their lives during religious communal violence at the time of partition and independence some have argued that the concept of nuc lear exchange may not be outside of the realm of possible action for indian and pa kistani leaders engaged in standoff over kashmir while india has re portedly adopted doctrine that it will not use first nuclear strike against any country pakist an has made such declaration some have argued however that india is more lik ely than pakistan to take an action such as invading parts of azad kashmir that mig ht begin chain of events leading to nuclear exchange for all of these reasons us state and defense department officials increasingly have been interested in helping to foster peaceful resolution to the kashmir conflict there are however significant obstacles to any form of actual or perceived us intervention recent reported efforts by u s embassy officials to bring moderate kashmiri leaders from the all parties hurriyat conference into elections in jammu and kashmir have brought fe w tangible results similarl although pakistan hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs4 3 mubashir zaidi new horizons the govern ment has decided in principle to merge all militant outfits fighting in kashmir into one grand liberation army the herald lahore pakistan july 2002recently followed through with some promises to us officials that it will curb cross border infiltration into india many have argued that the governments reported plan to reorganize all kashmiri militants within single kashmiri liberation army signals that this is decidedly temporary policy decision see section separatists in kashmir below3 if this includes former memb ers of foreign panislamic groups they argue this may be yet another excuse to continue the same activity under changed name similarly if presiden t musharrafs cooperation in the war on terrorism and antiextremist stance on kashmir are not met with some sort of concession from india many have argued th at pakistanis may be more reluctant to trust us intervention and peaceful negotiation over kashmir india for its part has repeatedly voi ced staunch opposition to any form of us intervention in the conflict see section t he role of india below many have argued that for this reason there is little hope that member s of congress could suggest something similar to the mitchell plan authored for the northern ireland israelipalestinian conflicts and bring lasting resolution to the kashmir dispute others however have recently argued that the increased friendliness between the united states and india since president clintons visit to the region in 1998 may begin to erode this inflexibility they believe that if the united states can build stronger ties with formerly government run sectors of the indian economy the countrys energy telecommunication and transportation infrastructures ruling bharatiya janata party bjp leaders ma become less inwardlooking in finding solutions to the problems of the region some observers see recent stronger military tomilitary ties between india and the united states including resumption of arms sales and joint military exercises as possi bly making india more receptive to the united states taking role in the negotia tion similarly us sympathy for countries facing the challenge of terrorism may increase the likelihood that india will be amicable to us efforts in the region the longstanding belief in the aftermath of the cold war that any us intervention in kashmir would be skewed in pakistans favor they argue may begin to gradually s ubside in india especially if the us hunt for qaeda terrorists in pakistan and afghanistan helps to end the activity of extremist militants in kashmir httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs5

one ignores the line of control which they argue has temporarily divided the region the islamic population of the entire former princel state is roughly 75 majority5 history of the kashmir dispute india and pakistan have fought three wa rs since their independence from britain including two over kashmir and have come to the brink of war over jammu and kashmir state several times since both c ountries tested nucl ear weapons in 1998 the longstanding dispute over the kashmir region began at the time of independence from britain in 1947 when the entire s ubcontinent was par titioned between the newly emerging indian and pakistani states during the negotiations leading to the partition the indigenous rulers of the co lonys more than 500 principalities were technically allowed the choice to accede to either country though for practical reasons most choices were dictated by combination of geography and the religion of the majority of the inhabitants th hindu maharaja of ma joritymuslim kashmir however put off this decision and refuse d to allow the accession until parts of his principality were overrun by pa shtun tribal groups from pakistan several months afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs6 independence and partition the legality of his accession agreement with india has been the subject of significant controversy ever since determined to build india as secular nation in which state with an islamic majority could thrive indi an prime minister jawaharl nehru reportedly promised kashmirs first chief minister sheikh mohammad abdullah that the accession of the princely state to india would not be complete until the people of kashmir were allowed to vote in plebiscite to affirm the decision many have argued that sheikh abdullahs influence and ne hrus message that kashmi rs islamic population would be better off under secular india than st ruggling pakistan could have turned this vote in indias favor following the 1948 49 war india conditioned plebiscite now mandated by resolution as contin gent on pakistans withdrawal from the territory it had occupied in 1953 in response to sheikh abdullahs continuing demands for promised autonomy and plebiscite the indian government removed him placed him under house arrest and imposed rule from new delhi because of nehrus failure to follow through with plebiscite and the congress partys continued interference in the autonomous st ate all hopes that the dispute could come to peaceful resolution brokered by the united nations were largely frustrated many have argued that the early fa ilures of india and later renunciation of independence by the abdullah family set the stage for grass roots movement among the kashmiri people which turned into violent uprising in december of 1989 more than decade later the uprising now thr eatens to destabilize the entire south asian subcontinent origin of the uprising and pakistani influence in 1972 after the 1971 war that caused the separation of pakistans eastern wing and the creation of bangladesh pakistan was forced to agree in simla india to resolve the kashmir dispute wholly through bilateral means ie rejecting the validity of the 1949 resolution calling for plebiscite in the view of many of the leaders of the kashmiri insurgency the postsimla elimination of international pressure allowed dramatic deterioration of the rights of the islamic population of indianheld kashmir the decade after 1972 in india was characterized by prime minister indira gandhis fforts to strengthen the political power of the central government over the countrys state pa rliaments furthe r armed regional movements for autonomy and secession were treated by her administration with harsh retribution nd few concessions in kashmir indira gandhi brought shei kh abdullah back into power nearly 20 years after jawaharlal nehru had remove d him from office in dispute over the abandoned promise of plebiscite at fi rst abdullah signaled his willingness to make significant concessions to the centr government and indira gandhi saw an opportunity to lessen the importance of those still agitating for plebiscite by bringing abdullah back into office abdullahs signing of the 1974 kashmir accord which described jammu and kashmir state as constituent unit of india was meant to bring final blow to the argument that kashmir was still disputed territory httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs7 6 turkkaya ataov kashmir and neighbors tale terror truce pp 127129 ashgate london 2001 although sheikh abdullah later revealed himself to be puppet of indira gandhis government his efforts to solidify his power base within the state as well as his willingness to compromise with india to secure his position generated for his party some significant opponents in ka shmir thus leaders like mirwaiz mohammad farooq the father of hurriya t leader mirwaiz umar farooq who would accept nothing less for kashmir than plebiscite began to build significant opposition to abdullahs national conference party s imilarly many islamic leaders in kashmir including several moderate sufi politicians disagreed with sheikh abdullahs staunch secular stance nd became active in the growing oppos ition after sheikh abdullahs death in 1982 an ar gument between his two sons over who would succeed their father as the chairman of the national conference party led to power vacuum within the state and dramatically increased role for the indian central government after successive maneuve ring by both brothers brought the state under three different regimes in four years the government called fresh elections for 1987 by many accounts this was time of tremendous hope for those who opposed the national conference party many of sh eikh abdullahs former foes joined their parties as muslim united front muf to contest the 1987 kashmiri elections hurriyat leaders however claim that alt hough this alliance had widespread support in the kashmir valley the 1987 elections were widely rigged in favor of puppet government of the indian center reportedl thousands turned out in anger when it was fraudulently announced that in coa lition with the congress party farooq abdullahs national conference party had won the state election by an overwhelming majority the years of political battle with indi over autonomy and plebiscite combined with the belief that rajiv gandhis g overnment had left the kashmiri muslim population in 1987 electorally disenfranchi sed some have ar gued led to the beginning of the armed uprising and the decision of many kashmiris to turn to pakistan for help6 in india the belief that anger over the election sparked the uprising has been largely challenged by the notion that pakistan in fact infiltrated the region to create militant insurgency pakistan for its part denies that it has had anything to do with funding training or otherwise encouraging the militant activity which began in the kashmir valley in the later months of 1989 thus the question of who is responsible na tive kashmiris or the pakistani military for both the original impetus for the uprising as well as the continued funding of militant groups has become central issue of contention between indian and pakistani leaders from 1987 onward kashmiri opposition leaders organized widespread demonstrations and general strikes which often led to riots among the kashmiri islamic population many ve argued that militants fro m the kashmir valley during this time began to go to pakistan to reque st training and funding to begin an armed conflict in jammu and kashmir these gr oups reportedly began to plan activities which would coincide with other alr eady organized kashmir i militant groups such as the jammu and

during this time the indian government began to build massive security apparatus throughout jammu and kashmir state in order to battle the militants for discussion of human rights violations see section below the role of india although the exact role of pakistan in the onset of the insurgency is highly contested many analysts contend that the pakistani interservices intelligence isi took on significant role in directing th militancy after 1990 they argue that the 1988 death of pakistani president general ziaal haq 19771988 and the end of the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1989 left significant number of mujahideen soldiers idle in pakistan the pakistani military is also said to have had deep reservations about supporting groups like the jklf because of their staunchly secular background in 1990 pakistan is said to ve begun to support kashmiri leader syed salaudin and the hizbul mujahideen as an alterative to the jklf by 1993 however pakistan is said to have turned away from the hizbul mujahideen because of fears that its l eader syed salaudin would not support the accession of kashmir to pakistan it has been argued that the isi began to back pakistanibased militant groups often from the farright leaning islamic extremist parties within pakistan in order to ensure that their allegiances were for kashmiri accession to pakistan many of these groups also reportedly

the kashmiri independence movement has been characteriz ed from its very inception by crippling internal conflicts of ideology and personal rivalries unlike similar movements however in kashmir single politician has gained the dominance achieved by tamil tiger militant vellupillai prabhakaran or palestinian leader yasser arafat some suggest that the larger regional battle over kashmir has created unique situation in which two competing ideologies have been allowed to thrive among islamic insurgents living on different side s of the line of control increasingly many observers have argued that the di spute has become not only proxy war between india and pakistan visited on th kashmiri people but also an internal conflict between moderate kashmiri separatists and foreign extremist militants who have infiltrated from pa kistans jihadi subcultu re recent attacks by militant extremists have not only led to the deat hs of indian security forces and hindu civilians but also moderate muslim separatists who ironi cally were leaders of the original uprising although some see th kashmir conflict as religious dispute between hindu india and islamic pakistan the insurgency itself has become part of larger debate over the emerging political character of islam throughout the entire south asian subcontinent religious and political influences aside from the concerns of pakistani political and military leaders13 t h groups struggling for plebiscite in kashmir have been characterized by two main ideological strains of thought the first group although decidedly islamic has nationalist vision of kashmir and views the struggle as means to liberate the entire state from india and in some cases also pakistan the second group takes more extremist view of islam and sees kashmir as the land of struggling muslim majority trapped within neocolonial secular state that prevents them from living under t aliban style islamic law although ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs11 14 interview with dr ghulam nabi fai executive director kashmiriamerican council june 14 2002 many international observers have recommended that any permanent border separating kashmir should be soft or porous so as to prevent this separation others argue that if militants continue to be trained in pakistan such porous border would be extremely dangerous to india significant grey area exists between the two camps in which certain leaders often display allegiance to both sides many w ould argue that the movement has become marred by an underlying ideological polar ization the characterization of the uprising as being driven purely by popular desire to allow ll kashmiris from both the pakistani and indian sides of the line of control to decide their own fate has become increasingly untenable the struggle for kashmiriyat many have argued that the 1987 uprising in kashmir began with kashmiriyat or nationalist vision of the state as region with strong ethnic identity that unites kashmiris across international and religious lines this argument is put forth largely by moderate muslims kashmiri nationalists today see the united nationsestablished line of control as boundary akin to the berlin wall in that it has led to division of kashmiri families from one another for more than fifty years14 those who make this argument insist that they should not be called separatists because they do not accept that jammu and kashmir state has ever become permanent part of india through accession from maharaja hari singh kashmiri nationalists further argue that the islamic majority of the state lived in subjugation throughout the colonial period under the rule of hindu maharajas they argue that the limited autonomy granted to the state in the indian constitution has never safeguarded the state from tinued occupation and dominance from the majorityhindu indian government they ar gue therefore that their struggle is to bring the diverse islamic popul ation of kashmir some assu rance that their national rights will not continue to be violated nd further that they have intention to establish an islamic theocracy in kashmir many from the religious minority communities in jammu and kashmir m ainly hindu pandits and buddhists however view the kashmiri nationalists secular claims with suspicion and have expressed deepseated fears that the fulfillment of the kashmiriyat vision would result in widespread discr imination or even ethnic cl eansing against nonmuslims kashmiri nationalists also argue that during indian prime minister nehrus time prior to 1953 there was widespread belie f among kashmiri citizens led by sheikh abdullah that united nationssponsored plebiscite would result in vote for kashmir to remain in india once nehru denied kashmiris this vote and subsequent indian prime ministers began to intervene heavily in kashmiri politics the argument follows that kashmiri muslims began to believe that they would never have complete popular control over their own state govern ment and that the divided sections of kashmir would never be reunited the ection in 1987 which they say was rigged is said to have been the last straw and due to the abdullah familys abandonment of the call for plebiscite the argument goes kashmiris turned to violence and rejected the notion that they should accept the li ne of control as national

ideology many assert that these groups represent far right political version of the sunni islamic faith that has been nurtured widely in south asia only since the zia ulhaq re gime 19771988 in pa kistan although there is little agreement from one faction to another many of these groups reject the central tenets of westernstyle democracy and seek to set up talibanstyle theocracy which would stretch throughout sout h asia many have argued that these militants see the jihad struggle for kashmir as first step to liberating the entire south asian islamic population from the secu lar dominance of india barring that however they would prefer that the entirety of kashmir become part of pakistan and are violently opposed to the concept of kashmir separating from both countries entirely many of the jihadi militants active in kashmir especially those with the closest reported links to qaeda trace their religious origins to conservative islamic revivalist movement that began during the co lonial period in india after quashing the indian sepoy uprising against colonial rule in 1857 the british began to heavily discriminate against the islamic elite who had once held positions of power within the bureaucracy of the mughal empire islamic leaders responded to the sudden change in their position through two importa nt south asian movements the first led by sir syed ahmad khan at the aligarh muslim university sought to return the islamic elite to positions in the government through the attainment of an advanced englishmedium westernst yle education while simu ltaneously cultivating urdu literature and modernist tion of islamic culture th second movement however which began in the darul uloom house of knowledge school in deoband india in 1866 violently rejected the secular infl uences embraced by british modernists and sought to create conservative sunni revival throughout south asia the deobandi movement sought to purify the practice of islam in british india ridding it of the mystical beliefs of the sufi islamic tradition which the revivalists believed to be the product of corrupting colonial and hindu influences the movement focused on adherence to taqlid tradition or acceptance of the old interpretations while rejecting the notion of ijtehad or reinterpretation of religion according to the times15 many have argued that pakistan s founder muhammad ali jinnah drew ideological inspiration from the moderate islamic work of sir syed ahmad khan and it was not until the country became front line state in the wa r against the soviet invasion of afghanistan that the conser vatism of the deobandi movement began to find widespread following in pakistan during the regime of general zia ulhaq thousands of religious schools or

became the underlying source for mujahid een soldiers fighting in afghanistan and when the soviets and americans left the region many have argued that the pakistani isi began to rely on madrassaeducated militants to take part in the kashmiri uprising many have argued that the practice of deobandi islam that is being imported into kashmir has an extremist character that was never even practiced in the darul uloom school in india and has been m odified significantly by more puritanical pakistani saudi arabian and afghani pashtun taliban influences similarly when the afghan leader mullah mohammad omar declared himself to be the true islamic caliph and began the taliban movement his followers are said to have enforced an islamic conservatism ironically unseen throughout the entire history of the islamic world while simultaneously claiming an adherence to the deobandi school some argue however that much has been gained by militants from the original teachings of deoband in this vein some maintain that osama bin ladin and members of qaeda prefer the militant activism of the original deoband school to the non confrontational rejection of the west they see in present day saudi wahhabism thus the second strain of ideological thinking behind the groups in kashmir contains strong anticolonial origin these groups often see both india and pakistan as semiautonomous secular stat created by the colonial western world to prevent muslims from practicing true islam they also believe that pakistan is controlled by secular elite backed by the united states in much the same way that the indian princely states were once dominated by britain during the colonial period if muslims are to be free of this neocolonial or der they claim it is necessary to set up panislamic state which adhe res to the teachings of s upreme sunni islamic leader or caliph in this case omar or bin ladi n would claim this position they see kashmir as the most egregious example of this oppression but their vision of pan islamic revival reporte dly covers all of south and s outheast asia ironically then many have argued that desp ite pakistans alleged use of these groups in kashmir they may be as ideologically opposed to pakistans state stru cture as they are antagonistic to india moderate political groups the clash of these extremist and moderate camps has led many of the

harkats activities have been severely limited due to the defection of nearly three fourths of its members recent pakistani reports suggest that harkat has also been dissolved and placed under syed salaudins control the role of india throughout the history of the insurgen cy successive indian governments have dealt with the leaders of the kashmiri uprising in much the same way as they have with separatist movements fro m other regions of india since prime minister indira gandhis administration during the sikh uprising in punjab in 1984 for example india adopted strategy of nonnegotiati on and repression of separatist leaders followed by efforts to bring remaining sikh leaders into the political process this approach resulted both in an internationa lly recognized massacre of hundreds of sikh leaders in the golden temple in amritsar and in decision of the more moderate leaders of the largely sikh alkali dal party eventually to participate in democratic elections in punjab although this approach eventually led to the end of the uprising it also precipitated the assa ssination of indira gandhi by her longtrusted sikh bodyguard the events of the massacre and the ensuing violence after indira gandhis death also created lasting resentme nt among even moderate members of the sikh community many of whom have gained political asylum in the united states and european countries because of tinued harassment by indian police nonetheless the punjabi example illustrates the thinking behind the often contradictory indian policy toward kashmir the indian effort to end the uprising in kashmir has focused on threepart strategy first india has sent massive security force to kashmir in order put down the militant activity in the region with fu ll force second india has attempted through offers of senior positions within the state government to entice moderate kashmiri political leaders to participate in the states elections and add democratic legitimacy to the jammu and kashmir state government and finally india has made every attempt possible to prevent the conflict from becoming the subject of calls for international interven tion many have argued that this is the best available strategy for india to avoid losing kashmir to pakistan or co mplete independence india has argued that were it not for pakist ans funding of the terrorist proxy war in kashmir the strategy could have been successful long ago httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs24 46 government surrendered sovereignty to us the hindu july 31 2002indias staunch aversion to international intervention

of state powells suggesti on during visit to the region in july 2002 that international observers be allowed to monitor th september and october 2002 elections46 indias rejection of even this limited type of mediation stems from several ideological and political concerns first many indian analysts have argued that direct intervention from the united states or ot her western countries between india and pakistan would be very similar to the british colonial control over the region that precipitated the creation of paki stan indian intellectuals often argue that the dispute is an internal conflict betw een brothers and that indi and pakistan should be able to reconcile their differences without th interference of neocolonial power pakistanis consider this argument to be patronizing dismissal of their legitimate claim to muslimmajority kashmir which was recognized by the united nations as disputed territory second despite ge nerally improved relati onship between india and the united states since president c lintons visit to the region in 1998 indian policy makers are often still spicious of us involvement in south asia given the close cooperation between pakistan and the united states during the cold war they have indicated an underlying belief that th united states would not be favorable to their interests third india has argued that the kashmir dispute is domestic issue and that pakistani and international interference in its handling of the insurgency is violation of its national s overeignty and finally india has had much to gain from stressing the significance of the simla ag reement of 1972 in which pakistan agreed to forgo the united nations mediation of pa st treaties in favor of hope of future bilateral negotiations be tween the two countries over kashmir the simla agreement has allowed india to postpone negotiation over kash mir indefinitely while warding off pakistani pressure by insisting that the uprising is purely domestic and that elections held in 1996 in jammu and kashmir state have superceded the need for plebiscite despite these arguments however many have noted that india has had an increased trust in us diplomatic efforts in the region during times of crisis since the bush administration took an unstinted stan ce against terrorism after the september 11 attacks others have also argued that given the threat of nuclear war between india and pakistan the kashmir dispute is by its very nature an international concern in late august and early september of 2002 group of indian academics and policy makers sanctioned by the indian government initiated dialogue with the all parties hurriyat conference in an effort to discuss negotiations over kashmir the hurriyat stated that it would only be willing to discuss the issue of talks and would reject participation in october elections outright many however have suggested that secretary of state powells recent trip to the region may have been the impetuous for indias backing of these talks

insurgency recently many analysts have argued that india and pakistan have both used the issue of the kashmir conflict symbolically to rehash the dramatic political battle that led to the partition of british india and th creation of the two countries accompanied by the deaths of nearly three million south asians in fighting and ethnic cleansing during vast exchange of populations indi ans they argue see their own ability to provide democratic rights to the islamic population of ka shmir as confirmation that they were indeed capable of creating secular government and thus that muhammad ali jinnah had reason to seek separate muslim homelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs27 pakistanis in turn rely on their belief that islamic kashmiris and other muslim minorities suffer under indian rule as mean s to justify the necessity of their own state they argue that in this sense the national identities of both countries will be forever antagonistic to one another w ithout this underlying rationale for national cohesion and without the impetus to retain one another as define d national enemies it is said both india and pakistan might divi into several sepa rate countries or be overrun by communal or sectarian violen ce due to the threat from successive regional movements many have countered however that this argument glosses over the political complexity of both countries not to mention the actual concerns of pakistanis for muslims in kashmir and other parts of india they argue that in both india and pakistan there are several perspectives on kashmir as well as many domestic political interests to maintain the conflict indian perspectives many in india express absolute oppositi on to giving up kashmir to pakistan many have noted however that two very different political perspectives characterize the motivation behind this position the first is held mainly by much of the opposition congress party and those who suppor t the political ideals of former prime minister and kashmiri pandit jawaharlal nehru who sought to build modern india as secular democracy in which politi cal party could be founded on religion and group would be discriminated against b ecause of religious practice for those who see india in this manner the loss of kashmir and its islamic population is viewed as threat to the founding framewo rk of india as religiously free and fair society the second perspective is held by the ru ling bharatiya janata party bjp the farright shiv sena party and several hi ndu nationalist groups such as the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss nd the vishwa hindu parishad vhp those who hold the principles of hindutva often speak of india as holy land and see the partition of india as visceral violation of this sacred ground by successive foreign invaders both the mughal and british empires the loss of kashmir would be seen as yet another blow to an already victimized indigenous population they have also expressed particular concern for the hi ndu pandit population of jammu and kashmir who they argue have been the vic tims of ethnic cleansing throug hout the separatist movement many analysts have argued that hardline leaders of the bjp have capitalized on national anger over the militant violence in kashmir and threats of retaliation against pakistan as means to drum up popular electoral support for their party and hindu nationalist agenda many indi an intellectuals have also warned that if the country were to lose kashmir hi ndu nationalists would probabl initiate widespread mob violence against the more than 100 million mu slims living in other parts of india pakistani perspectives pakistanis often state that they have concern for kashmir in the blood many have argued however that the reasons for th is concern are as diverse as they are in india the first group made up of the majority of the pa kistani popul ation havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs28 expressed concern foremost for the safety of the muslim majority in kashmir living under indian security forces and counteri nsurgent militias they also sympathize with indias remaining islamic minority living unde r hindunationalistled government especially given recent communal violence that has k illed more than one thousand muslims in the indian state of gujarat since march 2002 they speak about the necessity of plebiscite in kashmir in order to ensure the self determination of the kashmiri people some analysts have argued that while the majority of pakistanis speak of the activity of the mujahideen in kashmir as struggle for freedom they believe that sectarian and an tiwestern attacks in their own country are intolerable acts of terrorism the pakistani media which are often controlled ideologically by the military they argue pr events the majority of the population from knowing that the violence in both kashmir and pakistan is carried out largely by the same groups acting under differe nt names generally pa kistanis strongly oppose an independent kashmir and note that the 1949 resolution allows only plebiscite vote for pakistan or india not third opti on in other words many pakistanis see zerosum issue with india in which the only acceptable outcome is to overturn the states accession to india some take the view that the pakistani military has been motivated in its fight over kashmir by an underlying fear that if india is allowed to take over all of kashmir it will be the first step to retaking the rest of pakistan they see india as dominating regional power which attempts to impose its will over all of the other countries in the region and that backin g down from this historic battle would ultimately marginalize pakistan as nation many in th pakistani military have also shown impassioned sympathy for the kashmir i cause some support those such as syed salaudin who wage war for kashmiri nationalism and others back those who would like to build panislamic state some analysts have suggested that the military has been willing to use the ex tremist militant gr oups operating out of pakistan in the past to fight proxy wa r in kashmir although it may not agree with all of the militants underlying political goals the military however has often shown its violent opposition to any leader who argues for kashmiri independence from both pakistan and india many have argued finally that there is growing population in pakistan who see the struggle for kashmir as religious battle they see india as hindu nation that forces its muslim minority to live under political system that is against islam others however have pointed to the lack of support in prev ious parliamentary elections for the jamaatiislami party and other rightleaning islamic parties in pakistan as an indication that few of the countrys population view the conflict in kashmir from this perspective indian and pakistan i strategic concerns in addition to the ideological concerns on both sides of the dispute there are also significant strategic i ssues at stake for both countri simply because of the central geography of kashmir if for exam ple india were to attain azad kashmir pakistans capital islamaba d would be even more geographically vulnerable to an indian attack on the other hand if jammu and kashmir were to fall into pakistans hands new delhi would be more accessible to pakistan india has also expressed

miri noncombatants it is often difficult to gauge the leve l of popular support held by kashmiri civilians for the insurgency wide vari ety of political options have been advocated by citizens of kashmir including control by either india or pakistan complete separatism partition of kashmir along the chenab river with the kashmir valley ostensibly going to pakistan or limited combination of regional autonomy from both countries and an unres tricted border between azad kashmir and jammu and kashmir state recent opinion poll conduc ted in indiancontrolled kashmir by the independent british research company market opinion research international mori has suggested that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the uprising in survey of 850 kashmiris interviewed statewide 61 stated that they would be better off as part of india while only 6 said they would fare better as part of pakistan54 similarly 86 reportedly stated th at elections would bring peace to the region many have argued however that th poll did not take an adequate survey of public opinion in kashmir because it did not include an answer for those who supported co mplete independence or much greater autonomy they argue that the remaining 33 who were lis ted in the dont know category may have shown strong support for independence they so argue that those who supported indias control of kashmir did not have the chance to state their interest in some degree of autonomy they note that the poll found that 91 supported greater interaction between the indian and pakistani controlled sides of the region they also point out that while significant sample was taken in jammu and kashmir state the poll did not include the opinions of those living in azad kashmir many also point out that kashmirs re ligious minorities mainly sikhs hindus and buddhists are often left out of discussions about the states future prominent members of these communities have been the targets of widespread human rights abuses by militant groups throughout the hi story of the insurgency this ethnic cleansing led to large scale exodus of the regions hindu pandit community beginning in 1990 some analysts suggest that jammu and kashmir should be recognized as culturally diverse region and that minority groups should be brought into any negotiations concerning the in surgency several hurriyat leaders have agreed with this assessment of kashmir and have argued that an independent kashmir should recogn ize separate electorates for these minority groups to ensure that their views are heard in kashmiri pa rliament others how ever have said that the jammu and ladakh areas of jammu and kashmir state should be separated from the kashmir valley in order to protect these areas from militancy and allow the creation of separate homeland for kashmiri hindu pandits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31587crs30 55 in pursuit of trifurcation frontline april 14 2001possibilities for common ground many foreign observers of the kash mir conflict have expressed constant frustration with the entrenched positions of both sides while pa kistan continues to push militarily for plebiscite india refuses to discuss the matter with pakistan and rejects any form of international interv ention similarly while india continually rejects plebiscite hurriyat leaders refuse to participate in jammu kashmir elections successive us efforts to decrease tension between the two nuclear powers and renew negotiations have been met with provocative militant attacks in kashmir and india which almost always serve to reescalate the conflict many observers have labeled the kashmir dispute an unending conflict because there seems to be resolution that all sides are willing even to consider for negotiation some have argued however that there are several similar options for settling the issue that have been advocated at different times by different parties on both sides of the dispute some observers suggest that these proposals could provide road map for future negotiations and possible lasting settlement bifurcation trifurcation and the chenab river agreement recently hindu nationalists in india have suggested that much of the jammu and ladakh areas of jammu and kashmir should become states or given union territory status in the case of ladakh separate from the kashmir valley see map below in this scenario much of the socalled muslim belt that is part of jammu and ladakh such as doda poonc h and rajouri districts w ould also be given to the new kashmir region their belief is that th is trifurcation w ill contain the violence within the kashmir valley and protect the regions minority populations from militants the whisper campaign surr ounding trifurcation actually began as movement in jammu for bif urcation or the separation of jammus hindus from the rest of kashmir55 some believe that this would simply provide an excuse to allow security forces to commit human rights violations indiscriminately against the remaining population of the ka shmir valley without causing harm to hindu civilians others have countered that although this pl an leaves india with less of an argument against the loss of kashmir at least it would prevent the loss of jammu and ladakh if plebiscite we re to be held some members of the hurriyat w ho support the accession of kashmir to pakistan such as syed shah geelani reportedly have voiced their agreement with the idea of trifurcation they argue that at least the rss and shiv sena leaders who support this position are tacitly agreeing th at the issue of kashmir is not forever closed similar idea was first proposed in 1950 by sir owen dixon the representative for india and pakistan this plan suggested using the chenab river which flows just north of the city of jammu as national boundary between india and pakistan thus dividing the state along religious lines see map below president musharraf reportedly has expressed favorab interest recently in discussing

division of jammu and kashmir difficult to swallow they point out that there are still significant islamic minority populations in jammu and ladakh and that they would be subject to further indian oppression without protection from the majority in the kash mir valley those who believe that there are kashmiriyat cultural ties beyond religion that join the population of the region also view this

reaffirm article 370 and kashmiri autonomy many in india have noted that the sp ecial autonomy granted to the state of jammu and kashmir in the indian constituti on which never has actually been honored could provide the kash miris with more concessions than those granted to any other state in the country the ho tly contested accession agreement signed by maharaja hari singh in october 1947 provi ded india with jurisdiction over only three areas of governance defense external affairs and communications the indian constitution thus provided kashmir with an autonomous status in line with the accession agreement so that all other areas of governance would be decided by the jammu and kashmir constituent assembly it is for this reason that unlike other states in india kashmir has separate constitution fl ag penal code and criminal procedure code from the rest of the country58 members of the hurriyat however have argued that the indian constitution allowed compliant kashmiri constituent assembly to erode this autonomy59 under special provision of article 370 any act passed by the indian parliame nt could be applied to kash mir at the request of the states constituent assembly thus over the years believing the promise of plebiscite and trusting in the ruling congress party the sheikh abdullah government made many such requests thus alt hough sheikh abdullah was able to use the autonomy to institute considerable land reform in kashmir hurriyat leaders argue that his actions rendered the au tonomy virtually meaningless many however have expresse d hope that such an article already codified in the indian constitution could be revived thr ough negotiation between hurriyat leaders and the indian government and provide so means of finding compromise to the dispute before his death abdul gani lone reportedly expre ssed an interest in negotiating with india to gain package of further concessions for jammu and kashmir which would revers some of the longstanding erosion of kashmiri autonomy60 although perhaps falling short of independence this autonomy could reduce significantly the indian presence in kashmir especially if it gained enough popular support and won over some militants questionable proposition analysts maintain that lones death has put significant damper on the viability of this form of settlement for kashmir other moderate hurriyat leaders have been much more reluctant to negotiate with india because it is widely believed that he was killed for his views similarly some hurriyat leaders and kashmiris in pakistan view this type of solution with contempt because it does not safeguard independence or provide accession to pakista n the plan would also fall far short of meeting pakistans interests for the region

sangh rss have s poken vehemently against the cen tral government making such concessions to kashmir they have stated that granting such autonomy to only one state is similar to allowing the independence of the state which they regard as treasonous solution61 the andorra model in 1998 kashmiri american businessman organized group of policymakers and academics to suggest possible resolutions to the kashmir conflict among other plans the kashmir study group proposed that the region could be governed in the same manner as andorra small state th at was claimed by both france and spain until 1993 the arrangement gave ndorra partial sovere ignty separate constitution and free access across borders for both france and spain the plan allowed both countries to continue to have partial sway over the region while providing it with partial i ndependence when applie d to kashmir the group only included the kashmir valley where most of the islamic population of the region lives this plan would allow kashmiris free access to visit their relatives across the mountains into azad kashmir similarly the independent region would have separate constitution c itizenship and legal system the kashmiri legislature would govern over every aspect of normal sovere ign jurisdiction except defense and foreign affairs the new state would be free tr ade zone thus opening the regions beloved tourist areas to both india and pakistan the entire region would thus become demilitarized zone and the present line of control would be made into soft national border many analysts also suggest that this solution would have the added benefit of providing natura l buffer zone between india nd pakistan thus restricting their ability to orchestrate sta ndoffs against one another and answering to both countries strategic concerns some however have questioned the ability of such soft border to protect india if large groups of militants from organiza tions like jaishemuhammad and lashkar etaiba began to use the region to launch attacks against the rest of india they argue that the plan would only be feasib if pakistan could follow through on its promise to crack down on these banne d militant groups similarly although recognizing that the borders between i ndia and kashmir woul d be open some have also questioned the plans proposal to partition jammu and kashmir state along religious lines the plan would also incl ude converting the line of control into national border an idea that pakistan vehemently opposes ultimately however many have argued that proposal could
