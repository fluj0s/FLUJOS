consumer protection act of 2005 pl 1098 brian w cashell and mark jickling economics division heather d negley information research specialist september 14 2007 abstract the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act signed into law on april 20 2005 was intended to prevent the ﬁling of abusive bankruptcy petitions and to require debtors with regular incomes to repay as much of what they owed as possible overall the perceived eﬀect of these amendments was to make the bankruptcy code signiﬁcantly more favorable to creditors as result there was rush to the courthouse between the date of enactment and the eﬀective date october 17 2005 during that period record numbers of consumer bankruptcy petitions were ﬁled during 2006 by contrast the number of ﬁlings dropped sharply to less than quarter of the 2005 ﬁgure doubt much of the decline is explained by what happened during the transition many consumer bankruptcies ﬁled in 2005 were accelerated by the enactment of the new law and would otherwise have been ﬁled in 2006 or later at the same time part of the slowdown may be permanent if the new law is having its intended eﬀect of discouraging certain types of ﬁlings with only six quarters of data under the new law the lasting impact is uncertain this report examines the evidence to date and oﬀers some preliminary observations on the numbers and types of bankruptcy petitions

g343g561espite the fact that two of the longest economic expansions in us history occurred during the 1980s and 1990s the number of consumer bankruptcy filings rose sharply during those decades and continued to rise after 2000 this paradox attracted two kinds of explanations some analysts detect growing financial fragility among american families factors such as medical costs stagnant median wages low rates of saving or increased dependence on two incomes are said to make households more vulnerable to financial shocks others argued that the bankruptcy code itself was driving up the number of filings in this view the existing law made it too easy for consumers to have their debts discharged or erased by the courts and thus created an incentive for imprudent or even fraudulent borrowing behind the 2005 bankruptcy reform legislation lay growing perception that bankruptcy relief may be too readily available and is sometimes used as first resort rather than last resort and that the law was full of loopholes and incentives that allow andsometimeseven encourage opportunistic personal filings and abuse 1 the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 was meant to respond to many of the factors contributing to the increase in consumer bankruptcy filings such as lack of personal financial accountability the proliferation of serial filings and the absence of effective oversight to eliminate abuse in the system the heart of the bills consumer bankruptcy reforms consists of the implementation of an incomeexpense screening mechanism needsbased bankruptcy relief or means testing which is intended to ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford 2 the means test weighs debtors income against their debts and living expenses according to an arithmetical formula contained in the statute3 in general debtors whose incomenet of specified expenses and allowancesexceeds certain thresholds are not allowed to file chapter 7 bankruptcies where debts are discharged and consumers are free to make fresh start but must either file chapter 13 petitions under which they agree to repay part of their debts over period of several years under courtapproved plan or receive bankruptcy relief at all 4 thus the new law if it works as its sponsors intended should have two effects consumers with steady incomes and the ability to repay who filed chapter 7 petitions under the old law should be steered into chapter 13 second the total number of bankruptcies should decline as opportunistic filings are deterred the tables below present the data that bear on these questions g22g152g157g138g149g561g16g158g150g139g142g155g561g152g143g561g8g146g149g146g151g144g156g561 table 1 below shows quarterly nonbusiness bankruptcy filings since the

source administrative office of the us courts in december 2005 the number of filings increased slightly and the rising trend continued through june 2007 given that the latest figures remain far below pre2005 levels it seems likely that the aftereffects of the rush to file triggered by the new law are still being felt this suggests that filings will continue to rise throughout 2007 it remains to be seen whether filings will level off before they reach the levels that prevailed few years ago under the old bankruptcy law

into chapter 13 where the bankruptcy court collects part of the debtors income for number of years and distributes it to creditors before 2005 about 30 of all nonbusiness cases were chapter 13 and virtually all the rest were chapter 7 5 in 2006 and the first three months of 2007 the chapter 13 rate has averaged 407 5 nonbusiness petitioners can file under chapter 11 which is standard for corporate reorganizations however b ecause of the complex and costly procedural requirements only few individuals use it as table 1 shows

effective date of the new law was in fact rush into chapter 7 even though the total number of filings in 2005 set record the number of chapter 13 cases declined from 2004 clearly the message that debtors received about the new law was that chapter 7 relief would become more difficult to obtain and that chapter 13 was considerably less desirable alternative historically the percentage of cases filed under chapter 13 has varied significantly and persistently from state to state in 2002 29 of cases nationwide were chapter 13 but there were five states where chapter 13 accounted for more than 50 of all petitions on the other hand 10 states had rates of less than 106 tables 2 and 3 break out the 10 states with the highest and lowest chapter 13 rates in 2002 and present data on what happened there in 2005 and 2006 table 3 shows that the percentage decline in chapte r 13 filings reported in 2005 was greatest in the states that had the highest rates in 2002 in 2006 the percentage of chapter 13 cases has risen above the historical norm in both high and low rate states but the increase from 2002 to 2006 is not more pronounced in either group of states on might have expected the primary impact of the new law to be felt in states where chapter 13 had been relatively rare under the old law but the data do not show this instead there appears to be an acrosstheboard increase in the percentage of cases filed under chapter 13 as in the case of total bankruptcy filings some of this increase is likely due to the transition experience when the accelerated filingsand subsequent dropoffwere predominantly chapter 7 cases and it is uncertain how far or whether the chapter 13 rate will remain permanently above the prereform level 6 the high chapter 13 states were mostly in the south while the low states were geographically dispersed small population states the differences are usually explained as result of varying court norms or legal culture httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22511
