economics and risk assessment government and finance division financing recovery from largescale natural disasters summary two important issues before congress are 1 securing the nations capacity to prepare for respond to and recoverrebuild from natural catastrophe events and 2 determining whether and how the federal government should intervene in catastrophe insurance markets since the devastating gulf coast hurricanes of 2004 and 2005 and sequence of tornadoes wildfires earthquakes hurricanes ike and gustav and the midwestern floods in 2008 public attention has focused on 1 the potential high cost of recovery and financing of natural disaster losses 2 the supply and relatively narrow scope of private sector disaster insurance 3 the extent to which americans living in disasterprone areas may be uninsured or underinsured and 4 potential increases in federal outlays for disaster assistance after hurricane katrina in 2005 the property insurance industry revisited catastrophe exposures with the help of recalibrated catastrophe models for atlantic tropical storms based on this new analysis insurers arguably face greater potential losses in severe catastrophe events than was previously appreciated this enhanced appreciation of risk has implications for property insurance capacity underwriting and pricing many insurers responded to recent hurricanes by requesting rate increases or refusing to renew hundreds of thousands of policies sold in areas along the atlantic and gulf coasts where insurance became either too expensive or unavailable homeowners and small business owners who could not otherwise obtain property insurance in the private markets turned to stateoperated residual market facilities that serve as insurers of last resort in these areas as result many of these facilities have expanded nevertheless there is evidence to suggest that state operated facilities may not be fully capable of resolving the problems of insurance availability or affordability for example floridas inability to issue debt bonding capacity during the global financial crisis in advance of the 2008 hurricane season threatened to unravel the states property insurance system in the wake of financial market turmoil in 2008 one point of view contained in this report stresses the importance of bringing more transparency to the markets for innovative new risk transfer financial products some of these risk transfer instruments such as credit default swaps and other derivative products are not regulated and regulators have valid data upon which to perform oversight of them in the credit markets some economists believe that more transparency and regulation are important components of credit market reform several members of congress have debated mechanisms to ensure adequate capacity and solvency of the insurance industry to meet customer demand many proposals have been introduced that would improve insurers access to capital in the

ever since eight costly hurricanes struck the east and gulf coasts in 2004 and 2005 large national property and casualty insurers have significantly scaled back their willingness to underwrite property insurance for homes located on or near coastlines hurricanes dolly gustav and ike were the major storms of 2008 and they renewed fears about the economic effects of the destruction of thousands of homes businesses and infrastructure public attention is now focused on issues such as the cost of disaster relief and reconstruction in the wake of financial market turmoil and growing fiscal deficits whether and where gaps in private insurance and reinsurance coverage currently exist why insurance coverage might become expensive and unavailable and whether new forms of privatepublic risktransfer partnerships are needed to manage the financial impact of largescale natural disasters natural disasters in the us have the potential to cause economic losses in the tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars the federal government has played large financial role in responding to uninsured natural disasters during the 20year period from fy1989 to fy2008 congress appropriated 250 billion dollars for disaster assistance1 given the increasing frequency and severity of east and gulf coast hurricanes and growing disaster relief expenditures there is an urgency in congress to ensure the effective financing of catastrophic risks coupled with fair and efficient resolution of policyholder claims property value in key us earthquake and hurricane zones has doubling every 10 years meanwhile global insurance and reinsurance capital allocated to covering hurricane and earthquake perils is not keeping pace economists have observed that this fundamental shortfall between risk and capital growth represents major public policy challenge for congress in addition to federal outlays private sector expenditures have been considerable according to data from the insurance services offices property claims unit private insurers paid 2619 billion in insured catastrophe losses from 1980 through 2007 insurance companies play key role in managing risks of catastrophic 1 see crs report rl33226 emergency supplemental appropriations legislation for disaster assistance summary data by justin murray and bruce r lindsay crs2 events2 individuals and businesses usually insure against catastrophes in order to reduce financial volatility and avoid potential ruin insurers in turn will transfer portion of that risk to reinsurer thereby spreading globally the burden of catastrophic risks however some have contended that the capacity of the traditional international reinsurance market to finance megacatastrophic event remains inadequate3 new forms of innovative risk financing instruments have developed to help insurers and reinsurers increase their capacity to manage their peak catastrophic risk two main categories of alternative risk transfer art solutions are insurancelinked securities ils which are direct risk transfer instruments that provide funds to offset catastrophe losses and contingent debt agreements eg contingent surplus notes and equity puts which can replenish policyholders surplus ie an insurers capital after catastrophe losses art mechanisms complement traditional reinsurance by transferring risk directly to capital market participants such as hedge funds and institutional investors this report provides an analysis of the challenges facing property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies in financing largescale natural disasters particularly during financial market turmoil the report begins with discussion of congressional interest in financing recovery from natural disasters and the role and limitations of federal disaster assistance and private insurance this is followed by an assessment of the problem of financing catastrophic risk ie issues of availability and affordability of residential property insurance coverage in coastal areas and discussion of insurability of natural disasters given insurers claimspaying capacity in the final three sections the paper examines art mechanisms such as ils and contingent debt securities that complement traditional reinsurance the effects of the financial crisis on unraveling capital structures that underlie some state property insurance systems and possible roles for the federal government in the market for catastrophe insurance coverage as it considers policy options for resolving the broader financial market crisis the report concludes by summarizing the legislative options under consideration in the 110th congress congressional interest in natural disasters the us has always been exposed to risks of natural disaster largescale natural disasters such as wildfires windstorms ie hurricanes tornadoes and other wind damage floods and earthquakes however have become increasingly frequent and costly in 2005 private insurers paid record 604 billion in insured 2 insurers have three major tools at their disposal to manage an increase in risk 1 raise equity capital by selling company stock 2 transfer risk to the reinsurance market and 3 limit risk through the underwriting and asset management process 3 j david cummins and mary weiss the global market for reinsurance consolidation capacity and efficiency brookingswharton papers on financial services 2000 crs3 catastrophe losses for hurricanes4 at the same time uninsured losses from hurricanes katrina rita wilma and dennis caused an unprecedented 130 billion in federal outlays for emergency disaster relief consequently policymakers are aware that although there is wellfunctioning international catastrophe insurance and reinsurance market the federal government has increasingly been called upon to exercise its considerable authority and significant means to reallocate resources throughout the economy to compensate disaster victims the financial volatility of natural disasters and the resulting burden for society and the economy are important issues for congress because of its responsibility to promote national economic growth megacatastrophic event striking some region of the us could impede interstate and foreign commerce and cause widespread distress and hardship adversely affecting the general welfare uncertainty about how often catastrophic events will occur frequency and the magnitude of catastrophic events severity continue to pose catastrophic risk financing challenge both to society as whole and to the federal government in 1995 president clintons national economic council working group on disaster insurance formulated set of broad principles and objectives for federal insurance program to reduce losses and cover catastrophic risks in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in 2005 and ike and gustav in 2008 these principles and objectives could set the policy framework to guide policymakers in coping with natural disasters the working group concluded that federal insurance program should reduce total societal costs of catastrophic natural disasters reduce total longterm federal costs of dealing with such events increase personal security in the aftermath of disaster and increase the extent to which costs of disasters are maintained in the private sector to create incentives to moderate losses from disasters key question for congress going forward is whether to proactively address the issue of managing catastrophic risks through insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms one option is to establish an explicit publicprivate risk transfer partnership that would allow the federal government to leverage public funds through the use of insurance reinsurance and capital market instruments to accomplish the abovestated public policy objectives this report analyzes issues and information related to building different relationship between insurers reinsurers the capital markets and the federal government 4 this figure comes from the insurance services offices property claims unit crs4 the catastrophic loss financing problem at least two complementary approaches exist to manage the risk of largescale natural catastrophes 1 predisaster risk avoidance and mitigation that reduces physical and environmental vulnerabilities but still requires postevent funding 2 risk transfer mechanisms that involve disaster relief insurance reinsurance and capital market instruments designed to compensate disaster victims and reduce exposure to financial losses generally the federal natural catastrophe risk management strategy seeks to mitigate the extent of damages through landuse regulations strengthening risk assessment and enforcing structural mitigation and vulnerability reduction measures such as zoning and building code compliance remaining residual risk is then largely absorbed through combination of federal disaster relief assistance commercial insurance selfinsurance and tax deductions role of disaster relief and private insurance private insurance and federal disaster relief have been relied upon for decades as complementary mechanisms to compensate disaster victims and provide for recovery after natural disaster risk management theory however suggests at least three reasons why insurance is the more efficient mechanism of the two for allocating the risk of large catastrophic events disaster relief assistance is assumed to have negative incentives for risk mitigation because benefits are paid whether or not recipients have taken steps to reduce their loss exposures the inefficiency results in higher social and federal costs of disasters and is commonly referred to as moral hazard from welfare economics or resource allocation perspective disaster relief is inequitable because it is funded through general tax revenue and the costs of disasters are borne by people or businesses regardless of their location in hazardous areas ie residents and taxpayers in highrisk areas are subsidized by those in lowrisk areas disaster relief is inefficient and inclined to misjudgment because property owners oftentimes do not fully understand the risks they face make risk management decisions based on inaccurate information and intentionally rely on disaster relief for compensation insurance is considered more efficient mechanism to deal with natural catastrophes it establishes price on the hazard based on actuarial information and creates economic incentives to mitigate losses insurance manages risk pooling insurers are uniquely exposed to variety of risks arising from their riskbearing underwriting function insurers typically will hedge the risk they assume by directly transferring some portion of that risk to reinsurance company or indirectly to special purpose reinsurer set up to transfer the crs5 risk to investors in the capital markets through indemnitybased or indexbased insurancelinked securities ie derivative transactions5 there are inherent limitations to using insurance or reinsurance as risk transfer tool because insurance protection against megacatastrophic event is not always available through private sources also plans policies and structures intended to mitigate the effects of such losses might not always fully anticipate the destructive aspects of hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters property insurance price and capacity problem at the core of the problem of the availability and affordability of homeowners insurance in hurricaneprone coastal areas is the way insurers internally raise capital the cost of capital required to underwrite exposures in disasterprone areas and how insurers react to situations where their earnings or solvency are threatened insurers must have adequate capital to support the risks assumed and generally meet capitalization requirements this can usually be achieved in four ways earn net profit thereby increasing policyholders surplus sell insurance policies which increases longterm debt capital account for the value in the assets and liabilities not reported on their balance sheets realized and unrealized capital gains and reduce the amount of capital required by reducing exposure to risk insurers generally limit the capital committed to underwrite property insurance in coastal disasterprone areas largely because regulatory constraints have led to what some insurers believe are inadequate returns to attract sufficient capital insurers usually seek rate of return commensurate with the risk they assume expecting higher return from capital allocated to catastrophic risk than from say stable book of automobile insurance policies where losses do not fluctuate widely from year to year in contrast losses from catastrophic perils are more volatile and potentially much larger an insurer must hold significantly more equity to underwrite catastrophe exposures than it needs to underwrite noncatastrophe exposure to remain viable the insurer must be able to pass on its cost of capital to policyholders shortages of insurance induced by capital shortages led two states california earthquake and florida hurricanes to establish state catastrophe funds that offer certain advantages over private sources of capital state catastrophe funds that receive taxexempt status can accumulate funds free of federal insurance tax and use their government authority to issue debt to pay losses supported by future assessments against residents in the state the states are therefore able to diversify 5 indemnitybased transactions involve settlement that is directly related to the loss experience of the company issuing the securities eg catastrophe bonds and contingent capital facilities such as surplus notes indexbased transactions involve settlements that are triggered or derived from the value of an independent index crs6 spread risk over time through the debt financing mechanism within their limited jurisdictions economic factors contributing to price and capacity crisis property coverage became expensive and difficult to obtain following the 2004 2005 hurricane seasons after the storms insurers felt compelled to revise their underwriting and pricing assumptions to reduce their risk exposure and the amount of capital they needed to maintain profitability and comply with regulatory requirements as result insurance coverage for residential properties in hurricane prone coastal areas became more expensive and scarce for the average resident higher residential property insurance prices and reduced availability of coverage occurred not because of financial capacity shortage but rather because of changed industry assumptions about the frequency and intensity of north atlantic hurricanes and uncertainty about the models methodologies and data used for estimating natural hazard risk and losses from hurricane events insurers were essentially reacting to the perception not necessarily based on historical and actuarial data that more properties were at risk than previously thought residents in areas exposed to these catastrophic perils have experienced wide fluctuations in the price and availability of insurance especially after major disaster uncertainty about the probability of losses caused by natural catastrophes and concern about insolvency triggered by series of disasters are the key reasons for fluctuations in the price and availability of property insurance in disasterprone areas increased prices for and reduced availability of insurance have been attributed to both demand and supply side factors the next two sections examine demand and supply side effects that contributed to scarcity of privatesector disaster insurance following the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons demandside effects the demand for insurance coverage is function of the growth in population and property values along the gulf and atlantic coasts and the perception of increased catastrophic risks this increased demand has contributed to disruptions in the coastal wind insurance market when demand exceeds supply prices tend to rise supplyside effects four factors were key in the development of the current scarcity of residential property insurance 1 historic levels of insured catastrophe claims payments 2 limited supply of catastrophe reinsurance particularly after the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane losses 3 higher capital adequacy requirements imposed on insurers by credit rating agencies and 4 litigation surrounding wind versus flood insurance coverage disputes after hurricane katrina these factors are discussed below first insurers had to make historically unprecedented levels of payments to policyholders in 2004 and 2005 this has altered their view of what constitutes an infrequent megacatastrophe consequently the structure of reinsurance contracts has changed forcing primary insurers to retain more risks and pay more for the expanded coverage table 1 shows the ten costliest insured catastrophe loss events crs7 in recent years six of the 10 largest insured catastrophe losses occurred over the last four years6 hurricane katrina alone caused private insurers approximately 436 billion in insured losses surpassing the 229 billion from 911 terrorist attacks and the 23 billion for

the third most destructive hurricane to ever hit the united states according to the national weather service although initial estimates put insured losses at more than 11 billion ike has not been officially ranked by the iso faced with the changed marketplace conditions after the 2005 hurricanes primary insurers sought to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses by decreasing the number of policies issued on properties in coastal areas insurers lowered their exposure by not renewing policies coverage for significant number of their customers not selling new policies or exiting the market altogether although individual insurers have sought to reduce their presence in coastal areas the property insurance industry as whole continues to supply insurance to virtually every property in the united states in states where the insurance market disruption was most severe eg florida louisiana mississippi and texas state officials either created statesponsored residual mechanisms or expanded existing ones to provide insurance to all those who could not purchase coverage in the voluntary market the second factor that arguably contributes to the current problem is the limited supply of catastrophe reinsurance after the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane losses critical element in the ability of private insurers to underwrite catastrophe 6 on september 13 2008 hurricane ike made landfall in galveston texas as category 2 hurricane it was the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and third major hurricane of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season initial estimates put insured losses at more than 11 billion the 11 billion is based on computer simulation models ike will likely rank just ahead of hurricane wilma in 2005 when the isos property claims service unit publishes data on the official insured losses crs8 risk is the availability of reinsurance7 insurers typically purchase reinsurance to protect themselves from the financial consequences of single catastrophic event that causes insured loss to multiple policyholders reinsurance markets however are subject to price and availability cycles often resulting in price increases and supply restrictions following catastrophic events8 significant portion of the insured catastrophe losses from the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes were paid by reinsurance proceeds and as reinsurers capital reserves were depleted reinsurers needed to rebuild capacity9 the limited supply of residential property catastrophe reinsurance forced many primary insurers to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses from hurricanes and to retain more risk than they would prefer this has driven up their costs third primary insurers and reinsurers who underwrite catastrophe lines of coverage were subject to higher capital adequacy requirements imposed on them by credit rating agencies like standard poors and am best company this change affected the amount of catastrophe insurance that insurers were willing to sell strong financial rating reduces the insurers borrowing costs and therefore increases its competitiveness in the marketplace rating agencies were actually responding to adjustments in catastrophe modeling firms assumptions with respect to probabilities of loss based on presumed uptick in frequency and severity of catastrophic events over more immediate time horizon the nearterm higher expected frequency of hurricanes making landfalls and higher estimates of the amount of structural damage repair costs both assumptions based on information provided by catastrophe modeling firms led to higher predicted losses and ultimately to higher premiums after the backtoback recordsetting hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 rating agencies required insurers and reinsurers to plan for catastrophic event projected to occur with frequency of one in 50 years rather than one in 100 years insurers balance sheets had to be able to withstand multiple extreme events rather than just single event to maintain their financial strength ratings insurers were required to maintain higher level of capital to demonstrate an ability to pay claims under these two new standards the consequence of higher capital adequacy requirements was the sharp increase in demand for residential property reinsurance which in turn caused the price of this reinsurance to increase dramatically in 2006 through 200810 7 dwight

surrounding insurance coverage disputes and litigation over the standard homeowners insurance policy exclusions for wind and water damage created contract uncertainty associated with the judicial interpretation of insurance policy terms and language11 the legal dispute concerned which portion of the loss is due to wind covered by standard homeowners policy and which is from rising water whether from storm surge or flooding realizing that courts action could substantially increase insurers risks in hurricaneprone states some insurers decided to limit the amount of coverage sold in highrisk coastal areas residual market mechanisms for property insurance when residential property insurance becomes scarce and unaffordable individuals and businesses who cannot otherwise secure private coverage have turned to statesponsored residual market mechanisms12 state residual markets were created to improve the availability and affordability of property insurance primarily for residents and private businesses in coastal highrisk areas as private insurers have withdrawn from highrisk areas state residual markets have become the first and only choice for many homeowners consequently the programs have expanded in recent years residual market and state catastrophe funds typically charge lower risk premium than private insurers because they generally hold little or capital reserves against major events these facilities will typically impose tax or assessment after catastrophe in order to fund resulting claims obligations the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons demonstrated the limits of residual market facilities and catastrophe funds with losses exceeding the facilities claimspaying capacity most state residual markets face financial challenges because of the concentration of property risk underwritten by the facility the reliance on postevent assessment and the inadequacy of rates to cover expected losses over time there is growing belief that traditional backstop mechanisms such as assessments on insurers that have their own catastrophic losses to fund are not appropriate protection against megacatastrophic event many economists have acknowledged the political necessity for these facilities but suggest that the lower prices tend to distort an otherwise efficient market by reducing incentives for individuals to mitigate their 11

offer windstorm insurance coverage to residents in coastal counties in their respective states crs10 exposure this raises the longrun disaster costs for society as whole including for state and federal taxpayers insurability of natural disasters economic theory suggests that every risk is insurable at price this of course assumes 1 that risk averse individuals and businesses will be able to identify their risks and 2 there is accurate pricing so that insurance companies are able to sell insurance coverage at risk premium the firm believes is sufficient to cover the risk it has assumed in order for the insurer to calculate the risk premium the firm must be able to calculate expected losses and establish an appropriate price to charge for the coverage historical claims and exposure data collected over an extended period usually form the basis for projecting future expected costs inherent problems arise however when using historical loss data and experience to project catastrophe losses insurers generally endeavor to underwrite insurance for catastrophic loss events on the basis of handful of historical loss data points and actuarial science when the insurer does not have confidence in the catastrophe modeling or the ability to set price due to the infrequency or potential magnitude of losses the firm will stop selling new policies not renew existing policies or withdraw from the market altogether and subsequently reallocate the capital to other lines of insurance this situation usually creates hard insurance market in catastrophe lines of coverage prices rise and insurers limit the supply of insurance coverage in the marketplace from traditional insurance perspective natural catastrophe risk could be considered uninsurable for at least three reasons 1 limited amount of capital policyholders surplus allocated to catastrophe lines of insurance 2 uncertainty in measuring catastrophe losses and pricing catastrophe losses 3 insurance market imperfection the remainder of this section discusses each of these reasons why catastrophic risk may be considered uninsurable insurer claimspaying capacity although the 2005 hurricanes caused unprecedented catastrophe losses they were not solvencythreatening to the industry as whole nor did they cause net reduction in aggregate claimspaying capacity the property and casualty insurance industry

2008 the increase in natural catastrophe loss and exposure however has raised public policy concerns about whether there is sufficient capacity within the private catastrophe insurance and reinsurance industry to cover the nations payout requirements for megacatastrophic events 1in100 year events and what insurance reforms would improve insurers access to capital in order to ensure adequate capacity to meet consumer needs and solvency of the industry13 catastrophe reinsurance markets are thought to be limited in their ability to insure against megacatastrophe most observers would argue that for the very highest layers of catastrophe risk the federal disaster relief and consequently the taxpayer is now by default due to limited privatesector capacity in the traditional reinsurance market the insurer of last resort particularly for uninsured property owners national insurance markets even backed by global catastrophe reinsurance capacity are limited in terms of the amount of catastrophic risks that can be covered the total catastrophe reinsurance capacity is not presently large enough to allow primary insurers to adequately hedge their catastrophe risk to meet societys emerging needs several megacatastrophic scenarios could be imagined that could overwhelm the current claimspaying capacity of both the private insurance and state residual 13 jd cummins m doherty and can insurers pay for the big one measuring the capacity of an insurance market to respond to catastrophic losses journal of banking and finance vol 26 2002 p 557583 crs12 markets insurance industry calculations suggest that repeat of the 1906 san francisco earthquake could cause 80 billion in insured property losses based on total property losses approaching 300 billion14 reinsurers appear unable to provide complete diversification of catastrophe risks both because catastrophes appear to be correlated across risks hurricanes floods and earthquakes among others and because estimates of the probable maximum loss pml from catastrophes have risen dramatically15 in 2007 air worldwide corporation catastrophe modeling firm based in boston simulated estimates of potential insured

jaffee and thomas russell can security markets save the private catastrophe insurance market paper delivered at the asianpacific risk and insurance association conference july 19 1998 p 11 crs13 table 2 shows that the capital base supporting the entire us property and casualty insurance industry both commercial and residential is about 5482 billion as of january 2008 it would appear that this sizeable surplus for unexpected losses would be sufficient for the property and casualty insurance industry as whole to be able to underwrite needed levels of catastrophe insurance however only about 20 of the industrywide policyholder surplus measure of capacity is generally considered to be allocated to catastrophe insurance lines of business the remaining 80 is needed to support noncatastrophic risks this means that approximately 110 billion of policyholders surplus is available for catastrophic property losses nationwide when comparing total claimpaying capacity of the insurance industry to the probable maximum losses one can conclude that the insurance industrys financial resources are insufficient to cover anything more than 1in100 year loss in light of the concerns about the capacity of insurers to pay claims after mega catastrophes primary insurers have increasingly turned to private capital markets for risktransfer capacity to complement traditional reinsurance markets professor kenneth froot of harvard university has suggested that one reason for the search for alternatives to reinsurance has been the supply restrictions associated with capital market imperfections and market power exerted by traditional reinsurers16 this situation is matter of basic economics of supply and demand limited number of reinsurers with specialized knowledge and unique access to global capital markets can exert substantial control over prices and supply given recent historical losses and concerns with future megacatastrophes property catastrophe reinsurance capacity is increasingly seen as insufficient to meet societal demand and the search for alternatives continues to some this line of reasoning arguably suggests federal intervention in natural catastrophe insurance markets to address potential market failure in the range between the 04 to 02 return periods17 some finance experts may also be concerned about projections that catastrophic losses will likely double every 10 years 16 kenneth froot the market for catastrophe risk clinical examination journal of financial economics may 2 2001 pp 529571 17 this analysis simplifies the complex worldwide market for catastrophe property insurance and is intended only to provide an indication of the industrys overall claimspaying capacity this analysis for example does not determine the potential effect of natural catastrophes on the financial strength of insurers nor does it consider offsets from the broad spread and syndication of risk through heavy use of reinsurance much of it foreign significant share of the impact on surplus associated with megacatastrophic event would be transferred to the insurance industry balance sheet in foreign countries like germany great britain switzerland and bermuda in addition the analysis does not consider the total amount of catastrophe reinsurance provided by state residual markets or state catastrophe funds that would increase the overall ability to insure catastrophic risks as stated above some insurers and reinsurers are able to raise new capital after major catastrophic event crs14 and the present government insurance approach might not be adequate18 john seo cofounder and managing principal at fermat capital management llc asserted during discussions with crs in preparation for this report that government insurance program might become challenged in its ability to cover losses for less than one generations worth of exposure growth as an illustration 100 billion exposure becomes 200 billion after 10 years 400 billion after 20 years and 800 billion after 30 years ten years ago 1in100 event would have cost insurers 55 billion ten years from now 100 year event could cost 220 billion uncertainty in measuring and pricing catastrophe exposures in general efficiently functioning insurance markets require insurers to 1 classify risk so that differences in risk can be observed and incorporated in insurance premiums 2 accurately predict the total expected losses for the pool of insured properties and 3 accurately reflect the underlying economic costs in the price of insurance coverage for any insurer to meet its contractual financial obligations in the event of loss it must first be able to estimate the expected annual loss in order to price the coverage and the magnitude of the extreme losses to prevent cashflow or liquidity problems one difficulty is that riskspreadingandpredicting techniques in the private insurance market generally do not work as well for lowfrequency high severity events as they do for highfrequency lowseverity risks the lack of relevant historical data and experience on rare catastrophic events makes the forecasting of losses difficult in addition losses from catastrophes are correlated across exposures making it difficult for insurers to manage such losses in order to avoid potential insolvency given the uncertainty surrounding catastrophe losses insurers must charge premium that substantially exceeds expected losses homeowners might perceive this catastrophic risk premium to be too high and therefore may be unwilling or unable to purchase coverage the challenge for insurance companies is to accurately estimate loss probabilities due to the large variance of loss around an expected occasional extreme event19 insurance market imperfections catastrophe reinsurance could arguably become overpriced and in relatively short supply due to natural market forces of supply and demand capital market imperfections and market power enjoyed by relatively small number of catastrophe reinsurers can potentially also contribute to the high price and shortage of coverage20 18 insurance services office catastrophe losses will double about every 10 years says

crs15 economists dwight jaffe and thomas russell have argued that catastrophe insurance markets fail because primary insurers are not able to pay annual losses out of annual premiums situation that results from the wide variance in annual expected losses and potential magnitude of catastrophe losses21 the process of securitization of catastrophic risk in theory should be able to intertemporally smooth out this timing problem by allowing the capitalization of the stream of future premiums alternative risk transfer mechanisms securitization has traditionally been used to convert illiquid financial assets eg mortgages accounts receivable into liquid marketable assets securities but since the late1990s it is also being used to transfer catastrophic risk to investors in the capital market there are two main categories of alternative risk transfer art instruments that permit catastrophic risks to be dispersed into the capital markets insurancelinked securities ils which in effect are direct risk transfer instruments and contingent capital securities which reduce an insurers need for traditional sources of capital insurancelinked securities or catastrophe bonds these are risk transfer instruments that provide funds to offset catastrophe losses capital received is transferred to special purpose vehicle spv that then acts much like traditional although fully collateralized reinsurer the distinguishing feature of these bonds is that the ultimate repayment of principal depends on the outcome of an insured event the bonds pay fixed spread over libor the london interbank offered rate for investors insurancelinked securities ils are attractive as they provide an investment in specific insurance risk with potentially low correlation with equity and credit markets and with reduced counterparty risk because some funds can be held in trust contingent capital securities insurers are also considering contingent capital arrangements reinsurance sidecars industry loss warranty surplus notes catastrophe options and catastrophe equity puts that provide postevent capital that insurers can access after catastrophic event these arrangements allow insurers to raise cash by selling stocks and issuing debt at prearranged terms the insurer pays capital commitment fee to the party that agrees in advance to buy the equity or debt securities following loss contingent capital arrangements do not transfer the insurers risk of loss to investors the insurer only receives an inflow of capital to replenish its policyholders surplus after it pays for the loss contingent capital can be available to insurers immediately after catastrophe when the insurer most needs that capital through wide range of 21 dwight m jaffee and thomas russell catastrophe insurance

recognized that megacatastrophic disaster in the us could create insurance pricecapacity constraints in disasterprone areas in response catastrophe insurers and reinsurers have increasingly turned to capital markets to strengthen their balance sheets and manage risks associated with megacatastrophic event22 recent evidence suggests however that private insurance and the ability of state governments to implement catastrophe risk management strategies could be jeopardized because of the current financial market turmoil floridas inability to issue sufficient debt bonding capacity during the global financial market crisis in advance of the 2008 hurricane season for example threatened to unravel floridas property insurance system if major hurricane struck in 2008 in october 2008 officials in florida announced that the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf would not be able to honor the entire 28 billion in reinsurance obligations to insurers in the event of major hurricane striking the state and that additional funds from the federal government might be needed23 the financial market turmoil has been attributed to combination of factors including lack of transparency financial market complacency stemming from years of positive results and poor or insufficient regulation24 in short the creditrelated sectors of the financial services industry were adversely affected by the way investment banks hedged their risk exposure financial engineers and investment bankers created financial instruments called credit default swaps cds on structured collateralized debt obligations cdos and collateralized loan obligations clos but in hindsight these financial contracts lacked sufficient transparency to easily identify assess and clear the risks25 22 the

capital markets with excessive complexity being the enemy of transparency regulators have expressed interest in finding market transparency solution that is applicable across all current risk transfer categories and one that can identify in real time the interaction of multiple transactional operational and performance risks and provide an early warning system for systemic failure some have argued that the best way to resolve the financial crisis rests on the assurance of market transparency so that information about financial contract and its counterparties flows freely and all parties are informed about all relevant aspects of the market transaction transparency in the pricing and terms of securities is considered by many to be essential for financial market efficiency it has been argued that in the long run greater transparency leads to more developed financial markets28 greater resiliency to shocks29 and better allocation of capital30 transparency regulation has been presented as way to improve the allocation of resources which can arguably reduce financial fragility by strengthening market discipline and making financial institutions and markets more accountable to customers and taxpayers transparency has been defined in several ways and is often measured based on subjective perceptions of individuals one objective definition of transparency is the accuracy and frequency of economic information released to the public31 consideration is typically made to address the direct costs of complying with disclosure requirements and the indirect transparency costs stemming from having to protect proprietary rights from public policy standpoint the idea is for public officials and regulators to promote market transparency in order to ensure wellfunctioning

transparency could address issues of fairness subsidy to investors at taxpayers expense ambiguity with respect to the mission and oversight of the newly created troubled asset relief program and the longterm economic effects of the rescue plan illuminating opaque credit markets on one level what is proposed by the national association of insurance commissioners the federal reserve and other financial sector regulatory agencies to solve the current financial market crisis can be interpreted as the replacement of individual silos of traditional business models in favor of unification of the forms and methodologies for credit risk transfer that result in financial products according to this model all risk transfer whether insurance or capital marketsrelated can be allowed to compete on an open playing field regulation would still be required to contain market excesses and occasional disruptions such regulation in turn requires data and analytics to keep it informed michael erlanger an inventor and corporate executive of marketcore an intellectual property development company focused on the financial service and insurance industry claims to have identified the problems in the financial markets that led to the credit and liquidity crisis and to have devised solution erlanger asserts that the crisis is caused by the absence of realtime data flows in the financial services industry that would allow all market participants and regulators to determine or discover appropriate transaction terms prices and performances the lack of realtime data flows has arguably contributed to market illiquidity inefficient risk pricing and operational inefficiencies to the detriment of all market participants according to michael erlanger two things are needed to address opaque capital markets 1 framework for disclosure and reporting of comprehensive data and analytics pertaining to all financial instruments including loans lines of credit other financial products as well as insurance reinsurance and securitized insurance risks and 2 transaction platform or other data highway such as the internet in which financial products are bought and sold and where detailed data on the composition of the assets and of the transactions are collected stored and displayed these data are available wherever possible on realtime basis the activity on the transaction platform is facilitated by what erlanger calls transaction credits as buyers and sellers redeem those credits to either do more business or to access market and product information the transaction credits themselves can provide consistent tracking mechanism in which all transaction details including underwriting standards and actual per instrument financial performance are retained and displayed as they occur the marketcore approach to transparency is to create transaction platform where market participants as well as state and federal regulators have access to view the disclosures and the transaction details marketcore argues that transparent information about the transaction details would keep market participants honest while allowing all parties reasonable expected profit from the transaction placed through the platform many financial market experts agree that illuminating credit markets is an efficient way to keep market participants and market regulators informed leading to sounder financial decisions effective implementation would crs21 arguably require global alignment of accounting regulatory and due process approaches to provide standardize framework and restore confidence in contractual performance so all participants are able to rely on the sanctity of contract transparency in the pricing and terms of securities is considered by many to be essential for financial market efficiency by definition transparent financial markets provide accurate information to allow for the discovery of transaction prices as well as terms on securities and financial instruments of all types it is considered important that this real time information be readily available to everyone encouraging market participation transparency and regulation arguably todays economic environment is characterized by fundamental lack of financial market transparency that affects the insurance industry and those that regulate it along with the general economy regulation is usually intended to address market failures there are many recent examples of market failures where contributory factor has arguably been lack of transparency examples include the bidrigging and contingent commission scandal in the insurance world few years ago and the recent financial guaranty crisis32 another market that functions less efficiently than it arguably could is the market for catastrophe bonds if the underlying elements were made more transparent then different decisions would arguably have been made about accepting risk at the negotiated opaque price point the concept of insurance regulation is relatively simple the regulator wants to ensure that the insurers have sufficient assets to make good on the promises they have made to the public solvency regulation and that the insurers treat customers and claimants fairly market regulation solvency is monitored by requiring insurers to submit fairly comprehensive financial statements on an annual basis and each quarter in addition insurers are subject to periodic deskaudits and onsite examinations to verify the accuracy of the financial information provided to regulators the current system however is considered by some to have shortcomings in that the information provided to regulators is snapshot in time revealing the insurers opinion of the value of financial assets relative to the ultimate settlement value of all the liabilities that the insurer has assumed should the underlying markets for either the specific securitizations or their component parts fail regulatory solvency tests could become difficult to implement due to limited reliable transactional pricings in the case of the financial guaranty insurers bond insurers management is accused of having underestimated the liabilities to which the insurers were exposed because of the lack of transparency regarding the collateralized debt instruments they were guaranteeing it could arguably also have been misestimation of the value of an asset held by the insurer such as bond secured by subprime mortgages 32 see jamie chapman bidrigging scandal envelops top insurance brokers in us october 29 2004 located at httpwwwwswsorgarticles2004oct2004marso29shtml crs22 for effective market regulation insurance regulators need information on how the market is functioning currently this is done through monitoring consumer complaints reviewing rates reviewing policy language targeted market conduct examinations and market analysis majority of states are involved in project to collect market information through market conduct annual statement that requires insurers to answer several interrogatories and provide some market data to states like the financial regulatory framework the information provided is snapshot in time and is in large part influenced by the insurers opinion of its performance the national association of insurance commissioners is considering ways to strengthen solvency regulation and market regulation by harvesting financial and market performance data as well as accurate valuation of assets held by insurers directly from an electronic transaction platform system the thinking is that if such system is established and the appropriate information outputs are identified and captured regulators will in theory have better understanding of the actual financial position eg accurate valuation of assets of the insurer and greater insight into the insurers market practices over time as more transactions are captured by the system some think that the output might supersede the current annual and quarterly financial and market regulatory reports federal intervention in the catastrophe insurance market since the mid1990s policymakers and insurance industry participants have come to understand that major catastrophic event can cause an unexpected and sudden large loss of insurers capital reserves and there is material risk that the price of insurance will rise and supply will fall this situation can lead to calls for government financial intervention in catastrophe insurance markets to expand the private sectors risktransfer capacity economists believe that an argument for federal intervention in catastrophe insurance markets can be made if the following four conditions hold adequate insurance is not provided by the private insurancereinsurance industry the financial consequences of major disaster is beyond the ability of the private insurancereinsurance industry to cover local communities have adopted and enforced loss reduction measures to mitigate future natural disaster damages even if such activities had limited impact and the public insurance strategy is designed to be actuarially fair and financially sound and avoids unfunded contingent liabilities implicit in some type of guaranty crs23 there is not consensus among industry participants and experts as to whether these four conditions are present in todays catastrophe insurance market however if the private insurance and reinsurance markets are not willing or able to provide risktransfer capacity for whatever reason perhaps due to high cost and limited supply of private capital the heightened uncertainty about the frequency and severity of future losses or insurers inability to charge risk premium to ensure individual company solvency this situation could justify federal intervention property and casualty insurers and reinsurers have historically opposed federal intervention in catastrophe insurance markets often arguing that natural disasters are insurable if the free market is allowed to work the largescale disruption in private markets created by hurricane andrew 1992 the northridge earthquake 1994 and hurricane katrina 2005 however has prompted some insurers and their trade associations to call for more systemic approach to intervening in catastrophe insurance markets in response to the limited supply and high price of property insurance in coastal areas past concerns with the rising level of federal disaster assistance and limitations in insurers and the state residual markets claimspaying capacity congress may wish to examine the risks posed to the us by natural catastrophes and the means for both mitigating and paying for those losses particularly in the uninsured sector of the american public federal financial intervention in catastrophe insurance markets could take any of several forms designed to expand the private sectors ability to provide catastrophe insurance such as adding highend federal reinsurance backstop providing shortterm government liquidity loans or offering federal multiple peril homeowners insurance policies covering both wind and flood damages these approaches to government financial intervention in catastrophe insurance markets could arguably be justified on the grounds that they address the failure of private markets to offer affordable disaster insurance to meet societal demand but while government intervention might expand the capacity of private insurance and statesponsored insurance pools to underwrite wind insurance coverage in highrisk areas it might also create taxpayerfinanced subsidies in theory the subsidy could undermine the economic incentives for homeowners to adopt costeffective mitigation measures problem also referred to as moral hazard arguments for intervention proponents of federal intervention argue that the government is the facto insurer of last resort for megacatastrophes largely because the government is thought to be better positioned to bear catastrophe risk because of its broad resource base and borrowing capacity the federal government however currently lacks comprehensive approach to manage the effects of catastrophic natural disasters relying instead on ad hoc disaster relief spending to facilitate recovery and rebuilding following major disaster federal financial intervention in the catastrophe reinsurance market some contend could reduce the burdens for future disaster relief expenditures promote efficient risk management by property owners and encourage individuals and states crs24 to take steps to reduce loss exposure which in theory could ultimately result in overall lower social and federal costs an explicit ex federal government risk financing approach would arguably be the best way to assess budget and plan for the future cost of catastrophe risks before such events occur arguments against intervention opponents of federal intervention in catastrophe insurance markets insist that there is sufficient private insurance and reinsurance capacity to adequately cover catastrophic risks if the government ensures framework that allows market mechanisms to work without local regulatory interference ie regulatory price constraints that seek to keep premium rates lower that expected losses which is usually based on computer simulation models federal intervention in catastrophe insurance markets it is argued creates unexpected sideeffects such as moral hazard and reduces the economic disincentives for homeowners and businesses to locate in disasterprone areas or neglect risk prevention moreover opponents of federal intervention in catastrophe insurance markets argue that private insurers state residual markets and state catastrophe funds already protect coastal properties and federal government intervention would only distort the insurance market by regulating availability of coverage and level of premiums displacing private capital deployed in insurance and reinsurance and stifling innovative private sector solutions for managing and financing catastrophic risks government insurance schemes they say would not reflect the risk level of the activity being insured thereby eliminating potentially powerful economic deterrent to risky behavior moreover government intervention could force the public at large to crosssubsidize the risky behavior of residents in highrisk areas potential points of agreement there is some consensus that the federal government has regulatory role to play in creating incentives for private capital to flow into the property insurance market establishing strong building codes encouraging effective land planning techniques and creating state insurance regulatory environment that fosters competition and riskbased pricing there is also some consensus that the federal government could help decrease barriers in the nascent markets for insurancelinked securities ils and provide liquidity through temporary loans designed to stabilize the market after megacatastrophe other common ground topics include clarifying accounting rules for specialpurpose reinsurers granting insurancelinked securities conduit status for federal tax purposes and changing the rules to require foreign and domestic reinsurers to meet the same collateral requirements legislative proposals legislation considered by the 110th congress was intended to protect citizens and the national economy from catastrophic adversities while arguably reducing both societal and federal costs of natural disasters besides the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 congress has not approved any other federal disaster crs25 insurance law because of lack of consensus that problem exists or that specific congressional actions is desirable there is also concern about creating moral hazard problems and the financial exposure for state and federal taxpayers33 table 4 in the appendix to this report provides list of major legislative measures pending before the 110th congress these proposals include studying the issues surrounding the availability and affordability of catastrophe property insurance adopting federal multiple peril policy that includes coverage for wind and water damage amending tax laws to create incentives for insurers policyholders and investors and authorizing direct involvement in the primary insurance markets or federal reinsurance program to offset the expected losses from potential catastrophic disaster factors to be considered in debate on federal involvement in insurance markets include the following current budgetary constraints preference for dealing with state and local problems primarily through government institutions and past experience with federal insurance programs particularly those insuring financial institutions that are regulated at the state level bipartisan study commissions hr 537s 292s 2286 these bills would establish commissions to examine various proposals to improve capabilities of the insurance marketplace to adequately insure homeowners against natural disaster risk by facilitating the pooling and spreading the risk of catastrophic financial losses from natural disasters taxpolicy incentives hr 164s 926 these proposals would expand the supply of capital reserves that stand behind private insurance this would require an amendment of the us tax code to allow insurers to accumulate taxdeferred reserves for catastrophic perils34 current tax provisions discourage insurers from reserving funds for unknown losses reserves for such contingencies can only be accumulated out of aftertax income in contrast reserves set aside for reported losses or losses incurred but which have not been reported at the end of given accounting period are not taxed by the federal government allowing insurers to accumulate taxdeferred reserves for catastrophe perils could be costly to the federal government in terms of reduced tax revenue and may involve tax benefits that favor one type of activity over another raising issues of efficiency another tax policy incentive s 2327 would be to allow homeowners to create taxfree catastrophic savings accounts csa 33 us

consumers and allowing for taxfree distributions to pay expenses resulting from presidentially declared major disaster economists have raised the question of whether tax incentives for homeowners would be sufficient to get people to buy disaster insurance the cost to the government could be weighed against possible savings in ad hoc disaster relief outlays federal multiple peril insurance program hr 3121 one policy response that congress might consider in the context of reauthorizing the national flood insurance program nfip is to create new option in the nfip to offer coverage for both wind and flood risk in one policy35 multiple peril insurance could eliminate the problem of uninsured property owners but it could also create new uncertain liabilities for federal taxpayers federal reinsurance for catastrophe losses hr 91hr 330s 928 congress could decide to enact legislation that would authorize the secretary of the treasury to sell limited number of excessofloss contracts covering industry losses from natural disasters to private insurers and reinsurers as well as to state sponsored insurance pools another federal reinsurance approach hr 91 and s 928 would allow states with their own catastrophe funds to be eligible to purchase reinsurance from the federal government thereby encouraging states to establish catastrophic funds to protect against natural disasters and reduce costs to homeowners federal reinsurance would expand the supply of catastrophe insurance in the private market and thereby increase the capacity of the industry to write primary catastrophe insurance federal catastrophe loan plan title ii of hr 3355s 2310 would authorize the us treasury to provide loans to state qualified reinsurance programs for natural disasters the loan

the authority of risk retention groups rrgs to provide commercial property insurance to members legislative action capital market alternatives whether in the form of securities such as bonds or in the form of loans can potentially stabilize the price of coverage congress has begun consideration of legislation that would encourage the securitization of insurance risk on november 8 2007 the house passed the homeowners defense act of 2007 hr 3355 that would encourage statesponsored insurance pools such as the florida hurricane catastrophe fund to pool their catastrophe risks and transfer the aggregate risk to the private capital market through risk transfer mechanisms such as catastrophe bonds36 an identical bill was introduced in the senate s 2310 but action has been taken in the 110th congress section 102 of the bill outlines the functions of the proposed new staterun national catastrophe risk consortium at the discretion of the affected members and on conduit basis issue securities and other financial instruments linked to the catastrophe risks insured or reinsured through members of the consortium in the capital markets act as centralized repository of state risk information that can be accessed by private market participant interested in underwriting risklinked securities or entering into reinsurance contractsand use catastrophe risk database to perform research and analysis that encourages standardization of the risklinked securities market37 the national catastrophe risk consortium consortium envisioned in hr 3355s 2310 would therefore work to allow states to pool large natural catastrophe risks within the consortium and then transfer it to the private capital markets through 36 hr 3355 and s 2310 would also create 1 highlevel liquidity protection program to provide contingent loans to state catastrophe plans both prior to disaster liquidity loans and after disaster catastrophe loans and 2 federal national catastrophe reinsurance fund that would serve as reinsurance backstop for private catastrophe insurance and state reinsurance programs that have 05 probability of occurring 1in200 year return or lower 37 section 102 hr 3355 crs28 the issuance of catastrophe bonds or the purchase of reinsurance38 the consortium is premised on finding low or lowest cost catastrophic risk financing solution that generates market competition by exposing risk transfer opportunities in way that makes evident the cost savings for participants using the system possibly in real or near real time in theory the consortium would be set up to 1 effectively induce usage by providing economic incentives to insurers to underwrite catastrophe risk because the risk could be transferred to investors at lower cost of transmission 2 facilitate transparency in both standardized exchangetraded derivatives and heretofore highly customized overthecounter otc contracts tailored for specific buyer 3 lead to more individuals participating in catastrophe insurance programs and 4 lower the costs of insurance for the consumer some are skeptical of the efficacy of government solution seeing model that convincingly reduces costs while increasing both competition and financial innovation in the marketplace most economists would agree that it is important that the economic benefit the determining value proposition be evident to users of the consortium in manner that provides sufficient incentive for universal participation there are several other possible options that would encourage the onshore creation of catastrophe bonds and other ils through tax exemption for income from the underlying assets these options would 1 clarify andor change gaap accounting rules for special purpose reinsurance vehicles 2 encourage states to amend reinsurance laws to give insurers credit on their financial statements for other risk transfer or capital market instruments provided there is fully funded transfer of risk 3 amend federal tax law to allow insurers to deduct catastrophe equalization tax imposed by state governments in segmented account for the benefit of insurers for use in the event of natural catastrophe 4 grant insurance linked securities conduit status for federal tax purposes 5 allow nonindemnity reinsurance status of securities under state regulatory accounting rules and 6 reduce or eliminate the trust fund collateral requirements for nonus reinsurers based on state insurance regulators determination of the adequacy of regulation of the country of licensure and the financial strength of the assuming
