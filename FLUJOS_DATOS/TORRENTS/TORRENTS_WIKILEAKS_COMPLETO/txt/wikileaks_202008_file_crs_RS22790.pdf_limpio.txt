individual and business tax cuts several types of tax cuts were partially or fully enacted for purposes of short run economic stimulus in the recent past 20012003 these tax revisions were the first in some time that were motivated at least in part by the need for expansionary fiscal policy in the late 1990s the economy experienced protracted period of significant growth and in the decade prior to that most tax legislation addressed need for deficit reduction the objective of most tax change between 1982 and 1997 as was the case in the 1990 and 1993 tax changes or desire for structural change in the 1986 and 1997 tax revisions 1 very different types of stimulus provisions were enacted in the period 20012003 the 2001 tax cut was aimed at individuals but most of its provisions especially the rate cuts which were phased in over number of years were not based on the recession that was apparent in 2000 and that appeared in the spring of 2001 when concerns about the economy continued towards the end of 2001 and in 2002 the congress enacted bonus depreciation and in 2003 the tax provision advanced to stimulate the economy was reduction in dividend taxation in february 2008 stimulus package containing rebate and bonus depreciation was adopted this report discusses the rebate bonus depreciation and dividend relief as mechanisms for stimulating the economy in the short run g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g343g561g20g142g139g138g157g142g561 the 2001 tax cut was not primarily enacted because of concerns about recession and most of the provisions were phased in over number of years however concerns about slowing economy did motivate the advance tax rebate provided in 2001 because the tax cut was enacted close to midyear in may it was difficult to provide tax cut for 2001 that could be reflected appropriately in withholding by the time withholding changes could be put into place much of the year would have passed and either withholding changes would be inadequate deferring tax cuts until returns were filed the following year or if made larger to compensate for the partial year effect would have resulted in withholding increase for some taxpayers at the beginning of 2001 the rebate proposal provided for the mailing out of checks to taxpayers in the fall of 2001 that were advance reductions for the introduction of 10 rate bracket for 2001 they were however based on taxpayers 2000 tax returns and any excess credits did not have to be repaid when returns for tax year 2001 were filed taxpayers whose credits were smaller than those allowed on 2001 returns however received additional relief when tax returns were filed the checks were mailed out between july and october 2 1 stimulus provision proposed in 1992 to provide credit against payroll taxes was vetoed by the president during the 1960s and 1970s variety of provisions was enacted that were associated with economic stimulus including investment credits rate reductions and tax rebates the joint tax committee has released document that reviews tax stimulus provisions from the 1960s forward it also has discussion of potential effects although some of that discussion relates to longer term effects rather than short term stimulus aimed at countering an economic downturn see joint committee on taxation overview of past legislation providing fiscal stimulus and issues in designing and

stimulus3 unlike many stimulus proposals in the past particularly in the 1960s and 1970s where the stimulus occurred during the recovery rather than the recession phase potentially adding to inflationary pressures its impact occurred during the recession4 in addition tax cuts are most effective as stimulus if they are spent and the tax reductions affected lower and moderate income taxpayers who have high propensity to spend at the same time there was some concern that lump sum payments might be spent in the same fashions as continued increase in income through tax reductions there was some evidence that temporary rebates in the past were not spent5 it appears however that most of the rebate was spent fairly quickly at least 20 to 40 in the quarter received and twothirds by the end of the second quarter after receipt6 studies of the 2001 rebate also point to the importance of directing the rebate to households with low incomes and with fewer liquid assets in the study by johnson parker and souleles households with low incomes were estimated to have increased spending by more than the rebate while middleincome individuals spent less than 20 households with few liquid assets also increased spending more7 another study found that households with lower credit card limits or who were near their limits or used their credit cards intensively increased spending the most8 the joint tax committee study9 discusses some important administrative issues surrounding cash rebate

package proposal that included business tax cut in the form of reduction in the corporate alternative minimum tax and an acceleration of rate reductions failed to achieve passage in 2001 in 2002 bill was adopted and the centerpiece as far as tax provisions were concerned was temporary twoyear provision for bonus deprec iation this provision responding to concern about lagging business investment

extended through 2004 among the business tax incentives temporary investment subsidy should have the most bang for the buck10 by directing the subsidy at investment the stimulus does not provide windfall for existing capital by making the provision temporary there is an incentive to make investment now rather than later nevertheless study of the effect of temporary expensing by cohen and cummins at the federal reserve board found little evidence that bonus depreciation was effective in stimulating investment 11 they suggest several potential reasons for small effect one possibility is that firms without taxable inco could not benefit from the timing advantage in treasury study knittel confirmed that firms did not elect bonus depreciation for about 40 of eligible investment and speculated that the existence of losses and loss carryovers may have made the investment subsidy ineffective for many firms although there were clearly some firms that were profitable that did not use the provision 12 cohen and cummins also suggested that the incentive effect was quite small largely because depreciation already occurs relatively quickly for most equipment reducing the user cost of capital by only about 3 that planning periods may be too long to adjust investment across time and that adjustment costs outweighed the effect of bonus depreciation knittel also suggests that firms may have found the provision costly to comply with particularly because most states did not allow bonus depreciation study by house and shapiro found more pronounced response to bonus depreciation given the magnitude of the incentive but found the overall effect on the economy was small which in part is due to the limited category of investment affected and the small size of the incentive13 their differences with the cohen and cummins study reflect in part uncertainties about when expectations are formed and when the incentive effects occur one issue that these studies do not provide insight to is the desirable length of time to allow the temporary provision if the time is too long the provision is not very effective because the stimulus may be delayed but if it is too short firms do not have time to make adjustments cohen and cummins also report the results of several surveys of firms where from 23 to over 90 of respondents indicated bonus depreciation had effect on the timing of investment spending overall bonus depreciation did not appear to be very effective in providing shortterm economic stimulus it is possible however that stimulus during current times when losses are not as large as they were in 20022004 when the economy was already in recession could be more successful 10 these issues are discussed in more detail in crs report rl31134 using business tax cuts to

proposal to eliminate taxes on dividends in 2003 eventually proposal that reduced the tax rates on dividends from ordinary rates to 15 was adop ted as temporary measure reduction in the top capital gains tax rate from 20 to 15 was also adopted while the provision was based on grounds of boosting the stock market and stimulating the economy this provision would not on theoretical grounds be considered an effective short term stimulus short run stimulus must increase spending if it is to be effective and for tax reduction that increase must be either in consumption or investment however dividend tax relief is not likely to increase consumption spending because it tends to accrue to higher income individuals who are likely to save it it is not an effective investment incentive because it benefits savers not those directly making investments and the translation from saving to investment would actually be contractionary in the short term thus although the provision was advanced as short term stimulus provision it is unlikely to be as effective for this purpose as other alternatives 14 and the congressional budget office study does not discuss it15

package included an individual tax rebate unlike the 2001 rebate this rebate provided for refundability for taxpayers with at least 3000 of earnings social security benefits of veterans benefits it also included bonus depreciation of 50 for one year some preliminary evidence has been reported on the 2008 rebate although aggregate data do not show rise in consumption to correspond with the rise in disposable income these simple aggregate observations may not be very informativ in preliminary study of households broda and parker found that 20 of the rebate was spent in the first month 16 they predict that the 2008 rebate will have significant effect on spending in subsequent months their study also found higher levels of spending for lower income households and those with fewer liquid assets 14 for more complete discussion see rl31824 dividend tax relief effects on economic recovery longterm growth and the stock market by jane g gravelle 15 congressional budget office options for
