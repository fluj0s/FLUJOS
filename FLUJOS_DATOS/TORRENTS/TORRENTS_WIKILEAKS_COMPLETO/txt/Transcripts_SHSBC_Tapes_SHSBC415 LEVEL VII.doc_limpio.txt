level vii lecture given on 23 february 1965 note as yet tape of this lecture is available outside the c of s these notes were prepared by student of the shsbc and are the only record we have to date of this tape 1 lrh just returned from spain to england the people turned out to tell him msh goodbye when they left he visited the canary islands and did research there 2 certain things are else turning up i got good long distance look at everything i did research and i cracked level vii 3 i havent run level vii i havent finished level vi yet but one day i took look and saw something over there and that was level vii 4 talk about being right how right can you get level vii of course is the 8 dynamics 5 and we are right back at the beginning 6 and you run them out and its not experiential track and its not hard to do in fact its so easy to do im having hard time not doing it 7 i know i ought to finish level vi first note in 65 level vi was the cc and other types of implant basics such as gpms ews etc level vii was the ot levels all 8 i felt my stomach turn cold as ice somatics chasing all over the body etc but i felt like kid who asked for lolly pop and got an icecream factory 9 ive got it all taped its patterns and actions etc it only took about 45 min after i had seen it to get it all down its not very complicated 10 you could probably run out level vii in 2 or 3 sessions 11 to make myself more clear it is the ancient question of are we one or are we individuals i told you someday we would have to solve that well thats solved 12 and whats this stuff boom boom boom he pounds on the lecture table there isnt any thing much beyond this 13 i found out you dont have to destroy the mest universe to get out of it 14 it is an individual proposition 15 it appears to be collective proposition but it is not it is an individual proposition 16 you can go ahead of it in time back of it in time out of it it can still be there you dont have to destroy it you dont have to destroy it for everybody that was one of the things i was little bit worried about 17 if i ran out the mest universe would it be there for everybody else it seemed it would be bit of an overt 18 well you can run out the mest universe and it is still there for other people 19 you dont have to be in it and you dont have to not be in it 20 but thats level vii 21 he tells story about how the psychs were wrong again they say animals dont commit suicide but bear there in the zoo who they wouldnt let hibernate went apathetic and sick and climbed to the top of the cage and dropped onto the cement floor and killed himself 22 he tells of columbus house museum there with relics from his first voyage to america he left via there and came back via there and left animals for zoo 23 he then welcomes the new students 24 he warns against listing on level vii on gpms 25 he tells them the road is wide open on level vi because he is putting up the rack of gpms the time plot for cc 26 r6ew and so on is not about to fade and go the student is for the 1st time on solo and it will take him some time to get used to that 27 if he cannot get tone arm action on r6ew he has business at the level he is auditing 28 hes got worries ptps hidden standards etc the book of case remedies etc so hes got business at the level 29 so at that point you can put him back to lower levels book of case remedies etc there is process that is barred out just because hes been on r6ew does not spoil any lower level process so he can be brought back up the bridge properly till he is there casewise 30 but if you carry on past r6ew into gpms when he is not ready for it he would run just enough to get smeared into it then he would get stuck and you couldnt run any process that had words in it 31 he could be fished out of this but it would have to be delicately done because he is in over his head 32 he is wandering around as pc in the reactive bank and to pull him out with junior process becomes difficult thing 33 that is what can happen in r6 34 so i always run very heavy pilot right where i can straighten it out right up close 35 so that is the main problem in r6 36 if i dont keep this closely under supervision why some one might try to get lower level cases to run it for quick buck it has already happened results in series of catastrophes for the pcs 37 r6ew puts somebody into level vi and gets him accustomed to solo audit and find out whether or not he can take it without actually getting him into the middle of the reactive bank 38 it r6ew will be around long time it is amusing and gives lots of cogs 39 gives example of how confront comes up by running r6 at first one lock on gpm can produce whole illness then later you can blow 16 end words by inspection 40 the gradient of confront come up thru r6ew r6ews sixes and r6ewp plot 41 one the end product of ot is attainable that becomes quite obvious on practical basis two it is attainable with the processes of ew ew6 ewp regardless of running the gpms themselves 42 you can get to the state of just noticing the bank and it blows not what is the item and where does it fit but just look at it and it blows 43 this is blow by inspection 44 the bank becomes so weak in command value that this can occur 45 so auditing plenty of ew will weaken the bank its command value its aberrative value and its ability to cause physical reactions 46 you are becoming cause over thing which before you were the total effect of 47 in the future we will just use r6ew to see if the person can solo audit and if he is ok then open up the real line plot from the top down cc platens today 48 the probability of any solo auditor colliding with the actual accurate plot cc is so negligible as to be neglectable 49 it is true i have had people giving what they thought the plot was for about year and they are pretty wrong 50 you could probably attain blowing of the bank on long few years auditing of r6ew s p 51 but we are looking at about 3 months of intensive auditing to clean ot 52 but when you get up to ot you will find yourself still in this universe 53 you are cause over matter energy space and time yes but in this universe 54 it is not absolute because you still have 8 dynamics and there are 7 dynamics flanking the 6th dynamic 55 it really should be level 8 if there are 8 dynamics but you will find out you are only handling 7 of them you have got the other one squared away handled ie dynamic 1 note later he wrote about clears you are clear on the 1st dynamic 56 so what happens when you dont have reactive bank well we have never assumed otherwise than that the person would be in the physical universe with reactive bank 57 his next bank of course is the physical universe 58 you could describe it as such and it is such the universe of trolley cars buses brick walls and mount everest that is the next bank 59 i notice nobody gets out of it they can even kick the bucket and they are right back in it again 60 he describes science fiction stories that have been written about other universes but really they are just this universe with time warp or something in it you dont go from this universe to another universe when you run this compulsion to have physical universe bank out there just isnt one why do you need bank anyway 61 you can think much better than the bank can i assure you particularly after you find out to your horror what is in the bank and what its trying to do 62 thetan is basically good so he made bad bank because everybody else was bad and if they all had bad bank they wouldnt do all these bad things its backwards to what anybody would think it is too incredible for words 63 so we see this in auditing person run out part of his bank or discharges it and he gets along better he is more effective he loses nonoptimum conditions like asthma jitters nervousness screaming fits etc he can operate better 64 so when the whole bank is gone he will be terrifically effective and he is hed never dreamed how really effective he is 65 now apply the same reasoning to the mest unvierse and you have got it answered 66 psychologists today preach that people have to have their neuroses to keep sane what would they do if they werent crazy well you could get into the same frame of mind about the physical universe what would i do without it 67 it is what the hell have you got one for why do you have to have road for example when you can just have road if you want to it is more interesting game to just be able to have without all the complications of have to have effort maintenance taxes etc to keep this road there 68 guy would have to be completely in apathy to want to have complete universe laid out for him all the time randomity very dull 69 it is like animals in zoos at five oclock the keeper is coming to feed us we have to have that 70 all we have to do is sit in this cage and at 5 oclock the keeper will feed us and if we werent sitting in this cage we wouldnt get fed at 5 oclock 71 that is actually the logic thetan uses to account for the mest u and his bank he is security happy he is in complete apathy about doing anything himself 72 what would happen on earth as an example if the sun suddenly started moving backwards west to east without any geological cataclysm or it got to noon and went into spiral for while could you imagine what would happen out there in the streets 73 they would go frantic why because it has destroyed their certainty and their predictability 74 why have this much predictability suppose the sun just stays at 10 oclock till august hey bill you forgot to move the sun that is your hat oh 75 or you forgot to fill the ocean hey who is responsible for filling up the ocean this week 76 oh we dont need an ocean we want desert scene this week 77 what ocean the pacific what pacific ocean the physical univ pacific ocean oh you want to see that one then go look at it i cant ive run it out 78 then you say if everyone else has it mocked up then what happened to it the truth of the matter is it never was there it never is there it never will be there 79 but everybody has got it there 80 yes you can go on having it there seeing it etc and you can experience it and you can undoubtedly alter it 81 but if you think of varying or altering mest why pick on the physical universe mest vary and alter your own mest you could vary and alter phys u mest and it could affect other peoples perception of it and they would be bothered by it to the degree that they were aberrated by it to the degree they were overwhelmed by the bank phyubank 82 you wonder why 8c works it is cousin level vii not level vi 83 examples evol of science theory logic people get better by reading it why it keyed out some level vii case for them 84 example subjective process gain is because it handled some level vi case or charge 85 for years we have had subjective and objective processes 86 note level vii is really subjective too but you have to do weird trick of logic to see it that way 87 subjective processes or think or figure processes arc sw for example take locks off level vi purely mental mest masses subjective process keys out bits of the reactive mind 88 an objective process is level vii process to familiarize and accustom person to his physical universe bank physical mest 89 the person 1 out of 15 who wont develop comm lag or go to cogs on 8c or objectives but just keeps doing the process apparently perfectly but with case gain is being run on too high level process it is not real to him it is level vii process and it is too high is over his head 90 other people do get real gains on 8c objectives they have walls up against their faces displaced walls etc nobody knows how the physical universe looks to anybody else 91 these are people who have different physical universes there you find them mostly in insane asylums the insane are not all subjectively insane some are objectively insane there is not something wrong with these cases minds it is not giving them wrong view it is something wrong with their environment their vii case not their vi case 92 case like this might have time warp and have out there in this environment different time with matter energy space to fit that time 93 it isnt in here pointing to his head that is wrong with that case it is out there it is not an introverted error it is an extroverted error 94 locational 8c where is the indicated object will produce remarkable results on this type of case 95 when you run spot the location of that problem you are also running level vii 96 ptp can be level vii one if its with location i am in trouble at the bideawee biscuit factory maybe the pc is still in the factory which is 5 miles away from the auditing space so of course he cant make case gain until the ptp is handled as he is not there in the session 97 children can be outside playing while apparently in the class room they have such desire to be out there they put out there where they are so are not really in the class room so cant learn anything they are not putting the class room there because they dont want to be there also they dont mock it up too boldly as you might see it too and catch them 98 you have to get the child into the class room before you can teach him therefore locational processes are very good 99 it was level vi that ruined creative processing because creative processing is level vii processing and only slightly touches level vi it is the exercise by which he creates things but what booby trapped it was that his bank would get more solid his level vi bank 100 also the bank is full of the word create so it would add to the bpc 101 so the pc would address the process creative reactively to level vi and it wont work properly unless addressed at level vii so level vi boobytraps level vii people ask why i dropped creative processing well you only have to see one pc go green as his bank solidifies and you say the devil with it this doesnt work on everybody 102 it was too dangerous that one out of the hundered it didnt work on so i scrapped it it will make clear however because it will move vi out of the way in most cases and make him just clear and there in the physical universe it kind of bypassed vi 103 it was thetan exercise not mental exercise that straightened out his out of controlness of making the physical universe 104 the win on creative processing ep was to stabilize his compulsion or aberration about making the physical universe into the basic automaticity of making it 105 he was aberrated on the subject of being aberrated on the making of the physical universe so it would take the aberration off of the basic automatic aberration and he would feel fine he was still crazy but now was happy to be crazy yes he was unhappy about being crazy and now he is happy about it 106 the higher you get on the bridge the more you know about the background that was why when i got the reactive bank taped i was able to go back and do 0 iv grades with great accuracy 107 now having come to grips with vii and seen it was there i have to finish vi before i can tackle vii 108 but i attempted to run it before finishing but it turns on horrible somatics if i begin to do so so i just go ahead and finish vi 109 if i try to suppress it that isnt so good either so i run the suppression off and get on with vi 110 the net gain here was to get another look at the bank and to realize that all the time there were these two approaches to the bank the subjective and the objective 111 there are two things you can address significance and mass and now you can address those in two ways you can handle then subjectively and objectively 112 so you get the significance mass subjective and the significance and mass objective 113 if you say that is door it is the significance and mass objective 114 if you run process say whats in the room is asking for significance and mass objective it handles the penchant the thetan has for putting the physical universe out there 115 i keep saying physical universe because there is one keyed in but really there is all eight dynamics out there 116 it is not just the 6th he sees flowers it is the 5th it has got name form an apparent purpose relationship to other dynamics significance and it has mass energy space around it mass 117 so any wrongness about flower or case is right over there where it is it 118 you see there is another bank set of significances on masses in here pointing to his head meaning the individual putting attention on the flower but it has to do with behaviour and attitude this is the subjective bank and these values are of the wildest and craziest sorts and directions 119 his behavior attitude is regulated by the subjective process 120 and his observation and perception is regulated by the objective process 121 also his ability but this is regulated by both types 122 examples he gives an example of person who cant go out of houses he is afraid etc now there are 6 gpms which account for the subjectively but suppose you run those out and he still cant go out of houses happily well he has got something wrong objectively and has lost the ability to mock up the outside of house over there and thus be outside of it 123 so he keeps making the inside of house around him 124 on poltergeist who can make objects fly around or has it happen in his space use objective processes not subjective it is an outofcontrolness in vii 125 cross roads process by the way is have havingness runs level vi and level vii simultaneously 126 since have is also in the r6 bank it runs vi and vii and some people it works well on others require special kinds of have processes and some it doesnt work on at all they cant run 2 levels simultaneously not clever at all joke 127 if it is too steep or they cant run it then just dont run it that is easy run pure objective or pure subjective 128 if you cant get can squeeze you could find out it is subjective attitude behavior or objective observation perception and handle accordingly that is is his attitude about the universe wrong or has he got wrong universe 129 these are your sole notes on this i havent written it up yet except for some exact notes 130 prepchecking works on the subjective case but also could be used on pt objects with pt doingness commands thus it could become objective eg suppress the typewriter unsuppress the typewriter the typewriter itself may start doing something 131 you have to exercise the pc thetan in relation to the pt object for objective processing 132 try this on something really aberrative like fire eg reach the fire wdraw from the fire what ok gradient heat up the fire cool off the fire then reach the fire wdraw from the fire pretty soon the guy is happily putting his hand in the fire and taking it back and not getting burned after process flat the auditor asks how did you do that pc says i never reached into or put my hand in hot fire i only reached into cold one this is of course purely theoretical we havent run it just an example 133 i dont know what would happen if you put thermometer in the fire would it only be cold for him or for everybody it is only speculation at this point 134 i have seen lamps move and other strange things in processing which i didnt fully understand till now i was running an objective process and spatial relationships would shift etc 135 each level should have bit of objective and subjective in it to keep pcs vi and vii case in valence of reality as he goes up 136 find 2 spots in the body and 3 spots in the room is an objective process because the reactive mind is not in the body 137 the reactive bank is thing it has got muchylooking electronic masses pictures and locks etc associated with it 138 and the physical universe is thing mest and all the dynamics 139 that is what we mean when we say our universe the other fellows universe and everybodys universe there were 3 universes out there 140 we used to speak of the reactive bank as his universe but it is only part of it he has his own mest other dynamics in it too 141 we are right up to the point now of disintegration of matter this will be all found out in level vii whether it vanishes for him only or for everybody 142 all these strange phenomenalike yogi is good yogi if he can levitate you have heard all this trick nonsense and kid game stuff this is the level we are looking at 143 all these questions are going to be answered like what is plant is it part of another thetan is there somebody who keeps his eye on this stuff what do i mean by i 144 the 7th dynamic is not the same as the reactive bank there is an erroneous wrong statement in earlier material it says the bank is responsible for the physical universe 145 that is wrong the truth is it is the thetan which is responsible for the physical universe 146 the thetan is responsible for the physical universe and not via the reactive bank 147 just because he is mocking up gpm with time in it is not the reason he has time 148 this occurs at level vii and is direct action time that is the level vii aberration it is time not having gpm that makes time 149 now there is state of mind and set of agreements at level vii which is not the gpm bank and that state of mind keeps one fixed into the belief that there is physical universe and keeps one fixed also into the belief that everybody has one bank and one universe in common 150 it is the kinks in the thetan that bring about his belief in the oneness of everything 151 any way you should distinguish between objective and subjective processes and judge which to run based on observation of the pc at lower levels 152 one thing you step out of when you go from level vi to level vii is aberration because of past experience the objective case is right there and you work with it directly without any reference to his past experience with it 153 the aberration doesnt stay there because of past experience the past may be there but the aberration wont be there it is in pt 154 the compounded buildup of aberration vanishes at level vi your aberrations on vii are all in pt there is basicbasic on it 155 so you were in train wreck yesterday so what it doesnt influence your condition today 156 it would be pretty hard for person through level vii to figure out how to be aberrated because of some past incident yet this is the aberration you face all the time in level vi 157 he gives several funny examples 158 you feel tired now because you were up late last night how do you do that put last night now broaden time i cant understand it what is this funny game you are going to get confused if you keep doing that this is how it would seem to vii 159 what is obvious logic to humanoid is illogical to an ot 160 you cant be right and be human 161 what bugs lot of people in research is they get case advances they dont maintain an objective observation viewpoint but get subjective cog and stop 162 but i had to pull myself away from auditing it to finish level vi like good boy because one else is likely to find the exact plot of cc platens 163 in other words i am doing exactly what i am advising others to do in general dont start the next level till you finish the one you are on 164 but you are approaching the level of all the conundrums puzzles of life you dont have to even be that informed they just shake out appear easily as you do level vii that is good thing 165 but it doesnt mean that you are not interested in participating anymore it gets more exciting more pleasure out of existence 166 because it is not kicking you in the head anymore you are cause over it 167 but i have got to finish vi and i have got the whole of vii staring in the face so when i walk out that door i will have to take hold of the knob laugh 168 thank you very much
