directions for preparing epoxy mix tures and make all required preparations for application before mixing the epoxy epoxy mixtures will normally begin to setup and become difficult to work within few minutes after mixing section i introduction 1 purpose and scope this manual is restricted to external fuze gagging this manual provides data base from which gagging p rocedure andor materials for particular procedure can be selected th number of methods and materials for gagging is extensive so attempt is made to cover every one 2 general gagging is term used in explosive ordnance disposal eod to describe the immobilization of movable components such as plungers spring mechanisms gears cams etc of fuzing systems the intent of gagging is to prevent additional fuze arming or to render safe mun ition fuzes encountered may be intact or damaged exposing internal mechanisms which if disturbed may function the fuzing system as designed keep gagging techniques as simple as possible for the most part it is ft to the ingenuity of the person performing the gagging procedure the mater ial used for gagging is usually chosen from that at band gagging is at best temporary measure providing an additional degree of safety for the tra nsport of hazardous ordnance section ii description 3 movement the term movement has several connotations s used here it is mechanism that provides or transmits motion only fo rms of direct action are considered in external fuze gagging these can be rotational sliding or combination of both examples of combined mo vement are cam eccentric and hinge actions cam converts rotational m ovement into sliding movement movement can be stopped or blocked or the energy generated by motion may be absorbed some materials can absorb the energy of movement resulting in slowing stopping or lowering it to safe level however physical blocks are usually used to restrict th space necessary for movement arming vanes can be blocked with wir or tape arming vanes usually require locks or wooden chocks to prevent t heir movement safety pins are normally used to lock movable components in place 4 materials many materials can be used for gagging th choice of material depends upon the potential force to be gagged streng th of the material and the availability of materials however physical propert ies of the material will normally determine if material is suitable for gag ging some materials that may be used for gagging operations are wooden wedges paper clips cotter pins wire tape leather and canvas belts nails pop dental stone masonary water sealant rapidset epoxy glue water mud rock and even chewing gum in summary if the material is available and it can do the job use itfor official use only for official use onlya plaster of paris pop pop has been used for moldmaking f or many years it obtains its strength from the formation of i nterlocking needlelike crystals of gypsum when gypsum rock is crushed screened an d heated threequarters of the chemicalbound water is removed from the gypsum to form pop when water is added to pop crystals are f ormed heat is produced and slight expansion takes place pop is hydr aulic that is it can harden set under water the hardness of pop is cont rolled by its consistency ratio cr cr is the specific component weig ht of plaster and water maximum temperatune generated by pop is at final set b rapidset epoxy this epoxy compound has approximatel seven times the strength of pop some advantages of it over pop are i t is easy to employ it has high strength without being brittle it rapidly reaches set rigid state and it has good adhesive properties rap idset epoxy is composed of two parts resin and premixed hardeneraccel erator after mixing equal parts of resin and premixed hardeneraccele rator by weight an epoxy is formed it changes at room temperature fro m liquid to gel in approximately 3 minutes after l5 minutes the epoxy is hardened and is as resistant to deformation as is pop after 120 minutes of cu ring it will cure at temperatures as low as 0 degrees celsius 32 degr ees fahrenheit epoxy is essentially fully cured 1 hour fter mixing cure times are temperature dependent table 1 the epoxy curing process releases heat and produces maximum temperatureapproaching 173 d egrees celsius 343 degrees fahrenheit when epoxy heat is absorbed by an external heat sink fuze body or water reaction mperature seldom rises above 50 degrees celsius respiratory irritants and should be used in adequate ventilation and with skin and eye 122 degre fahrenheit all components of the rapidset epoxy are considered skin and p rotection section iii external gagging procedures 5 general when using liquid composition that must cure set or harden keep test sample to determine its set time this sample sh ould be taken from the same batch and have an approximate volume f that used in the gagging procedure when possible keep the test sample u nder the same environmental conditions as the gag 6

containment containment is usually associated with l iquid gagging techniques to contain the liquid attach some form of cofferdam to the munition this can be accomplished by cutting the bottom or sides out of pa per or plastic styrofoam cup or by improvising with the use of plastic bags tin cans ca rdboard boxes or jars can also be used support cofferdamscontainment vessels or tape in place keeping in mind that final weight will increase natural contaimnent materials such as sand or dirt may be used however it may be required to line with plastic or prewet the dirtsand so that water from the pop mixture will not be absorbed 9 mixing warnings wear goggles and rubber gloves and avoid breathing ep oxy fumes during all mixing and application operations epoxy in the eyes could cause b lindness epoxy and the unmixed components are skin and lung irritants and can cause systemic poisoning when inhaled or when absorbed through the skin do not remain in the area while pop or epoxy is curing pop and epoxy release heat when curing caution follow manufacturers directions for preparing epoxy mix tures and make all required preparations for application before mixing the epoxy epoxy mixtures will normally begin to set up and become difficult to work within few minu tes after mixing use clean containers for mixing bowls cans jars or zip lock bags can be used manufacturers instructions should be followed when usi ng unknown compounds always pour the pop into water and mix to desired consis tency depending on the flowlike properties desired and the situation at han d the mixing ratio or consistency ratio of water to pop will determine the curing time an d also the strength of the set mixture of 40 parts water to 60 parts of pop will provi stronger and more uniform set than 5050 mixture of water and pop ie for strong set use less amounts of water to pop the addition of 3 to 4 percent of potassiu m sulfate to the water before adding the pop water before adding the pop will also decrea the curing set time of pop salt will also decrease the set time of pop and reduce the chance of the mixture freezing in cold weathertable 1hfor official use onl for official use
