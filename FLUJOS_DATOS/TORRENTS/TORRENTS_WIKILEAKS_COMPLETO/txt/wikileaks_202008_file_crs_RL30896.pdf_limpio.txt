under the agreement which was signed in july 2000 and requires congressional approval the united states pledged to extend conditional normal trade relations status to vietnam thereby significantl lowering tariffs on imports from vietnam in return for hanois agreement to enact wide range of marketoriented reforms congressional discussion over the bta is expected to highlight vietnams labor rights situation topic that has become contentious part of the trade debate in recent years the bta itself does not specifically address workers rights the evolution of vietnams labor rights regime has been heavily conditioned by the tension between maintaining political stability and promoting economic development two goals that often conflict on the one hand vietnamese workers are not free to form their own independent unions all unions must belong to the vietnam general confederation of labor vgcl an organ of the communist party analysts have observed that the absence of true right of association in vietnam has impeded the improvement of labor rights in other areas collective bargaining agreements remain the exception rather than the rule vietnams doi moi renovation economic reforms launched in 1986 have been followed by surging urban unemployment and rise in child labor forced prostitution and the trafficking of women and children workers in all sectors of the economy are often exposed to dangerous unhealthy and in some cases impoverished sweatshop conditions rapid economic expansion corruption and shortages of funds training and personnel have made it extremely difficult for government authorities to enforce vietnams labor laws on the other hand since the launch of the doi moi reforms worker rights have made substantial progress vietnam rejoined the international labor organization ilo in 1992 and since then the government unions and local groups have intensified their cooperation with the ilo and other international groups comprehensive and detailed labor code was passed in 1994 among other advances it recognized workers right to strike there is evidence that over the past decade the vgcl and its memberunions have become more assertive particularly on matters relating to wages health and safety development tolerated by the government by many measures the coverage of labor laws the tolerance of wildcat strikes the slowly increasing clout of grassroots unions the relative openness of debate over labor issues there is evidence that the vietnamese labor rights regime is more flexible and responsive than its chinese counterpart this

report on human rights practices 2001 march 4 2002 march 2002 conversation with aflcio official 3 this section is based upon separate conversations with molisa state department and labor department officials in early march 2002vietnams labor rights regime an assessment most recent developments overview in the year since this report was published in march 2001 vietnams labor rights situation appears to remain fundamentally unchanged the vietnamese ministry of labor invalids and social affairs molisa has spearheaded tripartite revision of vietnams 1994 labor code the revisions are due to be debated in the national assembly in april 2002 from what is known about the revisions they are likely to help improve working conditions at the margin through such measures as streamlining vietnams cumbersome administrative procedures and expanding the countrys social insurance system notably the proposed revisions to collective bargaining requirements outlined below appear to signal the governments recognition that organizing at the grassroots enterprise level needs to be further encouraged and facilitated however by themselves the revisions are not likely to significantly help the vietnam general confederation of labor vgcl establish its credibility in the rapidly expanding private and foreigninvested sectors by law all official unions will still be required to register with the vgcl many workers in these sectors see little benefit in joining the official umbrella labor organization which traditionally has focused on providing social activities rather than pressuring employers for improved wages and working conditions1 one result is that some workers have formed unofficial ad hoc labor associations to push for better conditions in their workplace thus far the governm ent appears to have tolerated and in some cases even encouraged this development however these associations are scarce unprofessionalized and are not permitted to register officially the agreements they negotiate with employers2 revisions to the labor code3 in 2001 the vietnamese government accelerated its efforts to substantially revise the 1994 labor code which forms the backbone of the countrys labor rights regime the drafting process has been led by fourperson team headed by molisa official and including representatives from the ministry of justice the chamber of commerce and the vgcl the committees staff includes representa tive from the national assemblys social affairshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30896crs2 4 state department vietnam country report on human rights practices 2001 hereafter vietnam human rights report 2001 march 4 2002 5 march 2002 conversations with molisa officialscommittee the ilo and western business groups principally the ho chi minh branch of the law firm baker mackenzie have also commented on drafts of the revisions in june 2001 the drafting committee presented its revisions to the national assembly which is expected to begin debating the measures when it reconvenes in april 2002 for the first of its semiannual sessions number of factors have motivated the vietnamese government to initiate major labor law reforms first when the labor code was drafted in the early 1990s the vietnamese economy was largely planned one dominated by stateowned enterprises now that the foreigninvested and private sectors together account for an estimated 50 of industrial output the government has found it necessary to adapt its labor rights regime accordingly in particular hanoi wishes to expand worker rights in and perhaps government oversight over the private sector where an estimated 30 of employees are unionized the proposed revisions to collective bargaining requirements outlined below appear to be recognition that organizing at the grassroots enterprise level needs to be further encouraged and facilitated second vietnam has found it needs to bring many of its labor rules into compliance with the national treatment obligations of the newlyenacted us vietnam bilateral trade agreement third perhaps motivated by chinas entry into the world trade organization the government is attempting to attract more foreign direct investment by simplifying administrative procedures for instance the revisions eliminate the current requirement that foreign invested enterprises hire official employment services to recruit and hire vietnamese nationals finally in preparation for the gradual ending of the welfare role that stateowned enterprises traditionally have played the government realizes the need to expand its social insurance program under the revisions vietnam would create new national unemployment insuranc program that would be funded by contributions from the government employers and workers currently employers are expected to provide unemployment payments to laidoff workers the right of association the labor code revisions will not change the requirement that all unions must be recognized by the local office of the vgcl on the positive side unaffiliated and therefore unofficial labor associations continue to sprout up in some private sector enterprises and in occupations such as cooks porters and taxi motorcycle and cyclo drivers the actual number of these associations remains unknown though the state department puts their number in the hundreds4 the vgcl and the government appear to be continuing to tolerate these groups activities perhaps because they are not perceived as threat for the first time some highlevel molisa officials are privately acknowledging the existence of unofficial worker associations5 however the associations remain unprofession alized in that they appear to be unstaffed and it is unclear whether or how they receive any financial support furthermore because they are not officiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30896crs3 6 state department vietnam human rights report 2001 march 2002 conversations with state department and aflcio officials 7 state

departments 2001 human rights report implies that collective bargaining practices have continued to make inroads in vietnam particularly in the foreigninvested sector in some regions the continued development of competitive market for skilled labor is helping this process7 in the past vgcl officials have called the labor codes dispute resolution process overcentralized and inflexible if the new labor code revisions are passed the procedures for negotiati ng and registering collective agreements will be streamlined presently such agreements must be approved by local authorities before they can take effect under the revised guidelines agreements would take effect immediately bilateral textile agreement during the congressional debate over the bta many members urged the bush administration to negotiate bilateral textile agreement soon after the bta came into effect such an agreement would set quotas for vietnamese textile exports to the us which are expected to dramatically increase the preliminary stage of the negotiations began in late february 2001 with us special negotiator on textiles david spooners get acquainted trip to vietnam the vietnamese government reportedly has been reluctant to enter into negotiations arguing that the two sides should not set quotas until the pattern of usvietnam textile trade under mfn rates becomes apparent the us has significan t leverage on the textile issue however not only does vietnams textile industry which employs approximately 25 of the countrys industrial workforce need access to the us market but also the us could unilaterally impose quotas on vietnam at any time because hanoi is not member of the wto some vietnamwatchers in the united states report that the vietnamese government and textile officials are considering urging the countrys textile and apparel manufacturers to obtain sa8000 certification to become more attractive to western importers obtaining sa8000 indicates that an

in january 2001 the organization has deepened its involvement in upgrading the countrys labor rights regime the ilo currently is implementing seven national projects and eight regional or subregional projects the most significant of which is multiyear program to strengthen implementation of the labor code molisa solicited the organizations input on major revision to the labor code reforms to the

on the measure within 90 sessiondays should congress approve the agreement the president would then be able to extend conditional mfn treatment to vietnam through waiver under the socalled jacksonvanik provisions of us trade law such mfn status would be conditional because it would require annual presidential extensions of the waiver which congress could disapprove labor rights and trade agreements congressional debate over the bta is expected to highlight among other items vietnams labor rights situation9 the bta does not specifically address workers rights in the late 1990s many nongovernmental organizations ngos launched high profile campaigns charging that american clothing and footwear multinationals owned or subcontracted with factories in the developing world including vietnam that tolerate poor health and safety conditions do not allow the freedom to form or join independent unions employ children andor pay insufficient wages in particular the campaigns singled out the vietnamese plants linked to the nike corporation which in recent years has emerged as one of vietnams top exporters these labor rights campaigns which continue today have intensified the long running debate in congress and elsewhere over whether promotion of workers rights in other countries should be linked to trade policy10 those in favor of making this linkage argue that the failure of companies in developing countries to adhere to worker rights standards not only deprives workers of their basic human rights but that it also places some american industries at competitive disadvantage in trade suppresses wages in the united states and shifts employment opportunities to developing countries furthermore many labor advocates contend that international trade agreements can encourage countries to relax their domestic labor laws in order to help their firms become more competitive during the 1999 world trade organization ministerial meeting in seattle which was disrupted by largescale protests over issues such as worker rights president clinton pledged to place higher priority on linking labor rights and trade free trade agreement the us signed withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30896crs6 11 see crs report rl30652 the usjordan free trade agreement by joshua ruebnerjordan in 2000 for instance commits the two parties not to weaken their existing labor standards11 opponents of making the linkage argue that free trade helps to empower workers and promote the rule of law thereby promoting worker rights and that mandating international adherence to labor standards with the threat of trade sanctions for violating those standards is form of protectionism that can dampen worldwide economic growth for all nations furthermore opponents contend that trade agreements are not the proper place to address labor standards purpose scope and organization of this report this report examines the totality of vietnams labor rights regime from the right of association to wagerelated issues it is divided into six main sections the first provides general background of vietnams recent political economic and legal history the second provides an overview of vietnams labor rights regime including description of the present international regime for protecting labor rights vietnams relationship with the international labor organization ilo and the us labor department and vietnams labor code the following two sections provide detailed look at vietnams law and policy in six areas of labor rights the right of associationcollective bargaining forced labor including trafficking in women child labor including trafficking in children health and safety wages hours and welfare benefits and discrimination the penultimate portion of the report provides some international context by contrasting the vietnamese and chinese labor rights regimes finally the report concludes with discussion of the impact the labor rights debate could have on congressional consideration of the usvietnam bta note about sources comprehensive analysis and detailed information about labor rights in vietnam are difficult to obtain particularly when operating under tight time constraints news reports about labor activism are scarce and the vietnamese government has only recently begun to compile comprehensive information about labor conditions across the country as the ilo has noted one of the major problems in vietnam is lack of statistical and systematically collected information on labor relations correspondingly the english information that exists is scarce tends to be anecdotal and tends to focus on conditions at factories owned by or linked to western multinationals in contrast to larger countries like china and india vietnam has slipped under the radar screen as far as countrywide studies of worker rights are concerned the most comprehensive uptodate reports that are available are in the state departments annual human rights report on vietnam even these documents however rely heavily on anecdotal evidence and incomplete information that often are compiled by the vietnamese government this report will be updated as more information is obtained

vietnamese forces defeated usbacked south vietnam in 1975 reunified vietnam has been struggling with how to maintain balance between two often contradictory goals maintaining ideological purity and promoting economic development for the first decade after reunification the emphasis was on the former by the mid1980s disastrous economic conditions led the country to adopt more pragmatic line enshrined in the doi moi renovation economic reforms of 1986 under doi moi the government gave farmers greater control over what they produce abandoned central state planning cut subsidies to state enterprises reformed the price system and opened the country to foreign direct investment economic developments for the first decade after the doi moi reforms were launched vietnam became one of the worlds fastestgrowing countries averaging around 8 annual gdp growth from 1990 to 1997 agricultural production doubled transforming vietnam from net food importer into the worlds secondlargest exporter of rice and thirdlargest producer of coffee the move away from command economy also helped reduce poverty levels from 58 of the population in 1992 to 37 in 199712 substantial portion of the countrys growth was driven by foreign investment primarily from southeast asian sources most of which the government channeled into the countrys stateowned sector the economy has staggered since 1997 however as real gdp growth fell to 58 in 1998 and 48 in 1999 though it did rebound to 67 in 2000 foreign direct investment plummeted to 600 million in 1999 the lowest level since 1992 observers have cited vietnams failure to tackle its remaining structural economic problems including unprofitable stateowned enterprises weak banking sector massive red tape and bureaucratic corruption as major causes of the countrys economic slowdown in recent years the asian economic crisis that erupted in 1997 only exacerbated these systemic deficiencies unemployment has risen with some sources claiming that it has more than doubled to over 2 million since 1997 demographics are compounding the economic difficulties over half of the population is under the age of 25 and over 1 million young people are entering the work force every year13 with the partys legitimacy increasingly derived from providing economic growth rather than ideology vietnams leaders are under enormous pressure to find work for these new entrants rapid growth has transformed vietnams economy which has come to be loosely divided into three sectors the stateowned the foreigninvested and the privately owned which make up

of the 1990s vietnams foreigninvested enterprises fies were among the countrys most dynamic15 since the 1997 asian financial crisis the private sector has also made impressive gains to the point where privately owned firms employ nearly quarter of the workforce most of the giant stateowned enterpris soes meanwhile are functionally bankrupt and require significant government subsidies and assistance to continue operating in 1990 25 million people were employed by state firms in 2001 this figure is down to 16 million16 despite its significant economic gains vietnam remains an overwhelmingly poor country about onethird of vietnamese children under 5 years of age suffer malnutrition per capita gross domestic product gdp is estimated at 370 equivalent to 1850 when measured on purchasing power parity basis17 political developments vietnams experiments with political reform have lagged behind its economic changes new constitution promulgated in 1992 for instance reaffirmed the central role of the communist party in politics and society although personal freedoms have increased dramatically hanoi still does not tolerate signs of organized political dissent in subtle ways however the decision to prioritize economic development above ideological orthodoxy has led the party to slowly loosen its former stranglehold on political power recognizing that party cadres often were illsuited to administering its own policy directives for instance the party created more powerful and professionalized executive branch in the 1992 constitution the new constitution also gave more influence to the legislative branch the national assembly because the party realized it needed to make the organs of government more responsive at the grassroots level rapid economic growth increased integration with the global economy and weak domestic institutions have caused rise in corruption and decline in the vietnamese communist partys vcp authority alarming many party hardliners as result vietnamese policymaking in recent years has been virtually paralyzed as reformist and conservative elements within the party have battled to stalemate over how to deal with the major economic and demographic forces transforming the country the former group calls for steady rollout of new reforms and increased integration into the global economy the latter fears that economic reform will lead to the loss

meant that these divisions have produced only piecemeal economic reforms though impleme nting the bta may force more significant changes many observers believe the upcoming 9th party congress to be held in the spring of 2001 is unlikely to break the gridlock in the near future vietnams legal regime after launching the doi moi economic reforms vietnamese leaders gradually established new legal regime both to implement the reforms and to attract foreign investors18 the 1992 constitution gave the national assembly the authority to pass and amend all laws which are supplem ented by decrees issued by vietnams executive ministries and agencies since 1987 vietnam has produced hundreds of laws and decrees dealing with wide range of subject areas including labor law many of those laws have been poorly drafted they have already been amended several times because of their incompleteness or lack of enforcement provisions the weakness sometimes found in vietnamese laws may be explained by the fact that since the countrys legal regime was neglected during the decades of war vietnam has shortage of trained legislators lawyers and legal experts also because vietnam embarked on marketoriented economy relatively recently it lacks expertise in many areas related to the new system such as management economics banking finance taxation and labor as result some laws were drafted by people without experience either in law or in the relevant specialized subject area this situation however has been improving in recent years overview of vietnams labor rights regime vietnam and international labor standards the international labor rights regime the international labor organization ilo is the united nations specialized agency with the mandate to monitor labor standards and protect workers rights since its inception in 1919 the ilo has adopted 183 multilateral labor standards as conventions or treaties which are binding on countries that ratify them eight of these conventions which deal with freedom of association the right to collective bargaining prohibition of forced labor discrimination in employment and certain conditions of child labor are considered core labor standards19 in 1998 the ilo members adopted the declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work through this resolution they agreed that these eight conventions contain principles which all the ilo member governments should adhere to whether or not they have ratified them they also agreed that all members would be regularly examined for compliance with the corehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30896crs10 conventions or standards since the 1970s some us legislation that provides trade benefits to various countries such as the general system of preferences has required compliance with internationally recognized labor standards by us trading partners except where us national interests require waiver the eight core ilo labor standards are the standards generally accepted by congress for us trade legislation though the ilo has enforcement powers it has highly regarded supervisory system to investigate and evaluate compliance with the conventions and technical assistance program to help countries bring their legislation and practices into compliance since the creation of the world trade organization wto the united states including many in congress and some of the industrialized countries have pressed for the inclusion of labor standards in multilateral trade agreements andor the wto many developing countries have opposed these efforts vietnam and the ilo vietnam has been member of the international labor organization ilo off and on since 1955 rejoining most recently in 1992 therefore efforts to bring vietnam into compliance with ilo conventions and planning for technical assistance programs in vietnam did not get underway until the early 1990s since 1992 vietnam has ratified 15 conventions including three of the ilos eight core human rights conventions 100 equal pay for men and women for work of equal value ratified by vietnam in 1997 111 prohibiting discrimination in employment 1997 and 182 prohibiting the worst forms of

in the early years ilo programs in vietnam focused on employment strategy human resources developme nt enterprise development industrial relations social protection occupational safety and health and labor law as of the year 2000 the ilos program in vietnam is being shaped as it is in all countries to address the four new ilo strategic objectives 1 promoting fundamental principles and rights at work 2 creating greater opportunities for women and men to secure decent employment and incomes 3 enhancing the coverage and effectiveness of social protection and 4 strengthening the organizations which support labor and business interests and social dialogue the number and size of ilo programs in vietnam has grown progressively since 1992 during the 19992000 time period there were 24 ongoing

bound by labor contracts drafted with input from the ilo the code appears to be loosely modeled on french labor law in terms of its comprehensiveness its 198 articles and 17 chapters cover labor contracts collective labor agreements working hours and holidays safety and sanitation protection of special groups of workers such as women children older employees workers with disabilities foreign workers social insurance and the settlement of labor disputes the code also included provisions on the states responsibility to create training and work programs before the code was promulgated vietnam had issued many separate legal documents covering different aspects of labor law the labor code invalidated only those regulations that were inconsistent with the code thus some older laws such as the 1990 law on trade unions are still in effect21 the labor code applies to all types of businesses and industrial enterprises foreign and international organizations and individuals who employ workers22 provisions of this law also apply to foreign and vietnamese workers who work in vietnam and to vietnamese citizens who work overseas trade apprentices and domestic servants also are covered by the code however the code does not extend to vietnamese or foreign workers governed by provisions of an international treatyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30896crs13 23 labor code articles 24

invalids and social affairs hereinafter ministry of labor or labor ministry which is the ministry responsible for implementing the labor code and other related legal documents24 the labor code was passed after heated debate within the union movement the communist party and the government the dispute spilled into public view to such an extent that copy of the draft of the code was published in vietnamese magazines when the code was finalized the unions had scored number of victories including the explicit guarantee of workers right to strike the requirement that trade unions be established in all enterprises not just those that are stateowned the unionization of foreigninvested enterprises and the inclusion of provisions establishing minimum wages maximum working hours maternity leave and overtime pay25 enforcement implementation and enforcement of vietnams labor laws are major problems vietnamese monitoring agencies face shortage of qualified staff training mechanisms and funds as result most vietnamese workers and employers are unaware of the provisions of the labor code for this reason international sponsors includin g the ilo and the us government have funded many programs to enhance vietnams monitoring and enforcement capacities implementation has been further hampered by large major backlog in drafting decrees and bylaws to support the code26 additionally there have been allegations that since the 1997 asian financial crisis vietnamese authorities have relaxed their labor law enforcement in the textile and apparel sector where wage cheating and occupational and

ratified by 137 countries though not by vietnam nor by the united states the convention establishes the right of all workers and employers to form and join organizations of their own choosing without prior authorization and lays down series of guarantees for the free functioning of organizations without interference by the public authorities30 vietnam has not ratified the ilo convention on freedom of association and protection of the right to organize however as an ilo member it is expected to adopt and enforce ilo right of association and collective bargaining standards vietnamese law and practice there is true right of association in vietnam as with mass political and religious organizations vietnamese labor unions are allowed to exist only if they are under communist party control

that greater enforcement and speedier procedures are needed the number and intensity of strikes which are permitted under the law is on the rise although the majority of these walkouts have been

by writing into contracts prohibitions on 7day work weeks in some cases the increasingly competitive market for skilled labor is helping this process58 the vietnamese government while stopping short

and minimum age on nov 2 1990 and apr 28 1999 respectively102 marketoriented reforms foreign investment and international trade have contributed to high rates of economic growth and significant reductions in poverty103 however economic reforms have given rise to an urban unemployment rate of an estimated 8 to 13 percent and frequent labor demonstrations in older industrial areas where many stateowned enterprises are going bankrupt rural underemployment and an urbanrural income gap of over 2 to 1 has compelled an estimated 120150 million rural migrants to flock to eastern cities in

chinese government has chosen to keep the unions under tight rein105 as in vietnam chinas trade unions are essentially organs of the state and are subject to communist party control article 35 of the prc constitution guarantees freedom of association but that right is limited given that unions must belong to the partyaffiliated all china federation of trade unions acftu the labor law and the trade union law provide in general for the right to organize and participate in trade unions article 7 paragraph 1 and article 3 respectively but unlike the case in vietnam that right is not protected under the constitution and independent labor unions are illegal in china106 chinese leaders who preside over larger and older industrial sector than the vietnamese and whose economy is undergoing extensive structural changes deeply fear the rise of national labor movement similar to polands solidarity the communist party became especially vigilant after the spring of 1989 when workers in beijing and other cities formed autonomous labor unions and joined students who were demanding political reform after the military crackdown in june 1989 the tiananmen square incident the party purged the acftu chairman and several other union officials for allowing their members to join independent labor activists and students demonstrating for democracy many labor activists were arrested and sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 years107 unlike vietnams labor code neither the trade union law nor the labor law of china explicitly requires the establishment of trade unions the trade union law only states that trade union may be set up with minimum of 25 members article 12 paragraph 1 the acftu claims 103 million members of total workforce of approximately 740 million over 500 million of whom

october 2000 currently monitors the condition of 35 imprisoned labor leaders who it claims represent only tiny minority of labor activists and trade unionist in prisons and labor camps in chinaalthough they share similar socialist roots the roles of the acftu and the vgcl have begun to diverge whereas the vgcl has begun to evolve along the western model of an advocate for workers rights for instance the majority of acftuaffiliated unions appear to function primarily as social organizations and as resources for unemployed workers laid off due to soe restructuring109 vietnamese industrial unions which some argue are growing in importance appear to have considerably more autonomy in joining international trade union organizations for instance than their chinese counterparts which are far less important than enterprise unions likewise chinas enterprise unions have less autonomy from the party than in vietnam although they are officially encouraged to protect workers rights and to supervise management enterprise union efforts are often hampered by communist party authority in the factory and local union federations which in turn are under the effective control of the local party affiliate110 unlike vietnam the right to strike in china is in state of legal limbo there is provision in the chinese labor law granting the right to strike nor is there any constitutional guarantee of that right nonetheless the prc government has acknowledged that many spontaneous strikes and demonstrations do occur the number of officially recorded strikes soared to more than 120000 in 1999 14fold increase in five years111 some experts have estimated that labor protests mostly against lost jobs and benefits withheld wages and pensions and corrupt management practices occur almost weekly in rust belt areas where many older uncompetitive stateowned enterprises dominate the economy reported instances of relatively spontaneous and isolated strikes and demonstrations have not indicated that workers were arrested for their activities however in many private enterprises and foreign owned companies using migrant labor workers who strike reportedly are fired beijing has not tolerated acts involving longterm autonomous labor organization combined activities of workers from different enterprises unapproved labor publication s and other antigovernment acts112 since the late 1980s numerous attempts have been made to establish independent unions the government has persistently arrested or detained most activists involved in these efforts one exception appears to be the governments treatment of migrant workers who in 1999 began to form semiautonomous village labor unions on the outskirts of some cities to represent their interests in

remuneration work hours rest days and holidays safety and hygiene insurance welfare and other matters article 33 in october 2000 the ministry of labor and social security issued specific measures on collective wage negotiations115 dispute settlement procedures are similar to those of vietnam mediation arbitration and filing of lawsuit in peoples court labor law articles 7783 but as one scholar points out collective contracts are relatively meaningless without the right to take collective action116 as in vietnam most chinese workers enter into individual contracts with their employers chinese laborers bargaining powers are limited by unemployment pressures inadequate enforcement of existing laws and chinese government policies that forbid the formation of autonomous labor unions health and safety chinas labor law states that employers must implement state standards for occupational health and safety educate laborers about occupational health and safety and prevent accidents

guaranteed minimum wages article 48 beijing does not set uniform minimum wage but lets local governments determine their own minimum wage standards chinas per capita income is about two to four times that of vietnams 800 in nominal terms 4000 in purchasing power parity terms the state department reports that these wages are usually sufficient to provide decent standard of living for worker and family120 in some larger cities the minimum wage for factory workers is about 38 per month roughly the same as minimum wage levels in vietnam however according to one study average wages for workers in beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen range from 175 to 300 per month121 according to another study by uschina trade group wages at us factories in china were on average more than twice as high as wages for comparable jobs at chinese stateowned enterprises122 chinas labor law has rules on work hours and vacation time but they are not as detailed as those in the vietnamese labor code in 1995

labor the chinese labor law stipulates criminal responsibility for persons who compel workers to operate against established rules and under unsafe conditions if major accidents and serious consequences result article 93 like the vietnamese labor code which prohibits ill treatment of workers the prc law prohibits employers from using violence intimidation or illegal restriction of personal freedom to compel laborers to work such acts are punishable by means of detention fine or warning if they constitute crime criminal responsibility will be pursued article 96 item 1 unlike vietnam the prc uses forced labor as method of punishment for criminal and for socially disruptive actions the former is referred to as reform through laborthe latter is termed labor reeducation labor reeducation in particular has been harshly criticized by western governments human rights organizations and the united nations125 in 1992 and 1994 the united states and china signed memoranda of understanding on prohibiting export trade in prison labor products but their implementation remains problematic there have been many reports documenting the export of products in which some stages of assembly were subcontracted to prisoners who received payment126 generally speaking chinese law prescribes harsher punishments than those in vietnamese law for crimes of trafficking in women and children the prc criminal law prescribes punishments for stealing babies or infants for the purpose of extorting money or property not less than 10 years imprisonment plus fine or confiscation of property for abducting and trafficking in women or children between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment plus fine or confiscation of property and for buying an abducted woman or child not more than three

16 and 18 are prohibited from performing certain types of physical labor until recently the ilo and unicef maintained that there was not significant child labor problem in china particularly in the formal and exportoriented economic sectors129 however the decentralization and privatization of the economy has produced widening income gaps breakdown in social welfare services and greater opportunities for crime and corruption stagnating rural incomes rising fees for school and family financial crises coupled with deteriorating social welfare systems have compelled some poor rural parents to send their children to work130 according to the state department the chinese government publicly maintains that the country does not have significant child labor problem and unlike vietnam

authorit ies and taking children from destitute parents by promising to find them work that will provide large remittances134 it has been speculated that some child prostitutes in thailand were trafficked from minority areas in southwestern china explaining the differences between vietnam and china what factors account for the apparently stronger labor rights regime particularly the greater union independence and assertiveness in vietnam vis vis china the vast differences in physical and population size between the two countries has played role with less than tenth of chinas population vietnam may be more dependent on the outside world both politically and economically if so vietnamese leaders therefore are likely to be more sensitive to prevailing international norms regarding labor rights which may explain why they have aggressively engaged the ilo and the us department of labor in recent months despite sharing similar leninist political structures relations between labor and the state in vietnam and china have followed different paths some analysts argue that vietnams union movement was strengthened by the countrys division and its civil war for over twenty years vietnam was divided into communist north and capitalist south giving vietnam recent capitalist legacy and labor autonomy that china lacks strikes and other militant labor actions for instance were frequent occurrence in the south in the north decades of war prevented the communist party from imposing the same degree of authoritarian control over the union movement compared with china135 additionally for variety of structural and historical reasons the vietnamese communist party does not seem to have been as authoritarian as its chinese counterpart vietnams experiment with economic reforms was enacted later and has been far less extensive than that in china beijing has had to deal with far more social disruption than has hanoi perhaps making chinas leaders more sensitive to permitting union independence for instance vietnamese leaders also have not confronted regimethreatening political experience similar to the tiananmen protest movement in the spring of 1989 in the months before the demonstrations chinas acftu at all levels had pushed for more autonomy from the party as part of its crackdown against the protests the government squelched the acftus assertiveness136 however although vietnamese unions and laborers possess greater freedoms to advocate for workers and express grievances than their chinese counterparts progress in labor rights and

in china which may in turn undermine labor rights additionally for all the differences between vietnam and china most rights and freedoms in both countries stem not from the law but from the discretion of the party despite the differences between the two countries many labor freedoms and rights in vietnam are still vulnerable to changes in state policy since vietnams labor code was adopted in 1994 it is still being implemented and interpreted conclusion implications for the bta the state of vietnams worker rights conditions has become part of the debate over whether congress should approve the vietnam us bta which does not contain provisions that explicitly deal with labor rights the linkage between labor rights and the bta would have become even more contentious if the bush administration had followed up on its proposal to bundle the bta into broadbased trade bill that would also include usjordan free trade agreement and new negotiating authority also known as fast track or trade promotion authority for the president to negotiate new multilateral trade agreements137 workers rights along with environmental conditions will likely be prominent in the debates over both the jordan agreement and trade promotion authority they are also likely to loom large in the debate over the merits of bilateral textile agreement which the us and vietnam are likely to negotiate in the next year many proponents of linking labor rights and trade agreements have argued that congress should not pass the bta until vietnams labor conditions improve further138 some labor rights advocates contend that globalization occasionally has weakened vietnams labor rights regime in the textile and apparel industries at times textile multinationals and industrialized governments have pushed the vietnamese government against the wishes of the vgcl to relax its enforcement of certain provisions of the labor code139 other labor rights advocates argue that while congress should pass the vietnam us bta it should do so only after the signing of textile and apparel agreement that includes conditions on labor rights along the lines of the provisio ns of the cambodiaus textile agreement140 that agreement which was signed in january 1999 is designed to reward improvements in labor rights with increased access to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30896crs36 141 january 20 1999

standards and cambodian labor laws141 opponents of linking the vietnam us bta to improvements in labor conditions contend that obtaining mfn status will indirectly help improve vietnamese labor conditions by promoting economic development they argue the bta will provide vietnamese workers with more opportunities increased knowledge and improved means to promote their rights foreign investment which is likely to increase if the bta is passed is also thought by some to raise working conditions generally by bringing in multinational corporations that pay higher wages and have better health and safety conditions than do local enterprises finally supporters of unconditional passage of the bta argue that the agreement will improve labor rights by promoting the rule of law in vietnam for instance they point out that the bta requires vietnam to publicize in advance most businessrelated laws and regulations move that should enhance the transparency of the countrys legal
