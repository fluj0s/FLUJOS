shsbc307 ren 337 17 sep 63 what you are auditing what you are auditing lecture given on 17 september 1963 based on the clearsound version only thank you well i know i shouldnt be talking to you this week as matter of fact youre getting extra lectures well thats so that at any moment i can do bunk you see but theres so much data going by and were in the middle of summation some of you are departing and i wanted you to get good rundown on this because were dealing with pretty summated picture now and unless you have good aspect of how this is assembled why you might have some trouble with cases all right this is what date audience seventeenth what date audience seventeenth of september seventeenth of september how did we get up here seventeenth of september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now your the picture of pc is what were interested in were interested in the total concept of what you are processing and this is very important because it can now be summated with great accuracy the idea of oldtime psychotherapy has been ah well forget it you know haha you know they used to use camels to carry freight you know and ox carts and things of that character well those were practical because they would still be of some use but oldtime psychotherapy has use or value to you of any kind whatsoever and you can just forget it we make very clean break now weve always gone along on the foundation and formation of some early work of this material the historical value of it is interesting curiosa curiosa of an electric shock machine you know the curiosa of when you were very young you thought sexual thought so now youve had it that if you talk for four or five years to somebody he can then tell you at the end of that time what second dynamic shock you had in this lifetime that accounts for your whole difficulty you see i mean man this is something like shooting bb guns you see at the uss missouri i mean its just about that level of comparable magnitude you see the only thing we can say for them is they tried and they made some interesting popularizations and amongst those was the fact that something might possibly be done about it so we cannot discount their hope or interest factor in the matter or the fact that they made man aware of the fact that mental condition existed but when you take it when you take it to that point you have taken it all the way taken it all the way now in dianetics we talked about the mental image picture very interesting we have that whole technology surviving today under the heading of r3r its of considerable interest r3r is of great interest to be able to lay your hands on an actual facsimile or an engram on pc that has never seen one just merely by getting its proper date and then getting its proper duration and there he is running the thing and that sort of thing that was an outstanding problem of considerable magnitude and that problem got wrapped up in r3r and r3r however as far as the actual therapeutic value is concerned is well i dont know shooting rifle at battleship because youre dealing with free track and free track is relatively unaberrative if you can run any engram on somebody why it wasnt terribly important its value value interest cure psychosomatics with it momentarily or temporarily or even permanently you can alter physical condition with it and so forth and you say well these things should not be gainsaid well they shouldnt be gainsaid unless youre dealing with the idea of order of importance or order of magnitude because this is still just rifle against the battleship this is free track this is the problem of free track you could probably run free track for years without producing an ot and horribly enough without producing clear but its part of the tools of the auditor and it gives him view of the bank it gives him view of experience it gives him the whole anatomy of traumatic experience has an automobile accident has crick in the back of his neck thereafter you run the engram and he doesnt have that crick in the back of his neck from an automobile accident she loses her husband this is considerable secondary you find the beginning of the secondary and you run this with r3r technology and just run that one engram you see not even finding its basic and she looks young again and alive this is miraculous or magical technology when it works and it unfortunately hangs one with great many sporadic wins and that is the trouble with it sporadic wins you take this guy you locate this engram you run it through he longer has psoriasis see its gone see see bang and take the next guy he scales all over and you run an engram and you run an engram and you run an engram and you run an engram and hes still got it you get the idea and your attention is still drawn to that magnificent job that you did back there at suchandsuch time in other words it sticks an auditor on the track with wins and any technology which does not uniformly produce wins and which tends to stick the auditor with some spectacular wins is dangerous technology because hell go on using the doggone thing youll see out in the field youll see somebody and by golly he he found out that you did some patacake as part of the cchs you know and he was doing this patacake with this little kid and this little kid couldnt talk and couldnt hear and couldnt this and couldnt that and he did some patacake with this kid and all of sudden bang on went the kids total perception and the kid was in marvelous condition thereafter and eventually became rhodes scholar you see this kind of thing you see and my god years afterwards youll find him sitting there in front of pc after pc after pc running this same pattycake it hasnt produced another result since see thats the danger of one of these big win techniques but r3r is marvelous training process if you can handle r3r and move the pc around on the track and that sort of thing and you get good insight into traumatic experience mental image pictures that sort of thing and its just very very very nice as training technology beautiful piece of training technology also has an assist value and an auditor should be able to carry off good assist hes got jones has just fallen off horse and has broken clavicle and you tie into it with r3r and all of sudden why the guys clavicle mends up and so forth if its going to so this is good assist level action good training good assist and as far as making clears and ots is concerned has very small value very very small value an auditor who can run it can call himself an auditor get the idea all right now lets take up much broader zone of action r3n the handling of implants the handling of implanted goals and the handling of implanted materials and lot of you have been worried about this because you kept asking yourself the question because these implants have an effect on us is this going to turn out that we were all implanters you see you keep on working wheres the overt see how come how come these things have any value at all on one if were all going to run these implants all the time whats all this about whats it about whats it about whats the relative value of all these implants well the exact value of an implant is that an auditor without an understanding of implant goals and implants and implanting can very easily get the pcs own actual track mixed up in them and if he doesnt have good grip on these things and know what they are hell keep walking around them like stray dog walks around another stray dog and he will always be confused on the subject this pcs got goal to be alone and you just an actual gpm see and we open up the meter on this guy and we say to be alone and boy that really rocket reads that man that really rocket reads thats very fine so we go straight to the implant area and start running line plot on it it would do the pc in or it wouldnt quite do him in or you wouldnt get tone arm action or you wouldnt quite know whats happening dont you see youre running an implant gpm when you thought you were running the pcs actual gpm now lets say it wasnt the pcs actual gpm but only an implant gpm and we start to run 3m2 on it the old technology of yesteryear see all complete all valid now we start running this we start running 3m we start listing see we start listing for his items they dont sound anything like implant items you see and we list these things and when we finish all the way up and down the line what do we find ourselves sitting there with horrors we have just run something that only exists as an implant gpm by crosslisting as you would do 3m2 and so have succeeded in spending lot of time and we now have collection of about thirtyfive or forty items or something like this sitting right in the middle of that engram and every single one of them is wrong item wrongly worded item amidst two hundred and thirty bypassed implant items and if you dont think that isnt going to take the pcs skull off so therefore an able auditor should have good training background on the subject of implant materials in the first place it gives him beautiful idea of rrs gives him lots of practice on meter reading gives the pc practice on the form of the gpm and furthermore the forms of those gpms are quite accurate even though their item titles are highly corny you get the idea theres nobodys got gpm ri thats got absolutably snuff in it see plooey you got such thing see so therefore if you couldnt if you dont know lot about implant gpms you wont learn anything much about the form of gpm and youre asked to sail cold in on 3m2 and do all of the mechanics of gpm on the pcs actual goal and so forth nervous about rocket reads nervous about this what is the form of the gpm what is this what is that what is the other thing do you understand now you start tying pc up in knots on his own actual gpms and youve got trouble you got lots of trouble and the implanters i dont care if it practically caved you in back along the track and certainly enough it did there is doubt about this at the time they occurred but i dont care how many implant gpms youve got this is beside the point this is beside the point they have practically aberrative value compared to the order of magnitude were discussing practically aberrative value yeah you can get tone arm action out of them but whats it do it opens up the track the little charge that you get off of these areas and so forth opens up the track sometimes so that you can find out pcs own actual gpms and an auditor who is well advised on the subject of implant gpms never gets the two confused hes always got sense enough to say all rightto be alone to be alone now is that your actual your own goal or is that an implanted goal oh that is your own goal that is fine now i but or i get read on both of these implanted and actual all right good now at this point he can take his choice although its of great value to run this implanted gpm if its that stuck in the pcs craw he of course has because of the research thats been done on it the line plot for that actual gpm and could sit down and he could run it out take session run the thing out now say is there an do you have an actual gpmto be alone clang got bigger read now see and sail in with 3m2 and straighten the thing out bingetybang do you understand audience mmhm yes that is the value of it its an auditors value to keep from wiping the pc off the face of the earth by running implant gpms with r3n r3m2 the technique for his own gpms you see and running his own gpms with implant gpms line plots unless an auditors got this fairly straight why hes sunk when you first start looking at this and your first considerations with regard to this are liable to make you practically faint but youll get over it very rapidly you say oh my god what have they done well what they did was this some eager beaver dug up the actual form of thetans gpm and the bulk of wordings that thetans use in forming up their own gpms took synthetic line plot and implanted them with it planted them with their own actual goal hoping they would hit some of their own actual goals if they implanted them with enough goals so you see you get thirty forty sixty goals see in the final aggregate youll find out that the pcs been implanted with in excess of hundred different goals and some of these many times see actually making the total number of gpms hes implanted with probably creeping up toward thousand well thats thats been very confusing that was very confusing to thetans when it was done but why only because it was parody and mockery on the thetans own actual gpm and tended to key it in and it didnt even successfully scramble it up although it was very hard on the thetan when this happened although it probably helped his demise end by making him sad about the universe and undoubtedly influenced his postulation of his next goal or some of his ris undoubtedly influenced all this sort of thing in actual fact the aberrative value of an implanted gpm is back in the rifle against the uss missouri class see value but with that in mind the implanter then did us great favor now i know it loused you up and it was hell see but he did us great favor he gave us training ground gave us training ground and you can run with the greatest aplomb any quantity of implant gpms and you can train up an auditor left right and center and hell now know what gpms kind of look like and what their anatomy is and how they go together and whats at the bottom of them and all of this sort of thing and what rocket reads look like and how the pc can suppress things you know he can get the whole thing taped without wrapping the pc around very many telegraph poles and theres any gods quantity of them can be found on case its hell trying to find the pcs own actual gpms but any quantity you could practically take any man off the street out here and ask him for the goal to forget and run it hed be very happy to have it run hell think this is really great stuff you can make it rocket read dont you see and so forth so that any group of students running implant gpms will eventually find out what gpm is like gpm looks more like the old bulletins on the goal to scream however with more items in them the original ones released look an actual one looks like that really bit more than it looks like an implant gpm because the implant gpm is being synthetic and so forth of course an implant gpm has application to the case his case has really never been upset about being absolutably snuck up on or something you see hes never really been worried about this at all youll find his item somewhere along the line sneak and when you hit this rocket reading own item see psssw you know and hell say yeah that that uh thats sure so that is true see youre hitting him right where he lives and you get this thing opposed and the meter goes bbzzzzrrmm and clank and bong and thud dont you see it got lots of action lots of cognition this is where he lives he doesnt live on that implant track he lives on the other track now anybody however whos had experience in running 3n the technique of running the implant gpm is going to make good headway and so forth with actual gpms and its very well worthwhile to get an auditor to run these before you put him on actual gpms why he can find them bang see he can run them bong he can get it wheeling he gets accustomed to handling the pc under duress in the midst of all this living lightning dont you see then he can turn around and go through the ardures of finding the pcs own actual gpm and then he lists that out on 3m2 just as 3m2 was last released faintest changes in it and theres your theres your case your case will really start flying now now the tone arm action this basic breakthrough of course all stemmed from discovering the value of tone arm action and how it is produced and the tone arm action lies in the actual gpm it is thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times more aberrative than an implant gpm unimaginably greater magnitude and its got action in it its got tone arm action in it but theres difficulties in getting to an actual gpm youve tried to find pcs goals thats sweat man thats miserable list and list and list and guess and hope and list and trying to get something to rocket read and waaahh and list and mess around and hope and thats it that now doesnt rocket read and ooohwhooooal and first place an implant gpm will rocket read few times and fold up an actual gpm will go on rocket reading for one awful long time it doesnt wear out you see but if youve ever tried to find goal on pc that rocket read then you know what i am talking about and it has been in the past an auditor heartbreaker so you could find implant gpms easily therefore it makes good training ground but to make the pc well and straighten him up youve got to find his own actual gpms and they exist they exist slightest bit different i mean the top oppterm is of course the bottom terminal more or less dont you see and the bottom opposition terminal which the pc started out as against the opposition terminal to the goal as an ri that bottom opposition terminal is what actually the pc himself eventually becomes in his struggle through this those those old gpms those synthetic patterns and that sort of thing are all quite valid nothing at all wrong with those things and youll get tone arm action theres where the tone arm action lives this is on the actual line but the big stumbling block was how did you get the goal how did you get the goal well this is not simple action but we have just speeded this up about thousand to one with what the service facsimile what is the service facsimile service facsimile is the top ri terminal of the pcs actual present time developing gpm and thats what we call the service facsimile its the top ri and of course in view of the fact that that gpm is evolving and he is sitting in an incomplete gpm usually truncated we call them we dont quite know which side of the fence hes on for this thing but we have there wideopen door to finding the pcs goal while getting tone arm action now we have to ask this question why was the pcs goal so difficult to find well it was difficult to find because present time bearing down hard upon that goal gpm all of its ris and in particular the ri of that gpm which lived in present time that present time ri kept the pc sufficiently overrestimulated that you had stuckup messedup tone arm and his rocket read is totally suppressed if you cant immediately find his goal do you understand that youve got matter of environmental auditing other things that i showed you the other day the various zones of restimulation in present time all of those things are bearing immediately down upon the reliable item and its accompanying opposition terminal the terminal and opposition terminal of the gpm as it lives in present time those are the last two items of the goal he is now living with and all of those things are in restimulation because of his own postulates that make up those things so he is doing something there dont you see and this present time environment comes down against those two top items with crash and everything stays gorgeously in restimulation your tone arm hangs up beautifully and the case goes nowhere in great hurry and that is the mystery complete additional cases or qualifications of it that is the mystery of the stuck tone arm and thats come right through and that is the service facsimile when you eventually find the totality of the pcs service facsimile you will be into the top or nexttotop ri of the current existing gpm there you are so therefore the action of finding the pcs service facsimile leads you directly and immediately into two things one into the gpm he is now sitting in and his rr on his own gpm his own gpms goal problem mass will now rr providing you unburden it now ill give you an example of this were doing service facsimile now im taking you very rapidly across great number of techniques probably youre catching up with these numerals one by one and little by little youll make it but heres the situation present time is hitting this guy bangetybangetybangetybangetybang and hes so overrestimulated he doesnt know where to spit and hes keeping himself beautifully aberrated with these stable data horses sleep in beds or something like that on the goal to ride and hes there he is banging away present time banging away at him and he frankly is so restimulated his top is blocked so that theres release of charge or confusion its just hung there its just hung there and hes just frozen in concrete dont you see present time is hitting him kicking his head in his present time environment is knocking his block off auditing might be right in on the top of it take the goal to leave you see with this present time ri of not permit anyone to speak to whats that going to do to an auditing session man you see and there it is and hes getting his head kicked off and hes kicking off everything elses head dont you see and there he sits there hes right there at the top of the line hes so overburdened and his case is so stuck up with all this restimulation that he wont rr and that goal is overburdened and that goal is so thoroughly overburdened the one he is actually in that if you find any goal at all you will probably find one down the track trillions fifty or trillions thirty or something like that see some vast distance back you try to run that one you of course are running the pc who is sitting in the present time gpm and youre trying to run him trillionsahundred down the track and his bank goes creeeak creeeak and you cant get tone arm action out of the thing because the present time restimulation is so great and of course all his backtrack charge is smashing him right on forward up toward present time you see hes running like mad and youre trying to run this goal back there to be you see oh brother you know nice hightoned goal and its all in restimulation its pressing him up against present time and so forth and his present time gpm of course is nothing as great as that you see its be something like not to be slimy or something see to n and there it is see all your present time restimulation is hitting this goal not to be slimy and its top oppterm and top terminal and youre trying to work this thing to be way back down the track at some unimaginable distance the length of the time track is our most is our biggest fortunately and not serious error but is our biggest error in scientology the length of the time track thats silly man you write trillion on the board hundred times and you have the medieval period write trillions on the board thirteen times and youve got modern life trillionsthirteen its nothing for gpm to extend over vast periods of time but here he sits up here at the top of the bank and there he is being run at some vast early distance and of course it doesnt answer any of his present time problems its totally unreal to him and the reason its unreal is his attention is pinned in present time and is being ordered to some vast earlier period of the track which is probably dichotomy of some sort on the goal hes stuck in and thats why hell come up with the other goal so its totally unreal to him you start talking to him about trillions of years ago and why hell hes worried about the fight he had at breakfast hes still trying to explain how come he always fights at breakfast see hes trying to explain this you see and you get the reasons why he doesnt like fortifications to exist well man he hasnt been fortification engineer for the last four or five hundred years its the last time he ever had anything to do with it see and the last time he could do anything about it or it was present time problem to him was maybe trillionsahundred so here he is worrying about that fight he had at breakfast and thats sitting on the goal not to be slimy and the only thing wrong with breakfast is the eggs were little bit firm because by this time of course everything must be slimy because hes gone to the top of the bank you see so youve got everything must be firm you see as one of his items so hes opposed to anything slimy you see or something wild is going on you see you see how far you are running him from his present time problem and yet you couldnt really find this top of the bank because its so overburdened and so thoroughly in restimulation that any rr discernible on it will be almost impossible to reach because its so overburdened with locks locks locks locks practically everything in present times lock on these things so he wont rr now ill give you an experience which is interesting r3sc finding the service facsimile of the individual just exactly the way youre going about it now fumble and punch if youre running this successfully you found out the pc would occasionally have needle fall and as the case went on in the next session or something like this happens fairly rapidly in the next session if youd been very observant you would have seen that needle accelerated when he had fall it accelerated but it accelerated on everything everything you were running youd get everything youre running see everything youre running now youve started to do some lists this is the next session another session see you started to do some lists and three times on that list as youre nulling it you see very sharp fast falls next couple of sessions youre nulling some kind of list and you see little tiny rocket reads on about four items and lots of steep falls but little little tiny rocket reads so you get more tone arm action running on his present time problems and that sort of thing you get some more and youre sitting there and all of sudden you see some gorgeous rocket read you see something just go ppsssswww actually youve merely reached in you havent necessarily reached the ri but you certainly reached lock on the ri and the bank is loosened up enough so that the pc can differentiate on rocket reads on his present bank now you do youre still working on service facsimiles and day or so goes by and youre doing this list and all of sudden you see to hide pppsssswwww hey you had goal rocket read you come back and you call it to hide pppsssswwww there she goes man shes really taking off give it to him again prepcheck it do something with it it always fires fires fires beautifully then you say is this an implant gpm read was this to hide implanted on you read is this something you actually made up yourself is this actual so forth ppppssswwww you say well well we have arrived somewhere but exactly where have we arrived exactly where have we arrived weve arrived within the last four or five gpms thats we can be sure of that the last four or five actual gpms now if you took off immediately and said thats very lowscale goal to hide you have underestimated the state were all in because of the immediate backtrack we havent postulated any hightoned goals to hide for several trillion years thats hightoned goal man now how do you get lower than hide well i think you can go down about twenty tone arm divisions below hide im beginning to see on the scale to never be caught anyplace and have nothing to do and to be vis unvisible any goals of this particular kind to be to never be found out you see to have nothing worth taking goes down to something like this to have nothing thats hightoned goal you see but to commit suicide to get rid of it to go insane not to be so slimy see to endure see that kind of thing youd be surprised how far south this can go so youre within the last five you can be fairly sure of that youve seen goal rocket read while searching for the pcs service facsimile youve tested it out and youve found that the pc actually has that as gpm you of course with vast enthusiasm wish to god it were the last gpm and the one right up into pt because how wonderful life would be if that were the case unfortunately you have guarantee of that whatsoever itll even read on the meter that its the last one and not be it thats quite interesting because you see its its apparently right there dont you see you got your paws right on it and actually the bank is so jammed and the gpms are so jammed up as they approach present time because theyre so much more susceptible to restimulation dont you see but it isnt it isnt the last one now that doesnt say it isnt always it always isnt the last one once in blue moon you might have little luck and after that become careless and wind pc or two around the telegraph pole before you got back to battery and sensible again but the thing to do with this to hide is lay it all out test it just the way i showed you see see use it anyway you can trying to find that as the gpm you see and then oppose it what goal would oppose to hide now you want your pc to be in pretty good shape at the time you do this why because hes just now going to be put through lot of mischief the last three or four gpms youre going to drag this pc through them what kind of condition do you think the pc has to be in in order to be dragged through three or four gpms of his own actual gpms bodily you want him to be in pretty good shape and you want the auditor to be fumble lets list this lets list this and lets find the next gpm and the pc will be sure and for moment or two you will be sure that this next firing goal that you get youll be absolutely sure you see that its it what would oppose to hide and thats going to be something wild or weird or peculiar like to have nothing worth taking you know and then youre going to be sure of it hes going to be sure of it in actual fact if you tried to run it youre going to come cropper because its probably not the present time gpm see so you be very careful about this and you try to list it up to pt with who or what would oppose not to have anything worth taking see who or what would oppose that now the probability is is youre either on it or right next to the present time gpm so you scout that one down real carefully whatever you found as result of that and the possibility is that youre on it if youre not on it do another oppose list and land in the present time area prove it out conclusively ask questions of the meter ouijaboard the meter make sure that this is it and the pc by this time has got lot of restimulated track behind him and hes probably very uncomfortable and hes been getting tone arm action like crazy it doesnt matter you see youve hit him you couldnt help but get tone arm action and now list for the existing highest or the latest terminal of the final goal you found not to be so slimy just list for that list for it and youre going to find it and you got his service facsimile and you realized if you look back over your records that you were walking right in the vicinity of it all the time anyway see it suddenly adds up lightning bolts go through the pcs skull from both sides you see yes yes yes yes oh yes yes as matter of fact if hes so involved in it he could also have this reaction to it if this gpm this last gpm the one closest to present time if this last one up has already run its gamut and is about hundred items deep and hes up close to the top of this thing not to be so slimy is to oppose sliminess or something you see hes going on the opposite side of it and hes on the opposite side of it hes in the camp of the enemy the terminal is now and the oppterm is slimy thing or something you see this thing has gone backwards because hes lived all the way through it when you start landing in the middle of this stuff you just run your 3m2 straight on from there and youll find out bamblamwhamwhambingbangbangbang pcs liable to be very sick and what i was going to tell you is word of caution the pc oh i dont think this could be my goal you see well hes in the opposite oppterm see couldnt possibly be my goal not to be so slimy ive always hated slimy things and i i actually couldnt possibly be it couldnt be my gpm dont you see because i just couldnt be because i always opposed the thing you see and its at that point where an auditor has to be very alert because the pc is in actual fact goes into almost total dramatization of the ri terminal he is sitting in and it may have at the top of the bank reversed itself so that he is now the enemy of his own goal and with that reservation and that realization you are running your service facsimile like startled gazelle and if it turns out not be service facsimile at all you just run it in 3m2 and you go pocketapocketapocketa down the bank and the best way to run it run one of these actual gpms little piece of data im giving you in passing and which you will hear again best way to run one is to list carefully for its top oppterm take what you get and run it down toward the bottom as accurately as you can without missing any more ris than you can help but just keep finding ris all the way to the bottom keep finding ris see find oppterms and terminals and oppterms and terminals and oppterms and terminals and try not to shoot off into some other gpm thats the only thing that can louse you up and get down to the bottom of the thing and youll get blowdown youll see those rocket reads going by man and that tone arm going down down down down down down down pssewpssewpssewpssewpssewpssewpssew that whole goal is look going to look like it exhausts and then you turn around and go back up to the top again go from the bottom now list it terminal oppterm terminal oppterm terminal oppterm right on up to the top again and youll get the 50 percent of the items which you missed on the way down and of course that thing will clean up like bell that is instead of trying to find every item perfectly as you go down just discharge the thing and on the way back up find the remainder dont qanda too much with whether or not it was terminal or an oppterm and youve made mistake so youve got to relist you know youre all wrong and the pcs wrong and the bank is wrong and dont get into that kind of monkey business because you can kill two or three sessions without finding yourself very many ris dont you see what you want to do is just pocketapocketapocketa as best you can get down to the bottom of the bank and get that thing blown in the first place you cant list it from the bottom up the second you put your paws on and try to list and find its opposition terminal to the goal as an ri you see to catch catfish down there at the bottom of course to catch catfish in real gpm is at the heart of every single ri which evolves from it so when you start listing that bottom and fooling around too much with the bottom you throw the whole top of the bank of that gpm into violent restimulation the thing to do is you see these things are laid in as theyre lived implant gpms are all backwards you see the top oppterm is the earliest thing but thats not true of an actual gpm so you list it all the way from the top down to the bottom turn around and list it all the way from the bottom up to the top making careful that you dont go further south than the bottom because now youll be in foreign gpm the only thing to be very careful of while youre handling these things the only thing to be excessively careful of is to not go finding ris for goals for ris for goals you dont have you know thats the old one thats the only thing that turns off an rr is youre running item after item after item after item after item after item after item out of the bank and you dont have its goal sooner or later that pcs rr is going to go off its going to close down your ta action will stop and so forth you recognize that you remember this from way back some of you audience yeah yes you mustnt run ris without having the goal thats just as important now as it ever was none of this old data has ever changed you see its still there all right whats interesting about this is that you are right now doing that with r3sc youre looking for ris for which you have gpm you got goal for these ris and yet that service facsimile is one so the question is only this how long can you go on looking for these service facsimiles without running into finding ris without finding the goal how long can you go your guess is almost as good as mine because youre shredding an ri up and chewing it up and because it applies to all present time and so forth probably extends the length of time you arent really just finding ri after ri dont you see and so forth but i would say the low side of the estimate well id say it probably is not safe beyond fifty hours and there might be pc or two around where it isnt safe after fifteen hours this is be careful but that phenomenon doesnt occur until goal some goal has begun to present itself so its not anything very dangerous providing you stay on alert for the pcs goals i told you when i first gave you r3sc when you see pcs goal rocket read write it down in big box over to the side for further investigation dont hide it anywhere in his papers see go right on running r3sc if that is what youre running dont you see but put that over to the side and put that in plain view so that can be investigated because all of sudden the tone arm action might cease and the thing what you want to do if the tone arm action suddenly and inexplicably ceased you go back and you pick up any rring goal the pc might find and lets go into one fast scramble to make sure that we have got ourselves goal and then lets oppose that goal and then lets oppose the result of that and make sure were in present time and now weve got the goal for the rr for the ris weve found and all will be well again so it doesnt do to go too long on r3sc you get why you can key it out you can do all kinds of wild things with it it probably ive just estimated it for you on the very very very supercautious safe side you understand youll probably hear of somebody in some field auditor and so forth and hes run it on hes run r3sc on somebody for five hundred hours and it hasnt disappeared yet see all right he trouble with it is he keeps getting these rrs all the time and they get in his way cant read the meter too well because the needle is always going like that you know that sort of thing but the point im making here is that we must be alert to this old rule now we havent seen any search on r3sc turn off any rrs or turn off any meter action weve not seen that yet but we know this other point we know we are looking for ris that are at the top of the gpm line and the action of looking for that ri all by itself could apply the old rule which we know to our bitter experience all youve got to do is start charging down gpm go past it go past the bottom of the gpm go halfway into the next actual gpm and all of sudden youve got rr youve got tone arm action youve got nothing pc is whooaa creeak you know ooooh horrible you know everything is going to pieces and so forth and possibly sometimes as we learned early on on teaching r3m2 one of the last things that the auditors at that particular time thought of was that they might have gone past the bottom of the thing and were already running out the next gpm thats practically the last one they thought of its just the pc never put the goal on the list dont you see so it never demarked well theres there is the score of what you are processing and there is just about the scope and limit of processing there isnt very much more limit to it but lets look at what this is all about lets look at what this is all about by using this type of analysis by using program of this particular type by recognizing this put together for what it is we have probably programed ot very well within reach i would say weve shortened it considerably because weve shortened all the difficulties of actual goal finding and that sort of thing but something else has happened something else has happened we have found method of straightening out pt which can be used actually at any time that you started to run into trouble at any stage of running any actual gpm you cant seem to be getting anyplace and things seem to be pretty grim and you mustnt immediately suppose that the old rule of finding ris without the goal doesnt apply you scout that one down first you see youve run out of pcs all restimulated youre not getting tone arm action everything is going to pieces and so forth well for some reason or other you now have condition where the pcs present time is in overwhelm as far as the ris hes currently sitting in so you could just go ahead with r3sc you see first you would examine to find out if youd been finding ris that you didnt have goal for thats the main one see and then you could go on find that goal and so forth but you could actually destimulate present time at any time by using your techniques as youre used in r3sc you could use any ri any terminal any oppterm you can do all kinds of wild things with these things you see and you can disenturbulate his pt and you could practically clear him at any instant during the time of taking him to ot and i know that sounds weird see what i mean given that youre not finding tons and tons of ris without having the pcs goal for it given that one horrible fact that one cared for youve run this fellow now for seventyfive hours and youve found one and onehalf gpms and thats the end of his seventyfive hours you see you unburdened his bank and you got it all got pt is all straightened out and youve got all of this first top one and so forth and this is lot of work you did you see and you got the half of the bank of the next one see and thats the end of his time well you could spend the last session or so trying to find the service fac for his present time environment just scouting out his present time environment of course any application the ris which he has now found you see any application they have to present time will cause them to disintegrate so youll get disintegration of the factors which are still hanging up in present time his needle goes very floppy and you can hardly set it up and its on the clear read and so forth and you could practically sit there and make clear out of it although hes only halfway through bank of course hes going to go creak and hes going to talk to you and hes going to persuade you and try if you could just get to the bottom of this next thing you see that would maybe take you another twelve fifteen hours just to get to the bottom of it not to clean it back up all the way up the time you see its something on that order and where youve got to sever it off youve still got you still got technique which is analogous to r3sc in other words you could make clear at any time you were making an ot and you can clean up his needle and his tone arm read at almost any time very valuable thing to know because if youve seen the agony some people get into running actual gpms you would realize that its well worthwhile to have technology which straightens them out as cases id to program such case i would just make sure if the case is sort of gummed up and in bit of trouble and so forth id make sure i hadnt been finding ris for which he we had goal make sure of that id give him nice bunch of arc break assessments id do big case analysis on the subject have we found any implant goals dont you see and thought they were your actual goals or have we run you see actual goals as implant goals or disentangle that have we skipped any gpms you know have we found lot of wrong items have we listed things backwards you know the stuff thats in your list do sort of case analysis along this line make sure he was all straightened out in that line and then id very eagerbeaverishly start in on rssc trying to find the service fac for his present time now and of course were going to find out hes now applying the goal you see and hes now applying the goal to fly or something like this to his present time environment and wed clear off lot of locks and wed get lot of pt action blue smoke comes out of both sides of the meter you know pc settles out and goes clear read and the case straightens up theoretically this is quite doable and if you got the other reasons out of the way why the case was gammy or feeling bad that i have just outlined to you more complicated than that you would then be able to apply your r3sc once more and you could bring about state of clear so your state of clear is bringaboutable at any time with this one proviso the most dangerous time to use r3sc is before you find the first actual gpm apparently the simplest and easiest time to find it and to use it you see is in actual fact the most dangerous time to use it because you actually are running at ris without the pcs goal do you understand so thats you can go at it with great aplomb i dont know how long itll go on i can also tell you that i dont know and theres reason to suppose it would go on more than an hour in some cases i dont want to scare you but in everybody so far addressed it has gone on for nice long comfortable time and isnt getting in anybodys road and theres sign of these difficulties appearing but by past experience theyre there to appear therefore it is very necessary that an auditor who is doing r3sc must sit there very alert to the rocket reading goal if he gets anything on list that rocket reads why he should mark it loud and clear see put big rr down after it something like this you see looks like the pcs goal if theres any discussion of it ensues of any kind whatsoever and thats very easy to have happen you see in r3sc mark it down pc thinks this is his goal put it over there very clear now if the pc can be kept insession lets talk now about not just somebody trying to clear lets talk about taking it from there youve gotten tone arm action established on this pc this pcs pretty comfortable youre gotten some of the aberrative factors out of the pcs environment so the tone arm doesnt stick up every time you sneeze and you got goal sitting there well youd better research this goal lets find out what goal it is is it one back or two back or three back or is it is it this or that or what should we do with it and should we oppose this goal and find goal thats little closer to present time and then find an what should we do with this goal lets search this thing out it isnt as easy as well that is the pcs goal lets list it see it isnt that easy see its the only goal you really dare run and this is what gave all pcs trouble is the last goal the one closest up to pt now knowing all those things youre going to go getting tone arm action your tone arm action there is residual on the long haul now its residual in the pcs actual gpms thats where the tone arm action lies now the very system that you understand as service facsimile applies to every ri and applies to every gpm the pc has and it is that system which has aberrated the pc that is the system which has aberrated the pc and all pcs have done this and theyve brought it all the way along the track and it arrives till now actually the service facsimile cum laude for gpm is the goal as an ri that is the big one and of course it accumulates to its subsidiary ris see reliable items are accumulated to this basic one and the whole of these in their associated pattern make up what we call goals problem mass and that mass is quite actual these ris are have diameter they have mass they have this they have that theyre all very much in the groove now what are the what are the symptoms of somebody running out of well youre running too many ris and you havent got his goal your ta action will cease and the needle ceases to rr now therefore when should you dive for the pcs goal and start this goals program what is the dividing line well unfortunately it isnt as easy as x unit and unit or something like that you see that isnt that easy its different its technical point its have you rehabilitated the pcs rr and you run service fac r3sc until youve got rehabilitated rr and then its going to be awful easy for you to find the goal now the question arises what is the exact progress of the case run on this particular scheme of things whats the exact progress of the case well you run case on the latest part of his aberration all the time that keeps his pt cleaned up by keeping his pt cleaned up youre then keeping him nice and calm and so forth he actually isnt going to develop any skills to amount to anything as an ot hes going to rehabilitate very slowly rehabilitation factor then is slow even and gradual it doesnt do roily coaster type of action youll get occasionally some guy will bang out of his head or something like this but thats just not of any vast importance what youll get is an increase of ability on steady calm progress front oh of course youre going to have your difficulties of you listed this thing backwards and you shouldnt have and so forth these are merely technical difficulties as you go along the pcs going to spend an awful time between session and session b because you skipped gpm when you were listing down you didnt get the next adjacent gpm you got the one after that and its going to make him quite miserable but your actuality here is that the pc is advancing as being in relationship to present time hes getting an expanding perimeter of present time but he is advancing with present time and therefore he is advancing to marked degree smoothly and calmly in regard to present time now this has two factors one of which is relatively unimportant you might not agree with that its unimportant but i rather class it in that sphere youre not going to get spurty fluky manics turning on and off and boy they can get more in an auditors road than you would think pc goes the most dangerous thing of them is not damage that the pc does but the pc goes tearing off in manic and this has been one of our main problems he feels so good hes so ambitious you see and he doesnt want any more auditing because hes going out and hes going to get busy you see and you know that hes going to take about three days to fall on his silly head well the reason for that is is youve dropped back earlier on the track than the reality of the pc see youre earlier on the track than the pcs reality goes this is very important factor if pcs attention is thoroughly in present time any effort to go backtrack of course brings about feeling of unreality theres slight unreality involved on this quite normally well now multiply this to fact that by taking him backtrack you of course are bringing his arc at lower pitch than it might be and he cant actually cope with the aberration which is being thrown at him and he goes into manics and he turns on somatics and he has bad time and he sits around all day worrying because he cant tear up all the pavement of m1 or something you get the idea now thats all totally and hundred percent simply because somebody is being run well over his head the dangers involved in it are negligible because hes so overwhumped that nothing very serious could occur but by taking him back down the track from present time all the time actually the past is present time see the past is being carved off in present time all the time dont you see and therefore the reality of the pc is continuously increased and you actually make the more important fact is is you wont be up against the hurdygurdy of restimulation and upsets and rawf and bing and bang the pc will be much more cheerful and you wont be up against these sudden manics you wont have any difficulty in this direction in actual fact it is very doubtful if pc could make it to ot unless you continually handled the application of what he was doing to the aberrative factors of present time the only danger in processing anybody up the line is somebodys going to get go into some big snit of some kind or another when hes about threequarters of the way through dont you see and he isnt up to it and that sort of thing well actually the i dont think i dont think you could keep him insession or push him in that direction or hold him in that direction long enough to make him to have enough strength to misbehave you understand it takes smooth run this thing requires smoother run dont you see what you want is an even progress chart and the way to do that is to take everything down as you go against the present time which the pc now has and youll get discharge of it and probably reduce this is the important thing reduce the number of hours of auditing by at least 50 percent cut it back from pt now weve been making mistake by going early and coming up toward pt its very hard on pc because all of the ris hes dramatizing are right in pt now lets say he goes back and he finds the goal to have lets say this guys been run and run and run and run and run and he goes back and he finds this goal to have all right thats way back see and there hes got this gpm to have and he gets into the top oppterm of the thing to have and he said its want nothing to do with nobody nohow see something like that see and hes against capitalists or something like this see or people who have things or something like this you see the thing is reversed youll find that the moment that he enters that level if you have peeled back the track all the way down smoothly to where he is youll find at that moment his thinkingness is colored by the ris he is sitting and confronting his thinkingness is colored by these things hell get up in the morning and hell look around and say well i sure dont need three pairs of shoes i could get along with one you know his thinking is colored in this particular direction well that means its directly discharging against pt so in actual fact your discharge against pt of course accelerates the speed at which it goes you neednt worry too much or youre not really concerned with the ethic level of the pc as auditors im just talking about you as your general attitude and opinion youre not worried too much about the power or strength or otherwise of pc you never have been but of course you are approaching you are approaching point where this will become of interest to you it will become more and more of interest to you and be reassured be reassured by the fact that an individual whose present time problems are not cleared away doesnt have very much power to do anything hes too involved and too enturbulated to exert any force or power in present time interesting datum isnt it doesnt even really fall back on ethics see it falls back on that restrictive fact why well hes sitting in couple of wild stable data of some kind or another and hes resolving everything and its all mixed up anyway so his power and his difficulties are terrifically restricted by his present time involvements and confusions and frankly pc ever really progresses beyond his present time problem thats in actual fact the secret of processing thats why particularly you can throw away the freudian idea that little girl was looking in the window of the boys room when she was three you see and has been aberrated ever since you see that had nothing to do with aberration why its back there now if you were running the ris formed at the time she was three and you had peeled back to them you would find the pc oddly enough sitting in the present time problem caused by the inability to observe nonobservation and noncommunication at any given moment during auditing the pc is introverted at the level of what is now in present time what is now live in present time on that the pc is introverted therefore his power is consistently continuously cut back to practically nothing consistently and continuously you see gradients work this way you walk out here and pick up one day you can pick up pebble and the next day you can pick up rock and the next day you can pick up big boulder and the next day you can pick up stone wall you get the idea youd think in auditing pc would move ahead on that gradient of ability pc will not move ahead on that gradient of ability person halfway through wont be able to pick up the pebble you mark my words and you watch it if you carry it all the way through to complete conclusion its when he gets all the way back to the other end of the line and all those things have sheared off against present time and hes got all those things straightened out and he hasnt become totally overwhelmed by it all and so on hes going to be three feet back of his head now ive had period recently of being up in the looking around and that sort of thing and i just got gorgeously confused with my present time problem and i frankly became so involved with present time problem it was present time problem to at that moment that i was like to wrap beams all around my head and i was yoyoing past the moon dont you see i suddenly couldnt hold position in space worth nickel i was very introverted on the whole thing i didnt quite know what my present time problem was i was trying to figure out what my present time problem was see present time problem of course was sitting right in the ri i was sitting in the odd part of it was it was present time problem see it was present time problem i didnt think it was and thats always the case with the pc it is present time problem its that the pc can perceive it is present time problem so all progress is measured on the pcs ability to perceive what is present time problem and on that you get measure of his forward progress and he gets present time problems which are years wide and tens of years wide and hundreds of years wide and thousands of years wide dont you see present time problem is the distance of one inch his forehead hurts dont you see to his room to his world in which he immediately lives that is to say you know back and forth the route to the office and that sort of thing to the planet to the this to the that to off of this planet to the confederacy to all of the various connecting links of all the confederacies to this universe to the lot of beings in this universe and to the formations of this universe to this to that to that thup thup thup its always the length and distance of the pcs present time problem it actually isnt even that is on his only measure of reach it isnt how far he can reach or how many stones he can lift or anything else its just how wide is his present time problem and in every case it is his reaction to present time that is creating the problem beyond that there are actually problems you got this this its how whats whats his perimeter whats his perimeter of problem so you can measure that and as these ris are peeled off against pt as you go back through actual pairs through the gpms you go back through these actual pairs and these things are up in pt and so forth hell be expressing this degree of introversion with regard to the well hes just got an awful worry hes got an awful worry he so rapidly goes onto planetary affairs in think like this its quite dizzying hes got an awful worry hes got an awful worry hes found the idea that he actually can longer he can longer make waterfalls fall backwards see he isnt out there trying to make waterfalls fall in any direction hes got problem see his problem is he can longer make waterfall fall backwards and theres your consistent run of processing and the way it peels off and goes all the way back now do you see then what the approximate anatomy is of what youre tackling in essence you have something i can draw you here in spite of the lateness of the moment i can draw you here this with great rapidity and theres ill draw it for you again but here let us say is your pc and he is being an ri and heres heres the goal as an ri see and this whole thing is one annealed gpm and this is present time the pc is being this thing and therefore it is his service fac right back of this is bunch more goal this is gpm this is your current gpm now when we reduce this on this level heres pt and lets make it look like this and lets just draw gpm shall we were going away from pt here see when youre looking for your service facsimile youre looking for this fellow right here or this one here youll find one or the other of those first goal you find is possibly youre looking for the goal here you see this gpm may not be complete may not be finished because hes still living it hes postulated this goal but you get goal and you you actually found that goal see goal found so what youre going to have to do now is list goal oppose against that to find that goal and then that goal and then that goal and then as soon as youre sure that hes got this goal and you actually list for those two ris and peel down that bank and clean that bank up thats the end of everything youre working with with the pc and also the end of all of his aberrations all of his worries all of his concerns all of his upsets in pt and isnt well i wont say isnt life wonderful because he now has all these fortunately by actual count there is only twenty or thirty actual gpms on the whole track twenty or thirty youre on the sunny side of thousand hours to ot and i mean all the way youre well on the sunny side of it and knowing and the fact that we discover things as we go and so forth i would say well probably have that cut down bit but at this present moment i see reason to change anything weve got weve just fallen back and taken up all the technology of year ago without changing hair in it its all been done there it is weve investigated through this summer implant ris you know how to run those things youve got good ideas of what gpms are youre all neat away you know how to run service facsimiles youre learning right now you can tear into that thing find the pcs own goal and youre away and youre really away so it very well may be with other developments that youre looking at five hundred hours it may be within five hundred hours and if your case is very very slippy indeed and you audit very well and you give very good auditing and receive very good auditing and youre very good children indeed you might be within three hundred and fifty hours but thats might be i can tell you for sure youre within eight hundred hours of it thats for an absolute certainty now this is what this is what it means that is what youre processing there isnt anything more that you are processing the fact that free track exists that implant gpms exist that all these other things screen implants exist and so on i ran about twelve i think ten or twelve screen line implants off in one ri listing couple of nights ago nothing they were getting in my road i was trying to put down items that were aberrative and i kept running into these things mosquito bites all right but thats what it looks like i dont care what else is on the track that is all that is on the track that is important right there on that sheet right there in front of you and thats in actual fact what antiquates psychotherapy who would have dreamed of any of that or of its considerable simplicity in its final analysis we had to know an awful lot of things to bring it down to that level of simplicity and once youre studying it and grinding it through you wont think its simple for while and then all of sudden itll fall apart and youll see its relatively easy that is what youre processing and thats the way it falls apart and thats it anything thats wrong with your pc is right here influenced by that first goal anything wrong with your pc that your pc is now is real enough to know about because when he gets to here hes going to have whole new set you understand of course this is going to modify he gets different changes and so on until he gets that whole gpm gone though hes still going to worry about that idea see sort of withdraw from it and be upset about it these these ideas we dont know what we dont know whats going to turn up down here of course hes got that much charge off of his case he can handle it better hes that much saner life will go that much easier you can get rid of it that much quicker but down here if this is the goal to eat buttercups he all of sudden goes in for horticulture and starts worrying about these poor flower seeds lying around all over the place dying without being planted he never worried before about it in his life but now its present time problem well thats thats your variations of case that is map of case it is that simple theres nothing much more to it it doesnt excuse anybody from careless auditing it doesnt say you cant make mistakes but it is basically very elementary and there it is thank you end of tape
