specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division the davisbacon act issues and legislation during the 110th congress summary in 1931 following several years of intermittent hearings and ultimately encouragement from the hoover administration congress adopted the davisbacon act now 40 usc 31413148 the act as amended requires that workers employed on public buildings and public works of the federal government and of the district of columbia must be paid at least the locally prevailing wage as determined by the secretary of labor initially the act applied to construction in excess of 5000 but in 1935 the act was amended to render its terms applicable to projects of 2000 and above with the passage of time the act was added to series of individual public works statutes perhaps more than fifty depending upon ones count as each of these statutes came up for renewed funding the davisbacon provision became subject of dispute and by the 1960s such disputes became both numerous and contentious some have suggested that the act having long outlived its depression era origins should be repealed others have argued that the act is as important today as it was in the 1930s and that it should be applied more generally and routinely through the past decades application of davisbacon to the clean water act state revolving funds has posed serious problem and with other concerns has impeded authorization of funding for covered projects see hr 720 the battle for or against davisbacon has been fought out in other sectors as well for example see homeland security hr 2638 and the energy independence bill hr 6 even the farm nutrition and bioenergy act of 2007 hr 2419 contains davisbacon provision as part of that program series of biorefineries and biofuel production facilities

legislation during the 110th congress the davisbacon act of 1931 as amended requires that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed under federal construction contracts1 it also affects manpower utilization on such projects for example the employment of helpers or unskilled and semiskilled general utility workers with respect to the implementation of the act congress has assigned wide administrative responsibility to the secretary of labor but legislative oversight has been more or less continuous at least since the 1950s through the years davisbacon provisions have been written into numerous program statutes application of the act to these and to new legislative programs has continued to spark congressional interest some urge that the prevailing wage statute is as important now as in the 1930s others contend that the requirement should be set aside in order to stretch construction dollars by permitting payment of less than prevailing rates frequently davisbacon or the prevailing rate question has been contested within the context of program statutes in which wages were not the central focus of debate but that were nonetheless of considerable importance to employers to workers and to the communities in which they operate this report is essentially tracking document it traces the most recent interests by congress in the davisbacon act and suggests the concerns that have been and are being voiced with respect to the act introducing the davisbacon act in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration congress enacted prevailing wage legislation for federal contract construction the legislation was cosponsored by representative robert bacon and senator james davis thus the davisbacon act2 the act was significantly amended in 1935 and its scope broadened in 1964 the definition of prevailing wage was expanded to include 1 40 usc 31413148 davisbacon provides wage floor to recruit and retain skilled workforce contractors may be forced by the market to pay wages in excess of those found under davisbacon to be prevailing in the locality for construction work 2 robert bacon had engaged in banking in new york prior to his election to the house of representatives in 1922 james davis had served as secretary of labor in the cabinets of presidents harding coolidge and hoover prior to his election to the senate in 1930 crs2 fringe benefits component otherwise the act remains essentially in its 1935 form3 although there have been intermittent efforts to repeal the davisbacon act and the related copeland antikickback act 19344 such initiatives have been consistently rejected by congress the structure and context of davisbacon the davisbacon act requires that federal and some federally assisted construction contracts specify the minimum wage rates to be paid to the various categories of laborers working under those contracts minimum wages are defined as those rates of pay found by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the concept of locality is usually but not necessarily always county or metropolitan area normally construction work is divided into four categories residential nonresidential buildings highway and heavy construction the act does not require that collectively bargained union wages be paid unless such wages happen to be prevailing in the locality where the work takes place further the prevailing rate for davisbacon purposes represents floor it is not necessarily the rate that construction firm may have to pay in order to recruit and to retain qualified workers5 typically the department of labor dol conducts two types of wage rate determinations general area determinations and where necessary specific project determinations dol sometimes collects data through direct survey process more often it works from data provided by contractors trade unions and other interested parties it may use both methods jointly the act requires that the advertised specifications for every construction contract in excess of 2000 to which the united states or the district of columbia is party must specify the wage that the secretary of labor determines to be prevailing in the locality for the various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the covered work speaking generally dol does not recognize unskilled or semiskilled helpers as class of workers for wage rate determination purposes rather it evaluates workers by craft thus employers may be discouraged from employing helpers on davisbacon projects turning to more skilled craftspersons instead dol does however recognize apprentices and 3 for quick historical overview of the act see crs report 94408 the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy by william g whittaker 4 some employers it was alleged had paid the prevailing wage to their workers but then demanded rebates or kickbacks to end this practice congress passed the copeland anti kickback act in 1934 pl 73324 reports filed under the copeland act put employers on record though not part of the davisbacon act it operates in tandem with that statute and in policy terms is usually part of the davisbacon debate 5 there does not appear to be any systematic analysis of the gap if any between the floor provided by the davisbacon act and the wages actually paid to construction workers on covered projects crs3 encourages the employment on davisbacon projects of persons enrolled in bona fide apprenticeship programs6 supplemented by other statutes work under davisbacon is covered by work hours and health and safety standards legislation though the latter are not part of the davisbacon act per the related 1934 copeland antikickback act requires weekly reporting of wages actually paid with an affirmation from employers that any deductions from wages due to employees were proper davisbacon applies to direct federal construction alteration or repair of public buildings and public works including painting and decorating where the contract is in excess of 2000 further davisbacon provisions have been written into numerous federal program statutes some states have enacted little davisbacon acts these state statutes however normally differ from each other and from the federal davisbacon act7 the purpose of the act in the 1920s the federal government undertook major program of public works as the nation moved into depression after 1929 this program had important implications for the areas where the work was to be performed given the depth of the economic downturn and the scope of unemployment any opportunity for work was attractive both to workers and to struggling firms federal construction contracts were normally awarded to the lowest responsible bidder but treatment of workers and payment of fair wages were not taken into account as result certain itinerant contractors employing workers imported from lowwage parts of the country were able or believed to be able to underbid local contractors in this way it was alleged flybynight operators would win contracts based upon the payment of substandard wages to workers desperate for employment 6 with the fitzgerald act in 1937 29 usc 50 ff the federal government assumed an oversight role with respect to apprentice training workers enrolled in programs recognized by the dol or by cooperating state programs receive specified training which when complete results in credential certifying the competence of the graduate journeyman the credential is portable ie recognized throughout the country such programs are usually funded jointly by the employer and the apprentice through temporarily reduced wage and often by contribution from the trade union in the craft 7 the davisbacon act applies only to federal contract construction other enactments apply to government purchases of goods and services the walshhealey public contracts act 1936 deals with labor standards with respect to goods produced under contract for the federal government the mcnamaraohara act 1965 popularly known as the service contract act deals with labor standards under federal service contracts these statutes do not apply to fully private sector work in addition there is the more general contract work hours and safety standards act 1969 the latter is an amalgam of earlier federal work hours and safety enactments for extended but critical account of these statutes and their administration see armand j thieblot jr prevailing wage legislation the davisbacon act state little davisbacon acts the walshhealey act and the service contract act philadelphia university of pennsylvania press 1986 see also crs report rl32086 federal contract labor standards statutes an overview by william g whittaker crs4 but sometimes lacking appropriate skills and then produce an inferior quality of construction thus the positive rehabilitative economic impact of public building and public works projects for the various localities was reduced to the disadvantage both of local contractors and local workers alike8 the original davisbacon act it would seem was as much protection for fair contractors as for workers it was viewed as model for private sector employers with respect to labor standards in drafting the davisbacon act congress was not searching for the cheapest available labor for federal construction work rather it prescribed payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage in order in part to protect fair local contractors and workers engaged in local markets from contractors and lowwage crews from outside the area of construction work however supporters of davisbacon have contended that there is essential conflict between the purposes of the statute and securing bargain for the public agency consumer the taxpayer9 continuing process in 1931 the davisbacon legislation was regarded as an emergency measure that sparked little controversy from the hearings and debates of that period it seems clear that congress anticipated none of the administrative problems that would ensue but almost immediately restructuring of the act commenced in early 1932 president hoover moved to strengthen administration of the statute through executive order 577810 although congress proceeded with oversight and ultimately adopted reforms its reform initiative was vetoed by the president11 the copeland antikickback act 1934 helped ensure that rates would be paid without improper deductions in 1935 congress adopted major changes to the statute reducing the coverage threshold from contracts of at least 5000 to those in excess of 2000 b extending coverage from public buildings to include construction alteration andor repair including painting and decorating of public buildings or public works and c requiring that the locally prevailing wage rates 8 during the late 1920s and early

debate over davisbacon by the 1950s congress had begun to add davisbacon provisions to various program statutes in which federal funding made the work possible but such extensions of coverage which would involve new and different types of contract work and new body of contractors seem to have sparked increased uneasiness with the act through the years arguments for and against davisbacon have become largely fixed as have counter arguments of defenders and critics in the evolving debate few contentions about the act have gone or are likely to go unchallenged on both sides there are assertions that advocates tend to accept without question current policy debate has focused upon whether to attempt to strengthen or diminish the davisbacon impact or to repeal the statute outright outlined below are some of the arguments advanced by critics and by defenders of davisbacon expressed in summary as each side in the ongoing debate might state them in policy terms the division of opinion seems to be in some measure philosophical reflecting basic attitudes toward labormanagement relations rather than division along partisan political lines perspectives of davisbacon critics some critics of davisbacon argue that the act is inflationary that it unnecessarily raises the cost of construction that it is difficult to administer and that it hampers competition especially advocates assert with respect to small businesses that may be unfamiliar with federal contracting procedures and lack the staff to deal with the requirements such procedures impose they contend that the act impedes efficient manpower utilization limiting the use of helpers or general utility workers some argue were davisbacon restrictions absent that contractors would be able to restructure the work to be performed dividing tasks into less complex assignments in order to make practical the employment of workers who may be less skilled and who are also less expensive to employ the result they argue would be increased efficiency and they suggest this would likely open more employment opportunities to lowskilled workers allowing them to gain work experience and onthejob training while at the same time reducing the costs of public construction 12 reduction of the coverage threshold appears to have been motivated by at least two considerations first contracts for painting and decorating were often too small to come under the 5000 figure second it appears that some contractors artfully divided work into small parcels in order to avoid davisbacon coverage reducing the threshold to 2000 was viewed as means through which to extend coverage crs6 besides critics note the davisbacon act 1931 1935 was adopted before there were federal minimum wage standards with the general minimum wage floor established under the fair labor standards act 1938 they suggest the davisbacon act is longer needed that is super minimum wage for federal construction work is both unnecessary and inequitable they assert that labor costs for federal construction could be reduced with savings for the taxpayer if actual local market wages were paid rather than administratively determined locally prevailing wages which some argue may often be union rates13 in addition they urge simplification of the copeland acts reporting requirements perspectives of davisbacon supporters supporters of davisbacon often contend that the act prevents cutthroat competition from flybynight firms that would undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors they suggest that the act helps stabilize the local construction industry an advantage to workers and employers alike the act they suggest may tend to assure the contracting agency of higher quality work since employers required to pay at least the locally prevailing wage are likely to hire more competent and productive workers resulting in better workmanship less waste reduced need for supervision and fewer mistakes requiring corrective action14 this may lead to fewer cost overruns and more timely completion of public construction and in the longterm lower rehabilitation and repair needs thus some argue the davisbacon act could actually save the taxpayer money on public construction supporters of the act also argue that davisbacon deters contractors from fragmenting construction tasks in order to utilize lowwage and lowskill helpers or pickup crews some argue that without davisbacon and in the absence of collective bargaining agreement contractors would probably be unlikely to provide training beyond the necessary and narrow requirements of the job and would not likely enter into formal program such as those monitored by dols bureau of apprenticeship and training reducing or eliminating apprenticeship programs in the construction industry might work to the disadvantage of those younger workers who are creating careers for themselves in the building trades in addition some assert that if helpers are substituted for skilled craft workers it would likely be those same apprentices ones young and lacking experience in the crafts who could expect to be laid off or forced into lowerwage jobs that did not train them in all around skills needed by journeymen in their chosen fields15 13 the davisbacon prevailing rate is floor not necessarily the rate that employers will actually have to pay dol suggests that union rates are used only where they are found to be prevailing in locality 14 conversely some argue that in the fully private sector there is significant amount of quality construction work that is performed without davisbacon protection 15 both critics and supporters of davisbacon have tended to make arguments that involve women and minorities or small business people perhaps less because they would be directly impacted than that they have become sympathetic participants crs7 what do we really know about the impact of the davisbacon act perhaps the most frequently asked question concerning the davisbacon act is how much money could be saved if davisbacon were repealed or modified to narrow its scope the short answer is probably one really knows conversely does davisbacon save money for the federal government in its purchases of construction for example employment of more highly skilled workers on davisbacon projects here again response may also be uncertain davisbacon literature is extensive and diverse much of it in the form of public materials ie agency reports and analyses journalists have taken continuing interest in the act resulting in substantial popular literature serious academic studies may be fewer it is extremely difficult for an independent scholar to review the administration of the act to assess its impact first there is the scope of the task vast numbers of projects scattered throughout the united states administered by different agencies and involving hundreds of contractors and subcontractors working under dissimilar circumstances and in diverse labor markets second there is the problem of the availability of documentation since the contractors involved are of the private sector how much useful information has been preserved third access presents problem assuming that the data and documents have been preserved and could be made available securing such documentation and access to administrative personnel may be problematic both from the private sector contractors workers and unions and from the various public agencies if one assumes that documentation exists access is allowed that all of the parties are cooperative and that the means financial and other are available for such an undertaking there remains fourth and perhaps most difficult complication the analyst would be comparing something that did happen with something that in fact for whatever reasons did not happen payroll records labormanagement relationships availability of skilled workers quality of supervision internal agency memoranda etc all relate to an actual project and not to what might have happened under other circumstances in the absence of davisbacon requirement would the contract have gone to the same contractor if so or if not would the contract have been managed in the same way did the act have any impact upon the wages actually paid or upon workforce utilization without davisbacon would different workers have been employed the work of governmental researcher may be further complicated by political or public policy considerations16 for all of these reasons there appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge of the act and of its administration despite oversight by congress extensive study by public and private agencies and the work of individual scholars further few studies 16 see also crs report 94908 davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whittaker crs8 of the act whether public or private have escaped criticism on grounds of flawed methodology or inadequate sample size thus precise estimates of impacts ought to be viewed with considerable caution17 recent congressional concern with the davisbacon act during each congress some measures have normally been introduced that would strengthen diminish or repeal the davisbacon act generally the issues have been contentious and in some cases have been threat to enactment of the underlying measures there follows series of davisbacon related issues upon which some legislative action has been taken during the 110th congress in some cases the presence of davisbacon proposal does not appear to have been an impediment to enactment in other cases davisbacon seems to have been determinant the davisbacon act and the cwasrfs through more than decade authorization for funding of the clean water act state revolving fund cwasrf has been matter of contention with the authorizing committees of both the house and the senate each time bill has been brought up for consideration various issues were raised among them coverage under the davisbacon act and ultimately the bills died18 in the 110th congress consideration of the cwasrf issue commenced in the house very early in 2007 with davisbacon an essential ingredient in the 17 distinction needs to be made between labor costs and project costs higher labor costs could result in lower project costs if more efficient and more skilled workers are employed but as practical matter to what extent are actual project costs governed by the requirements of the davisbacon act might they reflect the manner of federal agency oversight and monitoring of the progress of the work is federal construction work supervised as closely as that of the private sector what might be the impact of other federal requirements style of constructionarchitecture especially for ceremonial buildings is cost impacted by various set asides for sheltered contractors small and minority business and the like for an example of the problems private research involves

rl33800 water quality issues in the 110 congress oversight and implementation by claudia copeland crs9 proceedings19 although the house has passed the cwasrf it has not been acted upon in the senate new bill introduced hr 720 on january 30 representative james oberstar introduced hr 720 the water quality financing act of 200720 the bill was referred to the subcommittee on water resources and environment markedup and promptly forwarded to the full committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee and committee action in the subcommittee mark up january 31 2007 davisbacon once more became an issue representative richard baker urged that the davisbacon language be stricken on voice vote the baker amendment was rejected and the davisbacon provision was retained21 on february 7 the house committee on transportation and infrastructure took up the measure here again there was controversy over the davisbacon issue but it was overcome the bill was approved in the full committee by vote of 55 yeas to 13 nays with the davisbacon provision intact the bill was ordered reported22 as reported hrept 11030 hr 720 has two provisions that deal with davis bacon section 513 which applies the act broadly to treatment construction was retained it requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment works for which grants are made under this act shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing for the same type of work on similar construction in the immediate locality that authority section 513 had long been in place but now new provision was added section 602b17 the committee report explained new section 602b17 requires the application of the davisbacon requirements for the construction of treatment works carried out in whole or in part with assistance made available from state revolving loan funds under title vi funds from section 205m of the act or both this amendment authorizes the application of the prevailing wage requirements to construction projects carried out with any financial assistance from the state revolving fund whether the source of assistance originates from federal capitalization grant funds state matching funds repayments to the fund interest payments or other sources of income to the state revolving fund and whether the character of the assistance is through loans loan guarantees or other types of assistance authorized by section 603d 19 bureau of national affairs daily labor report january 10 2007 p a8 20 congressional record january 30 2007 p e220 21 terry kivlan

p a3 22 bureau of national affairs daily labor report february 9 2007 p a2 crs10 the report continued by establishing the davisbacon prevailing wage requirement for the construction of treatment works the committee continues its longstanding practice of ensuring the application of davisbacon where federal funds are provided for construction it added for the clean water srfs the most significant source of revenue in the state revolving funds is the federal capitalization grant as congress has done in 63 separate instances for federallyfunded construction the davisbacon act should apply to the reauthorization of the clean water srfs the committee went on to discuss the different reasons for support of the davis bacon act to attract more experienced and better trained workers workers who are often more productive than workers with less training and experience that davisbacon work results often in the completion of construction projects ahead of schedule reducing the overall cost of the project and offsetting any increased costs due to higher hourly wage rates23 conversely representative john mica together with several others expressed opposition to the davisbacon provisions representative mica stated that the bill represents an important step forward for clean water but it also takes significant step backwards by mandating and expanding upon the past application of davis bacon act prevailing wage requirements in the srf program davisbacon he stated would add to the cost of public construction and have disproportionate impact on small rural and disadvantaged communities which can least afford to pay the higher cost of projects he stated that the act was discriminatory in that few small and minorityowned firms can afford to pay the higher wages that the davisbacon act requires as result he observed they are rarely awarded davisbacon contracts and many of them stop applying for those contracts he concluded there is precedent here for applying the davisbacon act to state funds24 the bill considered in the house on march 9 the water quality financing act of 2007 was called up for debate in the house davisbacon was major part of the debate that followed in discussion of the rule hres 229 representative pete sessions raised the issue of davisbacon coverage he stated the democrat leadership is bringing legislation to the house floor that benefits big labor bosses at someone elses expense sessions continued in order to help big labor bosses pad their dwindling ranks they would apply these same provisions davisbacon regulations to all nonfederal funds such as loan repayments state bond revenues interest and statematching funds sessions objected to this depression era wage subsidy law and its associated inflation which means that local budgets cannot build schools hospitals prisons roads and other vital projects he continued 23 us congress house committee on transportation and infrastructure hrept 110030 water quality

communities women and minorityowned businesses and the environment you will join with in opposing this rule if however instead you support environmental harm market distortion wasteful federal spending and stacking the deck in favor of labor bosses i wholeheartedly encourage you to vote for this legislation25 representative kathy castor responded that some were unable to criticize the heart of this legislation ie authorization for an important part of the clean water act thus she suggested that the member from texas instead reverts to attacking portion of this legislation that is vital to workers across america the davisbacon provisions she affirmed that it is our policy in fact it is congresss longstanding continuing tradition of applying prevailing wage requirements to federally funded construction projects studies have shown that by attracting more experienced bettertrained workers that wage requirements lead to higher productivity and they reduce overall costs which offset any higher wages castor argued that davisbacon protects communities by ensuring that wage determination is based solely on the local workforce costs the locally prevailing wage rate further she argued with davisbacon in place oftentimes projects come in under budget and on time26 throughout floor consideration of hr 720 members took strong positions either for or against the statute27 as discussion moved on through actual consideration of the measure representatives baker and steve king proposed an amendment representative king explained really all this amendment does is it just stops the expansion of the davisbacon and it says we are not going to move this davisbacon into revolving fund mr baker added with respect to davisbacon it davisbacon will make the compliance of the rules for rural and lower income communities much more difficult to achieve compliance with the davisbacon provisions he stated is difficult and cumbersome task28 speaking against the bakerking amendment was the chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure james oberstar who noted the difference between union wage and prevailing wage this davis bacon provision is prevailing wage not union wage oberstar added it is the prevailing local wage29 although the clean water act was under discussion very little attention actually focused upon that issue davisbacon had become the central topic the only debate that we really have is oberstar stated what shall be the wages paid 25 congressional record march 9 2007 p h2346 26 congressional record march 9 2007 pp h2346h2347 27

would others referred to an unprecedented expansion of davisbacon requirements and suggested that the president will veto the legislation if it contains the davisbacon provisions31 further representative howard mckeon asserted that davisbacon typically increases the costs of federal projects by anywhere from 5 to 38 percent32 on rollcall vote the bakerking amendment was defeated 140 ayes to 280 nays33 thus the davisbacon act would apply to the srfs under the housepassed version of the water quality financing act of 2007 whether on first use basis or repeatedly throughout the program following discussion of other issues the bill was adopted consideration by the senate hr 720 was dispatched to the senate on march 12 2007 it was referred to the committee on environment and public works senate consideration remains unclear davisbacon and energy independence hr 6 on january 12 2007 representative nick rahall introduced hr 6 the creating longterm energy alternatives for the nation act of 200734 week later the bill was adopted by the house 264 ayes to 163 nays and was subsequently placed on the senate legislative calendar35 ultimately the bill was adopted by each body becoming pl 110140 parliamentary maneuvering as passed by the house the measure was relatively brief about 14 pages and dealt largely with technical aspects of oil and gas leases taxation and other non davisbacon issues however with its passage by the senate in midjune 2007 65 ayes to 27 nays it had grown by several hundred pages and now contained wide variety of energyrelated considerations

mckeon among other things objected to the bills inclusion of bureaucratic mandates that will kill american jobs and complicate jobtraining he cited prodavisbacon letter to the administration suggesting that the bill will not significantly expand the application of davisbacon prevailing wage requirements he continued now i dont know how the majority defines the words significantly expand but by my count this bill contains at least seven separate instances in which the davisbacon wage mandates are imposed simply put this bill furthers the majoritys aggressive application of davis bacon wage mandates davis bacon wages can inflate project costs by as much as 15 percent costs that get passed on to taxpayers they also force private companies to do hundreds of millions of dollars of excessive administrative work each year squandering resources that would be better spent creating jobs and spurring innovation and further he stated if the job killing davisbacon requirements werent bad enough this bill also complicates our job training system38 mr mckeons protest may have been overshadowed by concerns about the current price of oil and its impact for the economy the bill with davisbacon included was approved by vote of 235 ayes and 181 nays39 at this juncture the bill moved back to the senate where its fate was uncertain mr president senator mitch mcconnell observed there

element of the new energy act pl 110140 it could have an important role in the administrative history of the act insuring that workers engaged in federal construction receive not less than the locally prevailing rate for their services the davisbacon language appears on several occasions throughout the new statute for example in sec 136 advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program there is subsection that deals with an advanced vehicles manufacturing facility among other things the act provided for not more than 25000000000 in loans to eligible individuals and entities to carry out this aspect of the program in applying for loan the applicant shall submit to the secretary an application with such information as the secretary may require but including written assurance that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors during construction alteration or repair that is financed in whole or in part by loan under this section shall be paid wages at

much expanded farm bill was approved by the senate apparently without davisbacon the senate asked for conference that request did not meet with an immediate response and the process continued into the

recall farm bill process as closed as this one members denied the opportunity to deal with provisions brought into this legislation like labor provisions and so on not allowed to offer an amendment to take out davisbacon provisions that have business being in farm bill legislation and it is in my opinion very disappointing as result of this process goodlatte stated the provision requiring davisbacon wage rates on the new loan guarantee program for the next generation ethanol plants will go unchallenged50 representative tim walberg similarly argued against the anticompetitive davisbacon provision included in this bill that would drive up the cost of building ethanol plants and discourage alternative energy production51 and representative phil gingrey suggested if the united states is serious about moving our country to alternative fuels we dont need restrictions like davisbacon prevailing wages52 as speaker after speaker argued the merits of davisbacon debate moved forward it sounds to like the republican caucus of this body observed dennis cardoza is actually considering voting against the thousands of farmers their families and the millions of people throughout this country that rely on farming for their livelihood53 but on hres 574 the vote was yeas 222 to nays 20254 little was said of davisbacon as the house moved on to hr 2419 representative joe baca recalled

there is davisbacon wage scale in this bill he noted and he predicted that the 5th congressional district of iowa will remain the number one renewable fuels congressional district in america mr king added last year we put over billion dollars of private capital into that and we did so without the davisbacon wage scale we did it he stated with merit shop wages56 he also said that davis bacon

bill proceeded along somewhat different tract from house consideration on november 5 2007 senator tom harkin proposed senate amendment 3500 in which he would strike all after the enacting clause of hr 2419 and substitute new bill60 over the next week some 265 amendments were proposed61 meanwhile senator harry reid in an effort to restrict the number of amendments had introduced delimiting proposals procedure that sparked hostility from some opposing members62 among those in opposition to the reid amendment was senator judd gregg gregg listed series of issues that reid would have removed from consideration reid gregg stated among other things took off the table the issue of labor labor questions well in my experience labor questions have huge impact on farm policy especially the immigration labor issues he observed how you get people who are immigrants to help you pick apples in new hampshire and the potatoes in idaho63 during debate on the farm bill it appears only senator

with trade issues after weighting the option of passing standalone bill with just the missing trade title house leaders decided the best way to avoid any constitutional questions was to pass duplicate version of the 15title bill78 there followed flurry of activity with several bills contesting for preeminence hr 2419 had become pl 110234 but in the interim new bill hr 6124 duplicate of hr 2419 had been introduced in the house on may 22 and was immediately adopted 306 yeas to 110 nays the replacement bill was then dispatched to the senate where it was placed on the calendar as 753 79 on june 5 2008 the new version of the farm bill identical to the conference report on hr 2419 was called up in the senate and adopted by vote of 77 ayes to 15 nays but the bills fate hr 6124 seems to be in

portions of the american government process that included the creation of the department of homeland security dhs hr 2638 of the 110th congress proposed additional funding and certain further

some dispute as to whether further reference to davisbacon was appropriate and if so for which programs and projects crs21 language to the measure the amendment rogers explained is really quite simple it strikes the davisbacon section in the bill82 as reported by the house committee on appropriations hr 2638 contained the following provision none of the funds appropriated in this act may be used for grant or contract for any project that does not comply with the requirements of subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 united states code the recodified davisbacon act provided that the president may suspend the provisions of such subchapter during national emergency83 mr rogers observed that section has consequences that im not sure the majority has thoroughly thought through working on the assumption that the davisbacon act increases the cost of federal construction and that the bill would extend davis bacon to previously uncovered work mr rogers stated that the act could unfairly disadvantage communities that are unfortunate enough to be struck by disaster he commented this expansion further disadvantages small emerging and minority businesses new to the complex inefficient wage and work restrictions which make it nearly impossible for them to compete with better capitalized corporations disadvantaging the very companies we often seek to help following disaster for these reasons he urged his colleagues to support this amendment and strike this onerous restriction on the nations communities84 representative david price author of hr 2638 replied that under the act the employer has got to pay their employees if theyre using federal funds not less than the locally prevailing wage homeland security price stated has interpreted the application of davisbacon far too narrowly has applied the act only to stafford act85 grant programs and to virtually other dhs programs price continued our belief is simply that there is good reason for denying prevailing wage protection to jobs involved in these activities he noted the presidential emergency option that would apply in situations where davisbacon requirements would truly have detrimental impact but stated that for most jobs most of the time carrying out the intent of this bill fair locally prevailing wages should prevail with that he urged rejection of this the rogers amendment86 82 congressional

housepassed version88 for three days the senate debated homeland security voted to accept the senate bill and appointed conferees july 26 200789 however the bill as reported did not have the houseapproved davisbacon language thus along with other considerations suggesting the need for conference senate conferees were duly appointed at that juncture other matters seemed to take precedence consolidated appropriations bill as the first session was drawing to close with 11 of the 12 regular appropriations measures pending congress turned to consolidated appropriations act it chose as its vehicle hr 2764 initially the stateforeign operations appropriations act for fy2008 the bill had passed the house in june and the senate in september 2007 negotiations continued through middecember

the bill hr 3524 expands upon joint federallocal community initiative dating from the 1990s to renovate or replace old distressed public housing projects with modern housing and new communities that are healthy safe and affordable castor suggested that the measure could not have come at more important time given the current rash of foreclosures91 conversely representative pete sessions rose in reluctant opposition to the bill in its current form he stated that in mandating compliance with privately developed green building rating systems rather than providing marketbased incentives to reach these goals the legislation creates burdens for contractors by adding further impediments to an already complicated financing structure which could discourage developers from undertaking future projects sessions affirmed that move to marketbased approach rather than the onesizefitsall washington standard can easily be fixed he then turned to the logistics of housing demolition and rehabilitation but there was seemingly little real disagreement the house passed the resolution and moved on to the bill itself92 the king davisbacon amendment as the house took up the hope vi reauthorization act representative steve king rose with an amendment it provided none of the funds authorized to be appropriated under this paragraph may be used to pay wages in compliance with subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 united states code this reference was to the davisbacon act93 the king amendment would have stricken the requirements for davis bacon wage scale and would have prohibited act funds from going to davis bacon wage scale representative king explained that he was perhaps the only member of congress who had actually worked and lived under davisbacon wage scale and i have done that for well over 30 years he continued i have done the homework i have done the paperwork i have put together the spreadsheets and i dealt with all the employee dynamics that were involved there and i make the point mr chairman that labor is commodity like corn or beans or gold or oil or gasoline and the value of it needs to be determined by the marketplace not by the government and for the federal government to intervene in relationship between two people and contractual relationship in particular at the cost of the taxpayer that always favors going to union scale and is not prevailing wage but it is in effect union scale this authorization as written if my amendment is not adopted will cost the taxpayers an additional 26 million 91 congressional record january 17 2008 p h299 92 congressional record january 17 2008 pp h300h301 93 congressional record january 17 2008 p h324 crs24 king did not specifically explain the basis for the additional 26 million though he did seem to suggest that his figures were low average he stated that the statute is not effective that it cannot keep up with change in the wage scale and according to the inspector general of dol that nearly 100 percent of the davisbacon data cannot be relied upon94 kings comments triggered response from representative david scott who stated the gentleman from iowa very cleverly used the words union scale this is not union scale this is prevailing wage scale scott continued now this amendment is very timely here we are in the throes of recession one of the most damaging economic crises that this nation has faced in the last quarter of century and we have the gentleman from iowa wanting to put on an amendment that would diametrically affect the living wages of the people who need the help the most now by preventing workers on hope vi projects from earning living wage is certainly not the right way to go scott closed with the affirmation the davisbacon prevailing wage helps attract the necessary skilled workforce to build housing in the most efficient and cost effective manner this he said of the king proposal is bad amendment95 meanwhile thanking scott for his comments representative george miller explained further this is about prevailing wages it is not about union wage miller added the fact of the matter is the majority in this house understands how important this provision is to working people in this country and to the communities in which these projects are being built in statement for the record miller summarized the king amendment uses taxpayer money to worsen the cycle of poverty in the poorest neighborhoods in the country it uses taxpayer money to buy shoddy work that just increases the costs later on its difficult to tell who the amendment is trying to hurt the most the poor neighborhoods the workers or the taxpayers he concluded this amendment is outrageous and should be roundly defeated by the house96 not so remarked representative king he found millers remarks offensive to to say that my 28 years of meeting payroll my 1400some consecutive weeks of making payroll of providing health insurance and retirement benefits and year around work for employees and career path for them is to take his words poor wages and poor working conditions who in this congress has some experience 94 congressional record january 17 2008 p h324 95

aggressively to seek approval of this legislation101 provisions of the dorgan bill like the pallone bill the dorgan bill contained davisbacon provision subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 united states code commonly known as the davisbacon act but with several caveats under which the davisbacon act would not apply in strictly orthodox manner first the construction or renovation may be performed by contractor pursuant to contract with an indian tribe or tribal organization with funds supplied through contract or compact authorized by the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act 25 usc 450 et seq or other statutory authority second or it may be subject to prevailing wage rates for similar construction or renovation in the locality as determined by the indian tribes or tribal organizations to be served by the construction or renovation 100 us congress house of representatives committee on natural resources indian health care improvement act amendments of 2007 110th cong 2nd sess hrept 110 564 part i april 4 2008 pp 42 and 117 101 congressional record april 24 2007 p s4926 crs27 third this subsection shall not apply to construction or renovation carried out by an indian tribe or trival organization with its own employees102 thus the dorgan bill would do three things first it reaffirms the existing davisbacon provision but changes the old citation 40 usc 276a to 276a5 to recodified citation subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 second it provides that jurisdiction over davisbacon rates formerly the exclusive preserve of the secretary of labor can be transferred to indian tribes or tribal organizations third it provides rather standard exception from the act that allows work performed by the employees of an indian tribe or tribal organization inhouse staff to be unprotected in terms of davisbacon standards103 some policy implications initially it appears the administration may not have taken the new proposals seriously the pallone bill contained straightforward reiteration of davisbacon coverage the dorgan bill more complex proposal to allow indians or tribal organizations an opportunity to share in determining wage rates for davisbacon purposes if there was opposition to the proposals it was not immediately apparent then under date of january 22 2008 the office of management and budget omb released statement critical of the expansion of davisbacon and suggesting if this provision is included in the final bill presented to the president his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill omb did not explain in what manner davisbacon would be expanded because davisbacon was already part of the statute further under the dorgan proposal the department of labor could find its duties diminished in scope primarily because of the new tribal primacy with respect to the establishment of davisbacon rates104 on february 14 2006 colloquy occurred between senators edward kennedy lisa murkowski and dorgan the colloquy opened with senator kennedy mr kennedy i understand that in the managers amendment section 303b of the bill has been modified so that the language is now identical to current law is that correct 102 see s 1200 the indian health care improvement act as introduced on april 14 2007 pp 160161 103 it may not be clear just what the impact of the devolution of enforcement policy to the several hundred tribes or tribal organizations would be since these entities would be it seems largely independent and could it would appear operate under their own rules 104 bureau of national affairs daily labor report january 23 2008 p a9 for the omb document see httpwwwwhitehousegovomblegislativesap1102saps1200spdf as proposed part of the enforcement policy and procedures would be shifted from the secretary of labor to indian tribes or tribal organizations somewhat unclear definition since there could be several hundred such organizations with different standards for implementing the davisbacon act crs28 mr dorgan yes the intent of the provision in the managers amendment to the bill is to maintain current law generally when indian health facilities are constructed or renovated davisbacon prevailing wage rates apply however pursuant to current federal law and longstanding policy of the department of labor indian health service and bureau of indian affairs when indian tribes and tribal organizations construct or renovate federally funded indian health facilities using their own employees davisbacon prevailing wage rates do not apply our intention in the managers amendment is to maintain the status quo of current law and policy in these regards mr kennedy so this language does not change the construction or application of existing statutes mr dorgan correct it does not change current law it is our intent that the prevailing wage provisions in both the indian health care improvement act and the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act will continue to apply when federal funds are used for the construction and renovation of indian health facilities except where such work is carried out by tribal or tribal organization employees105 senator murkowski joined in the dialogue expressing the same sentiment that is that nothing in the statute had been changed merely recodified on february 26 2008 the indian health care bill was approved by the senate 83 yeas to 10 nays with the davisbacon provision remaining in the measure106 back to the house on february 28 2008 the bill was received in the house and was referred to the committees on natural resources on energy and commerce and on ways and means107 105 congressional record february 14 2008 pp s1040s1041 106 congressional record february 26 2008 p s1155 however the language was changed so that davisbacon doesnt appear references to transfer of responsibilities from the department of labor to various indian tribes and tribal organizations where davis bacon is concerned were deleted in the senate version 107 drew armstrong senate aims to complete work on indian health care overhaul bill cq today february 25 2008 pp 10 and 12 crs29 improving public school facilities on february 13 2008 george miller chairman of the committee on education and labor presided over hearing on the physical state of americas schools we all agree on the urgent national priority of providing every child with worldclass education mr miller began it is clear that we cannot satisfy that priority unless we help states and school districts improve the physical condition of their school buildings and facilities he concluded we can help mitigate the current economic damage by investing in school construction projects that will create jobs and inject demand into the economy108 general discussion of davisbacon the committees ranking republican howard mckeon tended to disagree with chairman millers views not on general substance but on the source of funding traditionally states and local communities have retained control over education mckeon stated particularly public k12 education he pointed to the costly mandates that would threaten the autonomy maintained at the state and local level such as the davisbacon act mr mckeon suggested that the depressionera statute can drive up the cost of federal projects109 again just yesterday the committee received letter from leading business and construction groups outlining flaws within the davisbacon wage mandates110 several members appeared before the committee as witnesses representative charles boustany urged that the committee consider one federal mandate that makes already expensive projects even more expensive namely the davisbacon act mr boustany was hopeful that the committee will focus on the critical shortcomings in the way those davisbacon wages are calculated111 he suggested 20 to 25 percent increase in total costs arising from davisbacon observing that study by researchers at suffolk university boston found that the current method inflates wages by 22 percent overall i challenge anyone on this committee to argue that the davisbacon wage surveys are scientific surveys that need improvements boustany stated either taxpayers get overcharged by the system 108 prepared remarks of chairman miller when introducing the hearing on school facilities before the committee on education and labor february 13 2008 see also hr 2470 hr 3021 hr 5401 s 912 and others 109 press release from the office of representative mckeon february 13 2008 110 statement of representative mckeon february 13 2008 before the committee on education and labor among signers to the letter were the us chamber of commerce the national federation of independent business and associated builders and contractors 111 some have suggested that dols wage rate calculations may be in fact substantially outofdate and therefore reduce the effectiveness of the act mr boustany may well have concurred many construction employees are actually underpaid using the flawed determination method instead of superior bls figures employees in florida north carolina michigan virginia and maine were some of those americans who got cheated by the current systems shortcomings see statement of representative boustany before the committee on education and labor february 14 2008 crs30 or construction employees are underpaid he urged the committee to fix davis bacon before imposing it on future school construction projects112 representative steven king had also read suffolk university study and asked that it be made part of the record113 mr king alluded to work from his own experience with davisbacon citing the general education provisions act or gepa 20 usc 1232b he observed that the davisbacon mandate would apply to any bill that received federal dollars for construction or renovation and affirmed that davisbacon is the federal government intruding in the affairs of the states he charged that the act is anticompetitive mr king affirmed non union companies like the one i started are seriously hurt by davisbacon provisions small businesses he concluded simply cant compete114 jim waters of bowling green kentucky spokesperson for the bluegrass institute for public policy solutions kentuckys freemarket think tank was also witness waters stated that kentuckys prevailing wage law represents well intentioned policy gone awry the kentucky law prevents state government from receiving the most value for every dollar spent on public projects and increases the cost of infrastructure by 10 to 15 percent waters questioned how contractors build quality office complexes large custom homes investment properties and corporate facilities without being coerced by some kind of forced wage policy115 several open shop contractors and business spokespersons had asked that application of davisbacon to school construction be withheld until serious flaws with the lawss wage determination process are fixed116 house considers construction bill hr 3021 representative ben chandler had introduced hr 3021 the 21st century high performing public school facilities act in early july 2007 that bill now became vehicle for the committee the chandler bill stated that at least onethird of our public school buildings need extensive repair or replacement and twothirds have troublesome environmental conditions such as the presence of asbestos or lead in water and paint the average public school building was built in the early 1960s it stated and now needs hundreds of billions of dollars in construction modernization and 112 representative boustany before the committee on education and labor february 13 2008 113 see sarah glassman michael head david g tuerck and paul bachman

facilities and the academic achievement of students bringing elementary and secondary schools uptodate will help improve academic performance and will improve teacher retention117 views of the majority on april 30 2008 the committee conducted full committee markup of hr 3021 in summarizing the legislation the report presented by representative miller noted noted that construction modernization repair and renovation projects will be davisbacon covered davisbacon requirements will help control costs ensure higher quality work and improve safety studies have shown that where prevailing wages are not required contractors compete on the basis of labor costs frequently resulting in poor construction quality as well as substantial cost and time overruns due to cheaper workers lower levels of skill productivity and training where prevailing wages are paid higher rates of productivity safety and building quality more than offset the cost of higher wages the report continued davisbacon requirements help save federal state and local revenue further studies have found that repeal of local prevailing wage laws results in lower incomes loss of sales tax revenues and general loss of economic activity it concluded these are precisely the types of effects the committee intends to avoid by providing federal assistance to local communities consistent with davisbacon118 it wasnt necessary to add davisbacon to the bill under the general education provisions act or gepa such programs would automatically be covered119 but conversely critics of davisbacon were desirous of striking that provision views of the minority representative mckeon with his colleagues spoke for the minority one of the most troubling aspects of massive new federal school construction program authorized through hr 3021 they stated was the davis bacon requirement the prevailing wage system has proven to be fundamentally flawed often bearing relation to market wages and tends to favor union wage workers and the cost impact from davisbacon is staggering the congressional budget office cbo and gao were cited 117 language here is from hr 3021 as introduced 118 us congress house of representatives committee on education and labor report 110623 21st century green highperforming public school facilities act pp 1415 cited hereafter as hrept 110623 the majority cited two studies

american business january 2004 119 hrept 110623 pp 4 and 18 crs32 cbo estimates that the federal government could save more than 105 billion in construction costs if it were to repeal the davisbacon act the gao is also on record in stating that the davisbacon act is not susceptible to practical and effective administration by the department of labor and that davisbacon has resulted in unnecessary construction and administration costs inflated prices and inaccurate wages they suggested as minimum new system of wagerate calculation under the bureau of labor statistics within the department of labor in some cities the wage determinations are more than 75 percent above market wages in other cities they are just onethird of market wages in some states davisbacon rates are actually below the minimum wage these wage determinations simply do not reflect prevailing market wages and this failure has serious implications for construction workers and taxpayers120 citing study by the national school boards association representative mckeon and his associates argued that at least 38 states would have to endure significantly increased school construction costs if davisbacon were imposed121 the davis bacon mandate the minority stated will only over inflate school construction prices limit competition and reduce jobs for entrylevel workers122 the minority urged that new school construction be exempted from davis bacon coverage but in committee mckeon amendment was rejected 16 ayes to 27 nays123 on may 8 2008 the committee reported hr 3021 floor consideration in the house on june 3 2008 hr 3021 was approved for floor consideration under hres 1234 on june 4 hr 3021 was called up debated and passed by vote of 250 yeas to 164 nays124 despite earlier discussion of the davisbacon act little attention was paid to the act during debate on passage of the bill in general summary of the measure representative mckeon noted that the bill would link this funding to the depressionera davisbacon act mr mckeon added the problem is prevailing wage calculations are critically and fundamentally flawed with some rates higher than market rates and other times they are lower125 later representative carolyn mccarthy responded as far as having davidbacon why should not we have 120 hrept 110623 pp 3436 121 hrept 110623 p 36 122 hrept 110623 p 37 the minority cited the

the house took up hr 3074 the appropriations for the departments of transportation housing and urban development and related agencies ultimately the measure was added to hr 2764 the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 proposal by representative king representative john w olver presided over discussion that dealt with the more delicate points of housing and transportation that began with the phrase none of the funds made available in this act as debate proceeded on hr 3074 representative steve king proposed an amendment none of the funds made available under this act may be used to implement the provisions of the davisbacon act under house rules representative king was recognized for 5 minutes together with member opposed to the amendment mr olver128 representative king explained that the amendment strikes the requirements for the davisbacon act within the appropriations of this bill he continued by noting his experience with davisbacon both as recipient of davisbacon wages and as contractor through many years and noted the paperwork requirements under the act im maybe the only one in congress who has real handson experience of dealing with the additional costs that are involved with the federal wage scale thats davisbacon he explained that projects covered by davisbacon from his experience add anywhere from 8 percent increase in the cost of the projects up to 35 percent increase in the cost of the projects but he rounded the numbers off at 20 percent additional costs mr king stated that he supported free market economy of labor being able to collectively negotiate the value of their work he added 126 congressional record june 4 2008 p h4940 127 libby george bill aided at building environmentally friendly schools heads toward house

interference of the federal government this is not prevailing wage in practice its only prevailing wage by statute actually it is union scale representative king suggested some places its the davisbacon wage actually below the prevailing wage other places it distorts that prevailing wage dramatically why he asked should we limit our resources by imposing such draconian topdown federal management tool that not only costs lot more money but it makes it lot lot harder to manage your projects129 the issue debated representative olver then rose to defend use of davisbacon requirements after noting that the act had been adopted by republican congress and republican administration about 75 years ago representative olver affirmed without davisbacon the transportation construction industry which is responsible for building our highways and transit systems might suffer from lowbid firms that aim to undercut local wages and perform construction on the cheap davisbacon encourages higher quality of workmanship and we should not do away with the law for transportation construction where we need the highest quality and the longest lasting workmanship with that mr olver urged rejection of the king amendment130 in response representative king stated that he had worked on union shop and merit shop jobs both as an employer and as an employee he added i dont think we can apply high quality strictly to union and he continued in fact merit shop employees do fantastic job with the work that theyre doing and they take pride in it but it may not have been the wage rate that most disturbed mr king my greatest frustration with davisbacon wage scale is not the wage itself its that it takes away my ability to manage project and my ability to provide incentives for employees to make decisions themselves on the ground i have to manage them more when theyre under davisbacon wage scale it distorts the work we do it distorts the skills and the complement of the skills and it raises the cost of everything that we do in the construction business referring to merit shop construction king stated they make out better we make out better and weve got more consistent employees131

drug administration and related agencies appropriations act 2008 representative rosa l delauro presided over the discussion proposal by representative kingston as with the farm bill some portions of hr 3161 dealt with renewable energy and related concerns as debate progressed representative jack kingston rose with an amendment none of the funds made available in this act shall be used to pay the salaries or expenses of any employee of the department of agriculture who would require contracts to construct renewable energy systems to be carried out in compliance with the provisions of the davisbacon act133 mr kingston noted that people are paying 310 for gas or higher the rate is on the rise we are importing 60 percent of our oil he continued during this time when we are in desperate need for alternative energy options we should not increase the price of making cellulosic ethanol and yet he stated in the ag bill there was clause that says if you are building an ethanol plant you have to have prevailing wages the davisbacon provision which drives up the cost of the plant and therefore drives up the cost of ethanol134 the issue debated representative delauro rose to claim the time in opposition to the amendment and then yielded to representative robert c scott 132 congressional record july 24 2007 p h8385 see also hr 3412 freestanding proposal by representative king of iowa that would repeal the davisbacon act hr 3412 has been referred to the committee on education and labor subcommittee on workforce protections action has yet been taken 133 congressional record august 2 2007 p h9628 134 congressional record august 2 2007 p h9628 crs36 scott proceeded with rebuttal this amendment smacks right at the heart of our wage structure of fair wages and protected wages long before tafthartley before the wagner act this was put on the books in 1931 76 years ago then representative scott added davisbacon was put on the books by republican administration president hoover because at that time it was needed to have wage stabilization mr scott suggested that davisbacon was the cornerstone of the wage protection structure in this country and noted davisbacon prevents underbidding of any contractor coming in on government contract low bidding and attempting to bring in contract and hire workers below the prevailing wage then looking to the precise amendment he stated that it was dealt with in the agriculture committee and soundly defeated at that time representative scott then went on to central issue in the ag bill we have dedicated 4 billion for loan guarantees to set up ethanol plants now mr chairman these are highly sophisticated operations clearly we need the best talent the best skills he went on to discuss the nature of davisbacon and the rationale for its enactment these protections were put in to prevent flybynight operations from coming into community abridgment of the davisbacon act he suggested would be wrong and quite honestly unamerican135 mr kingston reclaimed his time but was then joined by representative king of iowa prevailing wage by definition union scale in practice there is other way to analyze this union scale is what gets produced king stated when the department of labor produces the proposed prevailing wage mr king went on to the logistics of the new energy there was over billion dollars invested in renewable energy in my district last year there will be over billion dollars invested this year we are number one in biodiesel production in america of the 435 districts king affirmed there is way that any other district in the country has hope of catching up with the fifth congressional district of iowa if you are going to impose davisbacon wage scales on this136 representative sam farr rose to challenge the critics of davisbacon mr farr noted that california has done more for cutting energy costs by doing energy conservation and renewable energy and he stated every one of those facilities was built under davisbacon law he stated that the amendment was an effort to get at labor try to cut wages go to the lowest cost and representative farr added this is the wrong way to do it it is mean amendment and it should be defeated137 there may have been some measure of irony here if this was about free enterprise kingston responded this clause would not be in the farm bill he

energy costs go up because it is making the construction of alternative energy facilities higher ms delauro in closing out the debate affirmed i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment why why would we want to deny american workers including those involved in rural development the opportunity to receive their prevailing wage protection its matter of fairness for working men and women138 representative kingston demanded rollcall vote on his projected amendment the vote was ayes 152 and nays 278139 the kingston amendment was defeated helper issue and manpower utilization through the past halfcentury the question of helpers has emerged as davis bacon issue sometimes in legislative format on other occasions as an administrative matter it will likely continue to be raised as davisbacon remains matter before congress both as to the definition of helper and with respect to the use of helpers on davisbacon covered projects dol efforts to change the helper requirement the davisbacon act makes mention of helpers nor does it refer to trainees apprentices or other skill groups rather it refers to various classes of laborers and mechanics and then leaves up to the secretary of labor the determination of just what those various classes might be and how they might be distinguished one from the other140 under davisbacon before bids are solicited the minimum locally prevailing wage rate is determined for each category of worker to be used on the project where helper category is not recognized in the locality of the projected construction craft or laborer rates have to be paid potentially but not necessarily increasing the labor cost of construction labor proponents maintain that recognition of helper category could defeat the purposes of the act that is allowing contractors to fragment tasks so that lowskilled lowwage helpers could be employed some argue that such policy could result in downward wage spiral and that employment of helpers would undercut apprenticeship programs with generally deleterious impact upon skills transfer through the years helpers have been employed on davisbacon construction where their use was common in the area and where they are clearly distinguished from laborers or craft workers however their use appears to have been infrequent during the late 1970s the carter administration opened the general issue of davis 138 congressional record august 2 2007 p h9629 139 congressional record august 2 2007 p h9644 ultimately hr 3161 was added to hr 2764 the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 140 for general background see herbert r northrup the helper controversy in the construction industry journal of labor research fall 1992 pp 421435 crs38 bacon implementation seizing the opportunity industry urged closer adherence to area practice when establishing worker classifications especially helper classifications141 before new davisbacon regulations could be given effect president carter was replaced by president reagan regulations proposed by the former administration were withdrawn and their substance reconsidered new regulations proposed by the reagan administration may 1982 redefined the concept of helper and potentially expanded their use change applauded by industry and objected to by the building trades unions142 litigation followed in order to circumvent objections raised by the courts dol redrafted the helper regulations in january 1989 during the bush administration the courts acquiesced in dols judgment and cleared the regulations for implementation but at that juncture congress objected refusing to appropriate funds for implementation and enforcement of the new regulations this restraint continued into the middle 1990s by which time the agency was free to act then another impediment was raised dol under the clinton administration declined to move forward with the regulation in june 1996 the associated builders and contractors brought suit to require dol to enforce its helper regulations confronted with impending litigation assistant secretary of labor bernard anderson affirmed that the helper regulation approved but not enforced was simply nonadministratable anderson explained that the distinction between helpers and other workers was insufficiently clear that dol had intention of implementing the regulation in its current form143 in august 1996 dol noted that during the 14 years that had passed since the regulation was first published additional information has become available which warrants review of the suspended rule144 the regulation remained in abeyance through the next several months dol reassessed the data and in december 1996 it announced that the helper regulation would remain suspended for the immediate future145 in july 1997 the us district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department was within its rights to issue an indefinite suspension of the helper regulation146 then in april 1999 dol issued new proposed rule that would essentially reaffirm the status quo prior to the carter administration initiatives of the late 1970s two decades earlier147 thus the use of helpers would be limited by area practice and where they were clearly differentiated from laborers and other craft workers the use of helpers was expected to be infrequent 141 the constructor december 1980 p 61 142 federal register may 28

another look whatever the immediate outcome of the helper question the department it appeared had made judgment for the foreseeable future further administrative involvement could be expected the late clinton administration late in the 105th congress 1998 representative charlie norwood introduced legislation that would have created special category of workers ie helpers for davisbacon purposes action however was taken on the proposal in the 106th congress 1999 mr norwood introduced new helper legislation on july 21 1999 the subcommittee on oversight and investigations committee on education and the workforce conducted hearing on the impact of the helper rules for job opportunities the subcommittee however took further action the norwood bill was not reported during the same period representative anne northup raised the helper issue during consideration of appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education at representative northups request language was added during markup that would have denied funding to implement administer or enforce the helper rule proposed by the clinton administration however as the legislation progressed through the legislative process the provision was dropped what impact its inclusion would have had may not have been entirely clear since in essence the bill would have codified existing practice as the 106th congress was drawing to close dol again took up the matter issuing new final regulation governing the use of helpers it was dated november 14 2000 and was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register just hours prior to the end of the clinton administration the regulation provided that helpers were to be recognized as distinct classification only where the following conditions occur i the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as trainee in an informal training program the work of helper was not to be performed by any other classification of worker in the wage determination148 the george w bush administration another bill dealing with the issue was introduced during the 107th congress but was not adopted in the 108th congress may 2003 the helper issue was raised again by representative marsha blackburn with representatives norwood and king of iowa the proposal again the helpers job opportunity act mandated that helpers of laborers and mechanics shall be considered to be separate classification but the prospects were better than 148 bureau of national affairs daily labor review november 20 2000 pp e1 forward for more detailed discussion of this issue see also crs report 96228 davisbacon employment of helpers on federal contract construction by william g whittaker crs40 with prior congresses149 the bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and subsequently to the subcommittee on workforce protections but action was taken on the proposal on september 27 2005 the 109th congress representative blackburn with mr norwood as cosponsor reintroduced the helpers job opportunity act hr 3907 again the bill died in the committee on education and the workforce the final regulation dating from the clinton administration has gone into effect and thus far the bush administration has not revisited the issue however this may not be the end of the process on the one hand the department of labor at its own discretion could reevaluate the helper question and issue new proposed rule or conversely congress could attempt to resolve the issue through new legislation of course it may be that the matter has been resolved and that nothing further remains to be accomplished 149 see hr 2283 of the 108th congress for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526
