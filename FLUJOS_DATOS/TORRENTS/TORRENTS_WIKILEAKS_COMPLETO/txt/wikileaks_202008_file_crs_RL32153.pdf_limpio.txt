excluding fy2002 congress and the president brought action on the regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year to close by incorporating unfinished acts into an omnibus appropriations measure for fy2006 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted into law separately each of the five omnibus acts and the defense appropriations act for fy2006 which wa s one of the last two regular appropriations acts enacted that session on december 30 2005 included an acrosstheboard spending cut to offset part of the cost of annual appropriations acts for the fiscal year fullyear funding for the bulk of the fy2007 appropriations was provided at restrictive levels in continuing resolution which did not include an acrosstheboard spending cut the six acrosstheboard spending cuts enacted previously ranged in size from 022 to 100 of covered appropriations and an estimated 11 billion to 85 billion in savings the 038 cut for fy2000 in pl 106113 saved an estimated 24 billion in budget authority the 022 cut for fy2001 in pl 106554 saved an estimated 11 billion in budget authority the 065 cut for fy2003 in pl 1087 saved an estimated 26 billion in budget authority the 059 cut for fy2004 in pl 108199 saved an estimated 28 billion in budget authority the 080 cut for fy2005 in pl 108447 saved an estimated 35 billion in budget authority and the 100 cut for fy2006 in pl 109148 saved an estimated 85 billion in budget authority the acrosstheboard cuts may be compared in several ways first the range of appropriations subject to the spending cuts varied under each provision because of variations in the number of regular appropriations acts covered and the specification of particular exemptions second the reductions imposed by the percentage cuts had to be made subject to percentage limitation or proportionality requirement finally the size of the percentage cut was reduced significantly during the course of legislative action in two of the cases the significance of the spending cuts differed with regard to budget enforcement 1 the fy2000 cut was needed to avoid sequester 2 the fy2001 cut was not needed to avoid sequester but it contributed to overall discretionary spending being below the statutory limits 3 the fy2003 and fy2005 cuts were needed to adhere to informal limits reached between congressional leaders and president bush in the absence of budget resolution and the expiration of the statutory limits on discretionary spending and 4 the fy2004 and fy2006 cuts contributed to adherence to the discretionary spending levels assumed in the budget resolutions for those years this report will be updated as developments warrant

discretionary spending which accounts for roughly onethird of total federal spending is spending that is under the control of the house and senate appropriations committees and is provided in annual appropriations acts for the most part discretionary spending funds the routine operations of the federal government including the salaries and expenses accounts of most agencies discretionary spending is distinguished from direct spending also referred to as mandatory spending which is controlled by the legislative committees of the house and senate through substantive law and funds entitlement and other mandatory programs such as medicare federal military and civilian retirement and unemployment compensation discretionary spending and direct spending together make up total federal spending each year congress and the president enact discretionary spending in the form of regular appropriations acts as well as continuing and supplemental appropriations acts 3 if action is not completed on all of the regular appropriations acts toward the end of congressional session congress sometimes will combine the unfinished appropriations acts into an omnibus measure an omnibus appropriations act may set forth the full text of each of the regular appropriations acts included therein or it may enact them indivi dually by crossreference in addition significant 1 for more information on this topic see crs report rl32473 omnibus appropriations acts overview of recent practices by robert keith 2 the spending cuts also required reductions in obligation limitations for accounts where this was appropriate 3 the number of regular appropriations acts was fixed at 13 between fy1968 and fy2005 the number of regular appropriations acts was reduced to 11 for fy2006 and fy2007 following realignment of subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees at the beginning of the 109th congress in 2005 further realignment in 2007 at the beginning of the 110th congress

house and senate consider annual appropr iations acts and other budgetary legislation within constraints established in yearly budget resolution required by the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended5 budget resolution policies are enforced by points of order that may be raised during house and senate consideration of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation on occasion budget policies may be modified by agreements reached between congressional leaders and the president such modifications may be accommodated during legislative action through the use of waivers of points of order emergency spending designations and other budgetary or procedural devices during the period covering fy1991fy2002 legislative action on annual appropriations acts also was subject to limits on discretionary spending established by the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 which amended an underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 19856 under this statutory mechanism separate discretionary spending limits were applied to two different measurements of spendingbudget authority and outlays budget authority represents the legal authority for agencies to incur obligations annual appropriations are perhaps the most well known form of budget authority outlays represent the liquidation of the obligation usually in the form of an electronic funds transfer or the issuance of check by the treasury department while proposals have been made to renew the discretionary spending limits efforts to enact them have been unsuccessful the discretionary spending limits were enforced by the sequestration process7 sequester involved automatic largely acrosstheboard redu ctions in discretionary spending in order to eliminate any breach of the limits separate sequestration process entailed automatic reductions in mandatory spending if the enactment of revenue or mandatory spending measures caused violation of payasyougo paygo requirement under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended the director of the office and management and budget omb was charged with determin ing within 15 days after the close of congressional session whether sequester of either kind was required for the fiscal year in order to adhere to restraints imposed by congressional budget resolutions the discretionary spending limits and ad hoc

also varied under each provision ranging from 10 acts for fy2005 to 13 acts for fy2000 two of the spending cuts applied to all of the regular appropriations acts whether they were enacted separately or included in an omnibus appropriations act 1 the fy2000 spending cut covered the five acts incorporated into the omnibus measure for that year as well as the eight acts that had been enacted as freestanding laws and 2 the fy2006 spending cut applied to all of the then11 regular appropriations acts for that year the coverage of the spending cuts was expanded by making them apply to funding provided for that fiscal year in this or any other act or similar language in the remaining instances between one and three of the regular appropriations acts were exempted from the spending cuts the laborhhseducation appropriations act was exempted for fy2001 the homeland security appropriations act was exempted for fy2005 and the defense and military construction appropriations acts were exempted for fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 10 further exemptions were provided for specified accounts and programs and supplemental appropriations acts military personnel accounts for example were exempted specifically from the spending cuts for fy2000 and fy2001 these accounts also were exempted in subsequent years by virtue of the exclusion of the entire defense appropriations act and appropriations for the department of veterans affairs were exempted from the fy2006 spending cut 10 exempted appropriations acts were referenced explicitly in the spending cut provisions except for fy2003 in that year the spending cut was made applicable to the 11 regular appropriations acts covered by the omnibus measure but not to the defense and military construc tion appropriations acts which had been

to proportionality requirement or percentage limitation the fy2000 cut required that defense accounts be reduced uniformly with regard to nondefense accounts proportional cuts were not required but program project or activity ppa within an account could be reduced by more than 15 the cuts for the other five years required proportional reductions to all accounts and ppas fourth the size of the percentage cut was reduced significantly during the course of legislative action in two instances for fy2000 president cl inton first vetoed an appropriations act providing for 097 cut before agreeing to the omnibus legislation requiring 038 cut during consideration of the fy2003 omnibus legislation the senate at one point had endorsed 29 cut which ultimately was reduced to 065 in third instance for fy2005 the cut was reduced slightly from 083 to 080 as technical adjustment fifth the significance of the spending cuts differed with regard to budget enforcement the fy2000 cut was an integral component of the plan that successfully avoided sequester at the end of the session the fy2001 cut contributed to overall discretionary spending being below the statutory limits but the acrosstheboard proved to be unnecessary in avoiding sequester with regard to the fy2003 and fy2005 cuts the house and senate did not reach agreement on budget resolution for those years and the statutory discretionary limits longer were in effect nonetheless the acrosstheboard cut was necessar in adhering to an informal limit reached between congressional leaders and president bush and in avoiding veto of the omnibus appropriations legislation the fy2004 and fy2006 cuts contributed to keeping overall discretionary spending within constraints established by the budget resolutions for those years as modified by agreements between congressional leaders and president bush finally the fy2000 and fy2001 cuts instructed the omb director to report to congress in the presidents annual budget submission on the implementation of the reductions while the fy2004 and fy2006 cuts instructed the omb direct or to report such information to the house and senate appropriations committees within 30 days after enactment the fy2003 and fy2005 cuts did not include any reporting requirement g8g27g344g342g342g342g561 g4g158g141g144g142g157g138g155g162g561g5g152g151g157g142g161g157g561 as the federal budget process for fy2000 unfolded in 1999 during the first session of the 106th congress policy emerged of keeping the level of discretionary spending within the statutory limits while at the same time not using the social security surplus ie incurring an onbudget deficit11 one of the purposes in adhering to the discretionary spending limits was to avoid sequester at the end of the session12 in order to enhance its efforts in trying to stay within the discretionary spending limits congress and president clinton used various budgetary devices and techniques including emergency 11 this issue is discussed in more depth in crs report rl30353 discretionary spending limits and the social security surplus by robert keith 12 the application of the process for this fiscal year is explained in

mandatory programs obligation and payment delays and directed scoring13 these devices either resulted in upward adjustments in the limits as was the case with the emergency spending designations or were counted as savings for the fiscal year according to omb the adjustments and savings from these devices amounted to tens of billions of dollars and averted the need for sequester in the aggregate discretionary spending enacted for fy2000 was 16 billion under the budget authority limit and 35 billion under the outlay limit 14 the congressional budget office cbo also issued sequestration estimates but they were only advisory in nature only the determinations made by the omb director could have triggered sequester for fy2000 cbo indicated that discretionary spending exceeded the limits by 67 billion in budget authority and 152 billion in outlays which would have necessitated an acrosstheboard cut of about 4 15 one of the devices used to prevent the violation of the discretionary spending limits was the inclusion of an acrosstheboard cut in the omnibus appropriations act used to wrap up consideration of the regular appropriations acts for fy2000 according to estimates made by omb following the measures enactment the 038 cut was expected to yield savings of 2351 billion in budget authority and 1356 billion in outlays for the fiscal year16 in the final sequestration report for fy2000 omb increased its estimate of the savings in budget authority to 2357 billion the provision requiring an acrosstheboard spen ding cut was included in miscellaneous appropriations portion of the omnibus appropriat ions act that contained other offsets savings from the acrosstheboard cut combined with th savings from the other offsets amounted to 6827 billion in budget authority and 9465 billion in outlays for fy2000 without the enactment of the 038 spending cut or comparable offsets the fy2000 limit for discretionary budget authority would have been exceeded by about 08 billion and sequester would have occurred g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 house and senate interest in an acrosstheboard spending cut surfaced relatively late in the session after much of the annual appropriations process had been completed legislative action on acrosstheboard cut proposals encompassed several different annual appropriations measures beginning with s 1650 and including hr 3064 and hr 3194 the formulation of the proposal evolved through the different stages of legislative action from senseofthesenate statement to 097 cut and finally to 038

consideration of s 1650 its initial version of the laborhhseducation appropriations act for fy2000 on october 1 senator don nickles the assistant majority leader offered an amendment number 1851 to the bill stating the sense of the senate that an acrosstheboard cut in appropriations should be adopted if necessary to avoid incurring an onbudget deficit on october 6 he offered further amendment number 1889 to his underlying amendment amendment number 1889 was similar to the underlying amendment and focused on protecting social security surpluses stating the sense of the senate that congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an onbudget deficit excluding the surpluses generated by the social security trust funds by adopting an acrosstheboard reduction in all discretionary appropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit if necessary17 in describing his amendments senator nickles indicated that an acrosstheboard cut of 1 of discretionary appropriations might be needed to eliminate an estimated overage of about 5 billion other senators provided estimates that the overage might be much larger and that cut of 55 might be needed on october 6 the senate adopted amendment number 1889 by vote of 5446 after tabling another amendment dealing with the issue offered by senator frank lautenberg senator nickles withdrew his underlyi ng amendment the senate passed the bill the next day without an acrosstheboard cut provision g10g495g20g495g561g345g342g348g346g561 following veto by president clinton on september 28 of the first district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 the house and senate developed second version hr 3064 which also included the laborhhseducation appropriations for fy2000 the conferees on the measure inserted an acrosstheboard cut provision in section 1001 of division c of the act the house agreed to the conference report on the measure on october 28 by vote of 218211 the senate agreed to it on november 2 by vote of 4948 unlike the language that the senate had considered earlier section 1001 set in place the requirement for specific cut in discretionary appropriations097 of the total provided for each account the section also provided that the pay of members of congress permanent rather than an annual appropriation would be subject to the cut under the sequestration process the pay of members of congress was not subject to reduction senator ted stevens chairman of the senate appropriations committee described the provision as placeholderin the face of certain vetountil the final necessary reductions could be negotiated with the clinton administration we have included against my best wishes an acrosstheboard cut that is primarily because only the administration can identify some of the areas we can reduce safely without harming the programs and i am confident when we come to what we call the final period to devise bill we will work out with the administration

offsets section is deeply flawed it includes misguided 097 percent acrosstheboard reduction that will hurt everything from national defense to education and envir onmental programs the bill is clearly unacceptable i have submitted budget that would fund these priorities without spending the social security surplus and i am committed to working with the congress to identify acceptable offsets for

small acrosstheboard cut this cut was not necessary to reach the offset targets to make sure the bill was paid for more than enough money was available from other sources it is simply an attempt by the majority to create symbol that could be used to pretend that in the midst of this orgy of gimmickry in spending that they are continuing to be fiscally responsible congressional record daily ed vol 145 164 november 18 1999 p h12742 there was hardly any discussion of the provision during senate consideration of the conference report senator john mccain suggested that it represented an abdication of budgetary responsibility it resorts to an acrosstheboard budget cut to avoid dipping into the social security surplus rather than making the hard choices among other spending priorities23 in his statement made upon signing hr 3194 in to law on november 29 president clinton did not make any reference to the acrosstheboard cut24

in fashioning the 038 spending cut congress included several important features the text of the provision is provided in the 0 first reductions made pursuant to the provision were to take the form of rescissions of fy2000 budget authority ie appropriations and offsetting collections rescissions permanently cancel budget authority second the required spending cuts were to be applied only to the total discretionary budget authority made available to each department and agency any mandatory resources made available to department or agency eg permanent appropriations to fund an entitlement program would not be affected by the requirement third reductions were to be applied uniformly to each account for the department of defense and the defense activities of the department of energy except that reductions were to be made in military personnel accounts with regard to nondefense activities there was stated requirement that reductions be applied uniformly to each departments or agencys accounts however there was requirement that program project or activity ppa within an account be reduced by more than 15 25 finally the omb director was instructed to include in the presidents budget for fy2001 report specifying the reductions made to each account under the requirement unlike the earlier provision in hr 3064 providing for 097 cut pay for members of congress was not made subject to the reductions 23 see the remarks of senator john mccain in the congressional record daily ed vol 145 165 pt ii november 19 1999 p s15036 24 see his statement in the weekly compilation of

the act reductions should be taken from the least critical funding available to the agency reductions should be considered from enacted funding above the presidents request wherever possible reductions should be taken that would require reductions inforce and agencies should make targeted recommendations rather than an acrosstheboard funding cut the report required of the omb director was

the second session of the 106th congress president clinton and congress began the budget cycle for fy2001 by recommending discretion ary spending levels well above the existing statutory limits29 the assumption was made that the statutory limits eventually would be raised to accommodate the new levels the positions reflected in part the fact that spending for the prior fiscal year fy2000 was expected to exceed the existing limits for fy2001 by substantial margin and that estimates of the onbudget surp lus for fy2001 and subsequent years were larger than first anticipated the fy2001 budget resolution adopted by the house and senate in april 2000 envisioned total discretionary spending for the fiscal year at about 600 billion in budget authority and 625 billion in outlays during the following six months congress considered the regular appropriations acts for fy2001 without enacting the necessary revisions in the discretionary spending limits on october 18 2000 the republican leadership in congress proposed increasing the fy2001 limits in order to accommodate total discretionary spending of 637 billion in budget authority and 645 billion in outlays considerably more than had been envisioned by the budget resolution after brief period of negotiation between the parties the proposal was incorporated into the conference report on the foreign operations appropriations act for fy2001 which president clinton signed into law on november 6 pl 106429 the foreign operations appropriations act was the eighth of the 13 regular appropriations acts to be enacted for the fiscal year the increase in the limits provided by pl 106249 provided sufficient leeway for the house and senate to consider the remaining appropriations measures particularly the laborhhseducation appropriations act which was transformed into an omnibus appropriations act the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 the 106 th congress adjourned on december 15 2000 having completed the annual appropriations process for fy2001 the final sequestration report for fy2001 issued by the omb director on january 16 2001 indicated that discretionary spending in total was 6545 billion in budget authority and 2487 billion in outlays below the limits and that sequester was necessary 30 cbos advisory final 29 legislative action on discretionary spending for fy2001 is discussed in detail in crs

day by voice vote as initially sent to conference hr 4577 provided fy2001 appropriations only for the departments of labor health and human services and education in conference the coverage of the bill was expanded to cover the legislative branch and treasurypostal service appropriations bills prior to the national election negotiators from congress and the clinton administration reached tentative agreement on total spending included in the bill including funding level for laborhhseducation programs well in excess of the presidents request legislative consideration of the measure was delayed however in part because of lingering disagreement over an associated provision aling with the promulgation of an ergonomics regulation by the department of labor when house and senate conferees resumed their negotiations on hr 4577 after the election break they faced mounting concern over the cost of the bill and the level of fy2001 appropriations generally although the discretionary spending limits for fy2001 had been raised earlier in the session to accommodate fy2001 spending of about 640 billion many members expressed desire to hold total appropriations well below this level 33 in response to this concern the negotiators scaled back total appropriations by several billion dollars including significant reductions in appropriations for laborhhseducation

budgetary context for fy2003 differed quite mark edly in two key respects from the ones in effect for fy2000 and fy2001 first the statutor limits on discretionary spending expired at the end of fy2002 for the first time in more than decade congress and the president did not have to contend with the threat of discretionary spending sequester at the end of the session second the house and senate were unable to agree on budget resolution for fy2003 this marked only the second time in the history of the congressional budget process that the house and senate had failed to agree on budget resolution although the house put deeming resolution into effect as basis for the enforcement of discretionary spending and other budgetary levels the senate took comparable action 38 differences regarding the appropriate level of discretionary spending for fy2003the senate advocated spending about 9 billion more for discretionary programs than did the househelped stymie action on most of the regular appropriations acts during the 2002 session following the november elections which signaled that the repub licans would regain control of the senate in 2003 congressional leaders worked out plan with

included as part of substitute amendment offered by appropriations committee chairman stevens and agreed to by unanimous consent44 in its initial form the provision required an acrosstheboard cut of

consideration of the measure on january 17 senator robert byrd ranking minority member of the senate appropriations committee offered an amendment number 36 to strike it chairman stevens explained that the purpose of the spending cut was to accommodate two unforeseen needs while staying within the overall limit agreed to earlier with president bush the offsets listed in title vi which senator by rd would strike are offsets that are necessary to achieve basically two things one is the full funding for the amount that can be spent of the election reform bill in the 7¬Ω to 8 months that are remaining bill that is absolutely necessary to be funded and put into place if we are to avoid or at least try to avoid the problems of the election in the year 2000 secondly the tremendous drought disaster areas of the country demand help we faced problem of how to deal with that so we added the monies for drought and disaster to this bill and we offset it by an acrosstheboard cut in all programs 47 senator byrd explained that his objection to the acrosstheboard cut stemmed from his concern about its impact on wide range of domestic programs and his concern that discretionary spending should not be reduced to offset increases in mandatory spending included in the omnibus appropriations act this country is faced with cut of 29 percent or 114 billion in domestic spending this is technical adjustment this is real cut nor can it be characterized as capturing the savings from agencies operating under continuing resolution for 4 months dont you believe that the presidents budget for fiscal year 2003 was simply inadequate when it came to critical domestic programs approximately 4 b illion of the 114 billion acrosstheboard cut is included in the bill to pay for increased mandatory spending in medicare in assistance for needy families and for drought relief once we start down this road of paying for increases in mandatory programs by cutting domestic funding where will it stop 48 on february 13 2003 the house and senate agreed to the conference report on hjres 249 during consideration of the conference report house members did not address the acrosstheboard cut in the senate chairman stevens indicated that various concessions had been made that allowed the acrosstheboard cut to be reduced from 29 down to 065 while retaining increased spending for several crucial items incl uding aid for agricultural disasters he further indicated that the 065 cut was necessary to keep the cost of the measure within the limit negotiated with president bush thereby avoiding veto there is 65 percent acrosstheboard cut to all discretionary accounts in this bill to assure that the total remains within the top line that was agreed to by myself house chairman bill young and the president this is an arbitrary line i will admit but in order to get the bill signed if we joined them together it was my judgment we could not risk final veto from 47 see the remarks of

discretionary spending which had expired at the end of fy2002 had not been renewed congress and the president therefore did not have to deal with the possibility of discretionary spending sequester at the end of the session second the house and senate were unable to agree on budget resolution for the third time in the history of the congressional budget process conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution which recommended total discretionary appropriations for the year of 821 billion was filed in the house on may 19 hrept 108498 although the house agreed to the conference report on may 19 the senate did not consider it the house considered the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution under the terms of special rule hres 649 hrept 108500 may 19 2004 the special rule was

spending ceilings and revenue floors as well as allocations of spending to committees for the two months following house action on the deeming resolution provision the senate did not consider the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution nor act on deeming resolution during this period however senate action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2005 was subject to ceiling of 814 billion on total appropriations for that year included in the prior years budget resolution which remained in effect the 814 billion ceiling for fy2005 presented the senate with two problems first the conference agreement on the fy2005 budget resolution revised the recommended level of appropriations for that fiscal year upward by 7 billion to new total of 821 billion in order for the senate to consider regular appropriations acts for fy2005 at level comparable to house action the 7 billion difference would have to be accommodated through procedure such as designating an equivalent amount of appropriations to be emergency spending course of action that was considered less desirable second the 814 billion ceiling applied to total appropriations only it did not provide basis for the enforcement of spending levels during the consideration of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32153g3g140g155g152g156g156g556g157g145g142g556 g4g152g138g155g141g561g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g561g5
