some congressional opponents of pntr legislation charged that china could not be trusted to implement the wto agreements based on the contention that china had failed to fully comply with the terms of past trade agreements made with the united states other analysts contended that while chinas compliance with trade agreements had been less than perfect it did make important strides in fulfilling its trade obligations with the united states they further contended that the wtos dispute resolution mechanism would provide more effective means for the united states to deal with trade disputes than relying on unilateral measures in order to ensure chinas full compliance with its wto commitments many members of congress called for the establishment of special mechanisms that would closely monitor chinas compliance with its wto commitments such measures were included in the final version of hr 4444 which passed both houses and became law on october 10 2000 this report addresses five major trade

years has been conducting negotiations with several wto members including the united states to join the world trade organization wto the multilateral trade agency that sets rules for most trade major progress was made towards chinas wto accession when the united states and china reached bilateral agreement on november 15 1999 that would require china following wto accession to substantially lower

finish talks with the wto working party handling chinas wto application before vote can be taken in the wto to admit china on october 10 2000 president clinton signed into law hr 4444 pl 106 268 bill that would grant pntr status to china upon its accession to the wto the act among other things included provisions to establish mechanisms to monitor and promote chinas complia nce with its wto commitments major factor in congressional debate over pntr legislation was whether china could be trusted to fully implement its wto commitments and what kind of monitoring and enforcement provisions if any were needed to ensure compliance some opponents of pntr charged that china had poor record of complying with past trade agreements it has made with the united states and therefore could not be trusted to abide by its wto commitments many proponents of pntr for china argued that china had generally complied with many or most aspects of the trade agreements especially in cases where chinas compliance was closely monitored and us pressure was brought to bear when compliance was deemed lacking they also contended that the wto dispute resolution mechanism would provide an effective means to ensure chinas compliance with its wto trade commitments according to the us department of commerce since 1979 the united states and china have concluded 14 trade agreements including the november 1999 bilateral trade agreement on chinas accession to wto1 this report addresses five major trade issues and related trade agreements between the united states and china 1 the 1979 trade agreement

throughout this report 3 the agreement must also contain provisions pertaining to possible termination of the agreement such as due to national security interests safeguard arrangements protection of intellectual property rights arrangements for the settlement of comm ercial disputes arrangements for the promotion of trade and procedures for consultations over the agreement title iv also requires that certain freedom of emigration requirem ents under the socalled jacksonvanik amendment be met before mfn status is restored 4 in addition the jacksonvanik requirements must be met on an annual basis 5 such certification does not require that china afford the united states the same trade treatment that the united states gives to chinese products eg china does not have to charge the same tariffs on goods from the united states that the united states charges on imports from china instead it requires china to give the same treatment to us imports that it gives to other countries 6 see

agreements it also discusses issues arising from concerns over how to ensure chinas compliance with its trade commitments relating to its accession to the wto if and when it enters the wto including legislative proposals that were introduced in the 106th congress to address these issues the 1979 agreement on trade relations between the united states and china us mfn status for china was suspended by specific legislation in 1951 that status was restored in 1980 on conditional basis based on the requirements of title iv of the 1974 trade act as amended which establishes requirements for restoring and maintaining mfn status for certain nonmarket economies whose mfn status was suspended by law one of the requirements for restoring mfn status is the conclusion of bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides mutual nondiscriminatory or mfn treatment3 the united states and china reached such an agreement in july 1979 which entered in force in february 1980 after the conditions under title iv had been met and the agreement received congressional approval in order for chinas mfn status to remain in effect the president must every three years certify that satisfactory balance of trade concessio ns has been maintained during the life of the agreement and that actual or foreseeable reductions in us tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are reciprocated4 the president has made such certifications for china triennially5 the most recent extension was made on january 30 1998 and runs through january 20016

from 38 billion in 1980 to 131 billion in 1999 china was the 12th largest us export market in 1999 and was an important market for several us export industries such as aircraft and machinery still many analysts argue that us exports to china would be substantially higher if trade restrictions were removedin 1996 letter to representative nancy pelosi us trade representative ustr charlene barshefsky stated that the 1979 uschina bilateral agreement on trade relations is the foundation of the us economic relationship with china and includes basic rules for conducting commercial transactions between our countries these rules encompass matters ranging from customs rules and procedures to providing facilities for banking and financial transactions to business facilitation activities and ensuring that we receive mfn treatment under laws affecting the sale purchase distribution and use of imported products in our domestic markets key element of the 1979 agreement is the obligation to exchange information and consult on problems arising in our bilateral trade relationship the united states has been able to call upon this commitment to initiate consultations to resolve trade disputes with china 7 many members of congress have questioned whet her the united states is receiving satisfactory balance of trade concessions from china they cite the sharp deterioration in the us balance of trade with china which went from 27 billion surplus in 1980 to 687 billion deficit in 1999 see table 1 many argue that chinas pervasive trade barriers restrictive investment policie s and failure to protect us intellectual property rights ipr in china substantially diminish us trade and investment opportunities in china while us markets are open to chinese goods and they have pressed the executive branch to take action against china such as utilizing us trade laws eg section 301 and special 301 to induce china to eliminate such unfair trade practices8

phytosanitary and veterinary standards that create unnecessary obstacles to trade and failure to publish laws regulations judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application pertaining to customs requirements restrictions or prohibitions on imports or affecting their sale or distribution in china the section 301 case against china was highly unusual due to its breadth of coverage most section 301 cases involve investigations of certain trade restrictions on specific products however the china section 301 case was the most sweeping market access investigation in the ustrs history it was essentially aimed at substantially reforming chinas entire trade regime in addition the ustr linked us support for chinas reentry into the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to successful resolution of the trade dispute9 on aug 21 1992 the ustr determined that negotiations had failed to resolve the trade dispute and threatened to impose 39 billion in us trade sanctions unless an agreement was reached by oct 10 1992 the proposed sanctions were the highest level ever issued by the ustr under section 301 case china in turn threatened retaliation against comparable level of us products on oct 10 1992 the united states and china reached an agreement settling the section 301 case under memorandum of understanding mou china pledged to 1 reduce or eliminate wide variety of trade barriers over the next five years according to specific timetables including tariffs quotas import restrictions import licenses covering over 1200 products 2 take

phytosanitary sps regulations on agricultural products based on sound science within one year and remove discriminatory standards and testing requirements on nonagricultural products for its part the united states pledged to staunchly support chinas entry into the gatt and to reduce export controls on computer and telecommunications equipment exports to china10 in late 1993 the ustr charged that china had failed to implement the market access agreement and warned that the united states would impose trade sanctions against china unless it took steps to abide by the agreement by the end of the year11 us state department report stated that by december 31 1993 china had lowered tariffs on 2898 items and had eliminated nontariff restrictions on 283 itemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30555crs6 12 us

that nontransparency was one of the most cited problems of doing business in china by us firms survey by gao in the case of nontariff barriers gao observed that china removed some barriers but then instituted new ones 15 gao uschina trade implementation of agreemen ts on market access and intellectual property january 1995 pp 1825 16 ibid p 31in addition in june 1994 china eliminated 208 nontariff barriers including number ahead of or in addition to the schedule set in the mou12 failure on the part of china to gain status as founding member of the wto at the end of 1994 led china to subsequently announce that it would longer abide by the market access agreement because of the us position on conditions for chinas entry into the wto however following the signing of the uschinese agreement on ipr in march 1995 see below us and chinese officials announced that an agreement had been reached in which china would resume its implementation of the 1992 market access mou by the end

1992 agreement based on interviews with us government and industry officials gao stated that the chinese government had complied overall with the provisio ns regarding transparency and tariff and nontariff barriers although number of significant problems remained in these areas14 according to the report ustr officials told gao that they believed that china longer maintained import substitution polices however gao noted the growing pressure from the chinese government to force foreign firms to increase local content ie the share of the value of the product made locally for certain operations in china gao found that chinas implementation of the agricultural standards provisions had been slow and that china continued to use such barriers to restrict us imports15 finally gao noted that resistence to central government regulations by provincial and local governments as well as central government ministries seeking to protect the industries under their jurisdiction impeded the full implementation of the market access mou 16 in congressional testimony in 1996 then acting ustr charlene barshefsky drew similar conclusions over chinas compliance with the 1992 mou on market access

removed on schedule 21 ustr 1998 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers 1998 p48agreement such as eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and making its trade regime more transparent however compliance in other areas was lacking while china has remov ed substantial number of nontariff barriers we are concerned with chinas tendency to give with one hand and take away with the other in some instances china has substituted new barriers in the place of those removed for example quotas have been replaced with tendering requirements or registration requirements in sectors such as medical equipment and film new regulations have prevented the market access we anticipated as result of the 1992 agreement china must live up to its agreement and eliminate those impediments to fair trade 17 barshefsky also criticized china for failure to remove trade barriers on us agricultural products such as wheat and citrus as specified under the agreement saying if i could pick one area under it where we are dissatisfied seriously dissatisfied i would say it is in the agricultural sector18 the 1992 market access mou was supposed to have been fully implemented by december 31 1997 the ustrs 1998 foreign trade barriers report made the following observations on areas where chinas compliance with the market access was lacking19 nontariff barriers china has generally met the requirements of the 1992 mou to remove various explicit nontariff barriers on products specified under the mou20 however china still maintains large number of nonta riff administrative controls such as registration requirements to implement its industrial policies which tend to act as new facto licensing requirement about 400 of the products covered by the 1992 agreement are subje ct to these registration requirements21 transparency while china has significantly improved the transparency of its trade regime since 1992 several problems remain for example the coverage of chinese trade publications of newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30555crs8 22 ibid p 48 23 ibid p 49 the 2000 ustr foreign trade barriers report stated that china had also developed import substitution policies for generic medicines telecommunications equipment and power generating equipment 24 these issues were reportedly resolved in april 1999 when the united states and china reached an agreement on agricultural cooperation china agreed to immediately remove import restrictions on us pacific northwest wheat citrus and meat products however according to us officials china has only recently begun to implement the agreement see us department of agriculture release march 22 2000 25 ibid pp 5051regulations is often incomplete and not always timely us firms often have difficulty learn ing which regulations apply to their operations in china22 the lack of regulatory transparency and few implementing regulations continue to inhibit the entry of foreign goods and services moreover publication of traderelated laws and regulations does not always precede implementation for example information on chinas import quotas crucial for foreign and domestic traders has yet to be published on an itemized basis import substitution laws china claims that it longer utilizes impo rt substitution policies however in 1994 the chinese government announced an auto indus try policy that included import substitution requirements the government policy directed that autos and auto parts should be purchased from chinese producers and that all automotive and component manufacturers in china should strive for complete localization of production the policy required producers to include minimum amount of local materials and value added work in their final products foreign joint venture vehicle assemblers are required to begin with 40 local content achieve 60 by the second year of production and 80 the following year in 1996 the government issued policies on pharmaceutical pricing that discriminated against foreign producers and embodied an import substitution policy23 sanitary and phytosanitary sps issues since 1992 china has made some progress in removing sps restrictions on certa in us agricultural items through the signing of bilateral protocols for live horses apples from washington oregon and idaho ostric hes bovine embryos swine and cattle cherries from washington and grapes from california however sps measures continued to bar impor ts of us citrus plums and pacific northwest wheat24 in addition chinas standards system often lacks transparency and is unevenly applied ie different standards are used for imports from different countries and standards for imports differ from those applied to domestically produced products finally many such standards are not based on sound science25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30555crs9 26 the ustr annually issues threetier list of countries which are considered to maintain inadequate regimes for the

sanctions 2 priority watch list countries which are considered to have serious deficiencies in their ipr regime but do not currently warrant section 301 investigation and 3 watch list countries which have been identified because they maintain ipr practices or barriers to market access that are of particular concern but do not yet warrant higher level designations in addition the ustr has made

foreign countries that fail to provide adequate and effective protection of us ipr such as patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets or deny fair and equitable market access to us firms that rely on ipr protection the ustr is directed to seek negotiations with the priority nations to end such violations and if necessary impose trade sanctions the 1979 uschina bilateral trade agreement calls for each natio n to offer copyright patent and trademark protection equal to the protection correspondingly accorded in the other country in 1985 us officials expressed concern over ipr protection in china during talks held under the auspices of the uschinese joint commission on commerce and trade jcct and similar concerns were raised in market access negotiations begun in 1987 concerns over chinese ipr protection led the ustr to place china on its special 301 priority watch list in 1989 and 199026 the 1992 ipr agreement in april 1991 china along with india and thailand was named as priority foreign country under special 301 and in may 1991 the ustr began section 301 investigatio n of four specific deficiencies in chinas ipr practices 1 failure to provide product patent

enforcement of ipr part of its anticrime campaign and has been conducting nationwide antipiracy campaign however the ustr noted that resistence from the provincial and local level has undermined

the past two years has mostly lived up to their obligations under the 1995 agreement and the 1996 action plan to close down pirate optical media production and halt exports however idsa noted that ipr piracy in chinas domestic markets remains serious problem estimating the rate of ipr piracy for computer and video games at 95 and costing us firms 13 billion annually of particular concern to idsa has been massive increase in imports into china from such sources as hong kong and taiwan of pirate products which has acted to offset many of the gains made in closing illegal plants in china the idsa has also stated that china uses vague cultural standards to restrict certain imports36 finally idsa noted that ipr enforcement remained serious problem however the idsa states the fact that enormous pirac and market access problems in china persist does not mean that china is not taking the problem more seriously or that progress has been made or that there is not an improved attitude in china toward addressing the issue to the contrary we believe there has been progress and there are signs china recognizes additional steps are required37 the iipa estimates that ipr piracy in china cost us firms 17 billion in lost sales in 1999an improvement over 1998 losses which were estimated at 26 billion however while china has continued to maintain significant enforcement actions against ipr piracy the iipa states that such enforcement is hampered by the failure of the government to take sufficient action against criminal followed by deterrent penalties against well organized pirates iipa notes that china has largely ceased exporting pirated products but has developed major domestic piracy problem along with an increase in pirated imports in addition the piracy rate for music and sound recordings rose from 56 in 1998 to 90 in 199938 in 1999 the us embassy in beijing reported that chinas ipr efforts had produced mixed results china has made significant progress in protecting intellectual property rights ipr but still faces major problems on the one hand respectable but not perfect ipr legal system is in place along with government agencies handling copyright patent

agreed to allow the united states to utilize special safeguard provision once china entered the wto until 2008 that would allow it to impose restraints on textile and apparel imports from china if such imports caused market disruptions to us domestic producers 44 while hong kong and macau are now part of china they maintain autonomy over their economic systems the united states maintains separate textile quota agreements with themthe us embassy observed that despite improvements in ipr protection in china ipr violations continue on massive scale it was noted that effective enforcement action is often hampered by local protectionism lack of training of judicial officials and corruption40 in reaction to continued ipr problems over 20 us companies in china recently formed an informal coalition to draw the attention of chinese and us government authorities to the counterfeiting problem in china and to propose ways of streng thening enforcement these companies estimate their annual losses due to counterfeiting at over 1 billion limited market access for products such as foreign movies and computer software and relatively small fines for persons convicted of piracy are viewed as major incentives for smugglers and counterfeiters some us companies have devoted considerable ontheground resources to combating ipr violations with mixed results41 for example gillette china which

to inspect chinese factories and if china repeatedly circumvented the agreement by shipping goods through other countries impose penalties against chinese quotas equal to three times the amount of the transshipment46 evidence of transshipments has led the united states on number of occasions to reduce chinas textile quotas on certain products between 1994 and 1996 the united states imposed 80 million in charges against chinas textile quotas including approximately 19 million in punitive triple charges against chinas 1996 quota allowance the 1997 agreement also allowed the united states to impose triple charges if evidence of extensive transshipment was found on may 5 1998 the ustr announced that it would impose 5 million in triple charges against chinas textile quotas due to persistent chinese textile transshipments ustr official testified in june 1998 that the chinese government appears to be making progress in preventing transshipment47 the 1997 us china textile agreement contained market access provision china agreed to reduce and bind ie they cannot be increased in the future tariffs at applied rates and to ensure that nontariff barriers do not impede the achievement of improved access china agreed to phase in the tariff cuts beginning by december 31 1997 and ending by december 31 2000 with most cuts occurring in 1997 and 1998 an official from the department of commerce stated that overall china has complied with these tariff reductions with few minor exceptions out of about 900 tariff lines48 to date however it does not appear that chinas tariff reductions have had significant impact on us textile and apparel exports to china as indicated in table 2 us textile and apparel exports to china fell from 8716 million in 1997 to 8657 million in 1998 the first

according to us officials chinas initial implementation of the agreement was spotty chinese officials were slow to respond to us requests for information and to visit suspected sites51 the united states sought to establish specific guidelines for the implementation of the mou this led to the signing of statement of cooperation soc on march 14 1994 that among other things included timetables for responding to requests for information and site visits to production facilities suspected of exporting prison labor products according to the us state department the soc fostered more productive relationship between us customs and the chinese ministry of justice52 between march 1994 and april 1995 customs was allowed to visit five facilities in china but china turned down several other

54 provisions to promote chinese wto trade compliance ensuring chinas full compliance with its wto obligations if and when it joins the wto became an important factor in congressional debate over whether to extend pntr status to china many members expressed concerned over whether the chinese government would be willing as well as able to fully implement the trade liberalization measures it agreed to in order to join the wto for example some analysts contended that wto reforms in the short run could cause widespread employment disruptions in china as many inefficient chinese firms are forced into bankruptcy due to increased foreign competition they argued that order to maintain social stabili ty the chinese government might decide to delay or roll back the implementation of economic reforms other analysts contended that the rule of law is very weak in china and that it might be very difficult for the central government to ensure that local government officials as well trade and industry ministers in the central government implement rules and regulations that are consistent with chinas wto obligations another concern expressed was that china might as it did in the past remove barriers specified under the wto trade agreements but then attempt to replace them with new barriers not specifically addressed by those agreements in response to question to secretary of

to the wto second it authorizes additional appropriations for the us departments of commerce state and agriculture and the ustrs office to help fund efforts to monitor chinas wto compliance and third

officials have stated on number of occasions that chinas compliancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30555crs20 58 for example see ustr micke kantor statement to the uschina business council january 31 1996 p

northwest wheat although it has only recently implemented the agreement see crs report rs20169 agriculture and chinas accession to the world trade organization by charles hanrahan jan 11 2000 with its trade agreements has been mixed or somewhat mixed58 ustr charlene barshefsky argues that china has generally implemented its trade agreements most satisfactorily when its obligations were concrete specific and open to monitoring59 the united states appears to have had initial success with its prison labor agreements with china however the chinese government appears to have been less cooperative in recent years it has not permitted us site visits since 1997 despite repeated us requests china appears to have for the most part abided by the market access provisi ons of the 1997 textile agreement however to date that agreement does not appear to have produced significant increase in us textile and apparel exports to china china appears to have implemented significant portion of the 1992 market access agreement60 however it failed to remove all unscientificallybased standards on certain agricultural products in addition china sometimes removed one barrier only to replace it with another and while transparency of trade laws was improved it still remains problem finally in the case of ipr protection china in 1992 agreed to enact new ipr laws however enforc ement of those laws was weak prompting the united states to threaten sanctions china took new steps to strengthen ipr enforcement however such steps were deemed inadequate by the united states which again in 1996 threatened sanctions china responded with increased raids against illegal production facilities and smuggling of iprrelated products and made limited improvements in market access for foreign iprrelated industries however despite vastly improved legal and enforcement ipr regim us officials state that ipr violations continue on massive scale obtaining full compliance with trade agreements appears to have been hampered by variety of factors including chinese policies to promote and protect certain industries lack of resources by chinese government agencies to enforce trade rules and regulations official government corruption resistence from the provincial and local level who often impose trade barriers against chinese products from outside their localities as well and mutual differences over what constitutes compliance the us experience with china over its compliance with past trade agreements should be considered in the context of the us experience with other countries problems with obtaining full compliance with trade agreements has not only been problem for the united states in its trade relationship with china but also with its dealings with several other trading partners as well for example the american chamber of commerce in japan surveyed 63 trade agreements between the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30555crs21 61 the american chamber of commerce in japan making trade talks work 2000 p 17states and japan reached between 1980 and 1999 the chamber determined that based on such factors as content implementation and results 53 of the agreements were fully successful or mostly successful but 47 of the agreements were either only partially successful successful in one or two areas or were unsuccessful61 the extent of chinas compliance with its wto obligations could have number of important implications for china full implementation of wto reforms could cause difficult shortterm adjustments for many chinese industrial and agricultural sectors and could displace millions of workers however over the long run such reforms will promote greater economic efficiency and hence more rapid economic growth thus the biggest winner of chinas wto reforms would likely be china itself however if the shortterm effects of the chinese economy are too severe the chinese government might seek to delay the implementation of its wto agreements similarly local government officials or central government ministries hoping to protect industries under their jurisdiction or control might attempt to circumvent chinas wto commitments many analysts are concerned that chinese noncompliance with wto trade rules and agreements could undermine the wto as multilateral institution and international support for free trade especially if noncompliance was widespread and extensive and could not be adequately dealt with in the wto for example chinese noncompliance could result in the wto dispute resolution body being swamped with multiple trade complaints brought against china which could hamper the ability of the wto to resolve trade disputes in timely manner conversely if wto members failed to take aggressive action against chinese noncompliance it might undermine international support for the wto for failing to enforce trade rules and for free trade in general eg if china does not comply with wto trade rules why should other members do so some analysts have argued that special mechanism should be established within the wto to monitor chinas complia nce with wto rules in order to maintain pressure on the chinese government to keep its commitments as well as to deal with compliance problems in their early stages rather than bringing multiple trade dispute cases before the wto for resolution other analysts have contended that in addition to monitoring and enforcement efforts the united states and other developed wto coun tries should provide extensive technical assistance to china to help it bring its trade regime in line with wto rules
