protection act of 2000 pl 106224 november 13 2000 ralph m chite specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress federal crop insurance and the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 summary on june 20 2000 the president signed into law the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 hr 2559 which reduces significantly the farmer cost of acquiring crop insurance policy beginning in the 2001 crop year pl 106224 is estimated to add 82 billion in new federal spending for the federal crop insurance program over the next 5 years fy20012005 in order to attract more farmers into the program and lessen the need for ad hoc disaster assistance from 1994 through 1999 the federal government spent an average of 15 billion per year on crop insurance subsidies and program costs the government pays the full cost of the premium for catastrophic cat coverage and pays portion of the premium for higher levels of coverage private insurance companies sell and service the policies but are reinsured by the government for most of their losses and expenses major reforms were made to the crop insurance program in 1994 in hopes of permanently replacing expensive ad hoc disaster payment programs with more heavily subsidized crop insurance program overall farmer participation in the program had increased in recent years but not enough to forestall the perceived need for ad hoc disaster payments moreover the enactment of series of multibillion dollar farm financial assistance packages in both fy1999 and in fy2000 encouraged the 106th congress to consider further modifications to the crop insurance program opposition to crop insurance enhancement came from those concerned that increased premium subsidies encourage further overproduction and pricedepressing surpluses and bring environmentally fragile land into production pl 106224 addresses many problems with the crop insurance program that were identified by several farm and insurance industry groups most of the new spending authorized by the bill is to be used to increase the portion of the premium paid by the government on behalf of the producer for insurance coverage higher than the cat level and for the first time to subsidize portion of the additional cost of revenue insurance products pl 106224 also provides improved coverage for farmers affected by multiple years of natural disasters authorizes pilot insurance programs for livestock farmers and growers of other farm commodities that are currently not served by crop insurance gives the private sector greater representation on the crop insurance policymaking board and eases eligibility requirements for permanent disaster payment program for noninsurable farmers among many other provisions the fy2001 budget resolution hconres 290 made room for the new spending required by pl 106224 the resolution permitted new agricultural program

protection act of 2000 background farming is commonly viewed as an inherently risky enterprise in their operations farmers are exposed to both production risks and price risks farm production levels can vary significantly from year to year primarily because farmers operate at the mercy of nature and frequently are subjected to weatherrelated and other natural disasters farm operators can also experience wide swings in the prices they receive for the commodities they grow depending on total production levels and demand conditions both domestically and internationally since farm income is primarily determined by the combination of production and prices annual farm income therefore can be volatile over the years the federal government has played an active role in helping to temper the effects of risk on farm income on the production side the government has widely expanded coverage and increased the subsidy of the federal crop insurance program to help mitigate price risk the government for many years administered price and income support programs for producers of major field crops beginning in the 1970s and up until 1996 these commodity support programs provided direct payments to participating producers when market prices fell below governmentset target price however the omnibus 1996 farm bill pl 104127 terminated target price deficiency payments for wheat feed grains cotton and rice growers and replaced them with fixed but declining 7year annual contract payments that are longer tied to market prices consequently farmers needed to assume greater responsibility for managing their price risk pilot projects were authorized by the 1996 farm bill to develop revenue insurance income protection products as part of the federal crop insurance program confluence of several events caused many farm groups and policymakers to call for reexamination of federal farm risk management programs especially the crop insurance program in late 1997 prices for many of the major farm commodities declined significantly causing drop in farm income for many producers also over the last several years some regions experienced multiple years of natural disasters which limited crop production and reduced farm income many farm groups complained that the thencurrent crop insurance program provided inadequate coverage for producers when natural disasters strike many also contended that the 1996 farm bill did not provide sufficient countercyclical income protection for farmers when farm commodity prices are low as they have been since 1997 in response to farm group pleas for assistance nearly 6 billion emergency farm financial assistance package pl 105277 the fy1999 omnibus appropriations crs2 act was enacted in 1998 to address losses caused by low prices and natural disasters half of this amount went to contract payment recipients in the form of direct income support most of the balance was paid to any producer including contract holders who experienced either 1998 crop loss or multiple years of losses caused by natural disaster another 87 billion financial assistance package was enacted as part of the fy2000 agriculture appropriations act pl 10678 as many commodity prices remained low in 1999 the large price tag associated with these assistance packages and others being proposed and subsequently enacted prompted the 106th congress to consider major modifications to the current federal crop insurance program and seek ways to enhance available risk management tools so that future ad hoc financial and disaster assistance programs might be avoided for more on emergency farm assistance see crs report rs20269 emergency funding for agriculture brief history of congressional action fy1989fy2001 crop insurance basics the federal crop insurance program is administered by the us department of agricultures usda risk management agency rma the program is designed to protect crop producers from unavoidable risks associated with adverse weather plant diseases and insect infestations insurance policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that have their losses reinsured by usda whether or not crop is covered under the program is an administrative decision made by usda the decision is made on cropbycrop and countybycounty basis based on farmer demand for coverage and the level of risk associated with the crop in the region among other factors most of the major crops wheat corn other feed grains cotton and rice are covered in nearly every county in which they are grown fruits vegetables and other specialty crops are also covered but availability of coverage varies by region in total approximately 70 crops are covered there are four sources of federal costs for the crop insurance program usda absorbs large percentage of the program losses the difference between premiums collected and indemnities paid out subsidizes portion of the premium paid by participating producers compensates the reinsured companies for portion of their operating and administrative expenses and pays the salaries and expenses of the rma see table 1 under the program participating producer is assigned 1 normal crop yield based on the producers actual production history and 2 price for his commodity based on estimated market conditions the producer can then select percentage of his normal yield to be insured and percentage of the price he wishes to receive when crop losses exceed the selected loss threshold the producer pays premium that increases as the levels of insurable yield and price coverage rise however all eligible producers can receive catastrophic cat coverage without paying any premium the premium for this level of coverage is completely subsidized by the federal government the farmer pays an administrative fee for cat coverage 60 per crop per county in 2000 rising to 100 in crop year 2001 under pl 106224 and in crs3 return can receive payment equal to 55 of the estimated market price of the crop on losses in excess of 50 of normal yield table 1 government cost of federal crop insurance in thousand net program adminis other losses or premium expense

management agency crs4 any producer who opts for cat coverage has the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage from private crop insurance company for an additional premium paid by the producer and partially subsidized by the government producer can buy up the 5055 catastrophic coverage to any equivalent level of coverage between 50100 and 75100 ie up to 75 of normal crop yield and 100 of the estimated market price in limited areas mainly the northern plains production can be insured up to the 85100 level of coverage buyup option that has been available since 1997 on pilot basis on major crops and has been quite popular is revenue insurance revenue insurance combines the production guarantee component of crop insurance with price guarantee to create target farm revenue guarantee for crop farmer under revenue insurance programs participating producers are assigned target level of revenue based on market prices for the commodity and the producers production history an insured farmer who opts for revenue insurance can receive an indemnity payment when his actual farm revenue falls below certain percentage of the target level of revenue regardless of whether the shortfall is caused by low prices or low production levels for farmers who grow crop that is not insurable under the federal crop insurance program usda has permanent authority to make direct payments to farmers under the noninsured assistance program nap nap provides payments equal to the catastrophic level of insurance coverage 55 of the market price paid on losses in excess of 50 of normal yields pros and cons of crop insurance enhancement legislation in recent years surveys have shown that nearly twothirds of eligible acreage was enrolled in the crop insurance program however prior to 1999 quarter of all eligible acreage was enrolled only in the fullysubsidized catastrophic cat coverage which is the most basic level of coverage designed to minimally protect producers against major disaster although farmers are encouraged to purchase buyup coverage to further protect against production risks only about 40 of eligible acreage was enrolled in buyup coverage throughout most of the 1990s participation rates for buyup coverage improved in crop years 1999 and 2000 primarily because nearly 400 million in additional premium subsidies were pumped into the program each year on an ad hoc basis through various emergency supplemental bills when the 106th congress was considering modifications to the crop insurance program many farm groups argued that bolstering participation in crop insurance should be high priority if crop insurance is affordable and provides adequate coverage supporters contend it would forestall political pressure for expensive ad hoc disaster payment bills each year many farm groups also wanted the current revenue insurance programs to be made more widely available especially in light of current low commodity prices and the elimination of target price deficiency payments for major commodities for the most part the strongest supporters of crop insurance crs5 enhancements were producers in the plains states and other regions that are prone to drought and other recurring disasters others were concerned that applying any more federal money to crop insurance might not be fiscally prudent especially since program reforms in 1994 did not preclude the enactment of multibillion dollar emergency financial assistance packages for farmers in fy1999 and fy20001 critics argued that new federal money should be channeled into crop insurance until more thorough investigation was conducted of whether crop insurance is the proper federal risk management tool critics also argued that reform of the federal program might be caught in catch22 the federal program will not be improved until participation improves say critics but participation will not increase as long as ad hoc disaster payments are regularly made available others are concerned that increased crop insurance subsidies will promote overproduction which could potentially depress farm commodity prices and cause environmentally sensitive land to be entered into production brief legislative history of crop insurance in the 106th congress over the last several years the federal crop insuance program was scrutinized by the administration the house and senate agriculture committees and various farmer and insurance industry groups to identify any shortcomings that might have been discouraging farmer participation series of hearings was conducted on crop insurancerisk management issues in both the house and senate agriculture committees in 1999 the risk management subcommittee of the house agriculture committee completed markup of comprehensive legislation hr 2559 on july 21 1999 full house committee action was completed on august 3 1999 hr 2559 was passed by voice vote on september 29 1999 the budget parameters for legislative changes were established by the fy2000 budget resolution hconres 68 which provided 6 billion reserve fund for any reported legislation that provided risk management or income assistance for agricultural producers in fy2001 through fy2004 see budget implications of the crop insurance legislation below in the senate several crop insurance bills including s 1580 robertskerrey were introduced to address many of the perceived problems with the federal crop insurance program s 1580 made modifications to the crop insurance program similar to hr 2559 senate agriculture committee chairman richard lugar who strongly opposed s 1580 stated that increased subsidies for crop insurance are not the most efficient way to encourage farmers to manage their risk instead he introduced legislation s 1666 that would have made direct payment to any 1 they pointed out that the 1994 reforms infused 1 billion per year of new spending and required producers who opt out of crop insurance to sign waiver disqualifying them from receiving any future disaster payments disaster assistance provisions in subsequent appropriations acts have allowed producers to receive disaster payments irrespective of the waivers crs6 insurable producer who adopts two of several risk management strategies lack of consensus between supporters of s 1580 and s 1666 led to several month delay in consideration of markup bill at march 2 2000 markup senator lugar offered chairmans mark that blended the primary component of his bill with that of the robertskerrey bill among its many provisions the chairmans mark would have given farmers choice between receiving an additional crop insurance premium subsidy or receiving direct payment in return for adopting two risk management strategies in addition to the purchase of crop insurance policy these options included entering into futures option or forward contract enrolling in risk management education program reducing farm indebtedness diversifying crop production or contributing portion of the payment into taxdeductible trust fund as substitute to the chairmans mark senators roberts and kerrey offered modified version of their bill which was adopted by the full committee by 108 vote on march 2 2000 and subsequently numbered s 2251 s 2251 as amended on the senate floor was adopted by the full senate on march 23 2000 the senatepassed measure was similar to the housepassed bill in that most of the new spending would have increased the government subsidy and reduce the farmer cost of purchasing an insurance policy additionally s 2251 reserved 500 million over 3year period for direct payments to producers who adopted two of several prescribed risk management strategies in lieu of receiving crop insurance subsidy managers amendment to s 2251 was adopted on the senate floor among its many provisions it addressed some additional concerns of states that have low participation rate in the federal crop insurance program conference action on the two measures was completed on may 25 2000 with the house approving the agreement by voice vote and the senate passing the measure by vote of 914 see major crop insurance provisions of the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 below for more information meanwhile the fy2000 agriculture appropriations act pl 10678 was signed into law on october 22 1999 the measure contained emergency spending of 400 million for usda to offer premium discount to all farmers who purchased crop insurance in the 2000 crop year similar provision was contained in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 which enabled usda to reduce the farmerpaid premium by nearly 30 in the 1999 crop year during the congressional debate the administration did not offer legislative proposals to modify crop insurance however the administrations views on crop insurance issues were contained in two documents feb 1 1999 white paper entitled strengthening the farm safety net the administrations principles and preliminary proposals for reforming crop insurance available at httpwwwusdagovnewsreleases199902crop and usda testimony before congress additional crop insurance proposals were subsequently offered by the administration as part of its safety net initiative released with its fy2001 budget request on february 7 2000 among the major risk management provisions in the initiative were anticipated legislative proposals to 1 extend to the 2001 crop year the 30 discount already offered on an emergency basis for crop insurance premiums for 1999 and 2000 2 improve insurance coverage for farmers affected by multiple years of disasters 3 establish pilot program for livestock insurance coverage and 4 crs7 loosen eligibility requirements for direct payments provided through the noninsured assistance program nap major crop insurance provisions of the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 after more than one year of debate and legislative consideration on how to improve participation in the crop insurance program and whether federal involvement in the program should be further enhanced congress completed consideration of the conference agreement on the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 hr 2559 on may 25 2000 the president signed the measure into law pl 106224 on june 20 2000 see brief legislative history of crop insurance in the 106th congress above for information on the original house hr 2559 and senatepassed bills s 2536 pl 106224 increases spending on the federal crop insurance program by 818 billion over the next 5 years fy200105 with funding made possible by the fy2001 budget resolution see budget implications of the crop insurance legislation below for more details most of the new spending in the measure nearly 67 billion over 5 years will allow usda to increase significantly the portion of the premium paid by the federal government and to subsidize revenue insurance products at the same rate as regular crop insurance an increase in the premium subsidy means that the participating farmers outofpocket costs for purchasing insurance will decline in tandem other major risk management provisions in the bill include 1 an adjustment of producers yields so that insurance coverage does not decline drastically when producer is affected by multiple years of disasters 2 an expansion of usda authority to conduct pilot insurance programs including two new pilot livestock insurance programs and an expansion of the existing dairy options pilot program 3 new authority for private insurers who develop newly adopted insured products to be reimbursed for their research and development costs and for the industry to have greater representation on the federal crop insurance corporation board and 4 the elimination of minimum arealoss requirement for eligibility in the noninsured assistance payment nap program which makes direct payments to farmers who grow noninsurable crop that is affected by natural disaster the following sections highlight these major issues and provide more detail on how they were addressed in pl 106224 premium subsidy background under the federal crop insurance program usda determines for each insurable crop what the total premium needs to be to cover the expected indemnity loss payments so that the program can operate on an actuarially sound basis prior to pl 106224 the federal government spent approximately 1 billion each year subsidizing the total premium to make insurance more affordable for crs8 farmers the premium for catastrophic cat coverage 5055 coverage ie losses in excess of 50 of normal yields are covered at 55 of the estimated market price is subsidized 100 by the federal government however the percentage of the premium subsidized by the government declines as the level of coverage rises for example in recent years and prior to pl 106224 the government on average paid 55 of the premium for 50100 coverage 42 of the premium for 65100 coverage and 235 of the premium for 75100 coverage under former law the government was prohibited from subsidizing the additional premium cost of farmer increasing the level of coverage from 65100 to 75100 coverage also producers had to pay the full cost of the premium for adding the priceprotection component of revenue insurance to the standard crop insurance policy consequently many policymakers believed that this subsidy structure did not provide enough incentive for farmers to purchase an adequate level of insurance many argued that the subsidy structure needed to be inverted so that the government paid higher percentage of the subsidy as the level of coverage increases and that the premium for revenue insurance products should be subsidized at the same rate as standard crop insurance others however were concerned that overly generous subsidies might encourage planting in high risk areas and increase the risk exposure of the government provisions in pl 106224 as shown in table 2 pl 106224 increases the percentage share of the premium paid by the government for all levels of additional coverage the higher subsidy takes effect with the 2001 crop year although the percentage of premium paid by the government will continue to decline as participants move to higher levels of coverage the government contribution to premium costs significantly increases for all levels of coverage particularly for the highest levels of coverage for example the share of the premium paid by the government rises from 42 to 59 for 65100 coverage and from 24 to 55 for 75100 coverage additionally pl 106224 requires usda to subsidize revenue insurance products or any new approved plans of insurance at the same rate as the level of subsidy provided for basic crop insurance policy previous law required producers to pay the full additional premium cost of purchasing revenue insurance when compared with previous law the premium subsidy structure in pl 106 224 including the new subsidy for revenue insurance will cost the government an additional 67 billion over 5 years according to congressional budget office cbo estimates this amount accounts for more than 80 of the 82 billion total cost of the crop insurance enhancement legislation to slightly defray the cost of the additional subsidies pl 106224 requires that new administrative fee of 30 per crop per county be assessed to any producer who purchases additional crop insurance coverage beyond the catastrophic level pl 106224 retains the current 100 premium subsidy for catastrophic cat coverage at the 5055 level of coverage however the administrative fee for cat coverage will rise from the current 60 per insured crop to 100 in crop year 2001 which according to cbo will cost farmers an additional 60 million over 5 years pl 106224 also gives farmers the opportunity to obtain higher level of cat coverage than the 5055 level if the producer opts for group risk plan grp coverage grp currently available in certain areas on certain crops is based on crs9 county yields rather than an individual farmers actual production level it pays all insured farmers in an area when the entire areas production of an insured crop falls below certain percentage of the normal production of the area because large area wide losses occur less frequently than individual losses premiums are generally lower for grp than for regular crop insurance pl 106224 allows farmer to increase the level of cat coverage from 5055 to higher level of grp coverage as long as the total premium subsidy is the same table 2 comparison of premium subsidies pl

to all producers for the 1999 crop year and 25 discount in 2000 under the authority of various emergency supplemental acts source usda risk management agency and sponsors of bills one of the major differences between the original house hr 2559 and senate s 2251 crop insurance bills as originally passed by their respective chambers was that the senatepassed bill would have reserved approximately 360 million for choice of risk management options pilot program which was strongly supported by senate agriculture committee chairman richard lugar this provision was not adopted by conferees and is therefore not part of pl 106224 under the pilot program producer could have chosen to receive either subsidized crop insurance policy or forgo the subsidy and instead receive direct federal payment if the farmer agreed to adopt two of several eligible risk management practices this pilot program was supported by senators from states with traditionally low participation rate in the crop insurance program primarily in the east crs10 multipleyear crop losses and actual production history background the level of crop yield coverage is viewed by farmers as one of the most critical features of the program and major determinant of whether farmer will purchase insurance in determining what normal production level is for an insurable farmer usda requires the producer to present actual annual crop yields usually stated on bushel per acre basis for the last 4 to 10 years the simple average of producers annual crop yields over this time period then serves as the producers actual production history aph if farmer does not have adequate records he can be assigned transition yield tyield for each missing year of data which is based on average county yields for the crop producer can insure certain percentage of his aph up to 75 in most regions and as high as 85 in selected regions if an insured farmers actual yield falls short of his insured yield the producer potentially can receive an indemnity loss payment farm groups in regions that have been stricken with multiple years of natural disasters in recent years particularly the northern plains and texas have complained that the system of calculating aph used prior to pl 106224 discriminates against them and causes them to be assigned crop yields that are below their true production potential when producers are affected by multiple years of disasters the years of little or harvested production tend to significantly reduce the producers aph these producers sought for some accommodation so that the their yield guarantee was not severely reduced by multipleyear crop losses moreover some farmers have complained that low aph prohibits them from purchasing adequate levels of insurance to cover their costs of production others question the logic of insuring crops on land vulnerable to high risk of losses provisions in pl 106224 effective in the 2001 crop year pl 106224 sets floor under farmers past and future annual yields so that yields in any year cannot fall below 60 of the transition yield for that commodity this means that even if producer has total crop loss in any year the yield used for that year to calculate the producers aph will not be lower than 60 of the historical average production for the region this provision was contained in the original housepassed bill while the senate bill would have allowed producer to exclude one poor year of production history for each 5 years included in aph the estimated federal cost of the 60 floor in pl 106224 is 788 million over 5 years according to the congressional budget office provision in previous law specifically required usda to adjust yields for multiple years of disasters however current usda regulations prohibit farmers aph from falling more than 10 in any one year nor can it fall any lower than 80 of the transition yield for certain major row crops also producers aph cannot rise more than 20 from one year to the next the administration supported enhancements to the program that assist producer affected by multiple years of disaster crs11 livestock coverage background traditionally livestock has been sector of production agriculture that has received minimal amount of price and income support from the federal government however some groups have expressed interest in new authority for some type of subsidized revenue insurance product for livestock producers in conjunction with the federal crop insurance program previous law gave usda the discretion to determine whether farm commodity is insurable but specifically excluded livestock as an insurable commodity provisions in pl 106224 pl 106224 requires usda to conduct two or more pilot programs to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management tools for livestock farmers the pilot programs can provide livestock producers with protection from the financial risks of price and income fluctuation or from production losses pl 106224 gives usda the authority to provide reinsurance to private companies offering livestock insurance or to subsidize livestock producers purchase of futures or options contract usda is given the authority to determine which counties are to be included in pilot program the livestock pilot programs are authorized to begin in fy2001 with annual spending limits of 10 million for each of fy2001 and fy2002 15 million in fy2003 and 20 million in fy2004 and each subsequent year for projected 5year total cost of 75 million during the debate the administration supported giving usda the authority to offer revenuebased insurance products for livestock on pilot basis pl 106224 also allows usda to conduct pilot risk management programs for other farm commodities as way of testing whether any new program is suitable for the marketplace and addresses the needs of producers another provision in pl 106224 expands the existing options pilot program from 100 to 300 counties the dairy options pilot program was the first and only such program developed by usda under its 1996 farm bill authority to conduct options pilot programs the program educates and subsidizes dairy farmers in their use of the futures market as tool for managing price risk private sector incentives background private insurance companies are free to develop new risk management programs and submit them to usda for approval to be reinsured under the federal crop insurance program for example private companies have developed some of the revenue insurance products that are now available on pilot basis on various crops in certain areas under prior law usda was not authorized to reimburse the private companies for developing and maintaining these new products many companies claimed that this lack of compensation had negative effect on the number of new products developed by the private sector and the number of risk management tools available to farmers in general private entities will not engage in product development they say if the developer has opportunity to recover its expenses private insurers also point out that newly developed and approved insurance products can be adopted immediately by any competitor without the competitor reimbursing the insurance company for its development costs which they say further stymies product innovation crs12 provisions in pl 106224 beginning in fy2001 pl 106224 requires usda to reimburse the research development and maintenance costs of any private entity that develops new or existing insurance product the entity could receive payment for up to 4 years following approval with the payment amount determined by usda after the 4year payment period the insurance provider responsible for maintaining the policy can develop and charge fee to any other insurance provider who elects to sell the policy the amount of the fee must be approved by usdas federal crop insurance corporation board also under the act if any farm commodity is considered by usda to be inadequately served by crop insurance usda can enter into contract with private entity to carry out research and development of insurance plans for that commodity pl 106224 authorizes usda to spend not more than 10 million in each of fy2001 and fy2002 and 15 million in subsequent years on reimbursements for research and development costs of new policies of this amount not more than 5 million each fiscal year can be used for underserved states during the congressional debate the administration had proposed that usda be authorized to 1 reimburse private companies for the cost of any new successful products they develop 2 contract with the private sector to develop new products for smaller crops 3 reduce regulatory procedures for developing and updating policies and 4 develop more pilot insurance programs with greater flexibility pl 106224 also gives the private sector more representation and power on the federal crop insurance corporation fcic board which is responsible for making policy decisions relating to the scope of the federal crop insurance program previously the administrator of usdas risk management agency served as the chief executive officer of the fcic board pl 106224 removes the voting rights of the manager of the corporation and would add fourth farmer to the 9voting member board it also adds the chief economist of usda to the board and allows the board to select its own chairman usda had expressed concern that these provisions would lead to weakened government oversight of the crop insurance program noninsured assistance program nap changes background the noninsured crop disaster assistance program nap is permanent disaster payment program administered by usdas farm service agency that is separate from the federal crop insurance program the program was designed to complement the federal crop insurance program by offering direct disaster payments to producers who grow crop that is not covered by the federal crop insurance program nap is intended to be transitional program for those growers who are awaiting approval for coverage of their crop in their area and more permanent assistance program to those who grow crop that is not economically feasible to insure under previous law in order to be eligible for nap payment the area in which the producer grew noninsurable crop must first experience 35 loss of that crop once the area loss requirement is met an individual producer can receive payment similar to catastrophic coverage on an insured crop 55 of the market price for the commodity on losses in excess of 50 of normal production 5055 crs13 many producer groups argued that nap provided inadequate assistance to uninsurable producers since its inception in 1994 total annual payments have been less than 100 million each year they contended that the area loss requirement was too restrictive and even if county became eligible the payment rate was too low for individual farmers the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act pl 106113 waived for one year the minimum area loss requirement of 35 for any producer who farms in region that has been declared disaster area by either the president or the secretary of agriculture provisions in pl 106224 pl 106224 eliminates the minimum area loss requirement as prerequisite for receiving nap payment consequently any noninsurable producer can receive nap payment as long as the individual producer has minimum loss requirement of 50 pl 106224 also institutes new administrative fee that requires potential recipient of nap payments to pay 100 per crop administrative fee which can be waived for financial hardship cases as part of its safety net initiative the administration supported replacing the minimum area loss requirement with secretarial designation for eligibility the net cost of eliminating the area loss trigger offset by the new 100 administrative fee is estimated by cbo at 482 million over 5 years budget implications of the crop insurance legislation one of the most controversial aspects of enhancing the crop insurance program involved the cost of any such changes estimating these costs is complicated by the budgetary ripple effects of policy changes for example increasing the premium subsidy for farmers will presumably increase farmer participation in the program which will in turn increase the amount of federal subsidy going to the private insurance companies for their delivery costs also greater farmer participation could likely mean higher total indemnity payments to farmers and potentially greater program losses for the government to absorb especially if higher risk farmers are attracted to the program the fy2000 budget resolution hconres 69 adopted by congress on april 15 1999 created reserve fund of 6 billion over 4year period to be used exclusively to fund the added costs of legislative modifications to federal risk management programs or for any type of farm income assistance this reserve fund served as the budget parameter for crop insurance enhancement legislation as it was being considered by the respective chambers the fy2001 budget resolution hconres 290 as adopted by both chambers on april 13 2000 increased the amount available for new crop insurance spending from 6 billion over 4 years to 818 billion over 5 years fy200105 thus giving conferees more available funding as they worked out the differences between the two crop insurance bills separately hconres 290 also contained reserve fund of 714 billion 55 billion in fy2000 and 164 billion in fy2001 that could be used exclusively for providing emergency financial assistance to farmers to help them recover from continued low farm commodity prices in order for the funds to be made available the house and senate agriculture committees had to report authorizing legislation crs14 by the end of june instead of reporting separate legislation the two committees agreed to include authorizing legislation for the 714 billion in separate title title b of pl 106224 for more information on this assistance see crs report rs20269 emergency funding for agriculture brief history of congressional action and crs issue
