parker resources science and industry division november 24 2008 abstract because stalemate has persisted on strategies to control greenhouse gas ghg emissions particularly because of cost uncertainties attention has increasingly focused on options to address these concerns and to move the debate forward these options range from incremental mechanisms within tradeable permit program such as banking and borrowing of credits which minimally aﬀect overall emissions reduction targets to more fundamental proposals such as carbon tax which would take climate change policy in new and

in energy policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program summary two events provide impetus for revisiting the cost issue with respect to designing greenhouse gas reduction program the first is the election of new president publicly committed to substantia l reductions in greenhouse gases over the next several decades the second was pa ssage of the 2005 sense of the senate climate change resolution calling on the congress to enact mandatory market based program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases and which states that the program s hould be enacted at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations facets of the cost issue that have raised concern include absolute costs to the economy distributi on of costs across industries competitive impact domestically and internationally incentives for new technology and uncertainty about possible costs marketbased mechanisms address the cost issue by introducing flexibility into the implementation process the cornerstone of that flexibility is permitting sources to decide for themselves their appropriate implementation strategy within the parameters of market signals and other incentives that signal can be as simple as carbon tax or comprehensive credit auction that tells the emitter the value of any reduction in greenhouse gases to credit ma rketplace that is constrained by ceiling price safety valve and includes incentives for new technology as illustrated here the combinations of market mechanisms are numerous allowing decision makers to tailor the program to address specific concerns in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the most important being carbon dioxide co2 focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or the compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically fficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of pe rmits available limits or caps allowable emissions while allowing the marketpl ace to determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax sets the maximum unit cost per ton of co2 equivalent that one should pay for re ducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for carbon ta x or tradeable permit system depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received the options discussed here repr esent continuum between lternatives focused on the price side of the equation eg carbon taxes through hy brid schemes eg safety valves to alternatives focused on the quantity side eg banking and borrowing they are tools to assist in the asse ssment of potential greenhouse gas reduction approaches leaving

nations fram ework convention on climate change unfccc an integral part and sometimes driving part of the ensuing debate has been the issue of cost in several manifestations1 f r t h g r g w b u s h administration the kyoto protocol was fatally flawed in fundamental ways including requiring compliance with manda tes that would have negative economic impact with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers2 this concern about cost can also be seen in the sena tes most recent resolution on climate change in 2005 samdt 866 echoing the langua ge of its 1997 resolution sres 98 on the same subject the 2005 sense of the sena resolution on climate change declared that mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases3 should be enacted at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations4 facets of the cost issue that have raised concern include absolute costs to the economy distributi on of costs across industries competitive impact domestically and internationally incentives for new technology and uncertainty about possible costs because stalemate has

dimensions of the cost issue that have arisen so far in the climate change debate are identified and discussed thir d representative sample of proposed approaches to address cost concerns is compared and analyzed according to the five cost dimensions identified previously finally the proposed options are summarized and opportunities to combine or merge different approaches are analyzed the paper does not provide detailed di scussion of allocation and implementation issues that creating marketbased mechanism partic ularly capandtrade program would entail introduction the price versus quantity debate in general marketbased mechanis ms to reduce ghg emissions the most important being carbon dioxide co2 focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or the compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically fficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of pe rmits available limits or caps allowable emissions while permitting the marketpl ace to determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax sets th maximum unit cost per ton of co2 equivalent that one should pay for re ducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for carbon tax or tradeable permit system depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received for those confident that achieving specific level of co2 reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that ev the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve does not bother them tradeable permit program may be most appropriate co2 emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the cost invol ved would be handled efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency occurs because through the trading of permits emissions reduction efforts focus on sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one feels uncertain of the nvironmental benefits of specific level of reduction and anxious about the downside ri sk of substantial control costs to the economy then carbon tax may be most appr opriate in this pproach the level of the tax effectively caps the marginal cost of control that affected activities would pay under the reduction scheme but the precise level of co2 reduction achieved is less certain emitters of co2 would spend money controlling co2 emissions up to the level of the tax however because the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known th overall emissions reductions for given tax level on co2 emissions is subject to some uncertainty hence major policy question is whet her one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the progra m and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reducti on received ie carbon taxes or one is more concerned about achieving specifi c emissions reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie tradeable permitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs3 5 finland the netherlands

environmental taxesa model for tradeable permit approach is the sulfur dioxide so2 allowance program contained in title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments 42 usc 7651 also called the acid rain program the tradeable permit system is based on two premises first set amount of so2 emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system wit hout undue harm thus the goal of the program is to put ceiling or cap on the total emissions of so2 rather than limit ambient concentrations s econd market in pollution licenses between polluters is the most costeffective means of achievi ng given reduction this market in pollution licenses or allowances each of which is equal to 1 ton of so2 is designed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale initially most allowances were allocated free by the federal gove rnment to utilities according to statutory formulas related to given facilitys historic fuel use and emissions other allowances have been reserved by the government for periodic auctions to ensure market liquidity there are existing us models of an emissions tax although five european countries have carbonbased taxes5 the closest us example is the tax on ozone depleting chemicals odcs to facilitate the phaseout of odcs under the montreal protocol and subsequent amendments th united states imposed tax on specific odcs in 1990 this tax was designed to supplement the allowance trading program that the epa had designed to implement the international agreements several activities trigger the tax including th production andor importation of the chemicals or the importation of products that contain them or used them in their production processes in ddition inventories of certain odcs held on january 1 of each year are subjected to floor stocks tax6 five dimensions of the cost issue five dimensions of costs associated with reducing ghg emissions are discussed in this section 1 absolute costs 2 di stribution of costs 3 longterm costs 4 price signal and stability and 5 uncertainty of costs the absolute costs of ghg reduction program are function of the interplay among the tonnage reduction required the timetable imposed on that reduction and the techniques available and used to achieve that reduction the three ts variables involved with the tonnage require ment include the magnitude and firmness of the reduction requirement and the number of gases and sectors involved in the program variables involved with the timetable include its length and number of phases along with the number and extent of any deadline extensions allowed and on what basis finally variables involved with techniques include promotion and availability of new technology the degree of flexibility permitted in complying withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs4 7 for example see interlaboratory working group scenarios for clean energy future ornlcon476 november 2000the program and any ceiling on compliance costs all these program design parameters influence the absolute cost of the program and the timing and extent of any benefits received second concern with costs is their distribution across the various sectors of the economy as indicated by table 1 ghg emissions are spread throughout the economy with about 81 emitted by the ectric power transportation and industry sectors restricting participation by any group could in crease the absolute cost of the program and would certainly increase the costs to the remaining participants however numerous rationales have been put forward to justify excluding one group or sector from reduction requirement or to provide some other special consideration rationa offered include sector or industrys concern about 1 international competitiveness 2 lack of costeffective control options 3 inability to make necessary capital investments 4 economic disruption 5 credit for previous efforts that reduced emissions and 6 the minor contribution that industry or sector makes to the overall problem it is th multitude of such variables that make constructing an acceptable re duction allocation scheme very

dc p es14 note the total does not include 62 million metric tons from us territories third concern is the longterm cost considerations of ghg reduction program climate change policy has to be thought of in decades not years ultimately successful c limate change program would involve longterm transition to less carbonemitting economy generally studies that indicate the availability and costeffectiveness of emerging new technologies to achieve this transition include an economic mechanism to provide the necessary longterm price signal to direct researc h development demonstrati on and deployment efforts7 developing such price sign involves variables such as the magnitude and naturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs5 8 for example see cera advisory service design issues for

change july 2000of the market signal and the timing direc tion and duration of it in addition studies indicate combining sustaine d price signal with public support for research and development efforts is the most effective longterm strategy for encouraging development of new technology8 as stated by morgenstern the key to long term research and development strategy is bot h rising carbon price and some form of government supported research program to compensate for market imperfections9 fourth consideration is the stability of the price signal in whatever form it takes eg allowance prices carbon taxes auction prices stable and reliable signal is necessary to minimize econo mic disruption and to encourage new technology experience with existing emissions markets suggests that shortterm price spikes and troughs occur that have at least shortterm economic effects either disrupting the market in the case of high prices or discouraging new technology in the case of low prices causes of this volatility can include 1 lack of trading volume 2 illiquidity in the market 3 external events and 4 regulatory uncertainty history with previous emissi ons trading programs suggests that if greenhouse gas program is based on mark etbased implementation strategy the inclusion of flexibility mechanisms to ensure reasonable market stability is desirable10 final cost consideration is the cost uncertainty presented by the wide range of projected costs of ghg reduction to the extent one understands the variables that create the range presented by different forecasting models one can design program to address those variables projected costs of proposed greenhouse gas reduction program will differ among m odels based on the various economic and technological assumptions either embedded in the pa rticular models processes endogenous variables or assumed externally and inserted into the model weyant has identified five assumptions that explain many of the differences in greenhouse gas reduction program cost estimates11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs6 12 see crs report 98738 global climate change three policy perspectives by larry parker and john blodgettbasecase projections of future g hg emissions and climate damages the specifics of the reduction program examined particularly the amount of flexibility permitted in complying with its mandates how dynamic the model is representing substitution possibilities by producers and consumers incl uding the turnover of capital equipment how the rate and processes of t echnological change are modeled how benefits are modeled figure 1 below illustrates how these and other variables such as type of model used can influence the estimated costs of climate change legislation measured by impact on gdp the figure indicates impacts generally ranging from positive 2 increase in gdp to 4 decrease interes tingly the variables used in projecting cost and benefits are sufficiently robust to obscu re strong correlation between cost and reduction requirements the range indicated also reflects the perspectives and parameters assumed by the forecast authors in previous report crs noted that cost analyses are influenced by the perspective or lens through which one views the problem12 analysts viewing climate change policy th rough technological perspective see it as an impetus for improved efficiency th rough technology improvements in the economy consistent with concepts such as lifecycle costs analysts viewing policy through an economic lens work throug h the boundaries of market economics and costbenefit considerations finally analysts viewing the issue through an ecological lens look to th benefits of controlling greenhouse gases and are suspicious of baseline scenarios that suggest that bus iness as usual is an acceptable yardstick from which to measure policy changes ach of these lenses implies fundamentally different ways of assessing policy actions and modeling potential costs and benefits the quantitative results are cost estimates that range from actual savings to the economy from ghg reductions to substantial costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs7 source robert repetto and duncan austin the costs of climate protection guide for the perplexed world resources institute 1997 p 12 approaches for addressing cost concerns the following analysis of options to ddress the cost concerns identified above is loosely arranged by the focus of the specific option 1 th tonnage requirement 2 the time frame and 3 the techniques llowed for compliance it should be noted that several options examined affect more than one of the ts also the options are not mutually exclusive many can be co mbined to create more refined options tonnage options much of the discussion on ghg reductions has focused on historic baseline as the starting point for reductions assu ming that the emissions inventory for specific year is adequate to support regu latory program whether marketbased or not such baseline is reasonable most existing emissions trading programs are based on historic baseline with modifications however there are options to calculate baseline that responds to ec onomic events over time without necessarily compromising the tonnage cap also the hi storic baseline can be eliminated in favor of different methods of ach ieving specific reductions figure 1 the predicted impacts of carbon abatement on the us economy 162 estimates from 16 modelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs8 13 vicki arroyo and neil strachan addressing the costs of climate change mitigation presented at the aspen workshop climat policy framework balancing policy and politics dynamic tonnage target another approach to address some of the concerns identified above is to calculate the tonnage target based on economic or other indexes or measures rather than stri ctly on historic or other static baseline for example the national commission on energy policy recommended that the tonnage requirements for ghg reduction pr ogram begin with year 2000 emissions with the future trajectory of emissions based on the product of progressively declining limit on the countrys ghg intens ity times projected economic growth over time the progressively more stri ngent carbon intensity index would produce progressively more stringent emissions t onnage caps despite projected increases in economic growth the actual steepness of that path would depend on the rate of decline in carbon intensity mandated by the program and actual economic growth of course the dynamic tonnage target coul d be indexed to just about any relative variable eg energy prices depending on the specifics of the met hodology and measures used in creating it the dynamic target could be more responsive to some unforeseen events such as substantial economic growth than static baseline at least in the short term this could reduce costs and economic disruption if sharp spike in economic growth were to occur in contrast slowerthanantic ipated growth would reduce the available emissions credits and thereby reduce the potential for hot air credits ie credits created by slowdown in the economy rather than by control efforts13 by potentially mitigating some effects of static historic emissions baseline dynamic tonnage methodology allows flex ibility in distributing reductions and the resulting costs among different sectors of the economy growth ghg intensity production and other variables c ould be tailored for sectors states or regions based on specific concerns such as competitiveness for example an industry growth index could be used to cal culate reduction requirements rather than an aggregated index such as gdp like most schemes dynamic target scheme could completely exclude some industries with the obvious result of shift in cost to the ones remaining in the program the effect of dynamic target on long term costs would depend on the slope of reductions mandated by the program for example the recommendation of the national commission on energy policy ca lled for an annual 24 reduction in allowable ghg intensity increasing to 28 nnually after 10 years this declining curve would be multiplied by projec tion of presumably increasing economic growth steeper slope in ghg inte nsity mandates andor an overly pess imistic projection of economic growth would stre ngthen the need for less carbonintensive technology but at the risk of increasing co st if those technologies did not arrive in timely manner weak ghg intensity mandate andor an overly optimistic projection of economic growth could re duce necessary emissions reductions and provide weak incentive for new technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs9 14 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o sulfur

global climate change lowering cost estimates through emi ssions trading some dynamics and pitfalls by continueda dynamic target would not necessarily prevent shortterm fluctuations in the price signal depending on the frequency of ad justments if target were based on macroeconomic trends such as gdp it w ould not respond much to shortterm or localized events such as the 20002001 electric ity shortage in california also the mixture of indices with different vector s eg ghg intensity reducing targets while economic growth is increasing targets may create some uncertainty in markets regarding the appropriate price of credits finally dynamic target would not increase the certainty of cost estimates uncertainty about the future trajectory of economic growth would be reflected in cost estimates just as they are now with emissions capped at historically determined levels likewise benefit certainty would not improve for the same reason expand supply options the breadth of options permitted under reduction program can have significant effect on absolute costs legislation introduced in recent congresses has rang ed from programs based on one economic sector eg electric utilities and one greenhouse gas eg carbon dioxide to several sectors including optin provisions and all six greenhouse gases covered by the kyoto protocol14 also some proposed programs ve included international trading of emissions credits and biological questration offsets among the permissible means of complying with reduction requirements15 some of these options particularly internationa l trading and sequestration have included limits on their applicability for example the regional greenhouse gas initiative16 has put control cost triggers characterized as safety valves on the availability of some supply options such as sequestration numerous analyses were done on the impact of global trading after the signing of the 1997 kyoto protocol for the united states the cost of complying with the kyoto protocol was estimate d at 2350 per ton of carbon if global trading were included versus 61119 if only trading among devel oped annex 1 countries were permitted cost estimates

sequestration in the supply mix can play an important and costeffective role in any climate change program18 expanding supply sources could help industries that do not have readily accessible means of reducing greenhouse gase s on their own by providing them with additional options and making the credit market more liquid to the extent the expanded supply sources help create an integrated market with true market price for credits industries could avoid very high compliance costs and lessen the impact of those costs on their profitability howeve r if competitors in other countries do not have to reduce emissions at all as is cu rrently the case with the kyoto protocol competitive disadvantage would remain in some cases the degree to which expanded supply opti ons would contribute to longterm and stable price signal would depend on how integrated these sources are in the overall permit market for example with the european trading system ets there are separate markets for credits created within the 15 members of the european union eu covered by the eu bubble cred its created by joint implementation with eastern european countries and credits created via the clean development mechanism cdm with third world countries19 one type of credit cannot be traded for another the result is range of credit prices reflecting the relative risk and availability of the various credit types thus the longterm signal being delivered is currently unclear and may take time to develop like wise substantial fluctuations in the eu credit market have not been stabilized by the existence of the other two credit types in some ways expanding supply options may increase the uncertainty of cost estimates not only because of disparity in assumed reduction costs but also in assumed availability and penetration of the options themselves for example emissions reductions via the clean devel opment mechanism could be substantial and very costeffective however the mechanism itself creates uncertainty with respect to availability as does the willingness of foreign governments to participate it is difficult to quantify the effect such an option could have on costs without some track record as is slowly being built by the ets carbon tax the most radical approach to controlling costs and addressing the concerns identified above is to impos carbon tax in lieu of proposed allowancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs11 trading programs as discussed in the introduction to this re port under carbon tax the costs are fixed by the legislation and the quantity of emissions reduced becomes the variable carbon taxe s are generally conceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon content in the appr oximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 10 respectively however the vy would not have to be imposed on the fuels themselves proposals have been ma to impose the tax downstream at the point where the fuel is c onverted into heat and co2 in addition there is reason why the tax could not be expanded to in clude all greenhouse gases in appropriate carbon equivalents carefully designed carbon tax could potentially address all five of the concerns identified above carbon tax puts limit on absolute cost by capping the marginal costs that participants should pay to reduce ghg emissions participants would receive firm price signal with respect to the upper value of ghg emissions and respond in the most costeffective manne r that is reduce emissions up to the cost of the carbon tax and pay the tax on any remaining emissions that are more expensive to eliminate carbon tax can be tailored to address distributional c oncern in two ways the first would be to exempt either partly or completely whatever sectors or industries were felt to be threatened either competitively or otherwise by imposing the tax the current tax code provides numerous exem ptions from various taxes for variety of reasons however such an approa ch would create economic distortions and complicate the tax structure the second approach would be to use some of the revenue generated by the tax to provide appropriate relief to targeted sectors or industries this could involve increasin g funding for existing programs for such sectors or industries or cr eating new ones in some wa ys this approach might be more transparent than an approach th at involves potentially complicated tax structure these approaches are not mutua lly exclusive they could be combined if considered appropriate likewise carbon tax can be employed to address longterm concerns in two ways first the carbon tax would create longterm price signal to stimulate innovation and development of new technology this price signal could be strengthened if the carbon tax were escalated over the long run either by statutorily determined percentage or by an index such as the producer price index second some of the revenue generated by the tax could be used to fund research development demonstration and deployment of new t echnology to encourage the longterm transition to lesscarbonintensive economy carbon taxs basic approach to controlling ghg emissions is to supply the marketplace with stable consistent price signal the fourth cost concern designed appropriately there would be little danger of the price spikes or market volatility that can occur in the early stages of tradeable permit program finally carbon tax basically places an upper boundary on projected economic cost uncertainty however it increases uncertainty with respect to environmental benefits by making emissi ons reductions dependent va riable this is the basic tradeoff that pricebased control system presents one way that might mitigate the problem to some extent would be to combine the carbon tax with some

program with beneficial results however it is the trading program not the cfc tax that is the primary regime for control in this manner carbon tax would be more of revenue raiser than control regime second hybr id would be safety valve that capped allowance pri ces such as proposed by the national commission on energy policy20 that approach is discussed later in this report the degree to which the problem is mitigated and others created depends on the interplay between the quantity control and the carbon tax timetable options similar to the countrys threeplus d ecades effort to reduce smog climate change promises to be an ffort measured in decades not years unlike conventional pollution control efforts the environmental benefit of mitigating climate change would come from reduction in the stock of greenhouse gases that have built up in the atmosphere for decades whereas the econo mic costs of control are related to the current flow of additional gases into the atmosphere thus in situation similar to protecting the stratospheric ozone layer there would be subs tantial delay between control costs and environmenta l benefits indeed if shortterm reductions in the stock of greenhouse gases were the focus of climate change policy control efforts would be focused on controlling methane which has 20year lifetime compared with co2 which has 200year lifetime likewise temporary measures such as biologic sequestration would be acceler ated with the assumption that new technology would be available in the future to capture the biologically sequestered carbon dioxide when it is released decades from now this situation leads to disputes ove r how time should be managed under ghg reduction program one argument is that modest cuts or slowing of the increase early followed by steeper cuts later is the most costeffective generally three cost related arguments are made in favor of th is approach first over the longterm sustained ghg reductions involve turnove r in existing durable capital stock costly process if the time frame of the reduction is long enough to permit that capital stock to be replaced as it wears out the transitional costs are reduced second increased time to comply would pe rmit the development and deployment of new less carbonintensive technologies that are more costeffective than existing technology third assuming positive rate of return on current investment less money needs to be set aside today to meet those future compliance costs21 counter argument to the above focuses on the risks of delay both in terms of scientific uncertainty and tec hnology development in term s of scientific uncertainty there is consensus on what concentr ation of greenhouse gases should not be exceeded in order to avoid undesirable clima change if the stabilization level needed is relatively low any delay in beginning reductions could be costly bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs13 22 cera advisory service design issues for

of opportunity for reducing co st implies need for immediate and continuing action to develop new lowca rbon technologies and to begin shifting longlived investment decisions toward alternatives that lower carbon emissions absent these actions the rapid future emissions reductions included in the delayed emissions scenario may be more costly than more evenly paced and earlier reductions24 economicbased circuit breaker delaying or suspending compliance with environmental ma ndates because of energy and economic reasons is not novel idea the clean air act contains provisi ons permitting the president in response to petition by an affected states governor to temporarily suspend any part of state implementation plan or enforcement of the so2 trading program to address severe national

amended reclaim to remove large power plants from the trading system and required owners of such facilities to reduce emissions under ma ndated commandand control regime such facilities returned to the trading system in 200728 proposals have been made to formalize circuit breaker into any ghg reduction program in genera l proposals envision declining emissions cap system where the rate of decline over time is determined by the market price of permits if permit prices remain under t threshold prices the next reduction in the emissions cap is implemented if not the cap is held at the current level until prices decline29 such cap could be implemented on an ec onomywide basis or by sector or other relevant grouping because the conditional reduction approach attempts to turn both the price and the quantity of reductions into variables solved by the trading market its effect on cost depends on host of variables mo st obviously the profiles of the emissions reduction targets and the price triggers for example the price trigger could be based on the spotmarket price the longterm market price or some hybrid price mechanism also the reliance on the market to either directly or indirectly determine price and quantity puts pressure on regulators to oversee operations and prevent any market manipulation designed to slow emissions reductions conditional tonnage target could address distributi onal issues if its tonnage targets and timetable triggers are tailored for specific sectors or industries this would substantially increase the complexity of the scheme and potentially risk bifurcation of the permit market as with other permit schemes discussed here another approach to addressing distri butional concerns unde r conditional tonnage target would be to simply exempt certain sectors from its mandates when the control regime responds to relatively shortterm events it may not provide the longterm price signal necessa ry to promote longterm solutions the elastic time frame also gives ambiguous sign als for planning the appropriate pace and scope of research and devel opment efforts in contrast the regimes focus on short term economic disruption may help in damping shortterm volatility in the allowance market as noted the responsiveness of the price and timetable triggers would determine how effective the program w ould be in avoiding such disruptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs15 30 pl 101559 title iv section 409 1990in reducing the uncertainty for cost timates the scheme introduces about the same number of new uncertain ties as it does in reducing ot hers the circuit breaker prevents ever increasing costs although with some undetermined lag time however it is difficult to estimate absolute costs because one does not know how often it will be used the scheme also increases uncertainty about the future tr end in benefits by making the quantity of emissions reduced variable shortterm break might not make much of difference particularly if participants were required to make up the emissions later however it introduces uncertainty into the system that would be difficult to quantify technologybased timetable another approach to increase flexibility in the system and encourage longterm tec hnology development would be to provide special compliance schedules for entities deploying i nnovative less carbonintensive technologies an example of this possib ility is section 409 of title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments30 under section 409 utilities choosing to meet their sulfur dioxide reduction requirements by installing qualifying clean coal tec hnology receive fouryear extension on the program compliance deadline during the extension the affected emitter is allowed to operate under existing regulations and operating conditions if the technology fails to operate as designed the affected unit may be retrofitted with another qualifying technology or with an existing control technology for ghg reduction program qualifying technology could include geologic sequestration emerging energy fficient technology or advanced solar power technology extension could reduce costs in two ways first the delay in compliance itself would reduce cost by allowing the affected company more time to gather resources and optimize compliance plan second to the extent the delay encourages more costeffective approach to ghg reductions compliance cost and longterm cost would be reduced of course the risk is that the delay will not result in successful technology development indee d it is likely that at least some of the projects would fail that is the nature of innovation however because technology development is crucial to longterm reductions in gree nhouse gases some may feel the risk is worth it assistance with distributional costs under this option would depend on the opportunities for new technology in given sectors of the economy although some industries may have potentially costeffective technologyfixes such as geologic sequestration others ma involve longterm structural changes of course the focus of technologyba sed timetable is to provide longterm signal to the market encouraging

regime shifts from quantitybased permit program to carbon tax depending on defined circumstances banking and borrowing most existing trading programs include provisions for banking credits for either future use or future sale indeed the absence of effective banking in the reclaim program discussed earlier is credited with contributing to reclaims suspension dur ing the california energy crisis as summarized by resources for the future rff allowance banking has been an essential component of the so2 program its absence is costly feature of the nox programs eroding the opportunity for cost savings from interannual trading and cont ributing directly to the suspension of trading in reclaim31 banking and borrowing reduces the absolute cost of compliance by making annual emissions caps

concerns which are more directly determined by initial allocation decisions banking and borrowi ng can help provide longterm market signal by supporting credit prices wh costs are lower than

preferable34 in estimating costs banking and borrowing help smooth out the reduction requirement as witnessed by the current acid rain program this economically desirable effect does not n ecessarily reduce the uncertain ty in cost estimates because estimators will make different assumptions about the extent to which banking and borrowing are used by emitters the smoothing effect however has effect on the reduction requirement in st with several of the other alternatives discussed here this is major reason why this alternative is generally favored by those whose priority is to achieve specific reductions auctioning permits auctions can be used in marketbased pollution control schemes in several di fferent ways for example t itle iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments uses an annual auction to sure the liquidity of the credit trading program for this purpose small per centage of the credits permitted under the program are auctioned annually with the proceeds returned to the entities that would have otherwise received them private parties are also allowed to participate second possib ility is to use an auction to raise revenues for related or unrelated program for example many states pa rticipating in the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi are using auctions to imp lement their public benefit programs to assist consumers or pursue strategic energy purposes35 third possibility is to use auctions as means of allocating some or all of the credits mandated under ghg control program in examining modifi ed auction program resources for the future rff analysis found that an auc tion scheme is drama tically more cost effective in allocating credits than either grandfathered allocation method36 or generation performance standard37 gps approach38 obviously the impact that an auction would have on the cost dimens ions identified earlier would depend on how extensively it was used in any ghg control program and to what purpose the revenues were expended the costeffectiveness of an auctioning system results from allowing the marketplace to allocate credits however unlike carbon tax the marketclearinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs18 39 burtraw et allowance allocation p 30 40 karsten neuhoff auctions for co2 allowances straw man proposal university of cambridge electricity policy re search group may 2007 pp 36price for credits is not limited unless the system is combined with safety valve andor reserve price as discussed below hence an auction for credits would be more expensive for specific industries than under historically based grandfathered system where they would receive their credits free likewise the price consumers pay may be greater depending on the companies ability to pass on their additional costs to them however when the substantial revenues received by the auctions are considered auctions are more costeffectiv than grandfathered or gps systems as stated by rff the bottom line is that the au auction pproach weighs in at substantially less economic cost to society than either of the two gratis approaches to allocating allowances au also provides policymakers with flexibility through the collection of revenues that can be used to meet distributional goals or to enhance the efficiency of the au even further by reducing preexisting taxes because the au approach is so costeffective corresponding sic carbon policy will have less effect on economic growth than under the other approaches this attribute provides the most significant form of distributional benefit39 as noted by rff the revenues from an au ction can be used to address host of distributional concerns indeed as noted ear lier the auction could be tailored to raise only as much as necessary to address thos concerns as with rggi funding of public benefits programs or ma more comprehensive to address credit allocation in terms of longterm price signal th type of auction employed would have some effect for example the program could implement price floor to facilitate investment in new technology via reserv price in the allowance auction process in addition the stability of that price sign could be strength ened by choosin g to auction allowances on frequent basis ensuring availability of allowances close to the time of expected demand and making any potential shortsqueezing of the secondary market more difficult40 an auction could provide s ubstantial incentive for new technology if the auction is structured to encourage longterm and stable price signal and if revenues received are at least partly directed toward research development and demonstration programs an auction would probably not reduce the uncertainty with costs because differing assumptions could be made bout the actual operation of the auction its efficiency and the effectiveness of the r ecycled revenues however an auction would not have any effect on benefits recei ved by the program unless it were joined with safety valve or other limit on auction prices safety valve the purpose of safety valve is to limit the costs of any climate change control program price at the potential expense of reductions achieved quantity safety valves

energy challenges december 2005 42 jacoby and ellerman the safety valve and climate policy p 1 43 richard d morgenstern the case for the safety valve p 10schemes perhaps the most publicized version is that recommended by the national commission on energy policy41 the commission scheme would be implemented through flexible marketoriented permit trading program the total number of permits each year would be based on mandated decline in ghg intensity and projected gdp growth however the scheme includes costlimiting safety valve that allows covered entities to make payment to the government in lieu of reducing emissions the initial price of such paym ents would be 7 per ton in 2010 thus if covered entity chooses it may make pa yments to the government at specific price rather than make any necessary emissions reductions effectively safety valve places ceilin g on compliance costs in that way it acts like carbon tax to the extent an titys control costs or the permit market remain below the safety valve the scheme acts like tradeable permit program the degree to which safety valve reduces co sts would depend on the extent to which it is used by entities eg who do not have costeffective alternative however the complex interactions involved in sche that includes both price and quantity controls should not be unde restimated as stated by jacoby and ellerman the usefulness of the safety valve depends on the conditions under which it might be introduced for time it might tame an overly stringent emissions target it also can help control the price volatility during the intr oduction of gradually tightening one although permit banking can ultimately serve the same function it is unlikely to serve as l ongterm feature of capandtrade system however because of the complexity of coordinating price and quantity instruments and because it will interfere with the development of systems of international emissions trade42 in contrast morgenstern argues that the complexity is worth it in preventing price spikes particularly if substantial reduction in emissions is envisioned if only modest reductions are undertaken syst em of banking and offsets is likely to be adequate in preventing price spikes in order to achieve more ambitious targets however the safety valve is clearly preferred43 to address distributional c oncerns safety value coul d be tailored for specific sectors to address concerns about cost effective reduction op tions or competition in addition to the extent the safety valve created revenues some of the funds raised could be recycled to affected parties the effect of safety valve on ne w technologies reflects the complexity discussion above if low safety valve price were chosen meaning it would keep compliance costs low it could have da mpening effect on longterm development of new technology by creating ceiling on the value of ghg reductions but providing floor for those reductions w eak market signal may be sent this might be offset to some degree if funds co llected by the safety valve were directedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs20 toward new tec hnology but marketing of any resulting technology might still be difficult if the market price is held low safety valve would dampen the possibility of an upward spike in credit prices indeed it is major reason for consid ering such an option however it would not affect any volatility occurring below the safety valve value and have effect on collapse in credit prices by the same token the safety valve would put an absolute limit on the projected costs of the program at the level of the safety valve however it would do this at the expense of certa inty in terms of reductions achieved illustrative approaches the selected options discussed above are summarized in appendix as suggested the various options identified have different stre ngths and weaknesses depending on the facet of costs one wants to address fortunately many of the options are not mutually exclusive nor do they require complete adoption parts of individual approaches can be combined with other parts to meet program specifications in terms of firmness of the goal also called the hardness of the emissions cap and time frame to illustrate program focused on achie ving specific tonnage reduction with some flexibility in implementation but not in manner that threatens the integrity of the cap could incorporate several of thes options the most obvious mechanism to include in the quantitybased capandtrade would be banking and borrowing options that would increase flexibility of the prog ram across time without any deterioration in the tonnage requirement flexibility nd protection against pr ice increases could be enhanced by expanding supply op tions to include all greenhouse gases sequestration and inte rnational trading depending on ones confidence in the individual supply options use could be re stricted to maximum percentage of reduction achieved through the option co mmon in many proposals or to more flexible percentage restraint based on credit prices as in rggis capandtrade scheme proper monitoring and enforcement could minimize any potential effect on the cap this illustration would not necessarily pr ovide either the longterm price signal or funding necessary for new technology one supplemental option that could help mitigate this problem would be credit auctions auctions would have effect on the cap but would provide the program with revenue flow that could be at least partly directed toward research and devel opment the auction could be designed to raise revenues only by auctioning small percentage of the credits such as the current acid rain program or be comp rehensive and auction all credits thus improving overall economics nd providing clear market signal as many rggi participants are doing in the latter case coordinating the auction with any trigger price mechanism for expanded suppl options would promote harmonious implementation depending on the stru cture of the auction chosen the comprehensive auction would also provide clear market price for reductions and with the addition of forward markets so indication of the general direction of those priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33799crs21 finally the auction and its resulting revenues could also be used to address pressing distributional cost issues alt hough the mixture of options used in this illustration could potentially mitigate several of the cost issues identified here it would not provide cost certainty the quantity side of the equation is the controlling factor under this illustration prices coul d be tempered by the market flexibility introduced by the options but actual costs would not capped in contrast more priceoriented illus tration could employ safety valve to place an absolute limit on credit prices in such hybrid system the focus of the program is the safety valve limit as much as any tonnage cap the quantitybased limits of the emissions cap determine the probability that the safety valve would be triggered assuming wellfunc tioning market however in addition to the supply demand dynamic that the credit market will reflect any market failure or disruption resulting from external events could trigger the safety valve for participants ultimately quantity is subordinate to price one can potentially reduce the probability that the safety valve would be invoked by including several of the other options discussed here expanding supply options would enlarge the pool of availa ble reductions and pot entially improve the stability of the credit market if properly integrated employing dynamic tonnage target or an economicbased circuit break er could help addre ss any economic growth spike that might trigger the safety valve the question of using these options in safety valve program is whether they woul d affect the cap more or less than invoking the safety valve in contrast borrowing and banking would help stabilize markets without having any effect on the cap like the illustration above this appro ach would not necessarily promote new technology indeed the safety valve coul d discourage such development unless it generated revenue that was di rected toward research and development if revenues were deemed insufficient fo r new technology and to addr ess distributional concerns if desired the safety valve program could be supplemented with an auction however in any case this illustration is driven by price concerns concerns that make coordinating new technology velopment and minimizing impacts on the emissions cap difficult final illustration could also be the s implest imposition of carbon tax the clear focus of the program would be the vel of the tax the steepness of any future increases in the tax and who has to pay the tax as noted earlier it could be crafted to address all the cost concerns identified in this report however it would represent new direction in us climate

pricequantity issue the fundamental policy assumption that changed between the us ratification of the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the george w bush administrations 2001 decision to abandon the kyoto protocol process concerned costs44 the ratification of the unfccc was based at least partially on the premise that significant reductions could be achieved at little or cost this assumption helped to redu ce concern some had that the treaty could have deleterious effects on us competitiveness significant consideration because developing countries are treated differently fro m developed countries under the unfccc further ameliorating this concern compliance with the treaty was voluntary while the united states could aim to reduce its emissions in line with the unfccc goal if the effort indeed involved substantial costs the united states could fail to reach the goal as has happene d without incurring any penalty under the treaty this flexibility would have been eliminated if the united states had ratified the kyoto protocol with its mandatory re duction requirements the george w bush administration cited this lack of flexibility as major reason for rejecting the kyoto process two events provide impetus for revisiting the cost issue with respect to designing greenhouse gas reduction program the first is the election of new president publicly committed to substantia l reductions in greenhouse gases over the next several decades the second was passage of the 2005 sense of the senate climate change resolution calling on congress to enact mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the grow th of greenhouse gases and which states that the program should be enacted at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations45 facets of the cost issue that have raised concern include absolute costs to the economy distributi on of costs across industries competitive impact domestically and internationally incentives for new technology and uncertainty about possible costs marketbased mechanisms attempt to address the cost issue by introducing flexibility into the implementation process the cornerstone of that flexibility is permitting sources to decide their appropriate implementation strategy within the parameters of market signals and other incentives that signal can be as simple as carbon tax or comprehensive credit auction that tells the emitter the value of any reduction in greenhouse gases to credit ma rketplace that is constrained by ceiling price safety valve and includes incentives for new technology as illustrated here the combinations of market mechanisms are numerous

however the complexity of market mechanisms particularly trading programs increases substantially with the scope of emitting sources included particularly if international trading is envisioned and
