certain rules and practices for the consideration of appropriations measures referred to as the congressional appropriations process appropriations measures are under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees these measures provide only about 40 of total federal spending for fiscal year the house and senate legislative committees control the rest there are three types of appropriations measures regular appropriations bills provide most of the funding that is provided in all appropriations measures for fiscal year and must be enacted by october 1 of each year if regular bills are not enacted by the deadline congress adopts continuing resolutions to continue funding generally until regular bills are enacted supplemental appropriations bills provide additional appropriations and are typically considered during fiscal year each year congress considers budget resolution that in part sets spending ceilings for the upcoming fiscal year both the house and senate have established parliamentary rules that may be used to enforce certain spending ceilings associated with the budget resolution during consideration of appropriations measures in the house and senate respectively congress has also established an authorizationappropriation process that provides for two separate types of measuresauthorization bills and appropriation bills these measures perform different functions and are to be considered in sequence first authorization bills establish continue or modify agencies or programs sec ond appropriations measures may provide funding for the

considers several appropriations measures which provide funding for numerous activities such as national defense education and homeland security as well as general government operations these measures are considered by congress under certain rules and practices referred to as the congressional appropriations process this report discusses the following aspects of this process the annual appropriations cycle types of appropriations measures spending ceilings for appropriations associated with the annual budget resolution and the relationship between authorization and appropriation measures when considering appropriations measures congress is exercising the power granted to it under the constitution which states money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law1 the power to appropriate is legislative power congress has enforced its prerogatives through certain laws the socalled antideficiency act for example strengthened the application of this section by in part explicitly prohibiting federal government employees and officers from making contracts or other obligations in advance of or in excess of an appropriation unless authorized by law and providing administrative and criminal sanctions for those who violate the act 2 under law public funds furthermore may only be used for purposes for which congress appropriated the funds3 the president has an important role in the appropriations process by virtue of his constitutional power to approve or veto entire measures which congress can only override by twothirds vote of both chambers he also has influence in part because of various duties imposed by statute such as submitting an annual budget to congress the house and senate committees on appropriations have jurisdiction over the annual appropriations measures each committee has 12 subcommittees and each subcommittee has jurisdiction over one annual regular appropriations bill that provides funding for departments and agencies under the subcommittees jurisdiction4 the jurisdictions of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees are generally parallel that is each house appropriations subcommittee is paired with senate appropriations subcommittee and the two subcommittees jurisdictions are generally identical5 as currently organized there are 12 subcommittees6 1 us constitution article i section 9 2 31 usc 1341a1342 and 13491350 3 31 usc 1301a 4 the house has an additional subcommittee select intellig ence oversight panel select panel it however does not have jurisdiction over providing spending the select panel instead makes annual intelligence funding recommendations to the house defense appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over legislation to provide intelligence spending 5 for departments and agencies under the jurisdiction of each subcommittee see crs report wa 00004 locate an continued

agencies of the federal government in the form of budget authority or ba such authority does not represent cash provided to or reserved for agencies instead the term refers to authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or other financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures or outlays involving federal government funds most appropriations are form of budget authority that also provide legal authority to make the subsequent payments from the treasury an fy2008 appropriations act for example provided 222 million in new budget authority for fy2008 to the department of the interiors national park service nps for construction improvement repair and replacement of facilities that is the act gave nps legal authority to sign contracts to construct and repair the facilities the agency could not commit the government to pay more than 222 million the outlays occur when government payments are made to complete the tasks while budget authority must generally be obligated in the fiscal year in which the funds were made available outlays may occur over time in the case of the nps construction projects for example the outlays may occur over several years as various stages of the project are completed in this example the 222 million appropriation could be spent over four fiscal years fy2008 22 million fy2009 55 million fy2010 55 million and fy2011 90 million the amount of outlays in fiscal year may vary among activities funded because the length of time to complete the activities differs outlays to purchase office supplies may occur in the year the budget authority is made available while outlays for construction projects may take longer as congress considers appropriations measures providing new budget authority for particular fiscal year discussions on the resulting outlays involve estimates based on historical trends data on the actual outlays for fiscal year are not available until the fiscal year has ended after the president submits his budget to congress each agency generally provides additional detailed justification materials to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees with jurisdiction over its funding g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561g3g141g152g153g157g156g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561 the congressional budget and impoundment c ontrol act of 1974

outlay levels for each fiscal year covered by the resolution it also allocates federal spending among generally 20 functional categories such as national defense agriculture and transportation and sets similar levels for each function within each chamber the total new budget authority and outlays for each fiscal year are also allocated among committees with jurisdiction over spending thereby setting spending ceilings for each committee see allocations section below 12 the house and senate committees on appropriations receive ceilings only for the upcoming fiscal year because appropriations measures are annual once the appropriations committees receive their spending ceilings they separately subdivide the amount among their respective subcommittees providing spending ceilings for each subcommittee13 the budget resolution is never sent to the president nor does it become law it does not provide budget authority or raise or lower revenues instead it is guide for the house and senate as they consider various budgetrelated bills including ap propriations and tax measures both the house and senate have established parliamentary rules to enforce some of these spending ceilings when appropriations measures are considered on the house or senate floor respectively14 the congressional budget act provides an april 15 deadline for congressional adoption of the budget resolution during the past 33 fiscal years congress has considered budget resolutions fy1976fy2008 however cong ress frequently has not met this deadline and in four of those years fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 c ongress did not adopt budget resolution 15 there is penalty if the budget resolution is not completed or is tardy under the congressional budget act however certain enforceable spending ceilings associated with the budget resolution are not established until the budget resolution is completed the act also prohibits both house and senate floor consideration of appropriations measures for the upcoming fiscal year until they complete the budget resolution and in the senate until the senate appropriations committee receive their spending ceilings 16 the house however may consider most appropriations measures after may 15 even if the budget resolution is not in place17 and the senate may adopt motion to waive this rule by majority vote if congress delays completion of the annual budget resolution or does not complete the resolution each chamber may adopt deeming resolution to address these procedural difficulties18 12 the committee ceilings are usually provided in the joint explanatory statement that accompanies the conference report to the budget resolution 13 see allocations below 14 for more details see spending ceilings for

traditionally the house of representatives initiated consideration of regular appropriations measures and the senate subsequently considered and amended the housepassed bills recently the senate appropriations subcommittees and committee have sometimes not waited for the house bills instead they have reported original senate bills under this nontraditional approach both house and senate appropriations committees and their subcommittees have often considered the regular bills simultaneously the house committee on appropriations reports the 12 regular appropriations bills separately to the full house 19 the committee typically begins reporting the bills in may or june completing their consideration of all or almost all of them by the annual august recess generally the full house starts consideration of the regular appropriations bills in may or june as well passing most of those bills by the august recess for three of the last seven fiscal years fy2002fy2008 the house did not pass all the regular bills separately the regular bills that do not pass are typically funded in an omnibus appropriations bill 20 in the senate the senate appropriations committee typically begins reporting the bills in june and generally completes reporting them in september the senate typically starts passing the bills in june or july and continues through the fall for five of the last seven fiscal years the senate also did not pass all of the bills separately during the fall and winter the appropriations committees are usually heavily involved in conferences to resolve differences between the versions of appropriations bills passed by their respective chambers relatively little if any time is left before the fiscal year begins to resolve what may be wide disparities between the hous and senate to say nothing of those between congress and the president as result congress is usually faced with the need to enact one or more temporary continuing resolutions pending the final disposition of the regular appropriations bills 21 g25g152g155g148g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g156g561 after the president submits his budget the house and senate appropriations subcommittees hold hearings on the segments of the budget under their jurisdiction they focus on the details of the agencies

in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union or committee of the whole of which all representatives are members24 special rule on an appropriations bill usually provides for one hour of general debate on the bill the debate includes opening statements by the chair and ranking minority member25 of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the regular bill as well as other interested representatives after the committee of the whole debates the bill it considers amendments regular appropriations bill is generally read for amendment by paragraph26 amendments must meet variety of requirements house standing rules and precedents generally that establish several requirements such as requiring amendments to be germane to the bill continued committee to originate bill in contrast most house committees do not have such authority 23 because the regular appropriations bills must be completed in timely fashion house rule xiii clause 5 provides that these

committee to report special rule providing for the measures consideration as is necessary for most major bills in recent years the house appropriations committee has us ually used the special rule procedure however these special rules typically include waivers of certain parliament ary rules regarding the consider ation of appropriations bills and certain provisions within them special rules may also be used for other purposes such as restricting floor amendments 24 house rule xviii clause 3 requires that appropriations measures be considered in the committee of the whole before the house

legislation and appropriations see relationship between authorization and appropriation measures below funding limits imposed by the congressional budget process see spending ceilings for appropriations measures below and provisions of special rule or unanimous consent agreement providing for consideration of the particular bill if an amendment violates any of these requirements any representative may raise point of order to that effect if the presiding officer rules the amendment out of order it cannot be considered on the house floor the special rule or unanimous consent agreement 27 may waive the requirements imposed by house rules or the budg et process thereby allowing the house to consider the amendment during consideration of individual regular appropriations bills the house sometimes sets additional parameters either by adopting special rule or by unanimous consent for example the house sometimes agrees to limit consideration to specific list of amendments or to limit debate on individual amendments by unanimous consent 28 after the committee of the whole completes consideration of the measure it rises and reports the bill with any adopted amendments to the full house the house then votes on the adopted amendments and passage after house passage the bill is sent to the senate g21g142g151g138g157g142g561 the full senate considers the bill as reported by its appropriations committee29 the senate does not have device like special rule to set parameters for consideration of bills before taking up the bill however or during its consideration the senate sometimes sets parameters by unanimous consent when the bill is brought up on the floor the chair and ranking minority member of the appropriations subcommittee make opening statements on the contents of the bill as reported committee and floor amendments to the reported bills must meet requirements under the senate standing rules and precedents including the authorizationappropriations process and congressional budget process as well as requirements agreed to by unanimous consent the specifics of the senate and house requirements differ including the waiver procedures30 27 under unanimous consent agreements the house agrees to the new parameters if representative objects 28 in addition to special rules in recent years house consid eration of appropriations bills has been supplemented by unanimous consent agreements for more information see crs report rs22711 considering regular appropriations bills on the house floor current practice regarding comprehensive unanimous consent agreements by christopher m davis 29 in cases in which the nontraditional practice is utilized the senate committee on appropriations typically reports an original senate bill and after the full senate has completed ac tion on it the senate waits for the house to send its bill to the senate and amends the housepassed bill with generally substitute amendment that contains the text of the senate bill as amended on the senate floor 30the senate may waive these rules either by unanimous consent or in some cases by motion

subcommittees having jurisdiction over particular regular appropriations bill and the chair and ranking minority members of the full committees meet to negotiate over differences between the house and senatepassed bills 31 under house and senate rules the negotiators called conferees or managers are generally required to remain within the scope of the differences between the positions of the two chambers and cannot add new matter32 their agreement must be within the range established by the house and senatepassed versions for example if the housepassed bill appropriates 3 million for program and separate senate amendment provides 5 million the conferees must reach an agreement that is within the 3 million5 million range in the senate the conference report cannot add new directed spending provisions that were not in included in either the house or senatepassed versions of the bill the senate rule against new matter applies to any provision in the conference report while the rule against new directed spending provisions is limited to any item that consists of specific provision containing specific level of funding for any specific account specific program specific proj ect or specific activity when specific funding was provided for such specific account specific program specific project or specific activity in the measure originally committed to the conferees by either house 33 these rules may be enforced during house and senate consideration of the conference report the senate typically passes the house bill with the senate version attached as single substitute amendment in such instances the conferees must reach agreement on all points of difference between the house and senate versions before reporting the conference report in agreement to both houses when this occurs the conferees propose new conference substitute for the bill as whole the conference report includes joint explanatory statement or managers statement explaining the new substitute conference report may not be amended in either chamber usually the house considers conference reports on appropriations measures first because it traditionally considers the measures first prior to consideration of the conference report the house typically adopts special rule waiving any points of order against the conference report the first chamber to consider the conference report has the option of voting to recommit it to the conference for further consideration rejecting it or adopting it after the first house adopts the conference report the conference is automatically disbanded therefore the second house has two optionsadopt or reject the conference report the senate 31 if the senate andor house does not pass bill informal negotiations typically take place on the basis of the reported version of that chambers for exampl the provisions of the housepassed bill and senate committeereported bill might be negotiated typically the compromise is included in conference report

the conference report by points of order thereby rejecting it the senate can avoid this situation by adopting motion to waive the applicable rule by threefifths vote of all senators duly chosen and sworn 60 senators if there are vacancies if the presiding officer sustains points of order against new matter or new directed spending provisions the offending language is stricken from the bill after all points of order under both requirements have been disposed of the senate considers motion to send the remaining provisions to the house as an amendment between the houses since they cannot amend the conference report the house would then consider the amendment the house may choose to further amend the senate amendment and return to the senate for further consideration if the house however agrees to the amendment the measure is sent to the president 34 in cases in which either the conference report is rejected or recommitted to the conference committee the conferees negotiate further

chamber considers 12 regular bills regular appropriations bills contain series of unnumbered paragraphs with headings generally reflecting unique budget account the basic unit of regular and supplemental appropriations bills is the account under these measures funding for each department and large independent agency is distributed among several accounts each account generally includes similar programs projects or items such as research and development account or salaries and expenses account for small agencies single account may fund all of the agencys activities these acts typically provide lumpsum amount for each of these accounts few accounts include single program project or item which the appropriations act funds individually in report language 38 the house and senate committees on appropriations provide more detailed directions to the departments and agencies on the distribution of funding among various activities funded within an account funding for most local projects are specified in report language as opposed to the text of the appropriations bill congressional earmarks referred to as congressionally directed spending items in senate rule xliv are frequently included in report language and have also been provided in bill amendment or conference report appropriations measures may also provide transfer authority39 transfers shift budget authority from one account or fund to another for example an agency moving new budget authority from salaries and expenses account to construction account would be transfer agencies are prohibited from making such transfers without statutory authority in contrast agencies may generally shift budget authority from one activity to another within an account without such statutory authority this is referred to as reprogramming 40 the appropriations subcommittees have established notification and other oversight procedures for the various agencies to follow regarding reprogramming actions generally these procedures differ with each subcommittee congress has traditionally considered and approved each regular appropriations bill separately but congress has on occasion combined several bills together for 19 of the past 32 years fy1977fy2008 congress has packaged two or more regular appropriations bills together in one measure 41 these packages are referred to as omnibus appropriation measures42 38 report language refers to the content of committee reports and jo int explanatory statements which are attached to the back of conference reports 39 authorization measures may also provide transfer authority for information on authorization measures see relationship between authorization and appropriation measures below 40 transfer authority may be required however in cases in which the appropriations act includes set aside for specified activity within an account 41 for example the fy2001 energy and water developmen t bill was attached to the fy2001 veterans affairs housing and urban development and i ndependent agencies bill the fy2001 legislative branch bill and treasury and general government bill were attached to the fy2001 labor health and human services education and

authority provided since the amount needed is the result of previously enacted commitments in legislative law47 congress also controls mandatory spending by controlling budget authority it does not

amended on the floor if such legislation violates these rule the legislation cannot be considered the separate order also provides procedure to enforce the 302b ceilings for certain amended appropriations measures for the 110th congress the 302f point of order prohibits floor consideration of such legislation58 providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicable committee 302a or subcommittee 302b allocations of new budget authority for that fiscal year to be exceeded in effect the application of this point of order on appropriations legislation is generally limited to discretionary spending and any mandatory spending changes initiated on the appropriations measures 59 if for example the committeereported fy2008 agriculture appropriations bill provided 18825 billion new discretionary budget authority which equals the agriculture subcommittees 302b allocation in table 4 any amendment proposing new discretionary budget authority would violate the 302f point of order the 311a point of order prohibits floor consideration of legislation providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicable total budget authority and outlay ceilings in the budget resolution for that fiscal year to be exceeded 60 as the amounts of all the spending measures considered in the house accumulate they could potentially reach or exceed these ceilings this point of order would typically affect the last spending bills to be considered such as supplemental appropriations measures or the last regular appropriations bills in the house the socalled fazio exception however exempts legislation if it would not cause the applicable committee 302a allocations to be exceeded 61 if for example the pending appropriations legislation would not cause the house appropriations committees 302a allocations to be exceed then the legislation would be exempt from the 311a point of order appropriations measures considered on the house floor typically include an amount at or just below the subcommittee 302b allocations and in some cases the committee 302a allocations and the total spending ceilings as well as result amendments that would increase new budget authority in an appropriations measure for certain activities must typically decrease funding for other activities in the pending bill there are two types of house offset amendments considered in committee of the whole clause 2f and reachback or fetchback amendments under house rule xxi clause 2f offset amendments may be offered that consist of two or more amendments considered together or bloc that would change amounts by directly adding text or changing continued it however does not generally report continuing resolutions 57 if special rule expedites consideration of measure by ordering the previous question directly to passage the form of the measure considered is subject to the points of order some continuing resolutions are considered by this procedure 58 in this context legislation refers the committeereported and noncomm ittee reported bills as well as amendments and conference reports to those bills this definition contrasts with legisla tion as it is defined for purposes of the authorizationappropriation process see relationship betw een authorization and appropriation measures below 59 it does not affect increased mandatory spending that the appropriators are required to provide for example if the house committee on appropriations is required to increase new budget authority for unemployment compensation due to recession such budget authority would not be subject to the point of order 60 this rule exempts in part appropriations measures and related amendments that would not cause the 302a allocation to be exceeded referred to as the fazio exception 61 section 311c of the congressional budget act the title of the exception refers to former representative victor herbert fazio jr ca

increase the total new budget authority or outlays in the pending bill reachback offset amendments are generally offered at the end of the bill and change funding amounts in the pending bill by reference these amendment must provide offsets in new budget authority but not necessarily outlays62 for the 110th congress the separate order extends enforcement of 302b allocations to appropriations bills amended in the committee of the whole regular appropriations bills and major supplemental appropriations measures are typically considered for amendment in the committee of the whole the order generally establishes point of order in the committee of the whole against motion to rise and report to the house an appropriations bill that as amended exceeds the applicable 302b allocation in new budget authority 63 if the presiding officer sustains point of order against such motion the bill does not fall or automatically remain in the committee of the whole instead the committee of the whole must decide by vote whether to adopt the motion even though the amended measure exceeds the allocation 64 significantly the separate order does not apply to motion to rise and report proposed after the bill has been read for amendment if offered by the majority leader or designee as result the majority leader or designee may be able to preempt consideration of motion to rise enforcing the 302b allocation if the committee of the whole agrees by majority vote to motion to simply rise the house may waive or suspend these three points of order by adopting by majority vote special rule waiving the particular point of order prior to floor consideration of the appropriations legislation g21g142g151g138g157g142g561 three points of order typically enforce spending ceilings associated with the budget resolution two are congressional budget act points of order 302f and 311a65 the senate versions of these rules however vary from the house versions the annual budget resolution typically establishes another senate point of order that enforces separate total discretionary spending ceilings established in the budget resolution66 in the senate these points of order apply to all appropriations measures both reported by the committee and as amended on the floor as well as amendments motions and conferences reports to these measures 62 for more information see crs report

such legislation providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicable 302b allocations in new budget authority and outlays for that fiscal year to be exceeded in contrast to the house it 1 does not enforce the 302a allocations and 2 does enforce the outlay allocations the 311a point of order in the senate is similar to the house version the senate however does not provide for an exception similar to the fazio exception in the house section 312 of the fy2009 budget resolution prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause the discretionary spending limits in new budgetary authority in outlays established in the budget resolution to be exceeded the fy2009 budget resolution included another point of order prohibiting provisions in appropriations legislation that would produce net increase in the cost of mandatory spending programs 67 senators may make motions to waive these points of order at the time the issue is raised currently vote of threefifths of all senators 60 senators if there are vacancies is required to approve waiver motion for any of these points of order vote to appeal the presiding officers ruling also

the presiding officer sustains the point of order the designation is stricken and then the legislation or amendment may be vulnerable to the various enforceable spending ceilings recently the house

measuresauthorization measures and appropriation measures these bills perform different functions and are to be considered in sequence first the authorization is enacted and then appropriation measures provide funding authorization acts establish continue or m odify agencies or programs for example an authorization act may establish or modify programs within the department of defense an authorization act may also explicitly authorize subsequent appropriations for specific agencies and programs frequently setting spending ceilings for them these authorization of appropriations provisions may be permanent annual or multiyear authorizations annual and multiyear provisions require reauthorizations wh they expire congress is not required to provide appropriations for an authorized discretionary spending program authorization measures are under the jurisdiction of legislative committees such as the house committees on agriculture and homeland security or the senate committees on armed services and the judiciary most congressional committees are legislative committees the house and senate committees on appropriations however are not appropriations measures provide new budget authority for programs activities or agencies previously authorized house and senate rules enforce separation of these functions into different measures by separating committee jurisdiction over authorization and appropriations bills and with points of order prohibiting certain provisions in appropriations measures 70 the house and senate prohibit in varying degrees language in appropriations bills providing unauthorized appropriations or legislation on an appropriations bill an unauthorized appropriation is new budget authority in an appropriations measure including an amendment or conference report for agencies or programs with current authorization or whose budget authority exceeds the ceiling authorized legislation refers to language in appropriations measures that change existing law such as establishing new law or amending or repealing current law legislation is under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees also called legislative committees

regular appropriations bills and supplemental appropriations measures which provide funds for more than one purpose or agency referred to in the house as general appropriations bills however house rules do not prohibit such provisions in continuing resolutions the house prohibition applies to bills reported by the house appropriations committee amendments and conference reports the house may adopt special rule waiving this rule prior to floor consideration of the appropriations bill or conference report 71 the point of order applies to the text of the bill as well as any amendments or conference reports in the senate unauthorized appropriations and legislation are treated differently the senate rule regarding such language applies to regular bills supplementals which provide funds for more than one purpose or agency and continuing resolutions referred to in the senate as general appropriations bills this senate rule applies only to amendments to general appropriations bills such as those introduced on the senate floor reported by the senate appropriations committee to the housepassed measure or proposed as substitute for the housepassed text the rule does not apply to provisions in senate bills or conference reports for example this rule did not apply to provisions in s 1005 the fy1998 defense appropriations bill as reported by the senate appropriations committee but it did apply to provisions in hr 2107 the fy1998 interior bill as reported by the senate appropriations committee since this version of the bill consisted of amendments to the housepassed bill 72 recently the senate has adopted unanimous consent agreements on billbybill basis that make these points of order applicable to the provisions of senate bills the senate rule is less restrictive than the house regarding what is prohibited as unauthorized appropriations for example the senate appropriations committee may report committee amendments containing unauthorized appropriations similarly an amendment moved by direction of the committee with legislative jurisdiction or in pursuance of an estimate submitted in accordance with law would not be prohibited as unauthorized an appropriation also is considered authorized if the senate has previously passed the authorization during the same session of congress in contrast in the house the authorizati on must be in law as result while the senate rule generally prohibits unauthorized appropriations senators rarely raise this point of order because of these exceptions to the rule the senate rule prohibits legislation in both senate appropriations committee amendments and noncommittee amendments 73 it also prohibits nongermane amendments 71 the special rule may provide waiver for specified provisions or all provisions in the bill that are subject to the point of order the special rule may also provide waiver for specific amendments special rules typically waive points of order against all provisions in all conference reports on general appropriations measures 72 the senate rule reflects senate practices at the time th rule was established the senate appropriations committee traditionally reported numerous amendments to the housepassed appropriations bill instead of reporting an original senate bill therefore the rules prohibition only pplies to amendments both committee and floor amendments 73 under senate precedents an amendment containing legislation may be considered if it is germane to language in the continued

only to congressional consideration if unauthorized appropriations or legislation remain in an appropriations measure as enacted either because one raised point of order or the house or senate waived the rules the provision will have the force of law unauthorized appropriations if enacted are generally available for obligation or expenditure g20g142g156g140g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 rescissions cancel previously enacted budget authority for example if congress provided 16 billion to construct submarine it could enact bsequent legislation canceling all or part of the budget authority prior to its obligation rescissions are an expression of changed or differing priorities they may also be used to offset increases in budget authority for other activities the president may recommend rescissions to congress but it is up to congress to act on them under title x of the congressional budget act 74 if congress does not enact bill approving the presidents rescissions within 45 days of conti nuous session of congress the budget authority must be made available for obligation in response to the presidents recommendation congress may decide not to approve the amount specified by the president approve the total amount or approve different amount for example in 2005 the president requested rescission of 106 million from the department of defense dod operations and maintenance defensewide account and 486 million from dod research development test and evaluation ar my account congress provided rescission of 80 million from the first account in the department of defense emergency supplemental appropriations to address hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and pandemic influenza act 2006 75 the act did not provide rescission from the second account congress may also initiate rescissions in the above act congress also included rescission of 10 million from the department of state diplomatic and consular programs account as budget authority providing the funding must be enacted into law so too rescission canceling the budget authority must be enacted into law rescissions can be included either in separate rescission measures or any of the three types of appropriations measures continued housepassed appropriations bill that is if the house opens the door by including legislative provision in an appropriations bill the senate has an inherent right to amend it however if the senate considers an original senate bill rather than the housepassed bill with amendments ther is house language to wh ich the legislative provision could be germane
