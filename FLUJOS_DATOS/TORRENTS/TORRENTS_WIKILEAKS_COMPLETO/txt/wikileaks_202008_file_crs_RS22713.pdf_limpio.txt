imports at 322 billion accounting for about 17 of all us imports over the past year or so numerous recalls and warnings have been issued by us firms over various products imported from china due to

goods and agricultural products is fragmented and ineffective problems are seen as including weak consumer protection laws and poorly enforced regulations lack of inspections and ineffective penalties for code violators underfunded and understaffed regulatory agencies and poor interagency cooperation the proliferation of fake goods and ingredients the existence of numerous unlicensed producers falsified export documents extensive pollution5 intense competition that often induces firms to cut corners the relative absence of consumer protection advocacy groups failure by chinese firms to closely monitor the quality of their suppliers products restrictions on the media 6 and extensive government corruption and lack of accountability especially at the local level chinese officials contend that most chinesemade products are safe and note that us recalls for health and safety reasons have involved number of countries as well as us products they also argue that some of the blame for recalled products belongs to us importers or designers they further contend that some us products imported into china have failed to meet chinese standards7 however they have acknowledged numerous product health and safety problems in 5 for example many fish farmers in china reportedly feed various drugs to the fish to help keep them alive in polluted waters 6 chinas media often reports on health and safety problems but rarely criticizes the central government for such problems 7 since june 2007 china has seized rejected or complained about us shipments of orange pulp dried apricots

requirements and mandatory standards for toys and increased funding for us product safety agencies on december 19 2007 the house passed hr 4040 rush the consumer product safety modernization act on march 6 2008 the senate passed its version of hr 4040 as substitute amendment s 2263 the cpsc reform act house and senate conferees reached compromise agreement on hr 4040 on july 28 2008 and the bill was signed into law pl 110314 on august 148 concerns over the health safety and quality of chinese products could have number of important economic implications both the united states and china have accused each other of using health and safety concerns as an excuse to impose protectionist measures and some observers contend that this issue could lead to growing trade friction between the two sides international concerns over the safety of chinese exports may diminish the attractiveness of china as destination for foreign investment in exportoriented manufacturing as well as for foreign firms that contract with chinese firms to make and export products under their labels such as toys efforts by china to restore international confidence in the health and safety of its exports through increased inspections certification requirements mandatory testing etc could have significant impact on the cost of doing business in china which could slow the pace of chinese exports and hurt employment in the export sector moreover international concerns over the safety of chinese products could prove to be setback to the governments efforts to develop and promote internationally recognized chinese brands such as cars which it views as important to the countrys future economic development thus it is very likely the chinese government will take this issue very seriously however it is unclear how long it will take for the central government to effectively address the numerous challenges it faces especially government corruption and counterfeiting to ensure that its exports comply with the health and safety standards of the united states and other trading partners additionally sharp decrease in purchases by us consumers of chinese products could negatively impact us firms that import andor sell such products and may raise prices of some commodities as firms attempt to rectify various safety problems the current crisis in china over melaminetainted milk which can cause kidney stones and the growing number of children who have reportedly have become ill have seriously challenged the governments assertions that most products made in china are safe and that an effective regulatory regime has been established 8 see crs report rl34684 consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 pl 110314 by margaret mikyung lee
