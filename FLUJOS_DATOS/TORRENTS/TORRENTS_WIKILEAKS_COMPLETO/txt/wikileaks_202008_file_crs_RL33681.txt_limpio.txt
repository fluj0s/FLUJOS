committee reported separate district of columbia appropriations act s 3660 but it was not considered by the senate information on the status of the fy2007 regular appropriations acts is presented in table 1 at the end of the report 5 from the late 1960s through the end of the 108th congress covering the fy2005 budget cycle the number of regular appropriations acts was fixed at 13 each year at the beginning of the 109th congress the house and senate appropriations subcommittees were restructured as consequence the number of regular appropriations bills considered by both chambers was reduced from 13 bills to 11 bills beginning with the fy2006 budget cycle 6 hrept 109676 sept 25 2006 the vote on agreeing to the conference report was 394 22 in the house and 1000 in the senate 7 hrept 109699

one or more of the regular appropriations acts is not completed by the beginning of the fiscal year congress turns to continuing appropriations acts to provide stopgap funding8 continuing appropriations acts commonly are referred to as continuing resolutions crs because usually they provide continuing appropriations in the form of joint resolution rather than bill occasionally however continuing appropriations are provided in bill form congressional reliance on continuing resolutions is demonstrated by the fact that during the 55year period covering fy1952fy2006 continuing resolutions were enacted for all but five fiscal years in recent years continuing resolutions were not needed for fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 when all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in the absence of regular appropriations the failure to enact continuing appropriations in timely manner results in funding gap funding gaps usually require that affected federal agencies shut down and furlough many of their employees9 in years in which the regular appropriations acts are not all enacted on time the house and senate usually resort to series of continuing resolutions to buy time to complete legislative action10 during the first 30 years that the congressional budget process under the congressional budget act of 1974 was fully in effect covering fy1977fy2006 an average of about five continuing resolutions was enacted yearly the largest number of continuing resolutions enacted for single fiscal year 21 occurred for fy2001 just before the beginning of the fiscal year on october 1 the house and senate sent president bush bill that included continuing appropriations for fy2007 in order to expedite action the continuing appropriations were included at the conference stage in the defense appropriations act for fy2007 as division b entitled continuing appropriations resolution 200711 as indicated previously the measure was signed into law on september 29 as pl 109289 the continuing appropriations provided in division b of pl 109289 and in subsequent continuing appropriations acts as is the case generally with continuing appropriations are provided at restrictive levels the funding formula contained in pl 109289 sets continuing appropriations for programs and activities generally at 8 for general information see crs report rl30343 continuing appropriations acts brief overview of recent practices by sandy streeter 9 exceptions are made under law so that activities for certain authorized purposes such as protecting property and the safety of human life may continue during funding gap 10 for more information on this topic see crs report rl32614 duration of continuing resolutions in recent years by robert keith 11 the text of division b

for fy2006 as mentioned previously the senate passed one of the remaining regular appropriations acts section 110 of division b emphasizes the restrictive nature of the continuing appropriations this division shall be implemented so that only the most limited funding action of that permitted in the division shall be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities on september 29 the office of management and budget issued bulletin to federal agencies apprising them of the procedures for operating under continuing appropriations12 in order to avoid any funding gaps before congress had an opportunity to address the fy2007 regular appropriations acts during the lame duck session the continuing appropriations did not expire until november 17 the lame duck session was scheduled to convene on november 9 this marked the fourth consecutive election year in which continuing appropriations were provided for an interval extending into lame duck session in 2004 the first continuing resolution for fy2005 enacted on september 30 expired on november 20 in 2002 the fourth continuing resolution for fy2003 enacted on october 18 expired on november 22 finally in 2000 the

senate on november 15 and signed into law on november 17 as pl 109369 the measure provided continuing appropriations through december 8 2006 third continuing appropriations measure hjres 102 was signed into law on december 9 as pl 109383 the measure extends continuing appropriations through february 15 2007 information on the status of the fy2007 continuing appropriations acts is presented in

the first monday in november of each evennumbered year and before the convening of new congress about two months later in early january13 during the first 30 years that the congressional budget process was fully in effect covering fy1977fy2006 the house the senate or both chambers met in lame duck session seven times although such sessions were rare in the decades following world war ii they have become more frequent in recent years two lame duck sessions in 1980 and 1982 occurred during the first half of the 30year period covering fy1977fy1991 the remaining five lame duck sessions in 1994 1998 2000 2002 and 2004 occurred during the second half of the period covering fy1992fy2006 table 3 at the end of the report provides information on annual appropriations acts considered during the five lame duck sessions that occurred during the period covering 19942004 as well as on the 2006 lame duck session as the table shows congress acted on appropriations acts during or after three of the five sessions all of the regular appropriations acts for fy1995 and fy1999 were enacted into law prior to the respective lame duck sessions in 1994 and 1998 consequently action on appropriations measures was needed in those two years five regular appropriations acts were enacted into law during the lame duck session in 2000 and nine in 2004 in the case of the 2002 lame duck session 11 regular appropriations acts were considered and enacted into law early in the next congress in 2003 many weeks after the lame duck session had ended most of the regular appropriations acts considered during or after lame duck sessions were incorporated into omnibus appropriations measures finally between one and six further continuing resolutions were enacted into law during each of these three sessions action on appropriations measures in connection with the 2000 2002 and 2004 lame duck sessions is discussed in more detail below 2000 lame duck session five of the 13 regular appropriations acts for fy2001were considered and enacted into law during the lame duck session at the end of the 106th congress three in an omnibus appropriations act and two separately the consolidated appropriations act

two of the regular appropriations acts for fy2003 were enacted into law before the lame duck session began the defense appropriations act pl 107248 and the military construction appropriations act pl 107249 they both became law on october 23 2002 all of the remaining 11 regular appropriations acts for fy2003 were considered and enacted into law early in the next congress as single measure the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 pl 1087 february 20 2003 many weeks after the lame duck session had ended one further continuing appropriations act for fy2003 was considered and enacted into law during the lame duck session pl 107294 four such acts were enacted into law before the lame duck session began and three more were enacted early in the next congress 2004 lame duck session nine of the 13 regular appropriations acts for fy2005 were considered and enacted into law during the lame duck session at the end of the 108th congress as part of an omnibus measure the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 the other four regular appropriations acts were enacted into law before the lame duck session began the defense district of columbia homeland security and military construction appropriations acts two further continuing appropriations acts for fy2005 were considered and enacted into law during the lame duck session pl 108416 and pl 108434 one such measure was enacted into law before the lame duck session began omnibus appropriations acts omnibus appropriations acts which provide funding for two or more of the regular appropriations acts have become significant feature of the legislative process in recent years as congress and the president have used them more frequently to bring action on the regular appropriations cycle to close14 14 for more information on this topic see crs report rl32473 omnibus appropriations acts overview of recent practices by robert keith crs7 during the period covering fy1986fy2006 total of 271 regular appropriations acts were considered all but one of these acts were enacted into law either individually or as part of an omnibus measure of the 270 measures enacted into law 181 67 were enacted as freestanding measures and 89 33 were enacted in omnibus legislation on average less than nine 86 regular appropriations acts were enacted into law as freestanding measures and more than four 42 were enacted into law in omnibus legislation each year during this period 12 different omnibus measures were enacted into law for 11 different fiscal years two separate omnibus appropriations acts were enacted for fy2001 each of the measures funded between two and 13 of the regular appropriations acts on average funding about seven of them eight of the omnibus measures were bills or joint resolutions carrying the designation consolidated appropriations or omnibus consolidated appropriations in the title three were continuing appropriations acts and one was the vahud appropriations act for fy2001 which also included the energy and water development appropriations act for fy2001 as indicated in the preceding section an omnibus appropriations act was considered during or after three of the last five lame duck sessions in 2000 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106 554 covered three of the 13 regular appropriations acts labor hhseducation legislative branch and treasurypostal service the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 pl 108 7 covered 11 of the 13 regular appropriations acts all except the defense and homeland security appropriations acts but it was considered early in the next congress and enacted into law on february 20 2003 after the 2002 lame duck session had ended and in 2004 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108 447 covered nine of the 13 regular appropriations acts although omnibus appropriations acts may offer means of managing political conflict and promoting legislative efficiency their use has been criticized for various reasons in 2005 following realignment of the appropriations subcommittees that reduced the number of regular appropriations acts considered by both chambers from 13 to 11 the house and senate appropriations committee chairmen pledged to enact the fy2006 regular appropriations acts individually thus avoiding an omnibus measure the pledge was met successfully and the final two regular appropriations acts for fy2006 defense and laborhhseducation became law on december 30 2005 with regard to the fy2007 appropriations acts committee leaders again voiced desire to avoid the use of an omnibus appropriations act before and during the 2006 lame duck session there was speculation whether the house and senate would be able to enact the remaining regular appropriations acts individually or would employ an omnibus appropriations act two or more mini omnibus appropriations acts continuing resolution extending into 2007 or some combination thereof as crs8 previously indicated congressional leaders decided to defer the matter to the 110th congress and continuing appropriations were provided through february 15 2007 enforcement of discretionary spending levels the house and senate are considering regular appropriations acts for fy2007 within the framework of limit on new budget authority for that fiscal year of 8728 billion see discussion below with the enactment into law of the defense and homeland security appropriations acts for fy2007 providing new budget authority of 3774 billion and 319 billion respectively 4635 billion remains under the limit for the remaining annual appropriations acts15 the amount remaining under the limit 4635 billion is about 7 billion above the funding level established by the current continuing resolution 4565 billion limit on fy2007 appropriations under deeming resolutions the congressional budget act of 1974 requires the annual adoption of budget resolution establishing aggregate levels of revenues spending the debt limit and the surplus or deficit as well as allocations of spending with regard to the enforcement of discretionary spending levels reflected in the budget resolution the 1974 act relies mainly on points of order in sections 302 and 311 of the act dealing with allocations of discretionary spending by appropriations subcommittee and aggregate spending which includes both discretionary and mandatory spending respectively when the house and senate do not reach final agreement on budget resolution in timely manner or fail to reach final agreement altogether during session they may be faced with difficult situation regarding the enforcement of discretionary spending levels for upcoming fiscal years the house and senate must adopt new budget resolution each year in order for the enforcement of annually appropriated spending levels to be continuous if budget resolution is not adopted for fiscal year there are allocations of spending made to the appropriations committees under section 302a and basis for them to make the required spending suballocations under section 302b consequently when the house and senate have been presented with such situations they have resorted to the use of deeming resolutions to provide basis for updated enforcement16 the term deeming resolution is not officially defined nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation instead the use of deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis deeming resolutions were used in one or both chambers when the house and senate did not reach agreement on budget resolution in 1998 for fy1999 in 2002 15 see the discussion in the senate budget committees online budget

fy2005 as indicated previously lame duck sessions were held in each of these years in 2006 the house and senate did not reach agreement on the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 sconres 83 and again employed deeming resolution to provide basis for enforcement of discretionary spending levels on may 18 the house adopted deeming resolution in the form of provision section 2 in special rule providing for consideration of the interiorenvironment appropriations act for fy2007 hres 818 section 2 provided that upon house adoption of the fy2007 budget resolution which occurred on may 18 the provisions of the housepassed budget resolution and its accompanying report shall have force and effect in the house for all purposes of the congressional budget act of 1974 as though adopted by the congress thus the deeming resolution effectively put into play enforcement procedures in the house at levels consistent with the presidents fy2007 request for 873 billion in total discretionary new budget authority17 the deeming resolution for fy2007 for the senate was included in the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery for fy2006 which was signed into law on june 15 2006 as pl 109234 section 7035 of the act 120 stat 489490 also put into effect enforcement procedures in the senate at the level of 873 billion for discretionary spending according to the house budget committee the annualized rate of funding provided under the current continuing resolution hjres 102 which became pl 109383 is 4572 billion in new budget authority which is 61 billion 13 below the 4643 billion that can be accommodated under the deeming resolutions18 acrosstheboard spending cuts in order to adhere to restraints imposed by congressional budget resolutions or deeming resolutions the statutory limits on discretionary spending in effect from fy1991fy2002 or ad hoc budget agreements between congressional leaders and the president or to meet other purposes congress and the president from time to time incorporate acrosstheboard cuts in discretionary budget authority into annual appropriations acts19 during the six fiscal years covering fy2000fy2005 five governmentwide acrosstheboard spending cuts were included in omnibus appropriations acts in addition governmentwide acrosstheboard cut was included in the defense appropriations 17 see the discussion in the report of the house budget committee to accompany hconres 376 concurrent resolution on the budget fiscal year 2007 hrept 109402 mar 31 2006 pp 67 18 an appropriations update statement on hjres 102 issued on december 8 2006 is available on the house budget committees web site at httpbudgethousegovappropau0614061208cr3pdf 19 this topic is discussed in more detail in crs report rl32153 acrosstheboard spending cuts in omnibus appropriations acts by robert keith crs10 act for fy2006 year in which all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted separately20 the acrosstheboard spending cuts included in omnibus appropriations acts ranged in size from 022 to 080 of covered appropriations and were estimated to yield between 11 billion to 35 billion in savings in the defense appropriations act for fy2006 the governmentwide acrosstheboard spending cut was 1 and was estimated to reduce total budget authority by about 85 billion the percentage cuts and estimated savings for the three omnibus appropriations acts associated with the lame duck sessions in 2000 2002 and 2004 were as follows the 022 cut for fy2001 in pl 106554 saved an estimated 11 billion in budget authority the 065 cut for fy2003 in pl 1087 saved an estimated 26 billion in budget authority and the 080 cut for fy2005 in pl 108447 saved an estimated 35 billion in budget authority omnibus appropriations acts sometimes include other acrosstheboard spending cuts or reductions of fixed dollar amounts that apply to individual appropriations acts as set forth in separate divisions of the omnibus legislation pl 108447 for example included three other provisions requiring acrosstheboard spending cuts focused on particular divisions of the act 1 054 cut in the commercejustice state appropriations division estimated to save 229 million 2 0594 cut in the interior appropriations division estimated to save 120 million and 3 cut of 18 million in the laborhhseducation appropriations division applicable to administrative and related expenses for departmental management except for the food and drug administration and the indian health service the house and senate appropriations committees initially proposed fy2007 spending allocations at levels 4 billion house to 9 billion senate below the presidents request for defense during final action on the defense appropriations act for fy2007 in september in the face of veto threat about 5 billion was restored to the bill in order to accommodate the presidents request21 20 the act which became pl 109148 on december 30 2005 included in division b section 3801a governmentwide spending cut of 1 118 stat 27912792 emergency requirements and spending for the department of veterans affairs were exempted from the cut which was expected to reduce total budget authority by about 85 billion for additional information see omb bulletin 0602 guidance on implementing the governmentwide

to media reports the action on the defense appropriations act for fy2007 may have complicated the task of securing final passage of regular appropriations acts dealing with domestic spending both house appropriations committee chairman jerry lewis rcalif and his senate counterpart thad cochran rmiss attempted to reserve more funds for domestic programs which fared poorly in bushs february budget first lewis proposed to cut 4 billion from bushs defense request in order to have those funds for other areas cochran and senate appropriations defense subcommittee chairman ted stevens ralaska went further shifting 9 billion away from defense in order to better fund bills such as that for the departments of labor and health and human services however in the end the lawmakers agreed to restore 5 billion of the funds to defense in order to avoid veto of the mustpass legislation22 in the past acrosstheboard spending cuts have been used to make room for spending increases in highpriority programs while maintaining total funding within an overall limit while the house budget committee has indicated that current continuing appropriations place total nonemergency discretionary spending about 6 billion below the 873 billion cap on new budget authority it is not clear whether an acrosstheboard spending cut would be needed to accommodate the limited adjustments envisioned by the incoming house and senate appropriations committee chairmen in the yearlong joint resolution expected to conclude action on the fy2007 appropriations 22 see restoration of defense
