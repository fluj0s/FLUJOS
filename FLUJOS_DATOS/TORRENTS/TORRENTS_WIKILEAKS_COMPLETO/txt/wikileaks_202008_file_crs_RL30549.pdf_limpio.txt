policy makers as they face challenges presented by the retirement of the baby boom generation and the growing number of older persons there are some common policy themes across each of the four countries projections about the increasing share that the elderly will represent in the coming decades have spurred policymakers to review and improve existing financing and service delivery systems each country is striving to create greater incentives for home and communitybased care and in some cases to correct incentives that favor more costly institutional care each country recognizes the important role of unpaid care provided by family and friends to assist older persons with functional andor cognitive disabilities the role of women in providing unpaid care is especially salient countries differ in their financing methods although each requires contributions from beneficiaries either through deductions of insurance premiums from wages germany premiums for social insurance japan or fees and contributions for services received united kingdom and canada germany established mandatory longterm care insurance in 1994 this social insurance approach provides for predetermined services or cash allowances to eligible individuals based on their level of need the insurance program is financed through 17 levy on wages shared equally by employers and employees japan s challenge of providing for their elderly is magnified by changing family roles with more women entering the workforce and unavailable to care for the frail elderly japans new gold plan of 1994 laid the foundation for longterm care insurance system that was enacted into law in december 1997 and was implemented in april 2000 in canada there is national system for providing or insuring longterm care instead provinces are responsible for providing services resulting in variability in eligibility criteria and services across the country the federal government provides block grant for health care social programs and postsecondary education provinces may use portion of the federal contribution for home and community based care in 1990 the national health service nhs and community care act was enacted in the united kingdom its goal was to control growth in spending for institutional care consolidate accountability for services at the local level and lessen the bias toward institutional care through greater incentives for home and community based care royal commission on longterm care was appointed in 1997 to examine the current system and make recommendations for improvement it reported

beginning in 2008 policy makers will increasingly be called upon to focus on issues related to providing and financing longterm care other industrialized countries face similar challenges and are planning or already taking steps to change their longterm care systems this report provides description and comparison of approaches taken by canada germany japan and the united kingdom the programs in all four nations seek to enhance the quality of life for the frail elderly population during the 1990s three countries germany japan and the united kingdom each enacted major legislation to redesign their systems of long term care for the frail elderly in 1994 germany created an employer mandated insurance program where employer and employee share equally in 17 levy on wages to pay for longterm care services japan enacted major legislation to establish public longterm care insurance system which was implemented in april 2000 in 1990 the united kingdom enacted major legislation to transfer funds from the central government to local governmental authorities to be used for home and communitybased services and to correct financial bias that favors institutional care more recently in 1999 the royal commission on longterm care made far reaching recommendations to the british parliament regarding changes in the current system in canada there is national system of longterm care the provincial and territorial governments have the primary responsibility for both health and social services as they affect longterm care they have individually taken measures to reorganize and refinance their systems the federal governments role in these areas is through its constitutional spending power its ability to generate revenues and to spend such money in ways that do not infringe on provincial powers similarities in the four countries include the following projections of the increasing share that the elderly will represent in the coming decades have spurred policymakers to review and revise existing financing and service delivery systems each of the countries is striving to create greater incentives for home and communitybased care and in some cases to correct incentives that favor institutional care in some cases the desire to control costs of institutional care has propelled policymakers to expand home and communitybased carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30549crs2 each of the countries recogniz the important role of unpaid care provided by family and friends to assist older persons with functional andor cognitive disabilities the role of women in providing unpaid care in each country is especially salient in japan particularly which has traditionally relied almost exclusively on family care the increased participation of women in the workforce is expected to have profound effect on family care the united kingdoms royal commission on longterm care has proposed major national initiative to assist caregivers responsibilities for administration are generally decentralized either divided among federal and local or provincial authorities local governmental agencies or in the case of germany insurance plans are responsible for assessment of an individuals need for service and development of care plan according to services available each of the countries requires individuals to pay for portion of the cost of their care and in the case of germany deduction is made from employees income to pay for longterm care insurance each of the countries except germany which has mandated

care system in germany has century old beginnings the year 1876 marks the foundation of the health office of the german reich in berlin in 1883 statutory health insurance was enacted by the first chancellor of the german state otto von bismarck from those early beginnings social welfare legislation was enacted throughout the next century contributing to the evolution of what was considered by many as model social insurance health care system what originally began as an insurance scheme for wageearning laborers and their families expanded to include other groups of workers today germanys social insurance program for health covers more than 90 of population totaling over 82 million germanys statutory health insurance automatically insures employees with income below specified annual level1 and its coverage extends to the dependents of the insured at extra cost additionally health coverage is extended to the unemployed selfemployed persons and state employees with an income above the specified annual level are not automatically insured by the social insurance program they are required to join state health insurance system or purchase private health insurance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30549crs5 2 sickness funds are quasipublic notforprofit insurance organizations that operate under statutory requirements but vary in the extent to which they provide services pay health care providers and how much they charge in contributions in january 1996 employees in local company guild or other statutory health insurance fund were given the freedom to choose the fund

individual sickness funds health insurance plans provide health insurance coverage in the form of both cash and inkind benefits at high level of service for those insured2 the sickness funds are financed through payasyougo contributions ranging from 12 to 15 of employment income3 typically half of the contribution to the sickness fund is paid by the employer while the other half is paid by the employee though regulated by federal legislation the health care system is administered by the states persons with statutory health insurance may choose their sickness fund demographic trends changing demographics were an influential factor in establishing longterm care insurance system for germanys aging population in 1980 94 million people in the federal republic of germany were 65 years of age or older4 in 1997 the number of 65 in germany grew by 38 to almost 13 million this growth is partially attributed to the reunification of the german democratic republic east germany and the federal republic of germany west germany the younger generation in germany is decreasing both in absolute terms and as proportion of the total population in 1997 the number of people under 15 years of age totaled 131 million 16 of the total population slight decrease compared to prior years5 the federal statistical office of germany calculates that in few years there will be more people aged 65 years and over than those 15 years and under the united states bureau of the census population projections for germany confirms this estimate the total german population is projected to fall to 57 million people in the year 2050 30 decrease from the 1997 total population it is estimated that 53 million people or 92 of the population will be 14 years of age or younger while 207 million people or 36 of the population will be 65 years of age or older this represents 59 increase over the number of people 65 years of age or older in 19976 with life expectancies at birth estimated at 74 years for men and 80 years for women and total fertility rate of 125 children born per woman these projections are likely to significantly affect the demand for long term care services in the

responsible for assessment of individuals in their own homes to determine eligibility and the extent of need for longterm care services12 each person in need of assistance is assigned to one of three

and equality of treatment while the longterm care insurance program is focused on the elderly it also provides for the younger disabled population in need of nursing care these persons receive flat rate allowance to help cover treatment costs the goal is to help disabled people live in the community rather than residing in nursing homes german law emphasizes integration of persons with disabilities into the community and the workplace by promoting employment of such persons the law requires that at least 6 of the workforce of government and private employers with more than 16 employees be persons with disabilities if the employment quota for the disabled is not met the employers must pay fee which ultimately subsidizes costs for those who do employ disabled persons

in germany provides both cash and services so that beneficiaries may receive nursing allowance home care allowance andor payment of full institutional care there are restrictions as to the combination of cash and services received so that anyone may benefit from comprehensive services and minimal amounts of cash or may choose to receive all benefits in the form of cash and buy privately delivered services although cash has been major choice of longterm care clients recent trends show the number of people choosing only cash is declining one reason may be because the majority of people in need of longterm care desire to live at home or in familiar surroundings for as long as possible more people seem to prefer tailored individual home care services or combination packages that provide both in kind and cash benefits longterm care cash allowances determined by persons care requirement level are paid as flatrate reimbursements for costs assumed to have been incurred proof of costs is required from individuals providing home care however monitoring by professional caregiver similar to case manager takes place every 3 to 6 months the professional caregiver must assess the quality of the home care situation and suggest possible improvements care in residential homes is generally restricted to cases in which proper care cannot be provided in the home if the individual requires institutional care longterm care insurance will pay expenses for basic care social services and treatment according to the level of care required however the insured person is responsible for paying the costs for room and board and must pay at least 25 of the nursing home charges if the home is relatively low in cost persons benefit rate may not be granted in full if it is more than 75 of the nursing home charges13 home care services may be provided by friends or family members this policy was designed to provide financial security for the caregivers of recipients residing at home and to assist spouses of persons with disabilities who had pension income additionally the policy reinforced support for home care rather than institutional care although the policy has shifted towards providing increased home care there are still approximately 490000 people in nursing homes this represents 28 of the 175 million people requiring longterm care in germany14 longte rm care insurance also provides respite care for caregivers so that persons providing home care for at least 12 months may take up to 4 weeks of holiday leave per year similarly caregiver providing at least 14 hours of

enactment of the health insurance law of 1922 in 1947 the japanese constitution established the goal of holding the government responsible for providing health care to its citizens but universal health coverage was actually achieved 14 years later in 1961 there are several insurance systems in japan governmentmanaged health insurance plan covers employees of small businesses mutual aid associations insure public employees and teachers and agricultural workers the selfemployed are insured under another system22 japans current health program for the elderly is part of this multipart national health insurance systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30549crs11 in 1963 the welfare law for the elderly provided coverage for all elderly in need of services and financial support regardless of income an amendment to this law in 1973 established free medical care services for those 70 years of age or older who met certain income tests subsequent high medical costs for this population led to the enactment of the health and medical service law for the elderly in 1982 which required the elderly to make copayments this law also provided for more comprehensive services including rehabilitation and prevention services amendments to the law established health care facilities for the bedridden and senile elderly in 1986 and homevisit nursing care system in 1991 overlapping goals of health care and welfare services led to their unification in 1989 10year gold plan was established by the ministry of health and welfare as strategy to promote health care and welfare for the elderly including the enhancement of inhome and institutional services in 1994 higher goals were set to build the foundation for elderly longterm care services with more rapid implementation called the new gold plan in 1996 the japanese government reevaluated its programs and began structural reform of its social security system the primary objective of the reform was to improve overall efficiency the second objective was to promote self sufficiency to enable individuals to live in their homes as long as possible as part of this reform public longterm care insurance system was enacted in april 1997 and was implemented in april 2000 the system is designed to provide comprehensive and high quality longterm care services including home care and institutional services it builds upon the existing health care program demographic trends the japanese tradition that stresses filial duty has characterized the countrys system of care for many years while most elderly remain in their own homes many reside with their eldest in 1998 approximately half of elderly persons lived with their children once japanese older person begins to live with hisher child the daughterinlaw becomes the main provider of care often spending years tending to the nursing and daily needs of her patient while children of aging parents carry the responsibility of providing care for the senior population this japanese tradition is being affected by number of social and demographic factors these include rapidly growing elderly population lower fertility rates decreasing youth population and high life expectancy in addition modern japanese women are entering the labor force in larger numbers and are increasingly leaving behind the role of housewife and caregiver in 1980 106 million people were 65 years of age or older representing 91 of the total population by 1998 this number had increased dramatically by 93 to 205 million people or 162 of the total population the large growth has

being criticized as being inefficient and non responsive to the needs of patients as result the national health service and community care act of 1990 was enacted to increase local authority

institutional care in favor of more home and communitybased care the 1990 law was designed to consolidate the administration of longterm care services at the local level by making local social service

concluded that the current system is failing reasons for this included insufficient home care and assistance to caregivers lack of progress in correcting the institutional care bias poor quality of institutional care and lack of clientbased focus among other things among the commissions conclusions were the following longterm care is risk that is best covered by some kind of risk poolingto rely on income or savings as most people effectively have to do now is not efficient or fair due to the nature of the risk and the size of the sums required private insurance will not deliver what is required at an acceptable cost nor does the industry want to provide that degree of coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30549crs27 56 report by the royal commission on long term care with respect to old

moderate assets before they get any help59 its report recommended radical restructuring of the means testing system so that personal care services that is tasks involved with assistance with daily living be exempt from means testing the commission analysis was based on the following rationale persons needing longterm care incur three types of costs living costs food clothing etc housing costs rent mortgage and personal care costs according to the commission personal care costs reflect the true risk or catastrophic costsof long term care therefore public funding should finance all of these

housing and residential care the nhs provides continuing care in nursing homes hospices and hospitals and community nurse services in 1999 there were about 600000 people aged 65 and older in the uk receiving home care services and close to 500000 receiving institutional care60 unpaid care provided by family and friends provides substantial longterm care support the royal commission estimated that 57 million people about 10 of the total population provide some form of informal care of these about 800000 people provide unpaid care for 50 hours week or more in 1995 60 of all caregivers were women and 48 of all caregivers were between 45 and 64 years of age twenty percent were over 65 years old and 32 were between the ages of 16 and 24 forty three percent of the individuals receiving informal care were the parent or parentin law of the caregiver unlike the recent trends in japan the royal commission found evidence in the uk of women being less willing or available to provide unpaid care61 the royal commission found that despite attempts to lessen the bias toward institutional care in favor of home care envisioned by the 1990 health and community care act more effort is needed the commission indicated that its proposals to provide personal care services free of charge would lead to expansion of home care services it also recommended that more support be given to families and others who provide unpaid informal care and proposed that national caregiver support program be established financing the current system of care is financed on payasyougo basis with current taxation paying for the benefits delivered at the present time in addition persons receiving longterm care contribute toward costs of their care table 10 shows public and private expenditures for longterm care in 1995 total longterm care expenditures were estimated to be 111 billion us 177 billion with 64 from public sources and 36 from recipients only about one quarter of total funds was for home and communitybased care with the remainder for care in institutions of the amount spent on institutional care about half was paid by fees from residents and half from public sources expenditures for longterm care are expected to rise to 147 billion us 238 billion in 2010 and 199 billion us 322 billion in 2021httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30549crs29 62 residential care as defined by the royal commission does not include nursing caretable 10 expenditures on longterm care services 1995 total 111 billion us 177 billion paid by the state via nhs and social services 71 billion us 113

longstay hospitals6283 billion us 133 billion source table prepared by the congressional research service crs based on data from the royal commission on longterm care p 10 current expenditures on longterm care in peoples homes and in residential settings amount to 22 of taxes from pensions investments and earnings however tax credits have also been introduced for caregivers so that wives providing care may benefit the royal commission recommended continuation of the current payasyou go model to finance longterm care while the commission considered other methods it recommended major changes in taxation as discussed above the commission did recommend changes so that individuals would be required to contribute toward the cost of their care administration local authorities are responsible for administration and management of funds on behalf of persons in need of longterm care services this was result of legislative changes in the 1980s and by the 1990 act to decentralize administration of health and social services after consultation with local authority associations the central government allocates funds to local authorities based on formula local governments are responsible for assessment of individuals and for administration of most institutional and home and communitybased care services the royal commission found that there is inconsistency among local authorities in their application of means testing and determination of an individuals longterm care needs while it supported local autonomy in administration it also recommended that the financing and delivery system be revised so that individuals can have clear expectations of what services they may expect from the public sector and that there be more consistency across jurisdictions regarding services provided and eligibility criteriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30549crs30 works consulted evashwick connie j the continuum of longterm care albany delmar publishers 1996 hoskins irene combining
