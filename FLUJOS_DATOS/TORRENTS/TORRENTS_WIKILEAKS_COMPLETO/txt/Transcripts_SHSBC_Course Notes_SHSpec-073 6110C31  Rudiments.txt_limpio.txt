6110c31 shspec73 rudiments those things that are closest to present time have greater influence on the pc than the whole track in his estimation so you have pc who is convinced that anything wrong with him must have happened in this lifetime this is one of the things wrong with him that he thinks he can get this aberrated in fifty years or less as far as the basic seat of aberration is concerned it is all way prior to this lifetime to the pc what has happened in the last twentyfour hours is more important than what has happened in the past month but it isnt really from the pcs viewpoint what has happened in the session is more important than what has happened in this day hence the violence of session arc breaks because of this evaluation of importances you cant audit over the arc break as it recedes into the past it loses importance the analytical mind fixes its attention closest to all of the havingness which is in present time so theres always the disagreement in the session that whats really wrong with the pc is in the yesterlives but the pc thinks its something wrong right now if you treat what is wrong with him now with heavy actions as if it were tremendous barrier the pc will think so too thus you can validate the pc into outruds an auditor has to adjudicate whether it will do more damage to get the rudiments in or to audit with them out goals run is very difficult with the ruds out but you can attack ruds with such ferocity that the pc gets convinced that they must be really out so they go more out if the ta starts going up while you are getting ruds in lock very pleased as if youd just gotten ruds really in wind up the ruds and get back on the goals terminal line ruds bit out is better than ruds way out details on goals running you will sometimes find the pc planting his heels in examine the case from the aspect of its goal examine the goal from the aspect of what dynamic it is an overt against and you will find out how pc got goal in this solid he had this goal as perfectly honest goal perhaps and nobody wanted this goal because it didnt fit in with certain dynamics they invalidated it and he reasserted it etc etc to the point where he pretty much dropped it when you first pick it up you find it behaves like an overt you can run it as an overt which is why the twoway flow run on it works you can ask what would the goal _______ do to group and find how it could be lots of overts against groups this means it has been invalidated lot which is why it goes out so easily any goal that isnt an axiom is out of agreement to some degree with groups the pc has been associated with thus it has been invalidated on other dynamics and so becomes source of invalidation he uses it to invalidate and others invalidate it so if you as the auditor invalidate it even slightly out it goes the terminal being an outgrowth of the goal is similarly fragile not accepting the pcs handwritten list resulted in the goal getting lost the pc didnt mention when the auditor got new goals list with the meter dont run any processes eg sec checks on any specific terminals other that the goals terminal line terminals except ow and when the pc runs out of ow against the terminal dont force it on the terminal anymore the pc will arc break as his attention is newly forced on the terminal
