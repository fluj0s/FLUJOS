recipients overview new approaches to foreign aid the united states acts to advance us foreign policy and national security goals and respond to global development and humanitarian needs through its foreign assistance programs following the september 2001 terrorist attacks foreign aid gained importance as vital cornerstone along with diplomacy and defense in us national security strategy1 the bush administration reoriented foreign assistance programs particularly to front line states in the war on terrorism for many countries the us government directed not only increased security and military assistance but also development aid for counterterrorism efforts including programs aimed at mitigating conditions that may make radical ideologies and religious extremism attractive such as cycles of violence poverty limited educational opportunities and ineffective or unaccountable governance in 2007 the bush administration restructured us foreign aid programs to better serve the goal of transformational development which places greater emphasis on us security and democracy building as the principal goals of foreign aid2 toward these ends the new strategic framework for us foreign assistance divides aid programming among five objectives peace and security governing justly and democratically investing in people economic growth and humanitarian assistance the millennium challenge account mca established in 2004 promotes these objectives by rewarding countries that demonstrate good governance investment in health and education and sound economic policies critiques according to some analysts recent us foreign policy trends have weakened programs and institutions that specialize in basic development some policymakers have expressed concern that transformational development and mca funding priorities have taken resources away from traditional programs particularly in countries that contain lesser security threats to the united states or where governments do not meet various us performance criteria other analysts argue 1 see crs report rl33491 restructuring us foreign aid the role of the director of foreign assistance in transformational development by larry nowels and connie veillette 2 transformational development which involves foreign aid is to work in tandem with the administrations transformational diplomacy which emphasizes diplomatic resources see usaid fact sheet new direction for us foreign assistance january 19 2006 crs2 that promoting democracy in some countries prematurely may result in waste of aid3 according to one study insufficient funding for foreign assistance objectives has reinforced migration of foreign aid authorities and functions to the department of defense4 funding trends foreign operations appropriations declined from peak in 1985 to low in 1997 after which they began to grow again many of the fluctuations in aid flows over the past 25 years can be attributed to us foreign policy responses to events such as natural disasters humanitarian crises and wars and to us military assistance and other security initiatives in the middle east since 2001 us assistance to front line states in the global war on terrorism and iraq warrelated funding have propelled foreign aid funding to new highs other sources of growth include the millennium challenge account mca and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar5 four asiapacific countries are eligible to apply for mca assistance east timor mongolia sri lanka and vanuatu while two countries indonesia and the philippines have been designated as threshold qualifying them for assistance to help them become eligible for mca funds in october 2007 the mongolian government and the millennium challenge corporation mcc signed fiveyear 285 million agreement vietnam is the largest asian recipient of global hivaids initiative ghai funding under pepfar 118 million between 2005 and 2007 the war on terrorism has reoriented foreign assistance priorities in asia and accelerated trend toward increased aid to the region that began in 2000 throughout the 1990s us assistance to asia fell due to the ebbing of cold war security concerns nuclear proliferation sanctions and favorable economic and political trends for example the withdrawal of us military forces from the philippines nuclear proliferation and other sanctions against pakistan and the reduced need for economic assistance particularly in southeast asia contributed to declines in us aid levels the asian financial crisis of 199798 reversed the downward trend as usaid funded regional economic recovery program for indonesia the philippines thailand and vietnam since the war on terrorism began in 2001 pakistan india the philippines and indonesia became the foci of the bush administrations

urban trophy projects rather than sustainable development and lacking performance criteria and environmental safeguards others have argued that the benefits of prc assistance to these countries particularly cambodia and laos have outweighed adverse effects and that china has helped to address needs not met by western and japanese aid many observers argue that the united states should bolster
