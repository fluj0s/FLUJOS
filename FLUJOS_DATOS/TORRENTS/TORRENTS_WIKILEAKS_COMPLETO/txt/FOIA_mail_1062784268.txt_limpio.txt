from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re something for the weekend date fri 05 sep 2003 135108 0400 cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk sorry meant is just the minimum slope constraint in first sentence apologies for the multiple emails mike at 0147 pm 952003 0400 michael mann wrote actually i think daves suggestion reflecting the data across the endpoints is really just the minimum norm constraint which insures zero slope near the boundary in other words hes probably only talking about reflecting about the time axis i assert that preferable alternative when there is trend in the series extending through the boundary is to reflect both about the time axis and the amplitude axis where the reflection is with respect to the value of the final data point this insures point of inflection to the smooth at the boundary and is essentially what the method im employing does i simply reflect the trend but not the variability about the trendthey are almost the same mike at 0134 pm 952003 0400 michael mann wrote sorry phil one more relevant item ive ccd in keith on this since you had mentioned that you had discussed the issue w him this is from dave mekos quite nice statistics lecture notes 1httpwwwltrrarizonaedudmekonotes_8pdf see page 2 section 81 he provides two in reality as i mentioned before there are really 3 basic boundary constraints on smooth ie in filtering the first method he refers to is what i called the minimum norm constraint assuming the longterm mean beyond the boundary the second which he calls reflecting the data across the endpoints is the constraint i have been employing which again is mathematically equivalent to insuring point of inflection at the boundary this is the preferable constraint for nonstationary mean processes and we are i assert on very solid ground preferable ground in fact in employing this boundary constraint for series with trends mike at 0520 pm 952003 0100 phil jones wrote mike attached some more plots 1 figure 7 forcing guess this is it could cut the scale to 6 and say in caption that 1258 or 1259 is the only event to go beyond this then give value in caption scale will then widen out ok to do caspars solar now there 2 fig 2a first go at coverage this is coverage over 18562002 from hadcrut2v 3 fig 4 again moved legends and reduced scale talked to keith and we both think that the linear trend padding will get criticised did you use this in grl and or fig 5 for rog with scott if so we need to explain it on this plot all the series are in different units so normalised over 17511950 or equiv for decades then smoothed again here i can reduce scale further and law dome can go out of the plot thoughts think all should be same scale have got gkss model runs for fig 8 were you happy hans conditions if so ill send onto scott next week i only have fig 2b to do this will be annual plot of nh europe and cet smoothed in some way for the soi i and tim reckon that it wont work showing this at interannual timescale with 3 plots it will then not be like the nao plot thoughts on colours as well have good weekend logging off once this has gone cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 434 9247770 fax 434 9822137 2httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 434 9247770 fax 434 9822137 3httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 434 9247770 fax 434 9822137 4httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml references 1 httpwwwltrrarizonaedudmekonotes_8pdf 2 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml 3 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml 4 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml
