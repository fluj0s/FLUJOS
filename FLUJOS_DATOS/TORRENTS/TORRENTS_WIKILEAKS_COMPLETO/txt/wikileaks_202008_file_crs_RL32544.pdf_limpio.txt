high power microwave hpm devices threat assessments summary electromagnetic pulse emp is an instantaneous intense energy field that can overload or disrupt at distance numerous ectrical systems and high technology microcircuits which are especially sensitive to power surges large scale emp effect can be produced by single nuc lear explosion detonated high in the atmosphere this method is referred to as highaltit ude emp hemp similar smallerscale emp effect can be created using nonnuclear devices with powerful batteries or reactive chemicals this method is called high power microwave hpm several nations including repor ted sponsors of terrorism may currently have capability to use emp as weapon for cyber warfare or cyber terrorism to disrupt communications and other parts of the us critical infrastructure also some equipment and weapons used by th us military may be vulnerable to the effects of emp the threat of an emp attack against the united states is hard to assess but some observers indicate that it is growing along with worldwide access to newer technologies and the prolifer ation of nuclear weapons in the past the threat of mutually assured destruction provided lasting deterrent against the exchange of multiple highyield nuclear warheads however now even single lowyield nuclear explosion high above the united states or over battlefield can produce largescale emp effect that could result in widespread loss of electronics but direct fatalities and may not necessarily evoke large nuc lear retaliatory strike by the us military this coupled with publis hed articles discussi ng the vulnerability of us critical infrastructure control systems and some us military battlefield systems to the effects of emp may cr eate new incentive fo r other countries to rapidly develop or acquire nuclear capability policy issues raised by this threat include 1 what is the united states doing to protect civilian critical infrastructure systems against the threat of emp 2 could the us military be affected if an emp attack is directed against the us civilian infrastructure 3 are other nations now encouraged by us vulnerabilities to develop or acquire nuclear

ppviviii and p 79high altitude electromagnetic pulse hemp and high power microwave hpm devices threat assessments background commission to assess the threat from high altitude electromagnetic pulse emp commission was established by congress in fy2001 after several experts expressed concern that the us critical infrastructure and military were vulnerable to emp attack1 on july 20 2008 the commission presented report to the house armed services committee hasc assessing the effects of an emp attack on us critical national infrastructures the 2008 repor t contained analysis of results of tests for modern electronics nd telecommunications equi pment for public networks supported by the power grid and by temporar isolated power supplies including cell phones computer servers and internet r outers and switches the report also made recommendations for preparation protec tion and recovery of us critical infrastructures from emp attack the commission reported that the ubiqu itous dependency of society on the electrical power system coupled with th emps particular damage mechanisms creates the possibility of longterm catas trophic consequences for national security comparison was made to hur ricane katrina in 2005 where the protracted power blackout exhausted the limited fuel supplies for emergency generators however in the case of an emp attack widespread collapse of the electric power grid could lead to cascading effects on interdependent infrastructures possibly lasting weeks or months the commission stated should sign ificant parts of the electrical power infrastructure be lost for any substa ntial period of time many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities and the fede ral government do not today have sufficiently robust capabilities for reliably assessing and managi ng emp threats2 at prior hearing on july 22 2004 panel members from the emp commission stated that as us military weapons and c ontrol systems become more complex and as portions of the militarys administrative communications systems continue to rely on the us civilian infrastructure for suppor t they may be increasingly vulnerable to the effects of emp the consensus of the commission in 2004 was that largehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32544crs2 3 daniel g dupont panel says society at great risk from electomagnetic pulse attack inside the pentagon july 15 2004 p1 4 william graham testimony before the house armed services committee jul 10 2008 5 pl 109163 section 1052 reestablishes the emp commissionscale highaltitude emp attack could possibly cause widespread damage to unprotected civilian and military electroni c equipment for an extended period3 however the consensus of the emp commission in 2008 was that the united states need not remain vulnerable to catastrophic consequences of an emp attack and that the nations vulnerability can be reasonably reduced by coordinated and focused effort between the private and public sectors the committee stated that the cost for improved security in the next thr ee to five years would be modest especially when compared with the costs associated with the war on terror and the value of the national infrastructures threatened4 the emp commissions reports in both 2004 and 2008 focused only on the effects of high altitude em p hemp and not necessarily the effects high power microwave hpm devices which are non nuclear radiofre quency rf weapons that can also produce damaging emp but with different charact eristics and covering smaller geographic area both ty pes of emp are discussed below the widely published vulnerability of us civilian and some military electronics to emp along with techni cal accessibility and lower cost could make smallerscale hpm weapons attractive in the future as weapons for terrorist groups also some observers argue that unless th united states openl describes how it is taking action to reduce emp vulnerabilities within critical infrastructures perceived inaction will increase the likelihood that rogue nation will seek to employ the asymmetric effects of hemp against our computer systems the emp commission the emp commission was reestablished by pl 109163 the national defense authorization act for fy2006 the new co mmission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack note that the new title longer includes the phrase high altitude and adds the new word attack continues with the same membership and the secretary of defense is authorized to appoint new member in the event of vacancy5 the emp commission is tasked to monitor investigate and make recommendations bout the vulnerability of electricdependent systems of the department of defense government agencies and the private sector on july 22 2004 members of the emp co mmission testified before the house armed services committee and presented report consisting of the following five volumes volume 1 is an unclassified executive summary volume 2 is classified threat assessment volume 3 is an unclassified assessment of the us critical infrastructure

mar 26 2008volume 4 is classified discussion of military topics volume 5 is classified assessment of potential threats the report stated that high altitude emp is capable of causing catastrophic consequences for the nation and that the current vulnerability of our critical infrastructures which depend so heavily on computers and ectronics can both invite and reward attack if not corrected6 specifically referring to the us military the report states emp test facilities have been mothballed or dismantled and research concerning emp phenomena hardening design testing and maintenance has been substantially decreased however the emerging threat environment characterized by wide spectrum of acto rs that include nearpeers established nuclear powers rogue nations subnati onal groups and terrorist organizations that either now have access to nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles or may have such access over the next 15 years have sic combined to place the risk of emp attack and adverse consequences on the us to level that is not acceptable our increasing dependence on advanced electronics systems results in the potential for an increased emp vulnerab ility of our technologically advanced forces and if unaddressed makes emp empl oyment by an adversary an attractive asymmetric option7 the emp commissions 2004 report proposed fiveyear plan for protecting critical infrastructures from emp and from ot her largescale terrorist attacks the fiveyear plan is briefly summarized in volume 3 of the report however some portions of the fiveyear plan that are related to military equipment may remain classified the commission is currently preparing review of the dod response to recommendations made in 20048 testimony at the 2004 hearing included questions such as 1 how would the united states respond to limited hemp attack against the us homeland or against us forces where there is loss of technolog but directly caused loss of life 2 does the current lack of us preparedness invite adversaries to plan and attempt hemp attack and 3 are the longterm effects of successful hemp attack leading to possible widespread starvation and population reduction potentially more devastating to the us homeland than an attack by surface nuclear weapons 2008 report on critical infrastructure vulnerabilities the 2008 emp commission report di scussed vulnerabilities and

addition the commission expressed concern that widespread use of automated supervisory and control data acquisition scada systems for the critical infrastruct ure had allowed companies and agencies to systematically reduce the size of their work forces having the necessary technical knowledge needed to support manual ope rations of these infrastructure control systems as might be needed during prolonged emergency the commission concluded after reviewing national capabilities to manage the effects of nuclear weapons and emp on modern systems that the country is rapidly losing the technical competence in this area that it needs in the government national laboratories nd industrial community9 private sector and state go vernment poorly prepared experts on the commission have asserted th at little has been done by the private sector to protect against the threat from electromagnetic pulse and that commercial electronic systems in the united states c ould be severely dama ged by emp attack10 commercial electronic surge arresters commonly used for lightning strikes reportedly cannot be relied on because most do not cl amp fast enough to protect against the nearinstantaneous effects of emp see section below on electromagnetic pulse overview11 in march 2007 survey of state adjutants general who oversee national guard units throughout the country f ound that most statebased emergency responders are not actively preparing agai nst an attack on the united states by electromagnetic pulse the survey entitled missile defense and the role of the states was conducted jointly by the anchor agebased institute of the north and the claremont institute of claremont california survey questions were sent to adjutants general of all 50 states with more than half responding although 96 of state adjutants general indicated significant concern over an emp attack the majority had done little or analysis of the effects of an overhead emp attack and little or training or preparation to harden electronic equipment none of the adjutants general surveyed indicated that they were actively involved in formal planning process for response to an emp attack12

electrical mass destruction air and space power 1993 15 us congress house armed services committee committee hearing on commission to assess the threat to the united st ates from electromagnetic pulse attack july 22 2004 and on july 10 2008inaction may increase emp threat to the united states some analysts discount the likelihood of largescale emp attack against the united states in the near term and the extent of possible damage stating that the critical infrastructure reportedly would survive and that military communications would continue to operate and high percentage of civilian phone calls would continue to connect the argument is that limited testing has shown that modern commercial equipment may be surprisingly resistant to the effects of electromagnetic pulse and that some military systems using commercial equipment are also retrofitted to be made more emp resistant before they are fielded13 however other analysts maintain that some past testing done by the us military may have been flawed or incomple leading to faulty conclusions about the level of resistance of commercial equipment to the effects of emp these analysts also point out that emp technol ogy has been explored by several other nations and as circuitry becomes more miniaturized modern electronics become increasingly vulnerable to disruption th ey argue that depending on the targeted area and power of an emp attack it could possibly take years for the united states to recover fully from the resulting widespread damage to electronics and the power grid14 commission members have stated at hear ings that as time passes without visible effort to show the world that we are protecting our computer systems and critical infrastructures the perceived in action may actually invite possible emp attack15 in the past the threat of mutually assured destruction provided lasting deterrent against the exchange of multiple highyield nuclear warheads however single lowyield nuclear explosion hi gh above the united states or over battlefield can produce largescale highaltitude emp effect resulting in widespread loss of electronics but possibly without direct fatalities therefore an emp attack directed against the united st ates involving violent destruction nor instant death for large numbers of us citizens may not nece ssarily evoke massive nuclear retaliation by the us military where for example large numbers of innocent civilians of nation with rogue leader might be killed such perceived lower risk of assured destruction by th united states and widespread knowledge about the

weapon potentially threatening to national security can be created as pulse traditionally by two methods overhead nuclear burst and microwa ve emission highaltitude electromagnetic pulse hemp is nearinstantaneous electromagne tic energy field that is produced in the atmosphere by the power and radiation of nuclear expl osion and that is damaging to electronic equipment over very wide area depending on power of the nuclear device and altitude of the burst highpower microwave hpm electromagnetic energy can be produced as nearins tantaneous pulse created through special electrical equipment that transforms battery power or powerful chemical reaction or explosion into intense microwaves that ar also very damaging to electronics but within much smaller area in addition while hemp weapons are large in scale and require nuclear capability along with t echnology to launch hi gh altitude missiles hpm weapons are smaller in scale and can involve much lower level of technology that may be more easily within the cap ability of some extremist groups hpm can cause damage to computers similar to hemp although the effects are l imited to much smaller area description of hi ghaltitude electromagnetic pulse hemp is produced when nuclear weapon is detonated high above the earths surface creating gammaradiation that interacts with the atmosphere to create an instantaneous intense electromagnetic energy field that is harmless to people as it radiates outward but which can overload computer circuitry with effects similar to but causing damage much more sw iftly than lightning strike16 the effects of hemp became fully known to the unite d states in 1962 during highaltitude nuclear test code named starfish prime over the pacific ocean when radio stations and electronic quipment were disrupted 800 miles away throughout parts of hawaii the hemp effect can span thousands of miles pending on the altitude and the design and power of the nuclear burst single device detonated at an appropriate altitude over kansas reportedly could affect all of the continental united states17 and can be picked up by metallic c onductors such as wires or overhead power lines

tha t creates hemp produces three major energy components that arrive in sequen ce and which have measurably different effects that can be cumulatively damaging to electronic equipment the first energy component is the initial energy shockwav which lasts up to 1 microsecond and is similar to extremely intense static electricity that can overload circuitry for every electronic device that is within line of sight of the burst secondary energy component then arrives which has char acteristics that are similar to lightning strike by itself this second energy component might not be an issue for some critical infrastructure equipment if antilightning protective measures are already in place however the rise time of the first component is so rapid and intense that it can destroy many protective measures lowing the second component to further disrupt the electr onic equipment the third energy component is l ongerlasting magnetohydrodynamic mhd signal about 1 microsecond up to many sec onds in duration th is late time pulse or geomagnetic signal causes an effect th at is damaging primarily to longlines electronic equipment there are two components to this third time energy pulse which experts call blast and heave the blast results from distortion of the earths magnetic field lines by the expanding fully conduc tive fireball the heave comes from the heating and ionization of

example microwaves with wavelength s about 57 cm long cband or 20 cm long lband or 3 cm long xband are of ten used for radar or communications 20 flux compression generator consists of xplosives packed inside cylinder all of which is contained within cylindrical copper coil structure the explosive is detonated from rear to front causing the tube to flare in wave that touches the copper coil which produces moving short circuit this compresses the magnetic field and creates an electromagnetic pulse that is emitted from the front end which is then directed by special focusing antennaand being conductive also distorts the earth s magnetic field both of these are considered mhd signals and are termed slow because they depend on the dynamics of cloud or fireball expansion as the fireball expands localized magnetic effect builds up on the ground throughout the length of long transmission lines and then quickly collapses producing the mhd latetime power rge which can overload equipment connected to the power grid and telecommunications infrastructure this latetime effect can add to the initial hemp effect and systems connected to longlines power and communications systems may be further disrupted by the combined effects smaller isolated systems do not collect so much of this third energy component and are usually disrupted only by the first energy component of hemp18 it is also important to note that this third latetime pulse depends on the total energy of the nuclear detonation and theref ore is usually associated only with larger yield nuclear weapons however the firs t energy pulse is saturationlimited effect and is produced by all nuclear w eapons both small and large yield description of high power microwaves microwaves are characterized by electromagnetic energy with wavelengths as small as centimeters or millimeters and can be used at moderate power levels for radio frequency communica tions or for radar19 highpower microwaves can be created as an instantaneous electromagne tic pulse for example when powerful chemical detonation is transformed thr ough special coil device called flux compression generator into an intense electromagnetic field20 other methods can also be used to create reusable hpm w eapon such as combining reactive chemicals or using powerful batteries and capacitors to create emp hpm energy can be focused using speciallyshaped antenna or emitter to produce effects similar to hemp within confined area or over limited distance unlike hemp however hpm radiation uses shorter wave forms at higherfrequencies which make it highly effective against electronic equipment and more difficult to harden against mechanically simple suitcasesized device using chemical explosive and special

produce damaging voltage nd currents in electr onic devices thousands of miles from the nuclear explosion effec tiveness is increased if the electronic devices are connected to any other metal that

distance and electronic equipment that is turned off is only less likely to be damaged26 to produce maximum coverage for the hemp effect nuclear device must explode very high in the atmosphere too far away from the earths surface to cause injury or damage directly from heat or blast also hemp produced by the nuclear explosion is instantaneous too brief to start current flowing within human body so there is effect on people however microwave energy weapons hpm are smallerscale are deliver ed at closer range to the intended target and can sometimes be emitted for long duration these characteristics of hpm can sometimes cause painful burning sensation or other injury to person directly in the path of the focused power b eam or can even be fatal if person is too close to the microwave emitter27 both hemp and hpm can permanently immobilize vehicles with modern electronic ignition and control systems however older electri cal components such as vacuum tubes and induction coils fo r spark ignition are generally built more massively and are more tolera nt of emp as modern electronics shrink in size circuitry is becoming increasingly tiny and more vulnerable to electromagnetic interference therefore countries with infrastructure that re lies on older technology may be less vulnerable to the disabling effects of hemp or hpm than countries that rely on higher level of technology28 recovery after attack the simultaneous loss of communications and power that would likely result from an emp attack would also complicat the restoration of systems without

oup of baltimore and instant access networks ian published study of the potential economic impact of hemp attack on the baltimorewashingtonrich mond area the study focuses on the economic effects of emp experienced by region after highaltitude emp pulse generated by nuclear device det onated between 30 80 miles above ground impacting an area at least 500 miles in radius in these instances of highaltitude emp one would feel the heat or blast but merely experience the effects of the disruption or damage to the electr onic and power infrastructure the baltimorewashingtonrichmond area likel comprises only onetenth of the economic loss that would occur for the total geographic area affected by regional emp event the report was presents range of low medium and high estimates of economic damage all within bounds accepted by broad range of emp experts the methodology relied on assumptions about di sruption and damage to the regional electrical power system communications systems system control and data acquisition scada devices nd other critical infrastructur that might occur as result of an emp and on the time required to repair that damage and fully restore economic activity these assumptions were used in combination to estimate the ultimate effects of an emp on the regions ec onomy the cumulative effect of an emp on critical infrastructure was assumed to be largely determined by effects on the electrical grid and communications systems cumulative damage was then determined by multiplying the remaining capacity of the electrical grid by the remaining capacity of communication system s under three scenarios for example under the high case an emp damages 50 of the capacity of the electric grid and 50 of the capacity of communication systems the analysis assumed that the economy was then able to operate at onl 25 of capacity ie 50 multiplied by 50 the study concluded that an emp attack affecting the baltimorewashington richmond region could result in economic output loss potentially exceeding 770 billion or 7 of the nati ons annual gross domestic pr oduct even under the most favorable assumptions including both shielded and unshielded critical infrastructurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32544crs12 an emp might still result in damage that would require one month of recovery and economic loss of 9 billion and 34 billion respectively table 1

duration of disrepair sts for years in such cases there are numerous complicating factors that could slow the recovery process the quantity of replacement equipment needed to re store the economy may quickly exhaust readily available supplies and in extrem cases existing manufacturing capacity in such cases the availability of skilled labor to replace and restore key infrastructure elements may also be in extraordinarily short supply highaltitude emp would also affect much larger parts of the region than the immediate baltimorewashingtonrichmond ar ea further complicating recovery efforts it is unlikely that restoration would occur in an orderly linear fashion more likely restoration efforts would start slowly nd gather speed as basic infrastructure is gradually brought on line portable

recent russian military writings claim that they have superemp weapon that can generate more than 200 kvs per meter which is 4 times greater than the level of emp hardening tested by the united states kilo volts per meter is the standard measure for describing the strength of an emp field in laymans terms the statement that russian superemp weapon could generate 200 kilovolts per meter means that
