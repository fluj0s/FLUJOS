contributes to presidentially defined homeland security missions and ensures that fede ral homeland security rd programs do not duplicate or leave gaps according to the under secretary federal homeland security rd will be coordinated by fall 2004 legislation has been introduced to require dhs to prioritize and consolidate all of its rd activities that are not now managed by the agencys science and tec hnology directorate hr 4141s 2285 omb data show that federal funding for homeland security rd was requested at 36 billion for fy2005 dhss rd programs constitute about one third of total funding other agencies with large homel and security rd budgets are the national institutes of health the department of defense the department of justice the national science foundation th department of agriculture the environmental protection agency and the partment of commerce omb has collected crossagency funding data on homeland security rd for several years this is difficult task on which omb is making progress data are now collected for different purposes data sets often conflict in its combating terrorism reports omb publishes summary data by agency on combating terrorism rd and summarizes some programs it describes homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd and has not published data on homeland security rd funding per omb publishes data on homeland security funding by agency subdivided by programs or units in ta bles appended to the fy2005 budget request it is not possible to identify clearly prog rams for rd using these data omb has also produced an unpublished homeland security rd data table it is not widely circulated and gives only total funding by agency 2004 congressional budget office report found shortcomings in fede ral homeland security funding data problems with the accuracy and consistency of rd data may be caused by inaccurate reporting federal agencies us of different definitions or changing conceptions of homeland security ove r time among options congress could consider are requiring agencies to use st andardized definitions of homeland security rd or mandating that omb or dhs pr epare an annual

department of homeland secur ity dhs has statutorily mandated responsibilities to coor dinate federal homeland securi ty research and development rd implementation of these respons ibilities depends in part on the quality of information about homeland security rd pr ograms in dhs and in other agencies there is single published comprehensiv inventory of federal agency homeland security rd activities several different types of data sets have been prepared for different purposes in its reports to congress on combating terrorism the office of management and budget omb publis hes summary data on federal agencies budgets for rd for combating terrorism and gives short desc riptions of some agency programs1 these data are current only through the budget request for the fiscal year when the report is published omb describes homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd omb has not published data on homeland security rd funding per but using an internal cro sswalk budget data base it has prepared an unpublished table on homela nd security rd in data appended to the fy2005 budget request and available onl electronically or on cdrom omb published information on homeland secur ity funding by agency subdivided by programs and units an earlier version of these data current only through the fy2004 request was appended to the 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism according to the congressional budget office cbo ombs publication of these data are responsive to section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 which directed omb to produce an annual report on homeland security funding to accompany the presidents annual budget submission2 it is not possible to identify accurately all agency programs for homeland security rd using these data cbo identified general limitations in the omb data on homeland security as follows the allocation of homeland security funding to almost 200 appropriation accounts within the federal budget substan tially complicates efforts to track such spending in addition agencies in thei r accounts do not separate that fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs2 3 cbo federal funding for homeland security op cit 4 for other information about federal agency homeland security rd funding and activities see crs report rs21270 homeland security and comba ting terrorism research and development funding or ganization and oversight by genevieve j knezo and crs report rl31914 research and development in the department of homeland security by daniel morganfrom money appropriated for their other activities indeed much of the money for homeland security activities resides within accounts that finance primarily nonhomelandsecurity spending such as departmental salaries and expenses that accounting practice makes it difficult to clearly identify homeland security funding as it moves through the appropriation process section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 attempted to address that issue by directing omb to produce an annual report on homeland security funding to accompany the president s annual budget submission the reports contain data on homeland security spending collected by federal agencies and updated throughout the fiscal year but those data do not always provide consistent picture of expenditures classifying and reporting spending on homeland security activities require judg ments about particular projects and programs in addition under the current datacollection process definitions of homeland security and current and prio ryear funding levels are continually being modified and updated3 this crs report portrays some of the data that has b een collected about federal agency homeland security rd and rais issues about the availability and consistency of such information especially about ombs data4 the quality of information is important since it enters into consideration when attempting to coordinate homeland security rd progra ms another crs re port inventories in detail specific federal agency homeland secu rity rd programs and funding trends crs report rl32481 homeland security rd fundi ng and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory among the observations made are that the different data sets that the office of management and budget omb publishe s about homeland security rd are not consistent and do not always include funding data for all federal agencies that are known to have homeland security rd pr ograms in addition agencies may be using different definitions when re porting homeland security funding an implication is that dhs and congress woul d have clearer picture of federal commitments for homeland security rd and would be better equipped to coordinate and set priorities for such rd if more accurate and consistent

or on activitie s in support of domesticallybased systems and processes the homeland security council hsc coordinates these activities governmentwide homeland security is defined as concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states reduce americas vulnerability to terrorism and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur homeland security can in clude activities that occur outside the united states and its territories if they support domesticallybased systems or activities eg prescreening highrisk cargo at overseas ports12 the 2003 combating

on combating terrorism september 2003 p 16 if the difference in dod totals between columns 2 and 3 in table 4 represents dods oct rd funding that difference 385 million is 1875 million less than the total reported for dods fy 2003 oct rd as reported in table 2 while the amount exceeding 212 million see column 2 of table 4 may be for oct rd that amount would constitute only part of dods oct rd budget authority as depicted in table 2 thus it is unclear if the 385 million is for homeland security rd or for oct rd comparisons between data identified for this crs report as likely to be rd from ombs published appendix tables and ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd show that for fy2003 data were identical for one budget account usdas ars data were similar greater than 5 difference for total dod budget accounts for both fy2004 and fy2005 see tables 5 and 6 regarding data for the department of homeland security the amount reported for combating terrorism ex ceeded the amount in the unpublished homeland security rd table by 39 million it is doubtful that this is for oct rd which is not likely mission for dhs and omb did not identify dhs as having any budget authority associated with oct there is similar problem with respect to usda which according to omb has oct accounts but the funding reported for usdas combating terrorism rd exceeded homela nd security rd funding by almost 20 million there are instances when the unpublishe d homeland security rd data table reported more funding than did the comba ting terrorism rd data set even though the two categories may be intended to be equivalent or where homeland security rd funding would not exceed the combating terrorism rd funding this occurred in data reported for the departments of health and human services justice and for the environmental protection agency see table 4 there are also major differences in da ta sets for dhhs for instance for fy2003 enacted ombs unpublished homela nd security rd data and ombs combating terrorism rd data are almost equivalent but they are both about 900 million less than the putative homeland security rd data identified for this crs report from ombs appendix data attached to the analytical perspectives on the fy2005 budget the two data sets for fy2003 also are about 800 million less than reported elsewhere in the fy2005 volume of analytical

of these are elaborated upon in crs report rl32481 homeland security rd funding and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory by genevieve j knezohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs17 table 8

include only rd activities of the directorate of science and technology and do not incl ude rd in other dhs directorates most funding is reported under the hom eland security mission of defending

appendix data identified for this report show homeland security rdrelated activities only for the federal bureau of investigation fbi at 41 million httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs18 agency issue dot there is correspondence between ombs data sets for dot homeland security rd and there are large differences between dots own reports of its homeland security rd and omb reports epa ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd differ by about 82 million from the published appendix data identified for this report nasa ombs unpublished data do not report any homeland security rd funding data excerpted for this report fro m ombs published ectronic appendix data show about 81 million for science and technology budget account of which an undetermined amount is likely for homeland security rd nsf the two data sets ombs unpublished homeland security rd data and the homeland security data identified for this report as likely rd are close differing by about 9 most homela nd security rd funding is categorized under the heading largely of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets not defending against catastrophic terrorism the mission for which dhhss rd data are categorized nsfs homeland security funding goes largely to s upport rd and is not primarily for facilities protection and cyber security activities summary observations about data on rd the analysis in this crs report has shown that while homeland securityrelated information is collected for variety of purposes questions may be raised about the accuracy of funding data for homeland secur ity rd issues include consistency of omb trend data over time inconsistences among data ts which appear to count the same things problems with using budget acc ount da ta lineitems to count rd whether or not all overseas combating terro rism rd data are included whether or not all of dods rd is included and us of different homeland security mission descriptors for rd some of the agencyspecific observations made in this conc luding section are based on data summarized in this report but discussed in greater detail in crs report rl32481 homeland security rd funding and activ ities in federal agencies preliminary inventory major difficulties with the data several major difficulties have been observed in the current data they are summarized next different types of information ar compiled for different purposes the most uptodate and complete source of trend information about federal agency homeland security rd funding is ombs unpublished data table however that document is not widely circulated and b ecause it gives only agency totals it is not possible to use it to identify funding for units or programs within an agency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs19 23 which uses different numbers from the budget account number and data given in the appendix to the presidents annual budget documents ombs published combating terrorism rd table in ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism is prepared annually in response to congressional mandate this table is almost two years outofdate when published for instance the report published in september 2003 include d data only through the fy2004 request in that document omb reported that homela nd security is subset of combating terrorism ie the total for combating terrorism rd minus the total for overseas combating terrorism rd omb did not publish data on homeland security rd funding per in that document and it is not clear what overseas combating terrorism rd data are included or excluded from the table omb publishes homeland security information in appendix tables the most recent in cdrom and electronic appendix to analytical perspectives us budget fy2005 these data are prepared in re sponse to congressional directive to report homeland security f unding omb uses budget acc ount data for these tabulations23 rd funding per is not listed as budget account item this crs report attempted to use this information to obtain estimate s of rd data by counting data in budget accounts that appear to be rdrelated while this method permitted identification of some units that support homeland security rd the funding reported may include other than rd activities it may include upgrades for physical and cybersecurity also homeland secu rity rd may be supported by offices or programs whose budget account does not incl ude descriptors that are science or researchrelated or under homel and security missions that are not related to rd thus some homeland security rd activitie s that an agency conducts but which appear under other budget accounts that are not principally for rd may be excluded an example is the funding am ount given for homeland security rd in the department of homeland security dhs the omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism the homeland security appe ndix data for fy2004 and the fy2005 request reported data only for dhss science and technology directorate even though other parts of dhs also support rd differences observed among data sets ombs unpublished homeland security rd table presents only total f unding by agency and its trend data do not always coincide with the data in other omb data sets for instance except for three agencies the data in ombs table on co mbating terrorism rd for fy2003 enacted differed from ombs unpublished table on homeland security rd funding also with few exceptions the data in these two tables differed from the data crs identified as for homeland security rd in ombs published or electronically available appendix data on homeland security omb data do not appear to report all funding for rd omb may not have included in its inventory of homeland security rd some agencies homeland security rd programs that were described elsewhere on their websites in budget documents or in their annual plans or strate gic plans sometimes in its published appendix data on homela nd security omb reported funding for science or researchrelate d budget accounts for some agencies but did not report them as having any homeland security or combating terrorism rd fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs20 responsibilities even though omb reporte d that funding for homeland security rd is subset of the category combating terrorism rd sometimes omb reported agencies as having homeland s ecurity rd funding responsibilities but combating terrorism rd responsibilities for instance it is not clear if or how much omb included for the homeland secu rity rd programs of the national nuclear security administration the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and prevention the depa rtment of energy the department of justice the national aer onautics and space administra tion and some programs in the department of homeland security omb may have undercounted the amount of homeland security rd in some agencies that was described elsewhere for instance ombs unpublished data reported that dot received funding fo r homeland security rd for fy2004 and that 41 million was requested for fy2005 the published appendi x data identified by crs indicated that dot requested about 04 million for fy2004 for homeland security and national security activities rd according to these omb data funding appears to have been appropr iated for fy2004 nevertheless in dots fy2004 performance plan the agency said it requested funding fy2004 homeland and national security rd programs funding totaling 637 million similarly reports of homeland security rd f unding for nasa and doj among other agencies differ whether overseas combating terrorism rd funding is included in combating terrorism rd totals combating terrorism according to omb includes both homeland security f unding and overseas combating terrorism oct funding it is not clear if omb included or excluded oct amounts for other agencies in its tables ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism does report separa tely funding for dods oct rd called rdte research advanced development testing and evaluation the amounts reported for dod oct rdte alone far exceed the total reported for dods combating terrorism rd it is not clear how other agencies oct rd funding was handled in this and other data sets this issue may require clarification in order to obtain accurate totals for federal agency combating terrorism rd responsibilities omb may not count all of dods rd as noted omb may not have included all dod homeland security rd in its data set on dod homeland security rd or in its fy2003 combating terro rism rd table this is exemplified by the fact that dods oct rd totals which were for rdte reported larger funding amounts than were reported in the co mbating terrorism rd table it is not clear if the difference was due to oct activities or whether dods dte advanced development test and evaluation activ ities were not counted in the combating terrorism rd table it is reasonable pursuant to ombs definition to exclude dods oct rdte from funding amounts on homeland security rd however it is not clear if the dod homeland security rd data that we re reported included all dt other documents that invent ory federal rd fundi ng levels including nsf reports and other omb documents include all of dods rdte in the reporting category of research and developm ent rd furthermore in the various omb data sets surveyed omb did not report consistent figures for dods budget authority for homeland security rd fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs21 24 omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p2 25 omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p2agencies may be using differe nt definitions when reporting funding levels to omb i n i t s combating terrorism report omb said it allowed federal agencies to report data to it and purposefully allowed agencies to use their own definitions of activities to repor t although omb said it did review all responses to ensure cons istency and comparability24 in detail throughout the data collection cycle agencies reported information using applicable definitions the data provided by the agencies are developed at the activity level which is set of like programs or projects that make up coherent effort aggregated at leve l of detail sufficient to analyze total governmental spending on homeland security and overseas combating terrorism missions the two major components of the overarching combating terrorism mission omb purposely left the definition of activity to the interpretation of respondent agencies to allow for flexibility in responses and reviewed all responses to ensure consistency and comparability25 the data presented in this report suggest that agencies may be using different definitions of rd activities when reporting to omb or that some of the data may be inaccurate this raises the issue of whether agencies are reporting homeland security rd uniformly and the accuracy of ombs statement that homeland security data were reported as s ubset of combating terrorism data also omb data do not include funding for the construction of buildings or facilities where homeland security rd is conducted and theref ore omb data in some cases are less than data sets which include such activities such as prepared by the american association for the adva ncement of science aaas aaas data show major construction activities that do not appear in omb data for usda doe dhs and dhhs for both fy2003 and the fy2005 request rd funding reported under two different homeland security missions in ombs published appendix data on homeland security funding some agencies with clear rd missions ch as the national science foundation appeared to report most homeland security rdrelated funding under the homeland security mission of protecting critical in frastructure and key ssets and not under the mission of defending against catastr ophic threats the heading that includes most rd in presidents strategy document because the mission of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets may also include cyber and physical security protection activities it is difficult to identify what part of the funding for the category goes for rd most nih homeland secu rity rd was reported under the category of defending against catas trophic terrorism thus the following questions may be raised both nsf and nih support the conduct of rd yet most of nsfs homeland security rd activities were categorized under the homeland security mission of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets while most of nihs homeland security rd activities were categorized under the mission of defending against catastrophic threats some may ask the following questions why the difference in categorization what are the fundamental differences or similarities in the kindshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs22 26 congressional budget office federal funding for homeland security economic and budget issue brief april

catastrophic threats should it be assumed that this is the amount that will be allocated to nsfs two bioterrorismrelated activities for ecology of infectious diseases program co sponsored by nsf and nih micr obial genome sequencing programwith usda or is some of this program f unding categorized under the heading labeled protecting critical infrastru cture and key assets s hould it be assumed that most of nsfs homeland security rd funding is oriented primarily to improving cyber security and physical security since most of its homeland security rd funding is reported under this category nsfs own information on its homeland security rd indicates that it supports vast array of fi elds from the perspective of fields of science performers and so forth what is the difference between the kinds of research supported under these two different headings options to improve information about homeland security rd funding omb has collected data on crosscutting or crossagency funding on homeland security rd for several years this is difficult task and omb has made progress in establishing ways to report these da ta improved data co llection could improve decisionmaking about policy programs and funding for homeland security rd specifically for setting priorities avoidi ng unnecessary duplication and assisting in transferring information and technology among agencies and first responders however as omb transitions to improve its homeland security data collection it appears to have encountered problems in data accuracy and consistency these may be due to errors in reporting changing definitions of homeland security rd and its components over time federal agencies use of different definitions and inconsistency in reporting categories omb uses for the different data sets that it prepares in 2004 report the congressional budg et office cbo identified general problems with ombs homeland security da ta focusing on the difficulty federal agencies confront in separating homeland security funding from accounts that serve nonhomeland security purposes or are prima rily for salaries and expenses cbo also observed that definitions of homeland security activities change from year to year and often require judg ments by accountants or analysts these problems make it difficult to obtain consistent data and to portray fundi ng and trends adequately even within the same data set26 many of these problems were manifested in the ombprepared rd data examined in th is report raising questions about the reliability or validity of the data examinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32482crs23 27 consultations are mandated specifically betw een omb and the house and senate budget committees the house and senate appropr iations committees and the congressional budget office sec 889 of pl 107296section 889 of pl 107296 requires omb to report on homeland security funding and to consult at least annually with congress27 about which activities constitute homeland security activities for budgeting purposes as one response to its data reporting requireme nts omb published data in an appendix to the fy2005 budget volume analytical perspectives that presents homeland security funding using special budget account categories rd funding is not specifically identifiable ombs unpublished data on hom eland security rd funding cannot be reconciled easily with these data nor for the most part with the domestic component of combating terrorism rd funding that omb prepares for another purpose these data also differ from some of the data ag encies use to characterize their homeland security rd programs and funding several options may be addressed to deal with these issues congress may seek to ensure that omb data on homeland security rd are adequate to enable congress to identify and oversee and dhs to identif prioritize and coordinate federal homeland security rd across all agencies oversight could be directed to whether omb should im pose more conformity about the way agencies define homeland security rd and about the definitions ag encies use in reporting homeland security rd consideration could be given to th option of asking omb or dhs to report separately to congress on funding for and activities of federal agency homeland security rd programs the costs of obt aining more precise data have not been estimated attention could be directed to examining the costs and benefits of whether or not the federal government should report more accurate and consistent data on federal agency homel and security rd programs
