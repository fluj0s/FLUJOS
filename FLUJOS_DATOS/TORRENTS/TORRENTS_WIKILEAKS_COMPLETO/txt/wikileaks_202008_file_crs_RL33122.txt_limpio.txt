american national government government and finance division congressional budget resolutions revisions and adjustments summary the congressional budget act of 1974 requires that the house and senate adopt concurrent resolution on the budget each year for about the first decade of the congressional budget process the 1974 act required that two budget resolutions be adopted each year an advisory one in the spring and binding one in the fall in the early 1980s the house and senate changed to the practice of adopting single annual budget resolution in late 1985 the 1974 act was amended to conform it to the changed practice in this regard initial implementation of the congressional budget process occurred in 1975 for fy1976 with full implementation of the process occurring the following year the house and senate have reached final agreement on budget resolution for every succeeding fiscal year except in four instances in 1998 for fy1999 in 2002 for fy2003 in 2004 for fy2005 and in 2006 for fy2007 the 1974 act originally reflected the assumption that revisions would be routine part of the congressional budget process by requiring the adoption each fall of second budget resolution revising or reaffirming the first resolution although the house and senate terminated this requirement in favor of adopting single budget resolution each year revisions may be made in budget resolutions in several other ways first revised budget resolution may be adopted by the house and senate as separate measure under authority provided in section 304 of the 1974 act second revisions in currentyear levels may be incorporated into the budget resolution for the following fiscal year third adjustments may be made under authority provided in section 314 of the 1974 act or comparable provisions included in budget resolutions fourth adjustments may be made pursuant to reserve funds or similar provisions included in budget resolutions fifth adjustments may be made whenever the fungibility rule is used under the reconciliation process finally deeming resolutions may include revisions to budget resolutions or provisions that effectively constitute revisions the house and senate adopted revised budget resolution under section 304 as separate measure only once in march 1977 for fy1977 due to the fact that two budget resolutions already had been adopted in 1976 for fy1977 as was required at the time the revised budget resolution was referred to as the third budget resolution for that fiscal year the development of the third budget resolution for fy1977 stemmed from budget revisions including stimulus package submitted to congress by incoming president jimmy carter at the beginning of the 1977 session the house and senate have made changes in budget resolution levels on many occasions under the other authorities cited above that provide for revisions and adjustments this report will be updated as developments warrant contents budget resolutions

following brief discussion of budget resolutions and the congressional budget process this report examines the several ways in which budget levels and other matters included in budget resolutions may be revised or adjusted the authorities that underpin the making of such revisions and adjustments and actual practices of the house and senate in this regard budget resolutions and the congressional budget process the congressional budget act of 1974 requires that the house and senate adopt concurrent resolution on the budget each year1 for about the first decade of the congressional budget process the 1974 act required that two budget resolutions be adopted each year in the early 1980s the house and senate changed to the practice of adopting single annual budget resolution and in late 1985 the 1974 act was amended to conform it to the changed practice in this regard see discussion below initial implementation of the congressional budget process occurred in 1975 for fy1976 with full

congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 july 12 1974 88 stat 297339 as amended and codified at 2 usc 621692 for information on budget resolutions over the years see crs report rl30297 congressional budget resolutions selected statistics and information guide by bill heniff jr and justin murray crs2 succeeding fiscal year except in four instances in 1998 for fy1999 in 2002 for fy2003 in 2004 for fy2005 and in 2006 for fy20072 as concurrent resolution the budget resolution is not sent to the president for his approval instead the budget resolution reflects the agreement of the house and senate and serves as internal guide to congressional action on legislation to implement budget policies the budget resolution sets forth aggregate levels of revenues spending the debt limit and the surplus or deficit as well as allocations of spending both budget authority and outlays by each of the major functional categories of the budget additionally the budget resolution may include certain optional matters such as reconciliation directives over the years the time frame of the budget resolution has lengthened from one fiscal year to at least five fiscal years and sometimes as many as 10 fiscal years plus the current fiscal year budget resolution enforcement enforcement of the budget resolution relies primarily upon points of order and reconciliation procedures pointoforder provisions contained in the 1974 act which sometimes are supplemented by pointof order provisions carried in annual budget resolutions allow any member in either chamber to prevent the consideration of legislation that would violate budget resolution policies3 of course points of order are not selfenforcing and may be waived with sufficient majority thereby allowing legislation in violation of budget resolution policies to be considered in the senate most of the points of order pertaining to budget enforcement require the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 votes if seats are vacant in order to be waived with regard to the substantive enforcement of the budget resolution ie enforcement of budgetary levels the major points of order under the 1974 act are found in sections 311 and 302 which deal with the enforcement of budget aggregates and committee spending allocations respectively house and senate rules and practices differ somewhat with regard to these two points of order section 311a generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the aggregate budget authority and outlays levels for the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution and any revenue measure that would violate the aggregate revenue level for the first fiscal year or the sum of all fiscal years covered by the budget resolution section 302a generally requires that the aggregate amounts of spending recommended in the annual budget resolution be allocated by committee the house and senate appropriations committees receive an allocation for only one fiscal year but the remaining house and senate committees receive allocations for all of the years covered by the budget resolution section 302b requires the house and 2 the house and senate sometimes have used deeming resolution to provide basis for enforcement when they could not reach agreement on budget resolution for more information on this practice see crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool by robert keith 3 for listing of the points of order see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno crs3 senate appropriations committees to subdivide their allocations by subcommittee4 section 302f generally bars the consideration of any spending measure that would violate the committee spending allocations made under section 302a or the appropriations committees suballocations of spending made under section 302b in view of the different time frames for making committee spending allocations the spending levels are enforceable for one year in the case of the appropriations committees but are enforceable for multiyear period in the case of the other house and senate committees the purpose of the budget reconciliation process is to change substantive law so that revenue and mandatory spending levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies5 reconciliation generally has been used to reduce the deficit through spending reductions or revenue increases or combination of the two in recent years however the reconciliation process also has encompassed revenue reduction generally and spending increases in selected program areas reconciliation is twostep process under the first step reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing one or more committees in each house to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues or both by the amounts specified in the budget resolution if more than one committee in each house is given instructions each instructed committee submits reconciliation legislation to its respective budget committee which incorporates all submissions without any substantive revision into single omnibus budget reconciliation measure when only one committee is given instructions that committee reports its reconciliation legislation directly to its chamber thus bypassing its respective budget committee under the second step of the reconciliation process reconciliation legislation is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures for example debate time in the senate on reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane the process culminates when the reconciliation legislation is enacted and the policies of the budget resolution are put into effect or the reconciliation legislation is vetoed and the veto is not overridden from two required annual budget resolutions to one as originally framed the 1974 act required the house and senate to adopt two budget resolutions each year the first budget resolution scheduled for adoption by may 15 was to set advisory levels while the second budget resolution scheduled for adoption by september 15 just before the start of the fiscal year on october 1 was to set binding levels the requirement for first budget resolution was established in section 301 of the act the requirement for second budget resolution was established in section 4 the spending allocations to committees usually are included in the joint explanatory statement on the budget resolution the spending suballocations made by the appropriations committees are set forth in house or senate reports as appropriate 5 the reconciliation process is discussed extensively in crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr and crs report rl30458 the budget reconciliation process timing of legislative action by robert keith crs4 310 the second budget resolution could revise any or all of the levels recommended in the first resolution or any revised budget resolution adopted subsequently as discussed below or it could reaffirm them without change the house and senate reached agreement on second budget resolution for each fiscal year during the first seven years of the congressional budget process covering fy1976fy1982 during the period from fy1983 through fy1986 however the house and senate effectively abandoned the practice of adopting more than one budget resolution each year6 the first budget resolution in each of those years carried provision referred to as the automatic second budget resolution that deemed the first budget resolution to be the second budget resolution for enforcement purposes automatically on october 1 if second budget resolution had not been adopted by that date7 second budget resolutions as well as automatic second budget resolution provisions in first budget resolutions are identified in table 1 table 1

final action on the second budget resolution for fy1982 was delayed until december 10 1981 nearly three months behind schedule and on the first budget resolution for fy1983 until june 23 1982 more than month late further on initial consideration the two budget resolutions passed by narrow margins in the house 206200 and 219206 respectively and the senate 4948 and 4943 respectively 7 for example section 7 of sconres 92 97th congress the first budget resolution for fy1983 stated if congress has not completed action by october 1 1982 on the concurrent resolution on the budget required to be reported under section 310a of the budget act for the 1983 fiscal year then for purposes of section 311 of such act and section 4 of this resolution this concurrent resolution shall be deemed to be

prepared by the congressional research service notes asbr refers to automatic second budget resolution asbr provisions deemed the first budget resolution to be the second budget resolution for enforcement purposes automatically on october 1 if second budget resolution had not been adopted by that date only the provisions in the fy1985 and fy1986 budget resolutions carried the designation of an asbr provision the entry na means not applicable ultimately the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 amended the 1974 act to conform it to the changed congressional practice8 beginning with fy1987 the change required the adoption each year of only one budget resolution and advanced the deadline for completed action on the budget resolution from may 15 to april 15 revision and adjustment of the budget resolution as indicated above the 1974 act originally reflected the assumption that revisions and adjustments would be routine part of the congressional budget process by requiring the adoption each fall of second budget resolution revising or reaffirming the first resolution although the house and senate terminated this requirement in favor of adopting single budget resolution each year revisions and adjustments may be made in budget resolutions in several other ways first revised budget resolution may be adopted by the house and senate as separate measure under authority provided in section 304 of the 1974 act second revisions in currentyear levels may be incorporated into the budget resolution for the following fiscal year third adjustments may be made under authority provided in section 314 of the 1974 act or comparable provisions included in budget resolutions fourth adjustments may be made pursuant to reserve funds or similar provisions included in budget resolutions fifth adjustments may be made whenever the fungibility rule is used under the reconciliation process finally deeming resolutions may include revisions to budget resolutions or provisions that effectively constitute revisions the authority for each of these six categories of revisions and the record of experience in each category is discussed below revised budget resolutions under section 304 section 304 of the 1974 act which is codified at 2 usc 635 authorizes the house and senate to adopt 8 the 1985 act is title ii of measure increasing the statutory limit on the public debt pl 99177 december 12 1985 99 stat 10371101 as amended section 201b of the 1985 act 99 stat 1040 provided new title iii of the 1974 act the requirement for single annual budget resolution was set forth in the new section 301 crs6 revised budget resolution for fiscal year as separate measure9 this action may occur at any time after the initial budget resolution for that fiscal year required by section 301 has been agreed to but before the applicable fiscal year has ended the revised budget resolution may change any or all of the budget levels or other matter contained in prior resolution or merely reaffirm them as noted by the conferees on the 1974 act the use of revised budget resolutions from time to time was contemplated by both the house and senate for several reasons the house and senate versions authorized the adoption of additional budget resolutions the conference substitute contains the authority to adopt additional budget resolutions during the fiscal year the managers expect that in addition to the two concurrent resolutions required in may and september congress may adopt at least one additional resolution each year either in conjunction with its consideration of supplemental appropriations or pursuant to the issuance of updated figures for the current fiscal year in the presidents budget furthermore whenever there are sharp revisions in the revenue or spending estimates or major developments in the economy it is expected that congress would review its latest budget resolution and consider possible revisions10 section 304 has been amended four times by 1 the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 2 the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 title i of pl 100119 3 the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 and 4 the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 two of the changes were temporary and were repealed later they made certain enforcement procedures dealing with maximum deficit amounts tied to sequestration procedures and ban in the senate against using more than one set of economic assumptions in developing budget resolution applicable to revised budget resolutions as well as the budget resolutions required under section 301 the other amendments were minor adjustments or conforming changes eg inserting permissible in the section heading during the consideration of revised budget resolution the regular procedures for the consideration of budget resolution set forth in section 305 of the 1974 act apply section 305b1 provides debate limitation of 15 hours in the senate for the consideration of revised budget resolution compared to debate limitation of 50 hours for the budget resolution required under section 301 the text of section 304 in its current form is set forth in box 1 9 section 304 of the 1974 act originally was codified at 31 usc 1325 in the title dealing with money and finance as part of the recodification and enactment of title 31 under pl 97258 september 13 1982 the provision was moved to title 2 which pertains to the congress 10 congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 conference report to accompany hr 7130 hrept 931101 june 11 1974 p 61 crs7 box 1 section 304 of the congressional budget act of 1974 permissible revisions of concurrent resolutions on the budget sec 304 at any time after the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year has been agreed to pursuant to section 301 of this title and before the end of such fiscal year the two houses may adopt concurrent resolution on the budget which revises or reaffirms the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year most recently agreed to third budget resolution for fy1977 the house and senate adopted revised budget resolution as separate measure only once in march 1977 for fy1977 due to the fact that two budget resolutions already had been adopted in 1976 for fy1977 as was required at the time the revised budget resolution was referred to as the third budget resolution for that fiscal year the development of the third budget resolution for fy1977 stemmed from budget revisions including stimulus package submitted to congress by incoming president jimmy carter at the beginning of the 1977 session president carters message to congress stated this budget includes the economic stimulus package which will reduce unemployment and promote steady balanced economic growth the package which has been slightly changed since it was first presented to the congress last month provides for 157 billion in tax reductions and increased outlays in 1977 and 159 billion in 1978 it includes 50 per capita rebate on personal income taxes an increase in the standard deduction reduction in business taxes to stimulate employment and provide incentives for investment expansion in training and employment programs increases in public works funding and additional money for countercyclical revenue sharing grants to state and local governments11 the house budget committee reported the third budget resolution hconres 110 on february 8 1977 hrept 9512 and the senate budget committee reported the third budget resolution sconres 10 on february 10 srept 959 the senate began consideration of the third budget resolution first on february 21 1977 pursuant to privileged motion made by senate majority leader robert c byrd senate budget committee chairman edmund muskie in explaining the need for action on the budget resolution indicated that it was an appropriate response to the circumstances but not the type of action that should be expected to occur routinely the budget committee is reporting this third budget resolution now because of the serious economic conditions facing the country the possibility 11 see proposed changes in 1978 budget message from the president of the united states hdoc 9577 in the congressional record vol 123 pt 4 february 22 1977 p 4905 crs8 of such additional budget resolutions to meet changed conditions demonstrates the flexibility of the budget process but the committee wishes to emphasize that additional resolutions should be the exception and not the rule the budget act provides for such additional resolutions to meet changed conditions not simply to take account of matters which might have been considered in the first and second resolution12 on february 22 the senate agreed to sconres 10 without amendment by vote of 7220 the house began consideration of hconres 110 on february 22 pursuant to privileged motion under the 1974 act made by the chairman of the house budget committee representative robert giaimo as well as unanimous consent agreement reached days earlier13 although the house subsequently developed the practice of considering budget resolutions pursuant to the terms of special rule reported by the house rules committee special rule was not used in this case the 10hour debate limit applicable in the house under section 305a of the 1974 act was split equally between chairman giaimo and the ranking minority member of the budget committee representative delbert latta the house agreed to the budget resolution the next day by vote of 239169 after agreeing to committee amendment in the nature of substitute and an amendment that added 215 million for countercyclical assistance to states and localities and rejecting an amendment in the nature of substitute that proposed permanent tax rate reduction in explaining the need for the third budget resolution chairman giaimo commented it is made necessary in the final analysis by the continuing economic recession which began in late 1974 although the congress actions in early 1975 helped to reverse the economic decline and to begin the recovery from recession that recovery as we now know stalled badly last summer and fall as result the economic goals we set last september in the second budget resolution are longer valid14 according to chairman giaimo the committees recommendations in the third budget resolution with respect to stimulus package 173 billion in total for fy1977 including 138 billion in tax reductions and 35 billion in outlay increases exceeded the presidents recommendations by 13 billion additionally the committees recommendations included 13 proposals unrelated to the stimulus package 12 see the remarks of senator edmund muskie in the congressional record vol 123 pt 4 february 21 1977 pp 47574758 13 the unanimous consent agreement which allowed the house to begin consideration of the measure one day before 10day layover rule expired was entered into on february 16 1977 see the congressional record of that date vol 123 pt 4 at pp 44984499 14 see the remarks of representative robert giaimo in the congressional record vol 123 pt 4 february 22 1977 pp 49204921 crs9 the conferees reported sconres 10 on february 28 hrept 9530 srept 9531 on march 3 house budget committee chairman giaimo called up the conference report as privileged matter the fivehour debate limit provided for under section 305a of the 1974 act was evenly divided between chairman giaimo and ranking minority member latta chairman giaimo explained that the conference agreement included 175 billion in economic stimulus for fy1977 including 138 billion for tax stimulus and 37 billion for accelerated program spending 17 billion in spending for job creation programs he noted exceeded the presidents recommendations15 in addition the budget resolution accommodated some nonstimulus matters including rescission of funding for two naval vessels and 126 billion in budget authority for additional housing subsidies the house agreed to the conference report on march 3 by vote of 226174 on the same day the senate agreed to the conference report by voice vote revisions in the following years budget resolution following the experience in 1977 the house and senate in various years incorporated revisions for the current fiscal year into the budget resolution for the following fiscal year thereby avoiding the need to adopt revised budget resolution as separate measure the first instance of revisions being made in this manner occurred for fy1977 when the first budget resolution for fy1978 included further revisions to the revisions made by the third budget resolution for fy1977 in an effort to accommodate president carters stimulus package the third budget resolution for fy1977 had among other things increased the deficit for that fiscal year by 19150 billion from 50600 billion in the second budget resolution for fy1977 to 69750 billion in the third budget resolution for that year when the need for the economic stimulus dissipated and president carter withdrew his stimulus proposal centered on tax rebates congress used the fy1978 budget resolution to revise the fy1977 deficit level downward to 526 billion close to the level recommended in the second budget resolution for fy1977 other budget levels for fy1977 were revised in the first budget resolution for fy1978 as well16 in this first instance the revisions to currentyear levels made in the budget resolution for the following fiscal year cited the authority of section 304 of the 1974 act the revisions in fy1977 levels made in the fy1978 budget resolution began as follows pursuant to section 304 of the congressional budget act of 1974 the appropriate aggregate amounts for the fiscal year 1977 set forth in the first section of sconres 10 are revised as follows 15 see the remarks of representative robert giaimo in the congressional record vol 123 pt 4 march 3 1977 pp 61976199 16 see section 4 of sconres 19 in first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1978 conference report to accompany sconres 19 hrept 95291 may 11 1977 pp 4 and 5 crs10 in the second instance fy1979 levels set forth in section 1 of the second budget resolution for fy1979 hconres 683 were revised by the first budget resolution for fy1980 but the reference to the authority of section 304 was not used the first budget resolution for fy1980 simply began as follows section 1 of hconres 683 is revised as follows 17 this approach to making revisions in currentyear budget levels was followed in the case of subsequent budget resolutions including those for fy1981fy1986 in those years revisions in currentyear levels were incorporated throughout the sections dealing with budget aggregates and functional allocations of spending for the other years rather than being segregated into their own section of the budget resolution as occurred in earlier years in the case of these revisions reference was made to the authority provided under section 304 revisions in currentyear levels were not made by the budget resolutions for fy1987fy1999 for fy1992 the budget resolution hconres 121 included section that authorized the house budget committee chairman to submit revised aggregates and committee spending allocations but the house and senate did not agree on common set of revised levels18 for fy2000 the budget resolution provided that budget levels for fy1999 activated previously under deeming resolutions in the house and senate be considered revisions of the budget resolution for that year19 the practice of incorporating revisions in currentyear levels in the following years budget resolution recurred with respect to the budget resolutions for fy2001 fy2002 fy2004 and fy2006 as indicated previously budget resolutions were not adopted for fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 most recently the budget resolution for fy2008 adopted by the house and senate on may 17 2007 included revisions in fy2007 levels20 adjustments under section 314 or comparable authorities section 314 of the 1974 act which was added by the budget enforcement act of 1997 and codified at 2 usc 645 provided for adjustments in budget resolution levels see 17 see section 1 of hconres 107 in first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year

the text of the section21 under the section the chairmen of the budget committees were required to adjust various budgetary levels generally for fy1998fy2002 but through fy2003 for adoption incentive payments the adjustments were to be made pursuant to the consideration of legislation in several different categories and were meant to parallel similar adjustments made automatically in the statutory discretionary spending limits and the payasyougo scorecard established initially under the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 the changes made by the bea took the form of amendments to the underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 198522 the budgetary levels subject to adjustment were the discretionary spending limits and budgetary aggregates set forth in the most recent budget resolution and the spending allocations to committees made thereunder adjustments were triggered by legislation mainly annual appropriations acts in the following six categories measures containing designated emergency amounts of discretionary spending direct spending or revenues measures funding continuing disability reviews subject to certain limitations measures providing an allowance for the international monetary fund measures funding arrearages for international organizations international peacekeeping and multilateral development banks but only for the period covering fy1998fy2000 and subject to limit of 1884 billion in budget authority measures providing funds for an earned income tax credit compliance initiative subject to annual limits ranging from 138 million for fy1998 to 146 million for fy2002 and measures providing funds for adoption incentive payments not to exceed 20 million for fy1999fy200323 the adjustments made under this section applied while the legislation was being considered but took effect permanently only when the legislation was enacted the appropriations committees were authorized to report revised spending suballocations conforming to any adjustments that were made section 314 of the 1974 act in part replaced authority for certain adjustments that had been authorized in temporary procedures under section 606d and of the act title vi of the 1974 act later was repealed 21 section 10114 of the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 added section 314 to the 1974 act the bea of 1997 was title x of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 august 5 1997 111 stat 677712 22 the budget enforcement acts of 1990 and 1997 as well as the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 are discussed in crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium clinton t brass coordinator 23 this provision was added by section 201b of the adoption and safe families act of 1997 pl 10589 november 19 1997 111 stat 2115 et seq crs12 the chairmen of the house and senate budget committees made the adjustments required by section 314 and provided notification of their actions in the congressional record in some instances adjustments made in budgetary levels were adjusted second time senate budget committee chairman kent conrad for example announced in september 2002 that an increase in budget levels of nearly 30 billion in budget authority for fy2002 made the previous july stemming from the enactment of emergency supplemental appropriations was being reduced by 51 billion because the president had not concurred in the emergency designation mr president section 314 of the congressional budget act as amended requires the chairman of the senate budget committee to adjust the budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the appropriations committee by the amount of appropriations designated as emergency spending pursuant to section 251b2a of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended on july 23 i filed adjustments to the 2002 budgetary aggregates and allocation for the appropriations committee resulting from the 299 billion in emergency funding included in the conference report to hr 4775 the 2002 supplemental appropriations act for further recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the united states public law 107206 the legislation however included 51 billion in emergency funding that the congress made contingent on the president designating the total amount as emergency spending within 30 days of enactment on august 13 the president announced that he would not declare the 51 billion as emergency spending thereby vitiating the entire amount consequently i am lowering the adjustments i made on july 23 by the amount of the contingency 51 billion in budget authority as well as by the estimated amount of the contingencys impact on 2002 outlays 096 billion24 the house and senate have included provisions in recent budget resolutions that renew on yearly basis some of the types of authorities to make adjustments that were granted under section 314 or that are tantamount to such renewal the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 for example provided in section 404a discretionary spending limits for fy2006fy2008 for purposes of enforcement in the senate but not the house25 under section 404b of the budget resolution the chairman of the senate budget committee was authorized to adjust the discretionary spending limits as well as the budget aggregates and the committee spending allocations in the event that fy2006 appropriations legislation was reported in four areas 1 continuing disability reviews 2 internal revenue service tax enforcement 3 health care fraud and abuse control program and 4 unemployment 24 see the remarks of senate budget

emergency spending provisions from budget enforcement also was accommodated by the fy2006 budget resolution instead of providing for adjustments to cover such spending however the budget resolution in section 402 stipulated that such spending shall not count for purposes of specified enforcement provisions under the 1974 act the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 also included house and senate procedures for the four categories of adjustment noted above which were referred to by the house as program integrity initiatives as well as for adjustments for the costs of overseas deployments involving the wars in afghanistan and iraq section 207 in addition procedures were included for the exemption of emergency spending section 20427 finally provisions have been included in recent budget resolutions that provide for adjustments beyond the scope of what had been authorized under section 314 the fy2006 and fy2008 budget resolutions in section 406 and section 212 respectively for example required the chairmen of the house and senate budget committees to make adjustments in budget levels upon the enactment of any measure making change in budget concepts or definitions adjustments pursuant to reserve funds reserve funds have been recurring component of budget resolutions for many years reserve fund is provision in budget resolution that authorizes the chairman of the house or senate budget committee to adjust the aggregate levels of revenue and spending in the budget resolution and the spending allocations made to committees thereunder as appropriate if specified legislative action occurs generally the legislative action specified is the reporting of bill or joint resolution by named committee or the offering of an amendment thereto or the submission of conference report thereon dealing with particular subject as long as the conditions specified in the reserve fund are met when the measure is reported or other appropriate legislative action occurs then the budget committee chairman may make the authorized adjustments such action is taken at the discretion of the budget committee chairman and is not automatic reserve funds often set the condition that the net budgetary impact of the specified legislation be deficit neutral under deficitneutral reserve fund procedures committee could report legislation with spending in excess of its allocations but if the excess amounts were offset by equivalent amounts of revenue increases then the budget committee chairman could increase the committee spending allocations 26 for an example of an adjustment under section 404b of the fy2006 budget resolution see the remarks of senate budget committee chairman judd gregg in the congressional record daily ed of july 28 2005 at pp s9274s9275 27

and 96108 joint explanatory statement crs14 by the appropriate amounts to prevent point of order under section 302 and adjust the revenue aggregates appropriately as well reserve funds sometimes are not subject to deficitneutral requirement instead they allow higher level of spending than initially is reflected in the budget resolution as long as the legislation meets the conditions of the reserve fund in some instances the increases authorized by reserve fund are limited to specified amounts recent and well known example of reserve fund is the one provided for medicare modernization and prescription drugs in section 401 of the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 the purpose of the reserve fund was to allow the applicable budget levels to be increased by up to 7 billion for fy2004 and 400 billion for fy2004fy2013 to accommodate legislation involving medicare prescription drug program and related matters the reserve fund procedure applicable in the senate under section 401b which was little less complicated than the reserve fund procedure applicable in the house under section 401a read as follows b in the senate if the committee on finance of the senate reports bill or joint resolution or an amendment is offered thereto or conference report thereon is submitted that strengthens and enhances the medicare program under title xviii of the social security act 42 usc 1395 et seq and improves the access of beneficiaries under that program to prescription drugs or promotes geographic equity payments the chairman of the committee on the budget may revise appropriate budgetary aggregates and committee allocations of new budget authority and outlays provided by that measure for that purpose but not to exceed 7000000000 for fiscal year 2004 and 400000000000 for the period of fiscal years 2004 through 201328 the reserve fund in section 401 was triggered and the legislation was enacted into law on december 8 2003 as the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 10817329 adjustments pursuant to use of the fungibility rule section 310c of the 1974 act known informally as the fungibility rule and codified at 2 usc 641 grants some flexibility to committees subject to reconciliation directives pertaining to both spending and revenues this provision applies principally to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee because they exercise jurisdiction in their chambers over tax legislation generally some other committees exercise jurisdiction over matters such as certain fees involving budgetary transactions that are scored as revenues 28 see section 401 of hconres 95 in concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 conference report to accompany hconres 95 hrept 10871 april 10 2003 pp 2021 29 see the remarks of senate budget committee chairman don nickles in the congressional record daily ed of june 18 2003 at p s8118 regarding the adjustment under the medicare reserve fund crs15 in essence the fungibility rule deems either committee to be in compliance with its reconciliation directives if its recommended legislation does not cause either the spending changes or the revenue changes to exceed or fall below its instruction by more than 20 of the sum of the two types of changes and the total amount of changes recommended is not less than the total amount of changes that were directed the rule authorizes the chairman of the budget committee to file changes in budget resolution levels and committee spending allocations thereunder whenever the fungibility rule is exercised further it requires that any committee receiving revised spending allocations report committee spending suballocations the fungibility rule has been used from time to time most recently it was used by the house and senate with respect to consideration of the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 pl 10827 may 28 200330 revisions under deeming resolutions deeming resolution is term that refers to legislation deemed to serve as an annual budget resolution for purposes of establishing enforceable budget levels for budget cycle31 deeming resolution is used when the house and senate are late in reaching final agreement on budget resolution or fail to reach agreement altogether the term deeming resolution is not officially defined nor is there any specific statute or rule authorizing such legislation instead the use of deeming resolution simply represents the house and senate employing regular legislative procedures to deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis the form and content of deeming resolution is not prescribed so it may be shaped to meet the particular needs at hand for example the house and senate have used simple resolutions as the legislative vehicle in the past but deeming resolution may be incorporated into bill such as an annual appropriations act as single provision at minimum deeming resolutions provide new spending allocations to the appropriations committees but they also may set new aggregate budget levels provide revised spending allocations to other house and senate committees or provide for other related purposes the use of deeming resolution for fy2005 and again for fy2007 was especially important in the senate because it was the vehicle used to revise limit on discretionary spending for that year enforceable by point of order that had been included in the prior years budget resolution but that had become insufficient to accommodate current senate policy 30 see the remarks of senate budget committee chairman don nickles in the congressional record daily ed of may 22 2003 at pp s6969s6971 and the remarks of house budget committee chairman jim nussle in the congressional record daily ed of june 12 2003 at pp h5354h5355 31 for more information on this topic see crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool by robert keith crs16 in 2004 the house considered the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution sconres 95 under the terms of special rule hres 649 hrept 108 500 may 19 2004 in anticipation of the possibility that final senate approval of the budget resolution might be delayed or might not occur at all deeming resolution provision was included in section 2 of hres 649 the house agreed to hres 649 on may 19 2004 by vote of 220204 the following month on june 24 the house rejected resolution hres 685 offered by representative david obey that would have amended the budget levels in effect under the deeming resolution for the two months following house action on the deeming resolution provision the senate did not consider the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution nor act on deeming resolution during this period however senate action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2005 was subject to ceiling of 814 billion on total appropriations for that year included in the prior years budget resolution which remained in effect the 814 billion ceiling for fy2005 presented the senate with two problems first the conference agreement on the fy2005 budget resolution revised the recommended level of appropriations for that fiscal year upward by 7 billion to new total of 821 billion in order for the senate to consider regular appropriations acts for fy2005 at level comparable to house action the 7 billion difference would have to be accommodated through procedure such as designating an equivalent amount of appropriations to be emergency spending course of action that was considered less desirable second the 814 billion ceiling applied to total appropriations only it did not provide basis for the enforcement of spending levels during the consideration of individual acts unless all 13 of the individual acts were packaged together into single omnibus act on july 22 2004 the senate resolved these problems by adopting the conference report on hr 4613 the defense appropriations act for fy2005 president bush signed the measure into law on august 5 2004 as pl 108287 118 stat 951 et seq section 14007 of the act deeming resolution provision which took effect upon enactment established the revised level of 821 billion as the allocation of new budget authority to the senate appropriations committee for purposes of section 302a of the 1974 act and repealed the outdated limit of 814 billion in the prior years budget resolution in 2006 the house and senate faced similar situation once again the house included deeming resolution provisions in special rule on an annual appropriations act on may 18 2006 the house agreed to hres 818 hrept 109469 may 17 2006 special rule providing for the consideration of hr 5386 the interior appropriations act for fy2007 the house agreed to the measure by vote of 218 192 section 2 of hres 818 put into effect the budget policies embodied in the fy2007 budget resolution hconres 376 as adopted by the house as well as the procedures under title iii of the 1974 congressional budget act used to enforce them several weeks following house action on the deeming resolution provision the senate addressed the matter as well as had been the case two years earlier senate crs17 action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2007 was subject to cap established in the budget resolution for the prior year that was judged to be too tight the fy2007 budget resolution passed by the senate as well as by the house reflected cap on appropriations for the fiscal year of 873 billion but the cap for that fiscal year established in the fy2006 budget resolution was 7 billion lower at 866 billion this situation raised the same problems that the senate faced in 2004 on june 15 2006 the senate resolved the matter by adopting the conference report on hr 4939 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery for fy2006 president bush signed the measure into law the same day as pl 109234 section 7035 120 stat 489490 of the act which took effect upon enactment established the revised level of 873 billion as the allocation of new budget authority to the senate appropriations committee for purposes of section 302a of the 1974 act and made the outdated limit of 866 billion in the prior years budget resolution inapplicable further the 873 billion cap was made subject to provisions in the senatepassed budget resolution pertaining to limitations and adjustments applicable to emergency spending revision of reconciliation directives reconciliation directives included in budget resolution have not been revised by subsequent budget resolution the first use of reconciliation directives by the house and senate occurred in the second budget resolution for fy1981 the resultant reconciliation measure was enacted into law pl 96499 in late 1980 before the next budget resolution the first budget resolution for fy1982 was considered the second use of reconciliation directives occurred in the first budget resolution for fy1982 the resultant reconciliation measure was enacted into law pl 9735 in mid1981 before the next budget resolution the second budget resolution for fy1982 was considered thereafter the house and senate have agreed to more than one budget resolution in each year final action on any reconciliation measures that were considered pursuant to budget resolution and enacted or vetoed during this period was completed before the next budget resolution was considered in one instance in 2006 there was an informal agreement to achieve greater level of savings in direct spending in the thenongoing reconciliation process than had been directed earlier in the session in the budget resolution32 beginning in september 2005 congress and the president enacted various measures intended to provide relief to the victims of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita and to fund 32 the reconciliation process for fy2006 is discussed in more detail in crs report rl33132 budget reconciliation legislation in 20052006 under the fy2006 budget resolution by robert keith crs18 reconstruction activities33 in the fall of 2005 republican leaders in the house and senate and others expressed concern about the impact of these relief and reconstruction efforts on the federal deficit and developed plans to enact offsets to some of the relief costs on october 6 2005 speaker of the house j dennis hastert issued press release on plan developed by house republican leaders34 in commenting on the plan speaker hastert noted hurricanes katrina and rita have dealt severe blow to our nation both in terms of human and economic losses we can and will recover but it will require some serious belttightening throughout the federal government house republican leadership committee chairmen and key members of the conference have worked together to come up with proposal we believe can accomplish this task in order to maintain our commitment to deficit reduction we are proposing to move midsession budget amendment for the first time in almost 30 years 1977 the amendment will increase the total amount of savings which can help pay for these unexpected costs the hastert plan had four elements according to the speakers press release an increase of 15 billion or more in the mandatory savings required to be achieved through the budget reconciliation process from about 35 billion for fy2006fy2010 to at least 50 billion for that period as well as the dollarfordollar offset of any new mandatory spending for disaster relief included in reconciliation legislation continued restraint on discretionary spending including an additional acrosstheboard cut in discretionary spending for fy2006 packages of additional rescissions to further help offset reconstruction costs and the permanent elimination through deauthorization of programs already zeroed out in the current appropriations process35 as announced by the speaker the plan did not indicate what portion or amount of costs would be offset in part because the full range of costs were not then known most of the relief costs estimated at that time more than 62 billion were 33

hurricane relief at 132 billion as of november 30 200736 the speakers press release stated that first step in implementing the plan could be the consideration of revised budget resolution for fy2006 house action on revised budget resolution tentatively was scheduled for thursday october 20 but action was postponed and never was rescheduled37 in the meantime seven of the eight house committees already subject to reconciliation directives in the fy2006 budget resolution were informed by the republican leadership that they should work toward achieving in the aggregate an additional 15 billion in fiveyear savings through their reconciliation recommendations although the increased savings amounts for each committee were not announced officially media reports indicated that the house ways and means and education and workforce committees were expected to achieve most of the increased savings roughly an additional 7 billion and 5 billion respectively38 by informal agreement the schedule of reconciliation actions in the house was delayed to accommodate these developments in the senate the republican leadership announced its support for enacting offsets but did not specify comprehensive plan to do so or indicate any intent to consider revised budget resolution on september 12 senate majority leader bill frist and senate budget committee chairman judd gregg issued joint statement indicating that in order to allow the congress and the committees to address the immediate concerns related to the recent hurricane and not be encumbered by budget reconciliation requirements in the near term the senate budget committee would not meet to markup the spending reconciliation bill until october 2639 on september 27 senate majority leader frist budget committee chairman gregg and other members of the republican leadership wrote to the chairmen of the committees subject to reconciliation instructions asking them to recommend spending reductions above and beyond those already called for under the instructions as part of the offset efforts in addition the leadership also sent letters 36 statement regarding the costs is available on the senate budget committee republican

during further legislative action according to the congressional budget office the net savings over five years attributed to the conference agreement on the spending reconciliation bill amounted to just under 39 billion which was almost 5 billion more than required under the reconciliation instructions in the fy2006 budget resolution additional savings were achieved in appropriations legislation
