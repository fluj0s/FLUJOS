finance division october 5 2007 abstract the recent pickup in productivity is at least in part attributable to the rapid rate of decline in the prices of computers and other it equipment an important factor in those price declines has been innovation in the manufacture of microprocessors as computer prices have fallen their use has become much more widespread because of falling prices it has become proﬁtable to put computers to uses with smaller and smaller returns there is also the prospect that it may take ﬁrms considerable amount of time to adapt the way they do business to take advantage of their investments in it equipment as was the case with other historic technological advances the productivity gains attributable to investments in it equipment may ripple through the economy for some timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456 order code rl32456 productivity will the faster growth rate continue updated october 5 2007 brian w cashell specialist in macroeconomic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456productivity will the faster growth rate continue summary while policymakers have at least some direct or indirect influence over many economic variables productivity growth may be among thos that remain relatively removed from the influence of deliberate economic policy lthough many policy proposals are advocated on the grounds that they will help boost productivity it may be that productivity growth rates have greater influe nce on policy than policy does on the growth of productivity it seems that variations in the productivity growth rate are so incompletely unders tood that there is clear consensus among economists about the best way for policymakers to promote it since the mid 1990s productivity growth ppears to have accelerated this is unusual in mature economic expansion wh ich has suggested to more than few observers that it was not just shortterm phenomenon but rather sign that there was an increase in the longterm economic growth rate an important question for policymakers is how long this surge in productivity growth will continue higher productivity growth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income tax rates yields higher federal revenues as long as social security operates on pa yasyougo basis productivity growth also extends the date of reckoning as far as the trust fund balances are concerned because the incomes of those paying social security taxes will grow more rapidly than the benefits whether productivity growth continues at the rate it did in the late 1990s is critical concern for those making and using longterm economic forecasts productivity is highly cyclical variable so that assessing its rate of growth at any single point in time requires knowing th particular stage of the business cycle however it is the long run tr end rate of growth of produc tivity that is of particular interest because that is the source of rising standards of living following the business cycle peak in the fourth qua rter of 1973 productivity growth slowed substantially unfortunately that sl owdown remains poorly understood which makes it difficult to design policies that might pr omote productivity growth the recent pickup in productivity is at least in part attributable to the rapid rate of decline in the prices of computers and other it equipment an important factor in those price declines has been innovati on in the manufacture of microprocessors as computer prices have fallen their use has become much more widespread because of fa lling prices it has become profitable to put computers to uses with smaller and smaller returns there is also the prospect that it may take firms considerable amount of time to adapt the way they do

least over th long run because it determines the rate of improvement in our nati onal standard of living economywide increases in productivity indicate increases in real pr oduction and incomes which have been achieved without an increase in work c onsumers can buy more of those goods and services or leisure that make their lives easier or more enjoyable even when productivity growth is limited to certain industries every one benefits from the lower prices or the improved quality for those goods and services while policymakers have at least some direct or indirect influence over many economic variables productivity growth may be among thos that remain relatively removed from the influence of delibera economic policy although policy proposals may be represented as promo ting productivity growt h productivity growth may have greater influence on polic than policy does on the growth of productivity it seems that variations in the productivity growth rate are so incompletely understood that there is clear consensus among economists how policymakers might go about promoting it nonetheless productivity gr owth rates do have impor tant consequences for policymakers the budget process for exam ple typically looks at least five if not 10 years ahead in setting spending and tax po licies with respect to social security the time frame is even longer over such an extended period of time some insight into the outlook for productivity growth is critical to projecting other economic variables and establishing an economic baseline on which to base budget decisions without at least some understanding of underlying factors projections of productivity may simply reduce to quantifying forecaster optimism between 1973 and 1995 productivity growth was sluggish compared to what it had been during the 1960s in 1995 productivity growth picked up that it happened well into an econo mic expansion was unusual and it raised hopes that it was more than temporary and promised durable increase in the rate of growth this report examines both the cyclical and long run characteristics of productivity growth discusses continuing efforts to explain the acceleration in productivity growth and considers whether the faster growth rate can be expected to continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs2 productivityoutput hours output productivity hours what is productivity productivity is ratio it is measure of the quantity of output produced relative to the amount of work required to produce it most often it is expressed as the ratio of some measure of inflationadjusted output to the number of labor hours involved mathematically it looks something like this rearranging the terms can help illust rate the significance of productivity this shows that total output is func tion of both work and productivity any increase in output must therefore come about as the result of increases in either hours worked or productivity in the short run hours worked may vary over the business cycle as the unemployment rate rises nd falls beyond that hours worked may vary somewhat over time as the proportion of the population in the labor force changes but in the long run hours is primarily determined by population growth output growth is an important policy goal but if it only come s by increasing hours worked then living standards are unlikely to improve when the economy is at full employment the combined growth rates of labor and its productivity represent sort of speed limit sustained economic growth above that limit is considered likely to result in an accelerating rate of inflation that is another reason why it is important fo r policymakers to be aware of productivity growth trends the difficulty of projecting productivity to make longrun projections of out put forecasters must estimate what productivity growth will likely be over the forecasted period however the study of productivity has not advanced to the point where it can be projected based on what is known now about economic conditions most forecasts project productivity growth to continue at its cu rrent trend rate of growth the current trend rate of productivity growth can be difficult to discern usually trend rates of grow th in productivity are measur ed over the entire course of business cycle to control for cyclical va riability in the rate of productivity growth the trend rate is thus termined by comparing produc tivity at successive business cycle peaks but depending on the length of those cycles that may mean estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs3 1 the last two complete business cycles exceeded 100 months measured from peak to peak 2 crs report rl30239 economic forecasts and the budget by brian w cashellof the trend rate of growth of productivity are based on somewhat dated information it can take considerable length of time before change in the trend rate of growth is fully appreciated1 although it is now clear that productivity growth picked up beginning in 1995 it was some time before it was thought to be part of potentially durable shift in the longrun rate of productivity growth most economic forecasters including the congressional budget office and the office of management and budget underpredicted real economic growth by an average of about 2 percentage points in each of the fours years after 19952 now that the acceleration in productivity has outlived the last expansion and seems to be continuing into the present one there is growing confidence it will persist whether that confidence is misplaced only time will tell the cyclical nature of productivity in the short run it can be difficult to tell whether change in the rate of productivity growth is temporar or indicative of change in the longrun trend to economists productivitys significance has more to do with the long run and so variations in its longrun trend and the factors that influence it are the focus of considerable research produc tivity is cyclical variable and tends to fluctuate in somewhat predictable ways over the course of the business cycle understanding those cyclical patterns is necessary to any analysis of productivity data although each business cycle has unique aspects there are certain tendencies that characterize them one of those tendencies is for productivity growth to be procyclical in recession productivity tends to decline or grow less rapidly as the recession ends and the economy begins to expand productivity growth usually picks up at the beginning of an economic cont raction demand for goods and services declines but firms may be slow to lay off workers both because they may have invested considerable amount of time and money in thei r recruitment and training and because there are costs associated with laying those workers off and then rehiring them when business recovers the othe r input to production physical capital is relatively fixed in the short run so at the beginning of an economic downturn output tends to fall more rapidly than ither labor or capital and so measured productivity declines if the contraction continue s and production falls enough firms will begin to lay off workers at first they will tend to be those most recently hired with the least amount of training and who were relativel less productive than those hired beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs4 reducing the quantity of labor employed tends to modera any initial deceleration in measured productivity growth as the contraction comes to an end and the economy begins to expand again firms can increase their output initially by putting idle capital back to work and taking advantage of any underutilized labor already on hand this increase in output with little or increase in hours worked is reflected in relatively rapid productivity growth once increasing demand can longer be satisfied with existing capacity additional labor will be added those hired first will tend to be those relatively more experienced as more and more labor is hired the contribution to output of each additional hire tends to drop as the ex pansion ages productivity growth slows from the rates earlier on in the expansion the general tendency is thus for productivity growth to decline during contractions and increase in expansions other things being equal productivity growth is likely to be faster in the early stages of an expansion than it is after the economy has regained full employment measurement issues productivity is ratio of the quan tity of output produced to the quan tity of inputs used in its production an increase in the quantity of output with increase in hours worked would be an increase in productivity as long as output is rising faster than the contribution of labor nd capital measured productivity will rise the most commonly cited measure of productivity published by the federal government is average labor productivity it is published quarterly by the bureau of labor statistics of the depar tment of labor bls the measure of output used by bls in its calculation is based on da ta from the national income and product accounts published by the bureau of econo mic analysis bea of the department of commerce labor productivity is measur ed in terms of average output per hour it is ratio of the quantity of output to the hours of work done if the quantity of output rises by the same proportion as the amount of work then the economy is only producing more either because there are more workers or workers are putting in longer hours and there is productivity gr owth if output rises faster than hours worked labor productivity is also increasing problems in measu ring real output production of goods and services is n ecessarily measured in terms of dollar values because that is the only unit of measure common to all of the goods and services produced the dollar value of output however reflects not only the quantity of goods and services produced but also th eir prices the dollar value of output will rise with in increase in the quantity of goods and services produced but it will also rise with an increase in their prices distinguishing between changes in output that are real ie indicative of changes in quantity and changes that are due only to variations in the general pri ce level is difficult problem httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs5 3 j steven landefeld and

ppproductivity measures are ba sed on inflationadjusted measures of output the way in which price change is measured can thus affect measures of productivity growth if existing price indexes understate the rate of inflation that will cause estimates of productivity gr owth to be overstated few goods or services stay the same from year to year over time most products acquire new characteristics that make it difficult to compare them with earlier models an increase in the price of car for example may reflect rising prices throughout the economy but it may so reflect new featur such as catalytic converters or airbags ideally those price increases due to the addition of these new characteristics would not affect the pri ce index for cars even though the same number of cars might be sold in succe ssive periods the newer model car might provide better eg safer or less polluting service over its useful life more difficult problem is the introduction of an entirely new product because there is price from an earlier period with whic h to compare the introductory price of all the goods and services produce d computers may be changing the most rapidly from year to year the prices of computers have been falling and their performance has been improving dramatically rather than simply track change in the price of computer from one year to the next the bea attempts to track changes in the price of computing power3 that means that it tries to take into account changes in mory processing speed and other features when estimating price change in successive models of computers some sectors of the economy may be easier to measure than others in the case of manufactured goods there is at least tangible product that can be counted even though there may be difficulties in asse ssing changes in its quality or other characteristics in the case of services it can be difficult even to define what is being produced take medical care for example in the case of physician services what should be measured as production the num ber of office visits per hour should success at treating various ilments be taken into account some have argued that because the rvice sector accounts for growing share of total national output and b ecause it is more difficult to measure productivity in the service sector that overall measures of productivity have become more prone to error at one time it was suggested that at least part of the slowdown in productivity growth that began by most accounts in 1973 may have been due to measurement problems associated with the increased size of the service sector4 more recent evidence suggests that is unlikely to have been the case those sectors considered to be harder to measure account for some of the larger productivity gains since 19955httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs6 6 these data reflect productivity in the nonfarm business sector the business cycle reference dates use here are those established by the national

than it was in the last year second it is clear from the data that following the business cycle peak in the fourth quarter of 1973 productiv ity growth was quite bit slower than it had been in prior

productivity growth for much of the postworld war ii era the united states experienced relatively rapid rates of productivity gr owth between the fourth quarter of 1948 and the fourth quarter of 1973 output per labor hour in the nonfarm business sector grew at an annual rate of 27 betw een the fourth quarter of 1973 and the fourth quarter of 1995 that rate fell to 15 per year most economists point to 1973 as the beginning of an extended period of slower productiv ity growth that drop in the rate of productivity growth has been the focus of much economic researc h thus far the slowdown remains poorly understood the prime suspect in that slowdown at least initially was the opec oil price hike which in 1973 roughly doubled the price of crude oil the mere coincidence of the productivity slowdown and the rise in price of major input to the production of goods and services motivated research into the connection the theory was that because of higher energy costs much of the existing capital stock which relied on energy to contribute to output became obsolete7 subsequent experience however cas t doubts on the significance of the coincidence between 1979 and 1981 oil prices doubled again and then in 1986 the price of oil fell by nearly half that only one of these large oil price changes was associated with shift in the trend rate of growth in productivity suggested that if there was single factor to blame fo r the 1973 slowdown it was likely to be found elsewhere another potential cause for the post 1973 slowdown was spending on research and development rd gr iliches found that rd spe nding as percentage of gdp declined beginning in the mid1960s8 the timing of the decline would seem to implicate it but it is hard to make strong case out of single instance moreover other countries so experienced decline in productivity growth without rd spending having dropped griliches also pointed out that in th 1970s the number of patents granted in the united states declined that resulte d in drop in the number of patents per dollar of rd spending griliches suggested that decline in the number of patents per dollar of rd spending may have been evidence of diminishing returns to rd spending and he wondered if there might be sort of technol ogical frontier near which opportunities for inventi on become relatively scarcerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs8 9 angus maddison

annual 1996 mit press pp 259267maddison examined number of factors in an effort to account for the role each one may have played in the slowdown9 maddison was able to explain only 41 of the total deceleration in output growth of 14 separate factors the most important was found to have accounted for less than oneseventh of the slowdown because the slowdown in productivity has b een dated to single point in time it was suspected that single cause for the slowdown might be found identifying single cause would have been more satisfying in that policy measures might have been designed to reverse it if the sl owdown had affected di fferent industries more or less equally that might have favor ed arguments that single cause was responsible however when productivity trends were examined for individual industries some were f ound to have fared well in comparison with others10 gordon offered slightly different perspective on the post1973 slowdown he maintained that rather than trying to ex plain why productivity growth slowed in the 1970s and 1980s th focus should instead be on why it was so rapid earlier11 gordon argued that in the 1970s productivity growth simply fell back to its longrun trend rate and that the growth experienced earlier in the century was unusually rapid due to number of technological advances among the advances he cites are the spread of electric motors the internal combustion engi ne and the telephone and its derivatives gordon argues that thes innovations had much greater economic effect than the elect ronic computer he goes on to suggest that the economy may be on longrun curve of diminishing returns to technological advancement and that the various modifications and improvements to devices such as computers are less important than their introduction accounting for economic growth thus far economic growth has been expl ained as the sum of the growth rates of labor and labor pr oductivity but labor is not the only factor of production so that explanation remains incomplete most economic textbooks present basic overview of the theory of economic growth that is known as the neoclassical model in this model output is explained as the result of combination of not just labor but also capital and technology in this model the size of the capital stock is determined by the saving rate and technology is treated as exogenous whic h is

quoted for his remark that the effect of computers can be seen everywhere but in the productivity statistics15 through the 1980s and early 1990s there seemed to be big payoff from the growing stock of comput ers that presented puzzle to those who expected significant returns it is now believed that computers have had much to do with the acceleration in productivity growth since the mid1990s whether that is the case and how computers have affected productivity growth are important in trying to assess how durable the acceleration will prove to be it is getting to the point where consum ers expect the rapid pace of innovation in the manufacture of computers to continue it is also widely assumed that the speed and memory capacity of those computers w ill continue to improve at steady pace this rapid rate of technological adva nce in the development and manufacture of computers was predicted in 1965 by gor don moore one of the cofounders of intel corporation16 specifically moores law predicted that the number of transistors that could be put on com puter chip would double every 18 months whether that prediction was selffulf illing prophecy may be open to question but the fact is that the pace of technological advance in th manufacture of computers has vindicated moores law over time because of the rapid innovation in the pr oduction of computer chips the prices of computers as well as other goods related to information processing and communications sometimes referred to collec tively as information technology it have been falling steadily for some time figure 1 shows the chainweighted price index published by bea for comput ers and peripheral equipment from 1959 through the middle of 2007 because the chan ges are so large the chart is plotted on logarithmic scale using logarithmic scale has the added advantage in that the slope of the line indicates the rate of change in the variable in this case the rate of change in computer prices has been fair ly steady for long time between 1959 and 1995 computer prices fell at an average annual rate of 172 and between 1995 and 2007 prices fell at an annual rate of 164httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs11 17 j steven

declines reflect substantial improvements in the quality of computers bls has developed proce dure for estimating price indexes for goods whose characteristics are changing rapidly these are referred to as hedonic price indexes hedonic price indexes attempt to estimate statistical relationship between prices and set of characteristics such as memory and processor speed these price indexes are important to the measurement of productivity because estimating price change is necessary to estimating change in real output and thus productivity if the rate of price dec line in computers is overestimated then measures of productivity will be overstated most studies estimate that in the late 1990s prices for personal computers alone fell at an annual ra of somewhere between 30 and 4017

affected growth in pr oductivity in at least two ways first there has been rapid productivity growth in the production of computers which as computers accounted for an in creasing share of total pr oduction tended to raise the overall measure of productivity growth s econd the sharp drop in computer prices has stimulated increased investment in computers which has contributed to an increase in the overall amount of capital available to the workforce this is often referred to as capital deepening increases in the capital stock generally tend to raise worker productivity accounting for the role of computers in the post1995 acceleration in productivity growth prior to the recent acceleration in produc tivity growth most analyses found that computers had not yielded much benefit one reason for that is that until recently computers accounted for relatively sm all share of the total capital stock18 figure 2 real investment in computers and peripheral

productivity growth of the late 1990s may mean that the economy is on higher growth path and that co mputers have had lot to do with it two widely cited studies discussed belo w found considerable evidence that the computer or more generally it equipment is behind most of the recent acceleration in productivity growth there is also evidence of modest spillover into other sectors of the economy in other words investment in computers can raise the productivity of the workers who use them but it may also lead firms to change the way they operate leading to further productivity gains the first study by oliner and sichel at the federal reserve board found that of 09 percentage point increase in the gr owth rate of total factor productivity from the first half of the 1990s to the second half all of it could be accounted for by advances in the production of computers them selves and the also by the use of those computers19 table 3 presents breakdown of oliner and sichels accounting for

technology and economic performance in the american economy national bureau of economic rese arch working paper 8771 feb 2002the evidence suggests that increased productivity in the sector producing it equipment has had modest di rect effect on total factor productivity by far the more important factor has been the dec lining price of it equipment stimulating surge in investment and increasing the size of the capital stock remember that total factor productivity measures changes in output that are not accounted for by changes in economic inputs such as labor and capital there is doubt that computers are raising productivity of many firms but as long as economic statistics measure them correctly the increased share of work computers do will not show up in increased multifactor productiv ity because that measure of productivity tracks the increase in output not associated with the increase in investment in computers21 it is unclear whether computers have had any spillover effects on multifactor productivity beyond their dir ect contribution to growth in output some evidence suggests that those sp illover effects of computers on total factor productivity are fairly small jorgenson and stiroh found that those sectors of the economy that invest most heavily in computers and it equipment such as financial services had among the lowest rates of productivity growth measured22 jorgenson ho and stiroh also estimated pr ojections of growth in average labor productivity they projected that produc tivity growth would range between 114 and 238 over the next decade with base case of 178 just below the 1995 2001 rate of growth in another study robert go rdon f ound that most of the acceleration in labor productivity was attri butable to capital deepening nd faster productivity growth in the production of computers and it equipment23 of the roughly 02 percentage point increase in total factor productivity most was accounted for by faster productivity growth in the manufacture of durable goods that suggests that any spillover effects of computers on the ove rall economy were limited is it the whole story since the publication of those studies attributing much of

commerce bureau of economic analysis gordon suggests that the continuation of rapid productivity gains following the decline in spending on computers may mean that the earlier studies exaggerated the contribution of it spending on the pos t1995 acceleration in productivity growth24 gordon argues that it is implausible that in creased investment in it equipment would have an immediate effect on productivity growth gordon points out that it took forty years for the benefits of electrification to be fully realized factories had to be reorganized to take advantage of electric power in the same way the introduction of computers has driven firms to change business practices those changes take time but the reorganization as well as worker training and other novel business practices made possible by the introduction of computers may have contributed to productivity in ways that are difficult to measure one of the sectors of the economy that experienced relatively rapid productivity growth is retail trade fernald and ramnath cite the particular example of socalled bigbox stores that have become pervasive in retailing25 the success of those large scale retailers may have been made po ssible by the introduction of computers computers allowed those stores to manage sophisticated distribution networks and figure 3 investment in com puters and peripheral equipment as percentage of

benefit from economies of scale baily also suspects that the contributi on of it investments to faster productivity growth might have been overstated26 he points out that prior to 1995 growth accounting was not especially helpful in expl aining variations in productivity growth given the relatively small number of obser vations on which the studies linking it investments to productivity are based they might s till be treated with some skepticism he argues that it might also be the case that the increase in it spending was motivated by the acceleration in growth nordhaus analyzed the contribution of wh at he called the new economy to the post1995 acceleration in productivity growth27 the four industries included in his definition of the new economy are industr ial machinery and equipment electronic and other electric equipment telephone and tele graph and software he found that labor productivity in total nonfarm business accelerated by 161 percentage points between the 19771989 period and the 19952000 period of that the new economy industries contributed only 029 percentage point or about sixth of the total acceleration nordhaus also calculated productivity growth for those industries whose production was well measured well measured industries included agriculture forestry and mining manufacturing transportation and public utilities wholesale trade retail trade and small number of services nordhaus found that the productivity growth in the wellmeasur ed economy accelerated by 131 percentage points less than the increase in total bor productivity nordha us concludes that while the new economy contributed the ri in productivity gr owth was not limited to those firms but was widespread will the faster productivity growth continue perhaps the most important question fo r policymakers is whether or not the surge in productivity growth of the late 1990s will continue higher productivity growth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income tax rates yields higher fede ral revenues as long as social security operates on payasyougo basis it also extends the da of reckoning as far as the trust fund balances are concerned because the incomes of those paying social security taxes will grow more rapidly than the bene fits whether or not productivity growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32456crs18 28 paul w blauer jeffrey l

those making and using longterm economic forecasts28 it now seems likely that most of the in crease in productivity growth of the late 1990s was not just cyclical variation but rather faster productivity growth seems likely to persist but there is still guarantee the major difficulty in projecting pr oductivity growth remains an imperfect understanding of past varia tions some of the sources of productivity growth are clearly understood increased investment and growing capital stock raise labor productivity increased educa tion and training also contribute but aside from the contributions of human and physical capital much less is certain to great extent projections of productivity still reflect the optimism or pessimism of the forecaster it is clear however that the recent pi ckup in productivity is at least in part attributable to the rapid rate of declin in the prices of computers and other it equipment an important factor in thos price declines has been innovation in the manufacture of microprocessors whether or not that rapid pace of innovation keeps up and prices continue to fa ll will be important factors in future rates of productivity growth however ultimately there may be limits to the number of transistors that can be put on single computer chip as computer prices have fallen their use has become much more widespread because of falling prices it has become pr ofitable to put computers to uses with smaller and smaller returns but as long as recent rates of innovation in the production of computers and it equipment continue productivity might at least be expected to continue growing more rapidly than it did between 1973 and 1995 there is also the prospect that it may take firms considerable amount of time to adapt the way they do business to take advantage of their investments in it equipment as was the case with othe r historic technolog ical advances the productivity gains attributable to investments in it equipment may ripple through the economy for some time
