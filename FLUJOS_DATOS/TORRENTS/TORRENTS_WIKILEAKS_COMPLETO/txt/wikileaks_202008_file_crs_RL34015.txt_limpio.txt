us government fiscal year 2008 washington gpo 2007 table 251 p 371 congressional budget office an analysis continued crs2 overview of the congressional budget process the congressional budget process consists of the consideration and adoption of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation within the framework of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the presidents budget congress begins its budget process once the president submits his budget the president is required by law to submit comprehensive federal budget not later than the first monday in february 31 usc 1105 the presidents budget includes estimates of direct spending and revenues under existing laws with certain adjustments as well as estimates of any proposed legislative changes affecting direct spending and revenues in addition the presidents budget contains requests in specific dollar amounts for discretionary spending ie funds controlled through the appropriations process for the upcoming fiscal year although congress is not bound by the presidents budget congressional action on spending and revenue legislation often is influenced by his recommendations as well as subsequent budgetary activities by the president during the year omb assists the president in formulating and coordinating his budget policies and activities on february 5 2007 president bush submitted his fy2008 budget to congress as is the usual practice the presidents budget was submitted as multivolume set consisting of main document that includes the presidents budget message and information on his 2008 proposals budget and supplementary documents that provide special budgetary analyses analytical perspectives historical budget information historical tables and detailed account and program level information appendix among other things3 in addition on february 9 omb made available supplementary document major savings and reforms in the presidents 2008 budget outlining program terminations and reductions proposed in the presidents fy2008 budget the president may revise his budget request any time during the year revisions requested before congress has acted on the initial request are submitted as budget

revised estimates of the budget deficitsurplus receipts outlays and budget authority reflecting changed economic conditions and assumptions and congressional actions the budget resolution implementation and enforcement the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297 332 established the congressional budget process including timetable for congressional action on budgetary legislation see table 1 the congressional budget process provides for an annual concurrent resolution on the budget to serve as framework for the consideration of budgetary legislation the budget resolution sets forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional area for at least five fiscal years as concurrent resolution the budget resolution is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law instead it is an agreement between the house and senate on congressional budget plan providing framework for subsequent legislative action on the budget during each congressional session budget resolution policies are implemented through the enactment of revenue and debtlimit legislation appropriations and other spending measures and if required by the budget resolution one or more reconciliation bills see table 2 congress enforces budget resolution policies through points of order on the floor of each chamber and the reconciliation process for example any legislation that would cause the aggregate levels to be violated is prohibited from being considered further the total budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution are allocated among the house and senate committees having jurisdiction over specific spending legislation any legislation or amendment that would cause these committee allocations to be exceeded is prohibited finally the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their allocations among their respective subcommittees point of order may be raised against any appropriations measure or amendment that would cause one of these subdivisions to be exceeded6 the budget resolution also contains spending levels by functional categories eg national defense but these are not enforceable congress also may use reconciliation legislation discussed further below to enforce the direct spending revenue and debtlimit provisions of budget resolution 5 for background information on the midsession review see crs report rl32509 the midsession review of the presidents budget timing issues by robert keith 6 for more detailed information on

paygo requirements for direct spending and revenue legislation prohibiting the consideration of such legislation if it is projected to increase the deficit in specified time periods both explained further below7 expired statutory budget enforcement procedures for fy1991 through fy2002 congress and the president also were constrained by statutory limits on discretionary spending and statutory paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation8 unlike the enforcement procedures 7 for more detailed information on the paygo requirements see crs report rl32835 paygo rules for budget enforcement in the house and senate by robert keith and bill heniff jr 8 these constraints were first established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388 continued crs5 associated with the budget resolution which are employed while legislation is considered on the floor of each chamber the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration process generally after legislative action for session of congress ended if either of these budget constraints were violated then the president was required to order sequestration which involved largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs by the amount of any violation these budget enforcement mechanisms however expired at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 president bush among others has proposed setting new discretionary spending limits and restoring modified version of the paygo requirement in addition to several other budget process reforms9 if congress and president bush enact new budget enforcement procedures such as these applicable to budget legislation in 2007 this report will incorporate them accordingly 8 continued 630 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 9 in his fy2008 budget president bush proposed to set

budget is based on budget baselines see table 3 the budget baseline is projection of federal revenue spending and deficit or surplus levels based upon current policies assuming certain economic conditions baseline projections provide benchmark for measuring the budgetary effects of proposed policy changes the presidents budget baseline referred to as current services estimates is included in the budget documents submitted to congress13 the presidents baseline usually differs from cbos baseline referred to as baseline budget projections because of different economic and technical

presidents budget proposals and estimates of the budgetary impact of any legislation likely to be considered during the current session of congress the budget committees are not bound by these recommendations the views and estimates often are printed in the committee report or committee print accompanying the budget resolution in the senate16 and compiled as separate committee print in the house the budget resolution was designed to provide framework for making budget decisions leaving specific program determinations to the house and senate appropriations committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction in many instances however particular program changes are considered when the budget resolution is formulated program assumptions sometimes are referred to in the reports of the house and senate budget committees and usually are discussed during floor action although these program changes are not binding committees may be strongly influenced by the recommendations when formulating appropriations bills reconciliation measures or other budgetary legislation the congressional budget process timetable sets april 15 as target date for final adoption of the budget resolution17 the budget act prohibits the consideration of spending revenue or debtlimit legislation for the upcoming year until the budget resolution has been adopted unless the rule is

spending allocations to house and senate committees spending allocations to the appropriations committees only or combination of these in some cases an entire budget resolution earlier adopted by one

reconciliation legislation congress may implement changes to existing law related to direct spending revenues or the debt limit through the reconciliation process under section 310 of the budget act23 the reconciliation process has two stages first congress includes reconciliation directives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution24 second each instructed committee develops legislative recommendations to meet its reconciliation directives and reports its legislative recommendations to its respective chamber directly or transmits such recommendations to its respective budget committee section 310b of the budget act specifies two options for the submission of legislative recommendations to comply with reconciliation directives 1 if one committee is instructed the committee reports its legislative recommendations to its parent chamber directly or 2 if two or more committees are instructed the committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committee in the latter case the legislative language recommended by committees is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more budget reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees once the reconciliation legislation is reported in the house or senate consideration is governed by special procedures these procedures serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation prohibit certain amendments and encourage its completion in timely fashion in the house as with the budget resolution reconciliation legislation usually is considered under special rule establishing the time allotted for debate and what amendments will be in order in the senate debate on budget reconciliation bill and on all amendments debatable motions and appeals is limited to not more than 20 hours after the 20 hours of debate has been reached consideration of amendments motions and appeals may continue but without debate in both chambers the budget act requires that amendments to reconciliation legislation be germane and not increase the deficit also the budget act prohibits the consideration of reconciliation legislation or any amendment to reconciliation bill recommending changes to the social security program finally in the senate 23 for full discussion of the reconciliation process see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr 24 at the beginning of the 110th congress the house adopted new rule clause 7 of rule xxi that prohibits the consideration of budget resolution containing reconciliation directives that would have the net effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus in the senate section 202 of sconres 21 the fy2008 budget resolution agreed to on may 17 prohibits the consideration of reconciliation measure that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus crs14 section 313 of the budget act commonly referred to as the byrd rule prohibits extraneous matter in reconciliation bill25 the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 agreed to by the house and senate on may 17 contains reconciliation directives sections 601 and 602 to the house committee on education and labor and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions to report by september 10 2007 reconciliation legislation reducing the deficit by 750 million over the period covering fy2007 fy2012 revenue and debtlimit legislation congress may adopt individual revenue and debtlimit measures without employing the optional reconciliation process as well revenue legislation revenue and debtlimit legislation is under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee article i section 7 of the us constitution requires that revenue legislation originate in the house of representatives but the senate has considerable latitude to amend revenue bill received from the house most of the laws establishing the federal governments revenue sources see figure 1 are permanent and continue year after year without any additional legislative action congress however typically enacts revenue legislation changing some

tariffs and duties 25 for detailed information on the byrd rule see crs report rl30862 the budget reconciliation process the senates byrd rule by robert keith crs15 figure 1 actual fy2006 revenues by source source chart created by crs based on data from congressional budget office the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20082017 washington cbo 2007 p 142 revenue legislation is not considered automatically in the congressional budget process on an annual basis frequently however the president proposes and congress considers changes in revenue laws to effect adjustments in the rates of taxation or the distribution of the tax burden or for other purposes an initial step in the congressional budget process is the publication of revenue estimates of the presidents budget by cbo these revenue estimates usually differ from the presidents since they are based on different economic and technical assumptions eg growth of the economy and change in the inflation rate cost estimates of any congressional revenue proposals are prepared by the joint committee on taxation jct they are published in committee reports or in the congressional record and are available on jcts website26 the budget resolution recommends yearly revenue levels based on baseline estimates of federal government revenues that assume the continuation of existing laws and any proposed policy changes to them revenue levels in the budget resolution provide the framework for any action on revenue measures during the session point of order may be raised against consideration of legislation that causes revenues to fall below the agreed upon levels for the first fiscal year or the total for all fiscal years in the budget resolution this point of order may be set aside by unanimous consent or waived by special rule in the house or by threefifths vote in the senate ie 60 senators if there are vacancies 26 httpwwwhousegovjct crs16 in addition both the house and senate have payasyougo paygo requirements for revenue legislation as well as direct spending as discussed below the house and senate paygo rules rule xxi clause 10 and section 201 of sconres 21 the fy2008 budget resolution respectively prohibit the consideration of revenue legislation as well as direct spending legislation that would have the net effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus over either sixyear period fy2007fy2012 or an 11year period fy2007fy2017 like many other budgetrelated points of order the paygo points of order may be set aside by unanimous consent or waived by special rule in

congress by david l brumbaugh debtlimit legislation the amount of money the federal government is allowed to borrow generally is subject to statutory limit 31 usc 3101 from time to time congress considers and adopts legislation to change this limit27 federal debt consists of debt held by the public plus debt held by government accounts the debt held by the public represents the total net amount borrowed from the public to cover all or most of the federal governments budget deficits by contrast the debt held by government accounts represents the total net amount of federal debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds eg social security trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special nonnegotiable federal government securities and thus are held in the form of federal debt the combination of both types of debt is subject to the statutory public debt limit therefore budget deficits or trust fund surpluses may contribute to the federal government reaching the existing debt limit the annual congressional budget resolution specifies the appropriate level of the public debt for each fiscal year covered by the resolution although the budget resolution does not become law itself the specified debt limits serve as guide for any necessary debtlimit legislation congress may develop debtlimit legislation in any of three ways 1 under regular legislative procedures 2 under house rule xxvii or 3 as part of reconciliation legislation as described above regardless of the process by which debtlimit legislation is developed the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee maintain exclusive jurisdiction over debtlimit legislation under house rule xxvii commonly referred to as the gephardt rule after its author former representative richard gephardt joint resolution specifying the 27 for further information on debtlimit legislation see crs report rs21519 legislative procedures for adjusting the public debt limit brief overview by bill heniff jr and crs report rl31967 the debt limit the ongoing need for increases by philip d winters crs17 amount of the debt limit contained in the budget resolution automatically is engrossed and deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution thereby avoiding separate vote on the debtlimit legislation28 the senate has comparable automatic engrossment procedure if it chooses to consider housepassed joint resolution it does so under the regular legislative process the most recent increase in the publicdebt limit was enacted as an independent measure pl 109182 120 stat 289 which originated pursuant to the gephardt rule in march 2006 the debtlimit measure increased the statutory limit by 781 billion from 8184 trillion to 8965 trillion president bushs fy2008 budget projects that the debt subject to the statutory limit will increase to 8977 trillion 12 billion over the current limit by the end of fy200729 therefore congress and the president will likely need to increase the statutory limit in late 2007 pursuant to house rule xxvii upon the adoption of the fy2008 budget resolution by congress the house clerk engrossed and transmitted to the senate joint resolution hjres 43 increasing the public debt limit by 850 billion to 9815 trillion hjres 43 was deemed to have been adopted by the house on may 17 by vote of 214209 ie the vote upon which the house agreed to the conference report to the fy2008 budget resolution the senate had not yet considered hjres 43 or other debtlimit legislation appropriations and other spending legislation federal spending is categorized into two different types discretionary or mandatory spending discretionary spending is controlled through the annual appropriations acts while mandatory or direct spending which consists mostly of entitlement programs is determined by existing law actual fy2006 federal outlays totaled 26544 billion see figure 2 of this total amount 10162 billion or 38 was discretionary spending exploded slices in figure 2 while 16382 billion or 62 was mandatory spending 28 for further information see crs report rl31913

major spending category source chart created by crs based on data from cbo the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20082017 washington cbo 2007 pp 144 146 and 148 the chart excludes offsetting receipts which are treated as negative spending ie they are deducted from spending in the budget totals offsetting receipts totaled 1406 billion in fy2006 as noted above the total budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution are allocated among the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over specific spending legislation these allocations commonly referred to as 302a allocations after the applicable section of the congressional budget act are specified in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report to the budget resolution30 point of order may be raised against any legislation that would cause committees spending allocation to be exceeded the budget resolution typically provides for periodic revisions of these allocations if certain conditions specified in reserve fund provisions for instance are met discretionary spending discretionary spending is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees soon after the budget resolution is adopted by congress the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations among their subcommittees and formally report these subdivisions to their respective chambers these subdivisions referred to as 302b allocations after the applicable section of the congressional budget act represent 30 see hrept 110153 pp 125132 crs19 the spending ceilings on the individual regular appropriations acts during the appropriations process these suballocations usually are revised several times congress passes three main types of appropriations measures regular appropriations acts provide budget authority for the next fiscal year beginning on october 131 from time to time congress merges two or more of these regular appropriations acts into an omnibus appropriations act supplemental appropriations acts provide additional funding for the fiscal year in progress continuing appropriations acts commonly referred to as continuing resolutions provide stopgap funding for agencies that have not received regular appropriations by the start of the fiscal year the presidents budget includes recommendations for the upcoming fiscal year for agencies programs and activities funded in the annual appropriations measures account and program level detail about these recommendations is included in the appendix volume of the presidents budget documents in addition agencies submit justification materials to the house and senate appropriations committees the budget justifications provide more detailed information about an agencys program activities than is contained in the presidents budget documents and are used in support of agency testimony during appropriations subcommittee hearings on the presidents budget request the house and senate appropriations subcommittees begin holding extensive hearings on appropriations requests shortly after the presidents budget is submitted by custom appropriations measures originate in the house in recent years the senate appropriations committee has adopted and reported original senate appropriations measures allowing the senate to consider appropriations measures without having to wait for the house to adopt its version under this practice the senate version is considered and amended on the floor and then inserted into the houseadopted version when available as substitute amendment thereby retaining the housenumbered bill for final action congress also often adopts one or more continuing resolutions each year because of recurring delays in the appropriations process for example congress passed three continuing resolutions before completing action on the fy2007 regular appropriations acts32 31 each subcommittee of the house and senate appropriations committees typically is responsible for one of the regular appropriations acts at the beginning of the 110th congress the house and senate appropriations committees modified their subcommittee structures establishing 12 parallel appropriations subcommittees for additional information on changes to the appropriations subcommittee structure see crs report rl31572 appropriations subcommittee structure history of changes from 19202005 by james v saturno 32 initially congress and the president enacted continuing appropriations resolution div b of pl 109289 to provide temporary appropriations through november 17 2006 for agencies and programs funded in the remaining regular appropriations acts not yet enacted they extended this funding twice first through december 8 2006 pl 109369 and then through february 15 2007 pl 109383 crs20 regular appropriations for fy2007 at the outset of the 110th congress only two of the 11 regular appropriations acts for fy2007 which began on october 1 2006 had been enacted since the start of fy2007 federal government agencies and programs funded in regular appropriations acts not yet enacted into law received temporary appropriations provided by three successive continuing resolutions crs generally at rate of operations not to exceed the fy2006 enacted level the last cr enacted in 2006 was scheduled to expire on february 15 2007 on january 31 and february 14 respectively the house and senate passed new cr hjres 20 that provided funding through the end of fy2007 for those temporarily funded federal government agencies and programs at the level appropriated in fy2006 with certain exceptions in all the exceptions brought the total fy2007 nonemergency discretionary spending to the level agreed to by the house and senate and proposed by president george w bush in 2006 on february 15 president bush signed the measure into law pl 1105 thereby bringing action on the fy2007 regular appropriations acts to close supplemental appropriations for fy2007 in addition to the regular appropriations acts congress typically acts on at least one supplemental appropriations measure during session president bush submitted along with his budget request for fy2008 request for 103 billion in fy2007 supplemental appropriations in support of operations in the global war on terror gwot and the gulf coasts recovery from hurricane katrina33 in response to the presidents request the house appropriations committee reported hr 1591 us troop readiness veterans health and iraq accountability act 2007 hrept 11060 on march 20 the house considered hr 1591 on march 22 and 23 and adopted the measure by vote of 218212 the senate appropriations committee ordered reported s 965 us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act 2007 srept 11037 on march 22 the senate took up hr 1591 amended it with the text of s 965 and considered several other amendments over four days between march 26 and march 29 adopting the measure as amended on march 29 by 5147 vote on april 24 conference report to accompany hr 1591 was filed according to the appropriations committees hr 1591 would provide about 1242 billion in new budget authority for fy2007 the house agreed to the conference report on april 25 by 218208 vote the senate agreed to the conference report on april 26 by 5146 vote president bush vetoed the measure on may 1

connie veillette curt tarnoff and rhoda margesson crs21 the house subsequently on may 10 passed two new supplemental measures hr 2206 and hr 2207 which were combined into one bill hr 2206 and sent to the senate on may 17 the senate passed hr 2206 with an amendment and requested conference with the house instead of resolving the legislative differences between the two chambers in conference committee on may 24 the house amended the senateamended house measure and the senate agreed to that house amendment clearing the measure for the president on may 25 president bush signed hr 2206 into law pl 11028 according to the house appropriations committee pl 11028 provided about 120 billion in supplemental appropriations for fy2007 in each case the supplemental appropriations were designated as emergency requirements35 thereby exempting the appropriations from the spending constraints associated with the budget resolution as mentioned above regular appropriations for fy2008 the conference report to the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 hrept 110153 provided for about 953 billion in discretionary spending accordingly the house and senate appropriations committees received spending allocations its socalled 302a allocations of 953052 million in budget authority and 1028397 million in outlays36 as congress began its memorial day recess the appropriations committees had yet to report their initial subdivisions or 302b allocations section 302c of the budget act prohibits the consideration of the regular appropriations measures for the upcoming fiscal year until the appropriations committees have made those subdivisions as mentioned above these subdivisions serve as spending ceilings for the individual regular appropriations measures and are enforced by points of order on the floor of each chamber the conference report to the fy2008 budget resolution also contains discretionary spending limits for fy2007 and fy2008 section 207 of sconres 21 which may be enforced in the senate by point of order37 motion to waive 35 in the case of hr 1591 for the house the designation was pursuant to sections 402 and 501 of hconres 376 109th congress as made applicable by section 511a4 of hres 6 110th congress and for the senate the designation was pursuant to section 402 of hconres 95 109th congress in the case of hr 2206 as well as hr 2207 in the house for both chambers the designation was pursuant to section 204 of sconres 21 36 section 207 of sconres 21 provides for the adjustment of the appropriations committees spending allocations up to 1042 million in budget authority and outlays plus an unlimited amount for costs of overseas deployments and related activities for fy2008 if they report appropriations bills that meet certain criteria involving continuing disability reviews and supplemental security income redeterminations internal revenue service tax compliance health care fraud and abuse control program unemployment insurance improper payment reviews and costs of overseas deployments and related activities 37 like the appropriations committees spending allocations the fy2008 discretionary spending limits also may be adjusted upward to accommodate spending for certain purposes as specified in footnote 36 crs22 the point of order requires threefifths vote ie 60 senators if there are vacancies mandatory spending mandatory spending is under the jurisdiction of the various legislative committees of the house and senate some entitlement programs such as medicaid and certain veterans programs are funded in annual appropriations acts but such spending is not considered discretionary and is not controlled through the annual appropriations process in addition to the committee spending allocations under the section 302 process mentioned above mandatory spending legislation is limited by paygo rules in the house and senate as noted above with regard to revenue legislation the house and senate paygo rules rule xxi clause 10 and section 201 of sconres 21 the fy2008 budget resolution respectively prohibit the consideration of direct spending legislation that would have the net effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus over either sixyear period fy2007fy2012 or an 11year period fy2007fy2017 like many other budgetrelated points of order the paygo points of order may be set aside by unanimous consent or waived by special rule in the house or by threefifths vote in the senate ie 60 senators if there are vacancies on several occasions in the past congress has included reserve funds in the budget resolution to accommodate specific mandatory spending legislation often requiring that the legislation be deficit neutral38 under the provisions of reserve fund the chairmen of the house and senate budget committees may revise the committee spending allocations and other budget resolution levels if certain legislation is reported by the appropriate committee without such an adjustment mandatory spending legislation might be subject to points of order if it were not assumed in the budget resolution spending amounts the senatepassed version of the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 contains 39 reserve funds sections 301324 330334 336343 and the house passed version hconres 99 contains 12 reserve funds sections 201212 as indicated in table 4 the conference report to the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 hrept 110153 contains 23 reserve funds sections 301323 for such purposes as schip legislation and selected tax relief policies one of these reserve funds applies to the house only four apply to the senate only and 18 apply to both 38 see for example crs report rs21038 reserve funds in the fy2002 budget resolution by bill heniff jr crs23 chronology may 17 2007 the house and
