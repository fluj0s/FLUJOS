divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34190pandemic influenza an analysis of state preparedness and response plans summary states are the seat of most authority for public health emergency response much of the actual work of response falls to local officials however the federal government can impose requirements upon stat as condition of federal funding since 2002 congress has provided funding to all us states territories and the district of columbia to enhance federa l state and local preparedness for public health threats in general and an influenza flu pandemic in par ticular states were required to develop pa ndemic plans as condition of this funding this report which will not be updated describe s an approach to the analysis of state pandemic plans and presents the findings of that analysis state plans that were available in july 2006 were analyzed in eight topical areas 1 leadership and coordination 2 surveillan ce and laboratory activities 3 vaccine management 4 antiviral drug management 5 other disease control activities 6 communications 7 healthcare services and 8 other essen tial services hist ory of federal funding and requirements for state pandemic planning is provided in an appendix this analysis is not intended to grade or rank individual st ate pandemic plans or capabilities rather its findings indicate that number of challenges remain in assuring pandemic preparedne ss and suggest areas that may merit added emphasis in future planning efforts generally the plans analyzed here reflect their authorship by public health officials they emphasize core public health functions such as disease detection and control other planning challenges such as assuring surge capacity in the healthcare sector the continuity of esse ntial services or the integrity of critical supply chains may fall outside the authority of public health officials and may require stronger engagement by emergency management officials and others in planning since different threats such as hu rricanes earthquakes or terrorism are expected to affect st ates differently many believe th at states should have flexibility in emergency planning this complicates federal oversight of homeland security grants to states however which requi rements should be imposed on all states when is variability among states desirable and when is it not flu pandemic is perhaps unique in that it would be likely to affect all states at nearly the same time in ways that are fairly predictable this may argue for more directive federal role in setting pandemic preparedness requirements but the matter of what the states should do to be prepared for pandemic is not always clear for example uncertainties about the ways in which flu sp reads the lack of national consensus in matters of equity in rationing and long tradition of federal deference to states in matters of public health all complicate effo rts to set uniform planning requirements for states in addition to assuring the strength of planning efforts readiness also depends on assuring that states can execute their plans this assurance can be provided through analysis of the response during ex ercises drills and relevant realworld incidents such an analysis is not within the scope of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34190contents background 1 crs analysis methods and

preparedness and response plans background in 1997 new strain of avian influenza bird flu named h5n1 for its genetic makeup emerged in hong kong and killed six people it has since spread to other countries in asia europe and frica where it has infected more than 300 people killing more than half of them the situation has raised concern about the possibility of global human pandemic1 flu pandemic of m odest severity would strain public health and healthcare system s worldwide and although flu viruses do not directly harm physical infrastructure severe pa ndemic could nonetheless affect infrastructure and commerce through high absenteeism supply chain disruptions and other effects public health functions in the united states are decentralized with states in the lead for most public health authorities such as disease surveillance and quarantine in many states local public health author ity is also decentralized not falling under the direct control of state h ealth officials the federa l government provides funding guidance and technical assistance to state and local planners and can require that certain activities be carried out as condition of funding but the federal government has limited authority to precisely direct the planning efforts of states and localities2 because the states are the seat of most authority for public health and medical preparedness national prepar edness for public health th reats depends in part on the preparedness of individual states pandemic planning at the federal state and local levels is woven into broader llhazards emergenc planning and the response to pandemic would employ the same basic approaches to leadership authority coordination assistance and financing as with other incidents3 however flu pandemic would pose at least two challe nges that may be unique to this threat and that may merit specific ttention in planning the lik elihood that all jurisdictions would be affected at nearly the same time and the potentially prolonged period many months during which response postu re would have to be maintained the nearsimultaneous nature of pandemic would likely diminish the value of

states have received nnual federal funding to plan for emergencies including public health threats certain planning activities were required as condition of the federal funds these planning requirements have evolved from one year to the next see the appendix for information regarding federal preparedness grants to states and associated requirements but efforts to evaluate states compliance with planning requirements or the effectiveness of states preparedness efforts in genera l have not evolved concurrently6 this crs report describes information that exists to date regarding

contractor th national opinion research center norc at the university of chicago8 to create database that could be used to analyze state pandemic preparedness and response plans norc delivered the database to crs containing information abstracted from one publicly available pandemic planning document from each of the 50 states and the district of columbia dc in august 20069 the most comprehensive publicly available document was used for analysis available documents varied and included 1 comprehensive pa ndemic preparedness and response plans 2 annexes to broade r public health or emergency management plans or 3 brief summaries of pande mic preparedness plans comprehensive pandemic plans were analyzed when available when not annexes were analyzed when available brief summaries were analyzed only when the other two options were not available broade r public health or emergenc management plans were not analyzed in any case often they were not publicly available of the 51 plans analyzed 14 were referre d to by the authoring state as draft pandemic plans 14 as annexes to the stat allhazards plan and 13 as formally adopted influenza plans ten states did not specify the database was populated in july 2006 at that time publication dates for the 51 plans ranged from 2002 through 2006 as follows 2006 29 planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34190crs4 10 states were required to submit pandemic fl u plans to the department of health and human services hhs by july 2005 the hhs pandemic plan for public health and medical preparedness which included guid ance for state planning was published in november 2005 superceding more cursory draft pandemic plan many states subsequently updated their plans to better c oordinate with the hhs plan see hhs hhs pandemic influenza plan november 2005 at httpwwwpandemicflugov 11 additional categorical and freetext variables were also created and were used to inform analysis of the dichotomous variables in addition to the 66 dichotomous variables presented selected crosstabulations are also presented to show the interaction of certain variables 12 the set of variables was finalized in may 2006 see the appendix for discussion of federal guidance for state pandemic planning2005 16 plans most predating key federal plan issued in november 200510 2004 2 plans 2003 and 2002 1 plan each year and two plans were not dated total of 66 variables were developed for analysis to assess pande mic planning activities in the following eight topical areas 1 leadership and coordination 2 surveillance and laboratory activities 3 vaccine management 4 antiviral drug management 5 other disease control activities eg isolation and quarantine 6 communications activities 7 healthcare services and 8 other essential services eg public utilities the 66 variables are dichotomous that is for each variable plans were determined to contain substantive mention of pa rticular activity yes or not no11 variables were developed by crs and the contractor to span spectrum of pandemic planning activities they were intended to reflect variety of public health preparedness activities that were presente d in federal pandemic planning guidance documents available at the time12 as well as number of planning challenges and potential planning gaps that were the s ubject of ongoing policy discussions while each individual variable was intended to reflect an essential element of pandemic preparedness crs did not attempt to weigh the relative importance of each variable with respect to the others the findings of this analysis are subject to number of limitations first variables were devel oped intentionally to reveal planning gaps rather than to document the universe of activities that may be described in the plans or that may have been discussed in grant guidance see the appendix second certain planning elements eg reporting relationships be tween the health department and the governor or plans for mass fatality mana gement may not be fleshed out in the pandemic plan but may be laid out in states public health preparedness or generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34190crs5 13 some local jurisdictions have published detailed pandemic plans see for example santa clara county california pa ndemic influenza preparedness and response plan for santa clara county at http wwwsccphdor gpanfluemergency management plan these broade r plans were not analyzed and in many cases were and are not publicly available third some states have published only brief summaries of extant pandemic plans that are not publicly available by their nature these summaries did not typically make substantive mention of planning activities fourth certain preparedness and response task s may be delegated to local officials and may not therefore be described in the state pandemic plan13 fifth states may have developed detailed operational plans for certain aspects of pandemic planning such as ventilator triage but may not have included them in the pandemic plan or may not have updated the pandemic plan to reflect these narrowly tailored documents sixth while analyses began with keyword searches yes findings were applied only to substantive discussions of relevant topics in th plan not merely the finding of keyword in list or another entry th at lacked meaningful context for planning while efforts were made to standardize analysis these determinations were inherently subjective finally this analysis reflects snapshot in time in what appears to be dynamic na tional planning effort the database contains state pandemic plans available as of july 2006 since then fy2006 supplemental funds for state pandemic preparedne ss were released pandemic planning benchmarks were included in homeland security grant guidan ce and at least 16 states have updated their pandemic plans most of these limitations would have th likely effect of underestimating states planning efforts therefore finding that planning element is absent from states pandemic plan does not necessarily mean that the state has not addressed that element this analysis is not intended to grade or rank individual state pandemic plans or capabilities there are not at this time the pr ocesses or standards to support such an evaluation rather this analysis is pr emised on the idea that national preparedness for pandemic flu is in part dependent upon the preparedness of individual states variables in this analysis that yielde d fewer yes responses overall may indicate areas that merit added emphasis in future planning efforts other

authors researchers from research triangle ins titute international rti published the findings of their analysis of 49 state pande mic plans available as of early 2006 for planning elements including vaccination surveillance and detection and disease containment23 the authors found considerable variation among states and posited two explanations first federalism which pl aces states in the lead in matters of public health and second limited scie ntific information about how flu is spread and therefore which disease control practices are likely to be effective the authors recommended that hhs publish more detaile d planning guidance for states and that there be more research on influenza including the effect of interventions such as use of masks and closure of schools on disease

variables findings of yes mean that state pandemic plan makes substantive mention of the relevant subject matter for each of the variables 51 plans were analyzed tables are presented for each of eight topical areas studied for most of the topical areas plans were searched for planning assumptions these are statements of generally accepted facts or circumstances that are used to achieve consistency and relevance in planning efforts such as the assumption that severe pandemic could result in absenteeism rates as high as 40 overarching planning assumptions for pandemic flu are provided in the hhs pandemic plan and include the universal and nearsimultaneous nature of pandemic and the expectation of shortages of vaccine and antiviral drugs27 in this analysis state plans were searched for the presence of planning assumptions that were specific to the topical area being analyzed leadership and coordination often when emergency managers have re viewed the response to disasters they have found the most serious shortcomings to involve unclear lines of authority confusion about leadership lack of mechanisms to c oordinate multiple responding agencies and other problems involving command and control in the 1970s firefighters developed the incident command system ics to address these problems in the management of rapidly moving wild fires since then the nations structures for

sometimes other first responders to be vaccinated first in order that they can remain at work and not make others ill next in order of priority are those most vulnerable to rious complications from

distribute vaccine or coordinate its di stribution according to several different possible procurement scenarios fewer than half of the state plans discussed vaccine storage or security states efforts

ven tilators and other supplies the healthcare workforce is likely to be the key limiting factor in ramping up healthcare service delivery during pandemic an influenza pandemic of even limited magnitude has the potential to disrupt the normal workings of the healthcare system in variety of ways these may include deferral of elective medical proce dures diversion of patients away from overwhelmed hospital emergency departments and tertiary care facilities protective quarantines of susceptible populations such as residents of l ongterm care facilities and hoarding theft or blackmarketeering of scarce resources such as vaccines or antiviral drugs the systems usual appr oaches to mass casualty management involve bringing in additional workers from other st ates and diverting or evacuating patients to unaffected facilities because flu is communicable disease and because pandemic could affect large areas of the united states simultaneously these approaches may be ineffective or even harmful during pandemic options to expand healthcare capacity during pandemic include stockpiling supplies beforehand with considerable upfront cost and altering standards of care that is implementing policies that change the way medicine is practiced approaches to altered standards of care include providing healthcare at alternate sites such as gymnasiums changing required staffing ra tios altering scope s of practice eg permitting nurse to perform certain procedures that normally could only be performed by physician withholding of certain services such as diagnostic

lister 63 holmberg et alplans nonetheless plan is merely an essential first step in competent response and true weaknesses in pl anning could be magnif ied as responses unfold the state pandemic flu plans analyzed here reflected their authorship by public health officials many of them addre ssed core public health functions such as surveillance or vaccine mana gement though specific aspect s of these functions were addressed in varying degrees of depth this suggests that challenges remain even in areas that are familiar to public health pl anners such as veloping schemes to prioritize or ration limited medical assets coordinating surveillance to optimize early detection and ongoing disease monitoring and legal liability and civil rights issues associated with disease control measures fewer plans addressed leadership and coordination or the conti nuity of nonhealth services subjects which may be unfamiliar to public health pl anners or which may exceed their authority these elements may require stronger engagement by emergency management officials and others in planning this analysis studied pandemic planning at the state level as with any emergency response most of the responsib ility rests with local authorities this analysis did not attempt to assess the st atus of local pandemic planning efforts though such efforts are also likely to pos significant challenges just as public health authority is decentralized to state rather than federal authorities it is also decentralized in some states with local health departments having varying degrees of autonomy further comp licating planning efforts62 variability among states in pandemic planning has been noted in another analysis63 the decentralized nature of public h ealth is often cited as an explanation the federal government cannot di rectly dictate to states wh at they must do to prepare though it can establish certain requirement s as condition of federal preparedness funding some flexibility in those require ments is helpful in allowing states to prepare differently for those threats ch as hurricanes earthquakes and wildfires that are likely to affect states differently pande mic on the other hand is more likely to affect states in similar ways that are to some extent predictable this threat may be more amenable to standardized pl anning approaches and to more directive federal requirements tie d to funding but the matter of what the states should do to be prepared for pandemic is not always clear for example uncertainties about the ways in which flu spreads the lack of national consensus in matters of equity in rationing and long tradition of federal deference to states in matters of public health all complicate efforts to set uni form planning requi rements for states the crs database analyzed here contains state pandemic plans available as of july 2006 at that point all states had been required to s ubmit pandemic plans to hhs one year earlier and ll had

response but the assurance of actual response capability is focused instead on the development and evaluation of exercises rather than on evaluation of plans65 exercises and drills test the ability of
