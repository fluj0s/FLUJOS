divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184supreme court recognition of fifth amendment protection for acts of production summary on several occasions the supreme cour t has addressed th question of when fifth amendment privilege against selfinc rimination applies to the act of responding to government subpoena or other command beginning with schmerber and fisher through doe and finishing with hubbell the court has declared that acts of production may fall within the privilege when they are personal compelled incriminating testimonial communications the act of production doctrine is eas ily misunderstood but some of the uncertainty can be dissipated by close ex amination of the facts and views of the court in the cases where the issue has ar isen the cases reveal that an act of production is not pr ivileged when it is done voluntarily it is not privileged to the extent that it involves sampletaking from an individual rather than some act which requires the individual to exercise his cognitive faculties it is not privileged to the extent that the act is performed as represen tatives of corporati on or other collective entity it does not preclude disclosures required for participation in regulatory scheme the cases also explain that an act of production may be privileged as testimonial communication when with respect to the items sought it implicitly concedes their existence identifies them evidences possession of or control over them discloses their location or vouches fo r their authenticity the two cases where the privilege was successfully claime d involved general sweeping demands characterized by the courts as governme ntal fishing expeditions that made the individual to whom they we re addressed strong and perhaps even indispensable witness against himself both cases involved sweeping subpoe nas which demanded that the individuals engage in the mental exercise of identifying collecting and organizing documents that incriminated them or that led to incriminating evidence this report is available in an abridged form without its footnotes as crs report rs21701 sketch of supreme court recogniti on of fifth amendment protection for acts

of production introduction the fifth amendment to the united states constitution declares in pertinent part that person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself the united states supreme court has pointed that acts of production may fall within of the fift h amendment privilege against self incrimination under some circumstances to do so they must satisfy the privileges general demands that require 1 pers onal 2 governmentally compelled 3 incriminating 4 testimonial 5 communication the act of production doctrine is eas ily misunderstood for number reasons first the protected communication is most often implicit the privilege covers an individuals actions rather than his speech or writing yet many incriminating actions such as providing blood sample or handwriting sample are ordinarily not protected because they are not testim onial second bright line divides communications that are testimonial from those that are not third the privilege sometimes protects the act of producing exis ting documents which by themselves are not protected because they were originally prepared voluntarily fourth the privilege protects not only intrinsically incriminating communications but also those that form link in the chain of incrimination some of the uncertainty can be dissipated by close examination of the facts and views of the court in the cases where the issue has arisen schmerber and fisher schmerber the act of production doctrine first comes into focus in two cases in which the court rejected its application schmerber v california 384 us 757 1966 and fisher v united states 425 us 391 1976 schmerber is blood alcohol case schmerber had claimed privilege against selfincrimination in an effort to bar the results of his blood alcohol test conducted over his obj ections following serious traffic accident the court was unconvinced it repeated justice holmes reminder that the prohibition of compelling man in criminal court to be witness against himself is prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it is material 384 us at 763 quoting holt v united states 218 us 245 25253 1910 schmerbers claim was fatally defective since the blood st evidence although an incriminatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184crs2 1 dean wigmore had written that the production of documents or chattels by person whether ordinary witness or party witness in response to subpoena or to motion to order production or to other forms of process relying on his moral responsibility for truthtelling may be refused under the protection of the privilege this is universally conceded for though the documents or chattels thus sought be not oral in form and though they be already in existence and not desired to be first written and created by testimonial act or utterance of the person in response to process still there is testimonial disclosure implicit in their production it is the witness assurance comp elled as an incident of the process that the articles produced are the one s demanded meaningful distinction canproduct of compulsion was neither schmerbers testimony nor evidence relating to some communicative act or writing by him 384 us at 765 emphasis added fisher although more beneficial to its cl aimants the act of production doctrine became clearer with fisher fisher invoked the privilege in response to an internal revenue service demand served on his attorney for documents prepared by fishers accountant the accountants papers had b een prepared voluntarily and consequently lacked the element of government coercion required for application of the privilege the content of the papers aside the act of producing evidence in response to subpoena nevertheless has communicative aspects of its own the court pointed out compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer it also would indicate the taxpayers belief that the papers are t hose described in the subpoena 425 us at 410 unfortunately for fisher his act of production came up short on two other elements it was neither incriminating nor testimonial implicit assertions of the existence and control of accountants papers relating to ones taxes are by themselves hardly selfcriminating for surely it is not illegal to seek accounting help in connection with ones tax returns or for the accountant to prepare workpapers and deliver to the taxpayer 425 us at 412 neither did the court consider fisher criminally imperilled by any implicit authenti cation of the papers for production would express nothing more than the taxp ayers belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena the taxpayer did not prepare the papers and could not vouch for their accuracy the documents would not be admissible against the taxpayer without authenticatin g testimony 425 us at 41213 in fisher and elsewhere the testimonial element turns on whether production asserts the existence control or authentication of an item and on the extent to which an individuals implicit evidentiary assert ion relieves the prosecution of burden it might otherwise find difficult to bear in fisher the court considered it doubtful that implicitly admitting the existence and possession of the papers rises to the level of testimony within the protection of the fifth amendment surely the government is in way relying on the truthtelling of the taxpayer to prove the existence of or his access to the docum ents 8 wigmore 2264 p380 the existence and location of the papers are foregone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the governments information by conceding that he in fact has the papers 425 us at 412131 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184crs3 be drawn between communication necessarily implied by legally compelled conduct and one authenticating the articles expressly made under compulsion in court testimonial acts of this sort authenticating or vouching for pr eexisting chattels are not typical of the sort of disclosures which are caught in the main cu rrent of history and sentiments giving vitality to the privilege yet they are within the bor ders of its protection furthermore it follows that documents or chattels obtained from the persons control without the use against him of process relying on his truthtelling is not within the scope of the privilege 8 wigmore on evidence 2264 at 36364 1940 edat 37980 1961 ed emphasis in the original 2 the court described the five subpoenas as follows the first two demanded the production of the telephone records of several of respondents companies and all records pertaining to four bank accounts of resp ondent and his companies the s ubpoenas were limited to the period between january 1 1977 and the dates of the subpoenas the third subpoena demanded the production of list of virtually all the business records of one of respondents companies for the period between january 1 1976 and the date of the subpoena the categories of records sought by the third subpoena were 1 general ledgers 2 general journals 3 cash disbursement journals 4 petty cash books and vouchers 5 purchase journals 6 vouchers 7 paid bills 8 invoices 9 cash receipts journal 10 billings 11 bank statements 12 canceled checks and check stubs 13 payroll records 14 contracts and copies of contracts incl uding all retainer agreements 15 financial statements 16 bank deposit tickets 17 retained copies of partnership income tax returns 18 retained copies of payroll tax retu rns 19 accounts payable ledger 20 accounts receivable ledger 21 telephone company statement of calls and telegrams and all telephone toll slips 22 records of all escrow trust or fiduciary accounts maintained on behalf of clients 23 safe deposit box records 24 records of all purchases and sales of all stocks and bonds 25 names and home addresses of all pa rtners associates and employees 26 w2 forms of each partner associate and employ ee 27 workpapers and 28 copies of tax returns the fourth subpoena sought production of similar list of business records belonging to another company the only documents requested in the fourth subpoena that were not requested in the third were the co mpanys stock transfer book any corporate minutes the corporate charter all corres pondence and memoranda and all bids bid bonds and contracts the request for corporate minutes and the corporate charter is puzzling because the company named in the subpoena was an unincorporated sole proprietorship the final subpoena demanded production of all bank statements and canceled checks of two of respondents companies that had accounts at bank in the grand cayman islands 465 us at 6067 footnotes 1 and 2 of the opinion in bracketsfishers authentication argument proved more robust as the court observed in the context of the incrimination element fisher did not prepare the papers and could not vouch for their accuracy the doc uments would not be admissible against him without independent authenti cating testimony 425 us at 413 doe i the privilege applies finally in united states v doe doe i 465 us 605 1984 the court encountered case where the act of produc tion doctrine was appr opriately claimed federal grand jury investig ating possible corruption rela ting to municipal contracts served sweeping series of five subpoena s upon doe demanding production of business records of five sole propriet orships under which doe apparently did business2 the lower courts held that does privilege against selfincrimination shielded him from punishment for failure to produce the subpoenaed documents the trial court declared that with fe w exceptions enforcement of the subpoenashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184crs4 3 although corporate custodian is not titled to resist subpoena on the ground that his act of production will be personally incriminating we do think certain consequences flow from the fact that the custodians act of produc tion is one in his representative rather than personal capacity because the custodian acts as representative the act is deemed one of the corporation and not the individual theref ore the government concedes as it must that it may make evidentiary use of the individual act against the individual for examplewould compel doe to admit that the records exist that they are in his possession and that they are authentic these communications if made under compulsion of court decree would violate does fifth amendment rights the government argues that the existence possession and authenticity of the documents can be proved without does testimonial communication but it cannot satisfy this court as to how that representation can be implemented to protect the witness in subsequent proceedings 465 us at 613 quoting in re grand jury empanelled march 19 1980 541 fsupp1 3 dnj 1981 the court of appeals concurred adding th at we find nothing in the record that would indicate that the united states knows as certainty that each of the myriad documents demanded by the fi ve subpoenas in fact is in the appellees possession or subject to his control the most pl ausible inference to be drawn from the broadsweeping subpoenas is that the g overnment unable to prove that the subpoenaed documents exist or that the ppellee even is somehow connected to the business entities under investigation is at tempting to compensate for its lack of knowledge by requiring the appellee to b ecome in effect the primary informant against himself 465 us at 613 quoting in re grand jury empanelled march 19 1980 680 f2d 327 335 3d cir 1982 the supreme court agreed in fact it declined to conduct an independent analysis of whether doe had established the testimonial and incrimination elements of his claim it simply deferred to the di strict courts finding affirmed by the third circuit that compliance with the s ubpoenas would involve testimonial self incrimination 465 us at 613 when the privilege does not apply there followed in fairly rapid succession three cases in which the court confirmed the vitality of the action of production doctr ine but found its benefits beyond the reach of the claimants before it braswell collective entities in braswell v united states 487 us 99 1988 the court held that the president and sole shareholder of co rporation could not interpose the act of production to avoid the commands of gra nd jury subpoena for corporate records even if their contents would incriminate him 487 us at 102 corporations and other collective entities like partnerships or labor organizations enjoy privilege against selfincrimination 487 us at 107 8 the privilege stands as impediment to demands for their records addressed to their custodial representatives although the act of production may afford the custodial individual protection3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184crs5 in criminal prosecution against the cust odian the government may not introduce into evidence before the jury the fact that the subpoena was served upon and the corporations documents were delivered by one particular i ndividual the custodian the government has the right however to use the corporations act of production against the custodian the government may offer testimony for example from the process server who delivered the subpoena and from the individual who received the records establishing that the corporation produced the records subpoenaed the jury may draw from the corporations act of production the conclusion that the record s in question are authentic corporate records which the corporation possessed and which it produced in response to the subpoena and if the defendant held prominent position with in the corporation that produced the records the jury may just as it would had someone else produced the documents reasonably infer that he had possession of the documents or k nowledge of their contents because the jury is not told that the defendant produced the r ecords any nexus between the defendant and the documents results solely from the corporation s act of production and other evidence in the case we reject the suggestion that the limita tion on the evidentiary use of the custodians act of production is the equivalent of cons tructive use immunity barred under our decision in doe 465 us at 616617 rather the limitation is necessary concomitant of the notion that corporate custodian acts as an agent nd not an individual when he produces corporate records in response to subpoena addressed to him in his representative capacity we leave open the question whether the agency rationale supports compelling custodian to produce corporate records when the custodian is able to establish by showing for example that he is the sole employee and officer of the corporation that the jury would inevitably conclude that he produced the records consistent with our precedent the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit ruled that petitioner could not resist the subpoena for corporate documents on the ground that the act of production might tend to incr iminate him the judgment is therefore affirmed 487 us at 11719 foot note 11 of the opinion in bracketsdoe ii consent forms in doe v united states doe ii 487 us 201 1988 th court encountered situation akin to schmerber when does signature was taken from him over his objections doe contested court order that directed him to sign form authorizing any bank in the cayman islands or bermuda to disclose to the grand jury information concerning any accounts doe might have in any of the banks using the words once again of dean wigmore the court declared that unless some attempt is made to secure communication written oral or otherwise upon which reliance is to be placed as involving the accuseds consci ousness of the facts and the operations of his mind in expressing it the demand ma upon him is not testimonial one and consequently outside the privilege 487 us at 211 quoting 8 w igmore on evidence 2265 at 386 1961 edat 375 1940 ed in doe ii the execution of the form is analogous to the production of handwriting sample or voice exemplar it is nontestimonial act in neither case is the suspects action compelled to obtain any knowledge he might have at 217 moreover by signing the form doe makes statement explicit or implicit regarding the existence of foreign ba nk account or his control over such account nor would his execution of the form admit the authenticity of any records produced by the bank 21516httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184crs6 4 we are not called upon to define the preci limitations that may exist upon the states ability to use the testimonial aspects of bouknights act of production in subsequent proceedings but we note that imposition of ch limitations is not foreclosed the same custodial role that limited the ability to resist the production order may give rise to corresponding limitations upon the direct and indirect use of that testimony see braswell 487 us at 118 and n11 493 us at 561 5 the government as it concedes could have compelled respondent to produce the documents listed in the subpoena sections 6002 and 6003 of title 18 provide for the granting of use immunity with respect to th potentially incriminating evidence the government did state several times before the district court that it would not use respondents act of production against him in any way but counsel for the government never made statutory request to the distri ct court to grant respondent use immunity despite repeated questioning at oral ar gument counsel for the government gave plausible explanation for the failure to request official use immunity rather than promising that the act of producing the documents would not be used against respondent we decline to extend the jurisdiction of courts to include prospective grants of use immunity in the absence of the formal request that the st atute requires 465 us at 61416 footnote 15 of the opinion in brackets 6 on october 31 1996 upon application by the independent counsel subpoena was issued commanding hubbell to appear and stify before the grand jury of the united states district court for th eastern district of

maintained custody of her ch ild subject to supervisory restrictions imposed as consequence of serious child buse but was held in contempt for failure to produce the child at custody hearing the supreme court denied her claim of the act of production as defense conf irming that the act of production does not excuse otherwise required compliance with regulatory scheme 493 us at 55556 although it may curtail the governments ability to use compliance for prosecutorial purposes4 hubbell second application most recently the court found the act of production applicable notwithstanding the fact

records andor other records of financial transactions 530 us at 469 7 critical component of the courts analysis and the key to the distinction between the contents of documents which are not privilege d and the act of their production which is lies in the realization that the privilege pr otects not only incriminating communications but communications that form link perhaps even the first link in the chain that leads to incrimination it has however long been settled that fifth amendments protection encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence even though the statements themselves are not incr iminating and are not introduced into evidence the privilege afforded not only extends to answers that would in themselves support conviction under federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those which would furnish link in the chain of evidence needed to pr osecute the claimant for federal crime 530 us at 38 quoting hoffman v united states 341 us 479 486 1951 the act of production can in some instances as in hubbell reveal the existence and location of unknown depositories of incriminating evidence that come within the privilege derivatively even though the fact of their location nd existence alone is not incriminating hubbell responded by asser ting his privilege against selfincrimination and was made the subject of statutory use immunity order the documents he subsequently supplied and evidence derived from them resulted in his prosecution for crimes apparently unrelated to either his first c onviction or whitewater the district court described the governments effort as quintessential fishing expedition and dismissed the indictment 530 us at 32 quoting united states v hubbell 11 fsupp2d 25 37 ddc 1998 the supr eme court essentially agreed content aside the mental exercise required for hubbell to gather sort and organize the thousands of pages of documen ts which he then stified fully complied with the subpoenas demand other than for documents privileged on other grounds handed the prosecution road map to crimes about which until then it was clueless7 in doing so the court felt hubbell had b ecome an essential or at least valuable witness against himself within the understanding of the fifth amendment what the district court characterized as fishing expedition did produce fish but not the one that the indepe ndent counsel expected to hook it is abundantly clear that the testimonial as pect of hubbells act of producing subpoenaed documents was the first step in chain of evidence that led to his prosecution the documents did not magica lly appear in the prosecutors office like manna from heaven they arrive d there only after hubbell asserted his constitution privilege received grant of immunity and took the mental and physical steps necessary to provide the prosecutor with an accurate inventory of the many sources of potentially incrimin ating evidence sought by the subpoena it was only throug h hubbells tr uthful reply to the subpoena that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32184crs9 8 whatever the scope of this foregone conc lusion rationale the facts of this case plainly fall outside of it while in fisher the government already knew that the documents were in the attorneys possession and could independently confirm their existence and authenticity through the accountants who create d them here the government has not shown that it had any prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of the 13120 pages of documents ultimately produced by re spondent the government cannot cure this deficiency through the overbroad argument that businessman such as respondent will always possess general business and tax reco rds that fall within the broad categories described in this subpoena the doe subpoenas also sought several broad categories of general business records yet we upheld the dist rict courts finding that the act of producing those records would involve testimonial selfincrimination 530 us at 4445government received the incriminating doc uments of which it made substantial use in the investigation that led to the indictment it was unquestionably necessary for hubbell to make extensive use of the contents of his own mind in identifying the hundreds of documents responsive to the request in the subpoe na the assembly of those documents was like telling an inquisitor the combin ation to wall safe not like being forced to surrender the key to strong box the governments anemic view of hubbells act of production as mere physical act that is principally nontestimonial in character and can be entirely divorced from its implicit testimonial aspect so as to constitute legitimate wholly independent source for the documents produced simply fails to account for these realities 530 us at 43 the independent counsel argued to avail that like the fisher tax records the existence of the hubbell business and tax documents should be considered foregone conclusion and therefore the act of revealing their existence lacked testimonial weight the court simply considered doe i with its sweeping minimally particularized commands more apt comparison8
