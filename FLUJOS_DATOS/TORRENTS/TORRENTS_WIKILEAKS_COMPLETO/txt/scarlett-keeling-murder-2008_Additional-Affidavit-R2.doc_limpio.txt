additional affidavit on behalf of respondent 2 i leonid beyzer russian national aged about thirty eight years resident of house 96 bhatir wado morjim pernem goa director of ms artlibori resorts pvt ltd respondent 2 herein do hereby solemnly state on oath as under 1 that the contents of this affidavit are based on record available in the office of the company as well as those available with various statutory authorities etc 2 that the petitioner has filed the above company petition under sections 397 and 398 of the companies act 1956 against the above said respondents the respondents filed their respective replies to the above petition on 9th april 2007 the petitioner has thereafter filed detailed rejoinder affidavit against the replies submitted by the respondents earlier it is most respectfully submitted that the petitioner has raised several fresh facts and issues which need an appropriate response by the respondents for an effective adjudication in the matter by this honble board it may be submitted that the present affidavit is only clarificatory in nature 3 that the replies furnished by the respondents are in accordance to law procedural technicalities cannot substitute what has been effectively dealt with on merits by the respondents in fact since the petitioner seems to realise an absence of any substance or merits in his contentions he has been making futile non essential false and vexatious submissions 4 the petitioner has made unsubstantiated unfounded reckless and defamatory allegations against the respondent 2 regarding his reputation 5 that the claim of the petitioner highlighting the alleged lack of income by the respondent company is far from truth the funds of the company have been wisely invested in land which have appreciated manifold within short span of time in fact it is the unlawful interference and intermeddling by the petitioner and his power of attorney despite the earlier resignation dated 12th of june 2006 which is resulting in dragging down the company the factual position is that on account of the stay order dated 8th february 2007 the respondents have been unable to function despite thorough preparations to set up the planned resort the company is required to pay huge amount of money every month on account of fixed expenses such as employees salaries rent electricity water charges etc 6 at the cost of repetition it is submitted that mere assertions by the petitioner again and again that he invested rupees 167 crores into the company without an iota of evidence deserves to occasion this honble board to dismiss this petition with heavy costs the fact of rs167 crores coming from the petitioners personal account has nowhere been substantiated 7 that it is alleged through only the photocopies of the documents submitted by the petitioner that name similar to the respondent 1 company exists in croatia under the control of the petitioner but the process of approval of name of the respondent company by the registrar of companies at goa was duly followed as per law the indian company remains separate and distinct entity 8 that the false allegations of the petitioner remain unsubstantiated in the petition as well as the rejoinder in fact it is the petitioner who has fabricated and forged the photocopy of the wire transfer for the amount of usd 4555 as the original foreign inward remittance certificate submitted shows the actual remitter as being the brophy group and not the petitioner the petitioner has filed false and fabricated document putting his personal name as the remitter of this amount when in fact it is another person notarised copy of the certificate issued by the centurion bank goa is marked annexed herewith as annexure r 2 g 9 that the petitioner has deliberately and wilfully kept himself away from the responsibilities and commitments towards the company his long absence from 5th march 2006 till date as confirmed by the him in his own petition and rejoinder strongly proved his intention not to involve himself in any of the board meetings or workings of the company he only sought trivial details as is apparent from the copies of the emails submitted in his petition 10 that it is denied that the respondent 2 is not entitled to be director in an indian company as per law 11 that apparently at the behest of the petitioner and his agents there has been extensive negative publicity against the respondent no2 and the company without any factual basis in fact it is the petitioner who has track record of manipulation in white collared crime his tremendous negative energy has been directed at siphoning of billions of dollars from small investors in russia and other parts of the world the russian government has been keeping close watch on his activities details of his criminal activities and his criminal manipulations are manifest in the report of the bureau of economic intelligence of the russian federation copy of the said report which is public document translated from russian to english and certified true by the office of the russian consul general at mumbai is annexed as annexure r 2 h the contents of the report are extremely serious and show the extent to which the russian government has identified the petitioner to be one of the top criminals in the country in fact this honble board may appreciate the entire conduct of the petitioner from the time of the inception of the company and the present legal proceedings in an entirely new perspective the charge made by respondent 2 about the petitioners misconduct and unlawful attempts to hijack the company despite his resignation on 12th june are borne out now by the annexed report it is obvious that the petitioner is an extremely powerful person with habit of defrauding innocent and guillible persons of their wealth 12 that the annexures filed along with this additional affidavit are true copies of their originals hence verified and signed on this the 16th day of july 2007 at goa deponent verification i the above named deponent do hereby verify that the contents of paras 1 to 12 above are true and correct to my knowledge and belief and as per the records available deponent
