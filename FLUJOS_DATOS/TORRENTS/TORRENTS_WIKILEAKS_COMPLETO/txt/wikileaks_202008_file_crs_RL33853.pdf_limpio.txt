us agricultural support summary on june 7 2007 the canadian governme nt requested the establishment of world trade organization wto dispute settlement panel to consider two charges against us farm programs first that the united states has exceeded its annual commitment levels for total aggregate measur of support ams in each of the years 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 and second that the us export credit guarantee program operates as wtoille gal export subsidy the united states blocked canadas re quest from proceeding at the june 21 2007 meeting of the wtos dispute settlement body dsb according to wto rules panel can only be blocked once implying that second re quest by canada woul d have to be honored at subsequent dsb meeting however to date canada has refrained from pursuing its panel request at subseque nt biweekly dsb meetings canadian officials appear to be deliberating about the merit of further ac tion particularly in light of similar case against us ams limits being pursued by brazil earlier in the year january 2007 cana da took the first step in instituting wto dispute settlement case when it requested consultations with the united states to discuss three specific concerns in addition to the two aforementioned charges against us farm programs canada initially included third charge that us corn subsidies had caused serious prejudice to canadian corn producers in the form of market price suppression in canadian corn markets during the 1996 to 2006 period however the corn serious prejudice charge was dr opped from canadas panel request several other wto members argentina australia brazil the european communities ec guatemala nicarag ua thailand and uruguay joined canadas initial request for wto consultations as interested third parties if successfully pursued and litigated this case could affect all us agricultural policy since the charges against the us export credit guarantee program and ams limit extend to all major progra m crops should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to comply with wto ruling in canadas favor such changes would likely involve action by congress to produce new legislation congress is presently revisiting us farm legislation which expires this year and could potentially address some of the issues ra ised by canadas wto challenge for example the housepassed version of new farm legislation hr

implications of the case for us farm policy background on the us and canadian corn sectors the united states is the worlds leadin g producer and exporter of corn since 1980 us corn output has accounted for over 40 of world production while us corn exports have represente d over twothirds of world co rn trade canada is also an important producer and consumer of co rn however canadas average annual production of 88 million metric tons mmt since 2000 is markedly smaller than us average annual production of 261 mmt4 although it is grown widely throughout th world corn grows best in

program payments averaged 28 billion per year since 2000 they have essentially doubled in si ze to an average of 55 billion per year the increases in both us corn program payments and impor ts of us

cost of production previous action by canadian corn growers in august 2005 the canadian corn producers coalition composed of the ontario corn producers association th fédération des producteurs cultures commerciales du québec and the man itoba corn growers association announced that they would pursue action on three separate fronts against what they perceived as unfairly traded us grain corn imports6 first they asked the canadian governme nt to include us grain corn imports on the list of products targeted for retaliation by canada ag ainst the united states for the us refusal to repeal the byrd amendment7 the byrd amendment had been ruled to violate wto obligations in dispute proceeding filed by canada and other wto members congress eventually repealed the byrd amendment in february 2006 with severalmonth transition period and us federal court ruled in july 2006 that the byrd amendment did not appl to imports from canada however in mid2005 canada was pa rticularly concerned about th economic effects of the byrd amendment because at that time it appear ed that as much as 4 billion in anti dumping ad and countervailing cv duty deposits on canadian softwood lumber could

third parties coul d add to pressure for the united states to further expand its agricultural subsidy reduction proposal in the current doha round of wto trade negotiations especially in the corn sector in its official request for consultations canada raised three explicit charges against us farm programs ach of these is discussed below first allegation us corn s ubsidies cause serious prejudice canada contended that the subsidies and domestic support provided to the us corn sector have caused adverse effects to cana dian corn producers in the form of serious prejudice and the threat of serious prejudi ce to the interests of canada during the 1996 to 2006 period in violation of articles 5c and 63c of the wtos agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures scm agreement23 article 5c defines adverse effects as including serious pr ejudice to the interests of another wto member article 63c states that serious prejudice applies when the effect of subsidy is serious price undercutting by the subsidized product price suppression price depression or lost sales for like product in the same market in its consultation request canada listed the subsid ies and domestic support programs that it contends supported the us corn sector during the 1996 to 2006 period these included commodity programs from both the 1996 and 2002 farm acts marketing loan payments ie marketing assistance loans market loan gains loan deficiency payments commodity cer tificates commodity certificate exchange gains and commodity loan interest s ubsidies the production flexibility

risk programs at premium rates which are inadequate to cover the longterm operating costs and losses of the programs received under the agricultural export credit guarantee programs26 were included in the list of support programs c ontributing to serious prejudice the canadian government included an annex with its official consultation request27 the annex entitled statement of available evidence included lengthy list of websites providing info rmation on us commodity programs but provided discussion of the specific pr ogram outlays other than the general discussion included in th consultation request28 however in related news release canada contends that in 20052006 the ited states accounted for 41 of global corn production and 68 of global corn exports while us support to corn producers has averaged nearly 9 billion in each of the previous two sepaug marketing years 20 042005 and 20052006 resulting in what canada claims is significant distortion of its domestic corn prices29 crs examination of available usda data suggests that average us corn subsidies for the two marketing years cited by canada were bout 75 billion including oneyear high of 88 billion in fy200630 second allegation us export credit guarantees act as illegal export subsidies canada argued that the us export credit guarantee program operates as wtoillegal export subsidy this charge stems from previous wto case the usbrazil cotton case ds267 where wto panel found and was upheld by an appellate board on appeal that us export credit guarantees effectively function as export subsidies b ecause the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cove r their longrun operating cost31 furthermore the panel found that this applies not just to cott on but to all commodities that benefit from us commodity support programs and receive export credit guarantees as result export credit guarantees for any recipien t commodity are subject to previously scheduled wto spending limits third

the united states its total spending limit for amber box programs ie programs thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33853crs11 32 decoupled means it has influence on produc ers decisionmaking process green box

years each wto member has agreed to notify its annual domestic s upport outlays to the wto for verification that it is adhering to its spending commitments the united states has notified to the wto its annua l farm program spending through 2001 in these notifications us domestic support outlays remain well within us wto spending commitments also in its wto notifications the united states has notified its production flexibility contract pfc pa yments as fully decoupled and green box compliant32 this is an important distinction because the green box contains only nondistorting program payments nd is not subject to any limit canadas claim that the united states has exceeded its total spending limits hinges largely on previous wto pane l ruling from the usbrazil cotton case ds267 in that case the wto panel f ound and was upheld by the appellate body that us payments made under the pfc and direct payment dp programs do not qualify for the wtos green box category of domestic spending because of their prohibition on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on covered program acreage33 instead the panel ruled that pa yments under these programs should be counted as domestic subsidies directly ffecting crop production ie distorting and should therefore be included with other commodity program outlays to evaluate whether the united states has met or exceeded its peace clau limits34 however the panel did not make the obvious extensi on that the pfc and dp programs should also be counted as amber box programs but instead was mute on this point canada does make the extension to amber box by arguing that because pfc and dp payments do not conform with paragr aph 6b of annex 2 of the aa which states that such payments should not be related to producer behavior such as compliance with planting restriction th ey should be included in us amber box payments furthermore canada argues that several other u s program payments were incorrectly notified as either green box eg several types of disaster assistance payments or as nonproductspecific ams crop market loss assistance payments where they easily qualified for exclusion from amber box limits under the non productspecific minimis exemption in addition canada argued that the as yettobenotified ccp payments made under the 2002 farm act should similarly be counted against the us amber box spending

response to canadian allegations in response to canadas recent request fo r consultations on us subsidies us secretary of agriculture mike johanns declared that the united states would vigorously defend us farm programs against any possible wto challenge by canada37 spokesman for the us trade representative ustr was critical of canadas action pa rticularly in light of the signif icant increase in international corn prices since september 20 06 the ustr spokesman said given the dramatic improvement in the market over the past ear were surprised th at canada believes that our corn programs are now causing harm in breach of wto rules38 however current market conditions are unlikely to influence any wto investigation should the case reach that point since canada is specifically challenging us subsidies for the period 1996 through 2006 when corn pr ices were substantially lower figure 5 in another response to canadas recent request for consultations the american farm bureau

complaints alleging adverse effects minimum 60day consultation period is required before country can as k for wto to establish panel40 although the consultations failed to resolve the dispute the canadian international trade minister david emerson announced on may 2 2007 th at the canadian government would temporarily hold off on taking any further action in its wto dispute settlement proceeding ds357 against us corn subsidies until at least the end of the year pending the outcome of current doha round trade negotiations41 on june 7 2007 the canadian governme nt reversing its earlier remarks of postponing further action during 2007 request ed the establishment of wto dispute settlement panel to consider two of its initial three charges against us farm programs first that the united stat has exceeded its annual commitment levels for total aggregate measure of support ams in each of the years 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 and second that the us export credit guarantee program operates as wtoillegal export subsidy the serious prejudice charge against us corn subsidies was dropped pr obably in large part because corn market prices have risen so dramatically since mid2006 figure 5 and are projected to remain high for at least the next ten years42 the united states blocked canadas request at the june 21 2007 meeting of the wtos dispute settlement body dsb according to wto rules panel can be blocked only once implying that second reque st by canada if ma at one of the subsequent biweekly dsb meetings would have to be honored however to date canada has refrained from pur suing its panel request ca nadian officials appear to be deliberating about the mer it of further action particular ly in light of similar case against us ams limits and the export credit program being pursued by brazil potential implications of wto case while wto case can result in punitive sanctions being authorized the proceedings of formal case can take ma ny months and sometimes years to reach conclusion43 for example the usbrazil cotton case was initiated by brazils request for wto consultations on sept ember 27 2002 panel was established nearly six months later on march 18 2003 the panels final report was delivered to the dsb on september 8 2004 the case was appealed and the appellate bodys final report was adopted by the dsb on march 21 2005 nearly 30 months after thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33853crs15 44 this timeline is discussed in more detail in crs report rl32571 background on the usbrazilwto cotton subsidy dispute by randy schnepf 45 usda news release 002007 johanns unveils 2007 farm bill proposals january continuedinitial request for consultations44 however the case is not yet finalized as wto compliance panel is currently reviewing under request from brazil whether the united states has fully complied with the panels rulings the wto compliance panel issued its preliminary determination to the dis puting parties in july 2007 however the report will not be released publicly until october 2007 thus extending the length of the usbrazil cotton case to over five years many market analysts and news media suggest that the uscanada ams dispute is harbinger of future foreign ch allenges against us commodity programs if canada were ultimately to move forward with wto panel and were to successfully litigate its case it could affect most us program commodities since the charges against the us export credit guarantee program and ams limit extend to all major program crops pfc and dp program compliance with wto green box rules would likely involve some type of policy reform including adjustment if not full removal of the planting restriction on fruits vegetables and wild rice on acres receiving direct payments with respect to the ruling that export credit guarantees operate like illegal export subsidies compliance through policy reform would likely involve incorporating user fees that reflect the market risk associat ed with each loan guarantee for example this could be achieved by removing the 1 cap on user fees charged under the export credit guarantee program the 1 fee cap prevents charging marketbased fees and contributes to the export credit guarantee program operating as wtoillegal export subsidy the housepassed version of the 2007 farm bill hr 2419 includes reform of the export credit program by eliminating the 1 cap on user fees but it does not address the issue of direct payments not being fully decoupled and greenbox compliant role of congress congress could potentially address the i ssues raised by canada in new 2007 farm bill legislation as already men tioned the housepasse d hr 2419 addresses the export credit charge but does not address canadas claim of ex cessive us total ams outlays the senate agriculture committee has yet to mark up farm legislation thus leaving open the possib ility that some type of reform may be included concerning the baseacre planting re strictions linked to direct payments and the resulting ams total during the past year agriculture secret ary mike johanns has been advocating that new farm act should be designed to make us farm policy be beyond challenge the administration proposal fo r us farm policy reform released on january 31 2007 if incorporated into ne w farm act potentially could alleviate many of canadas cerns while minimizing the likelihood of future wto challenges45 the proposal includes removal of the planting restriction on base acreshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33853crs16 45 continued 31 2007 46 hearings before the committee

them more wto compliant and potentially lower their vulnerability to challenges under serious prejudice given the importance of agricultural tr ade in the us agricultural economy congress will likely be monitoring developments in the wto ams dispute the house and senate agriculture committees regularly hold hearings on agricultural trade negotiations for example such h earings were held on april

participation in international trade negotiations if the ongoing doha round of wto trad negotiations were to successfully conclude with text for further multilateral trade reform there is the
