6212c13 shspec224 r212 data needle behavior clean needle is free flowing needle slow pleasant rise or fall which does nothing when the auditor is doing nothing it has trace of irregular or reacting motion on the meter clean needle is like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue flawless midruds will give you one it flows at uniform rate of speed the pc may have an intransigent dirty needle but after you find the first ri you will get clean needle the only problem with this is that you have to assess over filthy needle dead horse list does minimal amount to clean the needle cleaning needle is not the same thing as cleaning read off the needle you will see clean needle when you have finished list before you have done anything else it will be slowly flowingly rising or more rarely falling this is particularly visible on mark v emeter that is what you should have before you start nulling so as to be sure that you can null if you put big midruds in faultlessly without missing read or cleaning clean clean needle is what you will see r212 is such good process that it shows up any flaws in the auditors trs model session or metering you cannot use pc upsets as an excuse there is only one point in running r212 where things look awry about half or third of the way through list when the list is getting hot and the pc doesnt want to confront the next string of rock slams or when the auditor tries to null an incomplete list and finds the needle frequently getting rough in these situations the pc will undoubtedly get somatics misemotion etc that is usual the final check for completeness of list consists of asking 1 is the list complete 2 are there any more items 3 have you thought of anything else that should have gone on the list 4 could there possibly be anything else on the list if you get any reads on these questions the list is incomplete the reverse of clean needle more or less is needle pattern chronic needle behavior that pc exhibits while the auditor is saying and doing nothing needle with reaction on it is dirty needle it doesnt look like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue any ticks any roughness any slight speedups as it goes dirty needle is any needle that departs from the appearance of clean needle it has nothing to do with the auditor he is doing nothing if in midsession with an auditing cycle complete it is doing anything that has any irregularity if it of any kind whatsoever that is dirty needle and your midruds are out watch the needle for count of five doing nothing and that whatever you see is the state of the needle it is not how sticky or unsticky the needle is it is whether the needle is ticking at all or halting at all seeing this the auditor is expected to get midruds in not to do so is goof raw meat pc or pc who has had previous bad auditing and has filthy needle presents problem on such needle you cant expect much until you get your first ri that is the easiest way to clean the needle except that you have to assess accurately through dirty needle that is your most critical time in auditing it lasts only as long as it takes you to get an accurate first assessment it should take you only the first hour of auditing assuming that you dont get lot of dead horses if you get hot item just listing it will clean the needle you dont even have to null to clean it after you have the first ri you should be able to get midruds in pretty fast the pc will probably rockslam on list one anyway needle characteristics tend to become misinterpreted for instance people have failed to recognize rock slams rock slam is simply slashing agitation of the needle dirty read is buzzing agitation of the needle rock slam always has slash in it rocket read takes off it always goes to the right it takes off with very fast spurt and does very rapid decay like bullet fired into water its very fast it goes pshoo it looks like its got all of its motive power from its first instant of impulse with additional motive power being imparted to it by anything its kicked off and it has further kick so it just rapidly dies out how wide is it thats silly question ive seen them from sixtyfourth of an inch to dial wide you see they are any width rock slam can have its first slash mistaken for rocket read if the auditor has never seen rocket read but the rock slam doesnt go in spurt it is uniform and has power put to it the whole distance of its slash it doesnt decay it stops suddenly most commonly the first slash is to the left just one slash to the left is enough to identify it as rock slam even if it doesnt continue it can be awfully tiny too the first stroke could be sixteenth of an inch followed by dirty read rocket read should never be confused with even onestroke rock slam because of its rapid decay but dirty read is different it looks like an electric buzzer going it doesnt look like anything slashing and rock slam always slashes dirty needle is caused by big midruds buttons being out every pc has favorite button as you find out when doing an eighteenbutton prepcheck if you go beyond eight or nine buttons to get big midruds in you might as well do full roll your own prehav see pp 333334 above except that you are now doing routine 2 see hcob 5jun61 processes allowed and p 34 above instead of r212 the only trouble with routine 2 was that its results werent lasting good though they were at the time you have to find items for the benefit to last it is the need for mass that requires r212 item 1 is held in suspense in time because it is held in balance against item 2 which is also held in suspense in time this configuration can be unsettled somewhat just by running item 1 the balance will stay out but full benefit ie ten to fifty times as much benefit will result from running the whole package if you leave too many of these single items around the pc doesnt know what he is leaning against now and he doesnt think that he has gotten any gain even if he has after about six unfound items the pc will start getting nattery therefore you will get only soso gains on r212 if you dont really find both sides of the package although you may think you did you can get lots of gains if you go back to the lists that didnt end up with an ri and extend them to get the item you will get gains if you represent an item that rockslams or if you fail to complete your cycles of action in fact you will get adverse results especially if the pc was very interested in the cycle you were on you must have clean needle before you nul mark v emeter expresses clean needle much better than mark iv it expresses ruds in pc when the slightest little thing is out the mark v just doesnt look clean it gets less flowing less right the mark v just amplifies the mark ivs tiny little ticks it is not more sensitive it is just easier to read you can harass pc in trying to clean up needle to the point where the needle gets dirty especially by asking supergeneralized question like what are you thinking about if the pc knew what he was thinking about it wouldnt make the needle tick therefore it is useless to ask this broad question to clean the needle you will do better to get in midruds on heavily charged list the pcs think influences the needle more than on lesscharged list if the needle has been clean then slowly dirties up dont leap to put midruds in the pc will feel interrupted and protesty if you do this when the needle gets dirty you cant always put in midruds or you get noauditing so when the needle was clean and gets dirty during nulling slowly twist the list around and show him as much as the needle has been worse on and ask which item he has had thoughts on get his suppressed and invalidated items cleaned up and go on nulling the pc may get allergic to this after while but this is not as bad as running midruds all the time the rud that goes out on checking especially goals checking is anxious about getting needle clean is an operation that takes all reactions off the needle when the auditor is doing nothing if the list is complete but the pc has some minor withhold from the auditor the withhold will cause him to be individuated so he will think things as you assess which because of the missed withhold will read and make items appear to read that are not reading you will have to clean them up also pc with an incomplete list essentially has missed withhold hence he has dirty needle and the needle reacts on everything the auditor says the pc is vulnerable to auditor actions because of the inflow of the withhold he isnt critical yet but he thinks extra thoughts he is individuated high sensitivity picks up all the analytical thoughts of the pc really severe arc break will give you very nice flowing needle also
