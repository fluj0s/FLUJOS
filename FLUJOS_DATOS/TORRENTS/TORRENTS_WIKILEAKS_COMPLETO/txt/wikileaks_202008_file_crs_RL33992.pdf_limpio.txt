were under contract or direction of the us military or government or due to their participation in military activities such as the defense of certain geographic areas for example guam or bataan because these individuals were not members of the us armed forces their participation in world war ii is not considered active duty military service for purposes of veterans benefits1 in the years

several legislative measures were enacted that impacted the working conditions for us merchant seamen also known as merchant mariners3 the merchant marine act of 1936 pl 835 established the united states maritime commission and stated as matter of policy that the united states should have merchant marine that is capable of serving as naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency4 the social security act amendments of 1939 pl 76379 expanded the definition of employment to include service on or in connection with an american vessel under contract of service which is entered into within the united states or during the performance of which the vessel touches at port in the united states if the employee is employed on and in connection with such vessel 5 in 1941 joint resolution hjres 237 pl 294 repealed section 6 of the neutrality act of 1939 related to the arming of american vessels and authorized the president during the national emergency declared on may 27 1941 to arm or permit to arm any american vessel 6 when the us entered the war the merchant marine was needed to transport the personnel and materials of war to the various combat theaters7 on february 7 1942 president franklin d roosevelt through executive order number 9054 established the war shipping administration wsa the wsa was separate emergency agency not part of the us maritime administration that was charged with building or purchasing and operating the civilian shipping vessels needed for the war effort the wsa also in 1943 was given the authority to design and grant medals and honors to us merchant seamen including medal for members who were injured due to an action of an enemy of the us the mariners medal the maritime war emergency board established in december 1941 by the wsa regulated maritime war risk insurance hazardous duty bonuses wages and bonuses when vessels were lost and reimbursements for lost personal effects the board was chaired by the wsa deputy administrator for labor relations manning training and recruitment and was composed of representatives of the us conciliation service 8 and the national war labor board the board established in cooperation with industry and uni ons warrisk insurance and system of bonuses 3 for purposes of this report the term merchant seamen is used 4 pl 835 101b 5 pl 76379 209b 6 gun crews on merchant marine vessels were navy personnel sometimes supplemented by vessel crew 7 note that because of the war most of the oceangoing shipping during the war and for period afterwards was related to the needs of war or relief and not the needs of consumers or civilian industry 8 the us conciliation service now the us federal mediation and conciliation service provided mediation services on labor issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33992g24g142g157g142g155g138g151g156g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g497g561g15g142g155g140g145g138g151g157g561g21g142g138g150g142g151g561 g561

waters and ports changed through the war so did the application of the different bonuses bonuses were paid on monthly basis for voyages in risky waters or on an incidence basis for an attack on vessel in addition vessels in certain ports were considered at risk and onetime bonus was paid for seamen on vessel in those ports of call

united states at that time did not receive unemployment compensation the health care of merchant seamen was provided by the public heath service which began with the operation of marine hospitals specifically to care for merchant seamen however under regulations merchant seaman had to report to marine hospital for admission within 60 days of discharge from vessel compensation for disability and death for merchant seamen was limited to that of warrisk insurance or legal recovery for injuries or death due to negligence by vessels owners warrisk insurance which had benefits in the event of death or disability of up to 5000 was provided to merchant seamen at charge however the benefit was only for warrisk and not for other marine hazards depending on state law disabled merchant seaman may have been eligible for vocational training under the state program for the disabled prior to world war ii some merchant seamen on us government vessels were considered federal government employees and entitled to the same compensation as other federal employees for death or disability during world war ii this distinction between merchant seamen based on ownership of the vessel generally did not exist however certain licensed officers may have remained eligible for the benefits related to ath and disability provided under law for federal employees also during world war ii merchant amen were members of one of the labor unions representing workers in the maritime industry during world war ii merchant seamen spanned wide range of agesome former merchant seamen returned to service as part of the war effort and other individuals interrupted school to join the merchant marine according to the wsa 51 of the merchant seamen were under age 25 and 165 were under age 19 10 merchant seaman also received an automatic draft deferment while serving as merchant seaman if merchant seaman left service for longer than stated period usually 30 days the merchant seaman was subject to the draft however some 9 contested waters are those for which control was being fought for by both the us and its enemies two of the major oceansthe atlantic and the pacificwere considered by the us navy to be contes ted waters until the hostilities associated with those waters ended may 1945 for the atlantic ocean and august 1945 for the pacific ocean 10 us congress hearings before the ship constructio n

after world war ii merchant seamen sought through legislative means to gain recognition as veterans of world war ii legislation was introduced to either provide benefits to merchant seamen comparable to those of the gi bill 11 or expand the benefits merchant seamen were receiving at that time in 1945 hr 2346 would have provided benefits to merchant seamen comparable to those of other world war ii veterans during two days of hearings in october 1945 the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries heard testimony on four bills including hr 2346 that would have provided some benefits to merchant seamen testimony in favor of hr 2346 was heard from number of former merchant seamen and the merchant marine veterans association testimony in opposition came from various administration agencies including the war department and the veterans administration currently the department of veterans affairs during the 1945 hearing great deal of discussion was focused on the freedom of merchant seaman to make decisions about whether or not to take particular voyage or leave service and the earnings of merchant seamen relative to navy seamen one argument against providing benefits was the high pay of merchant seamen which was greater than that of military personnel particularly navy seamen testimony presented at the hearing on earnings included wsa study done in response to letter from the american legion which testified in opposition to legislation providing benefits 12 the results of this study are still being used today however the results of the wsa study should be used cautiously the wsa comparison in the study was limited in that the calculations were done for seaman with wi fe and two children not single seaman with dependents and did not include any bonuses for the merchant seaman if the base pay comparison done at that time was for single navy seaman with dependents the merchant seaman would have significantly higher pay than the navy seaman the issue of pay comparability during the war is extremely difficult while both merchant and navy seamen would receive additional pay because of hazardous conditions the bonuses for merchant seamen were much larger as much as 100 of monthly pay with minimum of 100 navy seamen received allotments for spouses and dependents portion of which came out of the seamans pay while merchant seamen pay did not contain any additional allotments for dependents merchant seamen paid social security and income taxes but not for warrisk insurance while navy seamen paid for life insurance but did not pay social security or income taxes there was an exemption large enough to cover most navy seamen navy seamen also received benefits related to travel while on leave free train and bus fares that merchant seamen did not receive 11 the gi bill provided veterans of the armed forces with benefits for education or training home loans and cash allowance for unemployed veterans the military was not eligible for unemployment compensation at that time 12 us congress hearings before the committee on the merchant marine and fisheries seventyninth congress first session on hr 2346 hr 2180 hr 2449 hr 3500 part 1

implementing pl 95202 specify which groups the secretary has determined were employed in active duty service16 the regulations also established the department of defense civilianmilitary service review board and advisory panel to review each application for active duty status17 following its review the board issues written recommendation to the secretary as to whether the applicant group should be considered active duty for the purposes of the act the secretary makes the final decision based upon the recommendation of the board pursuant to this procedure various groups of persons have been accorded active duty status 18 the regulations concerning the designation of active duty status have undergone revision over the years changes and clarification to the regulations implemented in

1980 the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations aflcio submitted an application on behalf of group of world war iiera merchant seamenthe oceangoing merchant marinesoceangoing group21 their application specifically defined active oceangoing service and outlined in detail the type of merchant marine service and the groups of personnel for whom active duty status was sought the board on january 5 1982 recommended that the secretary deny the application of the oceangoing group on january 13 1982 the secretary adopted the boards recommendation and denied the application the secretary reasoned that the seamen 1 received only limited military training 2 did not render service exclusively for the us armed forces 3 were not subject exclusively to military discipline 4 were not s ubject to pervasive military control 5 had reasonable expectation of active military service status and 6 were not part of wartime organization formed for or because of wartime

denial of the inva sion group and the oceangoing group applications30 they argued that the merchant seamen included in those applications satisfied the established criteria to greater extent than many of the approved groups and argued that the denials were inconsistent with the secretarys prior decisions31 the secretary responded that the plaintiffs misunderstood the designation criteria and outlined characteristics that the approved groups shared32 in its analysis the court scrutinized the criteria that the secretary applied in making the decisions the court determined that the secretary had failed to articulate clear and intelligible criteria for the administration of the selection process 33 it noted that congress provided vague selection criteria and the secretary adopted these same criteria without articulating specific meaningful criteria to guide decisions34 the court found that in addition to utilizing vague criteria the secretary applied criteria which were not published in either the statute or in the implementing regulations as the court observed when congress gave the secretary discretion in adopting appropriate regulations it assuredly did not license the secretary to publish one set of criteria and to apply another 35 by making decisions based on unpublished criteria the court found the secretary frustrated the purpose of the implementing regulations and denied the plaintiffs fair opportunity to present their case36 the court observed that the secretary also failed to apply established standards for administrative decision making reviewing one of the secretarys prior decisions the court found that the decision made reference to most of the criteria set out in the regulations the court concluded that because the criteria are vague and have not been applied in workmanlike manner it is 26 id at 51 27 id 28 665 fsupp 41 ddc 1987 29 id at 42 30 the secretarys decision in operation mulbe rry was not challenged in the

the group known as american merchant marine mariners who were in active oceangoing service during the period of august 15 1945 to december 31 1946 is not considered active duty under the provisions of

covered by the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 pl 78 346 also known as the gi bill of rights because legislation introduced in 1945 and 1947 to grant them comparable benefits was not enacted they were not entitled to the unemployment compensation education or housing loan benefits provided under the gi bill of rights to world war ii veterans of the us armed forces in addition because they were not former members of the us armed forces they were not entitled to the disability or health benefits provided by the va when recognition under pl 95202 is granted to group the members of that group become eligible for all of the benefits administered by the v however some of the benefits such as education have time limitations which have already expired members of every group with recognition under pl 95202 may have had their lives impacted by not receiving veterans benefits at an earlier time in their life determining the value of the impact of delayed recognition for benefits is difficult some members of the civilian groups such as those with medical conditions related to their service may have heavily utilized veterans benefits if they were provided earlier in their lives others may have returned from service accepted job and not taken advantage of the veterans benefits even if they had been available earlier in their lives according to the v history of the original gi education benefit by 1956 the end of the original gi bill 78 million 488 of the 16 million world war ii veterans took advantage of the education benefits and participated in an education or training

authorized funding and the cbo estimate of the number of eligible in dividuals who would have applied for the new benefit it was possible that not all eligible individuals who applied for the new benefit would have received payments this was because total payments for the new benefit would have been limited by the annual appropriation for the fund and payments would be made based on the order in which an eligible individuals application was received by the v for example if 120 million were available for payments in fy2008 only the first 10000 eligible individuals who apply could receive monthly payments of 1000 for the full year depending on regulations issued by the secretary of the v an eligible individual who was not among the first 10000 applicants may receive benefits in fy2008 if he or she moves up the list as result of deaths among the first 10000 recipients of the new benefit because the authorization level for the new benefit declined over time the maximum number of individuals who could have received benefits for full year also declined in fy2012 if 75 million were available for payments only the first 6250 living eligible individuals could have received monthly benefits for the full year it was possible that some individuals who received payments in one year may not have received payments in subsequent years for example an individual who received payments in
