biotechnology industry is notable both for its heavy concentration of small businesses and its weighty research and development rd expenditures given the small size and heavy expenses of many biotechnology firms their ability to raise venture capital may be of some consequence the patent law has been identified as facilitator of these rd financing efforts although many observers believe that the patent law plays significant role in the biotechnology industry two principal issues have arisen regarding biotechnology patenting first observers have fundamentally questioned whether patents should be granted for living inventions genetic materials and other biotechnologies ethical issues concerns that biotechnology patenting promotes animal suffering and decreases genetic diversity as well as regard for the traditional agricultural community animate many of these objections supporters of biotechnology patenting counter that trade secret protection is less attractive social alternative observe that patents have long been granted for biotechnologies and question whether the patent law is the appropriate vehicle for technology assessment commentators have also differed over the extent to which an inventor must show specific practical use for biotechnology in order to be awarded patent some observers favor strict view of the utility requirement due to concerns over overlapping upstream patents that discourage research and commercialization others believe that the utility requirement should be applied leniently stating that strict view of utility will only lead to industry concentration and that biotechnology research tools cannot be meaningfully distinguished from other sorts of inventions congress may choose to exercise oversight on these

patenting and its effect upon entrepreneurial companies introduction biotechnology may be broadly defined as the application of biological systems and organisms to technical and industrial processes1 the discipline of biotechnology may be traced to the 1944 identification of deoxyribonucleic acid dna2 this discovery commenced significant research effort that culminated in the sequencing of the human genome in 20003 the biotechnology industry has provided many new technologies including diagnostic kits dna fingerpri nting protein synthesis enzyme engineering and transgeni c plants and animals4 many observers forecast that the completion of the human genome project will bring even more spectacular advances in the future5 the biotechnology industry is notable both for its heavy concentration of small businesses and its weighty research and development rd expenses in 1998 total of 1283 biotechnology firms participated in the domestic biotechnology market more than twothirds of these firms employed fewer than 135 persons and approximately onethird employed less than 50 persons6 the prominence of small biotechnology enterprises belies the enormous expenses that must be devoted towards rd in this market the us biotechnology industry is one of the most research intensive endeavors in the world with 99 billion devoted to rd in 19987 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30648crs2 8

cloning biotechnology has recently introduced the technique of cloning cloning employs dna from one animal to produce genetically identical animal18 cloned organisms may be created by fusing cell from one organism with an immature reproductive cell from second organism the second cell is then stimulated to replicate the cells if placed into an appropriate womb will result in the live birth of an animal genetically identical to the one from which the original dna was taken in the case of dolly the sheep cloned in 1997 in scotland19 an udder cell was fused with an unfertilized egg cell from which the nucleus had been removed and the cell mass grown was then implanted in sheep womb gene therapy scientists may introduce gene directly into patient through technique called gene therapy this

has generated variety of technical advances that have impacted fields ranging from agriculture to health care to the criminal justice system these advances have not been achieved without costs however the significant presence of small firms as well as substantial research and development expenses suggest that capital infusions play an important role in the biotechnology industry the need for funding looms largest for products intended for human medical use46 the typical biotech company generally requires 250 million to 500 million to fund product from research to profitability47 lengthy periods required for regulatory approval account for much of this expense48 despite the promise it holds for future developments the biotechnology industry has recently encountered difficulty in attracting investors one commentator recently observed that venture capital is tough to come by at time when investors are looking for quick payouts and have little patience for biotechnology which seems to be plodding compared to internet software and telecommunications companies49 for example during the first six months of 1999 biotechnology initial public offerings generated only 363 million representing only about 10 of the 35 billion attracted by internet and software companies50 as result many industry observers believe that strong patent portfolio is essential for capital infusion in the biotechnology industry51 even firm that does not yet market product may be able to obtain income from its intellectual property rights may be sold or the technology licensed for development or research purposes creating revenue stream that supports additional research patent attorney kenneth j burchfiel has characterized biotechnology as an industry whose wealth resides in its patents more than its products52 recent stock market movements suggest the significance of patent rights to investors for example on march 14 2000 president bill clinton and uk prime minister tony blair issued

of patenting biotechnology the rate of patenting biotechnology has dramatically increased in recent years more than 9000 patents issued in the biotechnological arts in1998 as compared with just over 2000 patents in 198862 patents concerning genetic materials are also being filed at growing rate on july 13 2000 the director of the patent and trademark office pto q todd dickinson reported that approximately 20000 patent applications concerning genetic materials were pending before the pto63 he also explained that approximately 6000 generelated patents had already issued by that date including 1000 that were specifically drawn to human genes64 the patenting process begins with the filing of an application at the pto in deciding whether to approve patent applicatio n pto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention65 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute66 among the more important requirements are that the invention must be novel and nonobvious to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain67 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made68 beyond novelty and nonobviousness two patentability requirements are of particular significance for biotechnology first the invention must be judged to comprise subject matter the patent law was designed to protect69 this gatekeeper to patentability is variously known as the requirement of patent eligibility patentable subject matter or statutory subject matter70 crucial biotechnology patenting issue is whether living inventions and genetic material are appropriately subject to the patent system the debate concerning biotechnology patents is reviewed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30648crs10 71 35 usc 101 2000 see also brenner v manson 383 us 519 1966 72 35 usc 122 2000 1999 amendments to the patent act also call for the publication of certain

press new york 1998 46 77 biotechnology industry organization some facts about biotechnology available at httpwwwbioorgaboutbioguide2000factshtml 78 see 17 usc 107 2000the other significant substantive patentability standard is the socalled utility requirement this requirement is ordinarily satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit71 although the utility requirement is readily met in most fields it presents more significant obstacle to patentability within biotechnology biotechnicians sometimes synthesize compounds without precise knowledge of how they may be used to achieve practical working result when patent applications are filed claiming such compounds they may be rejected as lacking utility within the meaning of the patent law this report will later consider the utility requirement in some detail once the pto allows patent to issue the patent instrument is formally published72 issued patents therefore present full technical disclosure of the patented invention73 the patent proprietor then obtains the right for twenty years to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention74 the patent act allows these rights to be enforced in federal court unauthorized infringers may be enjoined and required to pay monetary damages in favor of the patentee75 few core points concerning the patent law should be noted here first the patent grant is in the nature of the right to exclude patent owner may prohibit others from employing the patented invention but does not obtain the right to make or use the patented invention itself76 for example simply because the pto has granted an individual patent on gene therapy does not mean that the food and drug administration has approved or will approve the practice of that therapy in addition to the food and drug administration the environmental protection agency and department of agriculture regulate the use of biotechnological inventions77 second the patent right applies not only to fullfledged commercial activities but also to most unauthorized experiments involving the patented invention the patent statute itself contains experimental use infringement defense analogous to the fair use privilege codified within the copyright act78 as result the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit has held that mere experimentation with the patented invention constitutes an infringing act so long as thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30648crs11 79 roche products inc v bolar pharmaceutical co

amusement to satisfy idle curiosity or for strictly philosophical inquiry may possibly be exempted from infringement liability80 given the expenses associated with biotechnology rd increasing collaboration between industry and academia and ultimately commercial motivation of most researchers successful use of this socalled experimental use defense is unlikely81 finally the pto bases its patentability determinations only upon the relatively limited criteria set forth in the patent act these criteria include whether the patent application appropriately discloses and claims the invention for which protection is sought as well as the impact of the novelty nonobviousness statutory subject matter and utility requirements upon the claimed invention82 the pto is not statutorily authorized to consider other issues such as whether the patented invention may be licensed to ensure access by researchers and other interested parties when making this decision83 the patent eligibility of living inventions and genetic materials the issue of whether living organisms are merely unpatentable products of nature or whether ethical or policy concerns should bar their patenting continues to command public attention as with other sorts of inventions the governing statute is section 101 of the current patent law the patent act of 1952 which is codified in title 35 of the united states code section 101 allows patents to be granted for any process machine manufacture or composition of matter as result an invention is eligible for patenting if it is process which the patent act defines as process art or method84 alternatively the invention may be machine which has been interpreted to include any apparatus85 composition of matter including synthesized chemical

remainder of the lengthy amino acid sequence is omitted here an inventor could also obtain process patent directed towards the techniques of biotechnology for example in in re ofarrell 90 the patent applicant claimed method for producing predetermined protein in stable form in transformed host species of bacteria despite the broad statutory language the courts had traditionally crafted several exceptions to patentability one significant restriction is that product of naturea preexisting substance found in the wildmay not be patented per for example an individual may not obtain patent on new variety of plant found in remote part of the amazon basin even if the existence of this plant was previously unknown91 however the courts have also established that significant artificial changes to product of nature may render it patentable92 by purifying isolating or otherwise altering naturally occurring product an inventor may obtain patent on the product in its altered form93 the rule that patents may be granted for altered products of nature renders patentable many inventions of biotechnology includin g genetic materials and proteins for example in amgen inc v chugai pharmaceutical co94 the patentee claimed purified and isolated dna sequence consisting essentially of dna sequence encoding human erythropoietin95 with the scope of patentable subject matter limited one expert has concluded that properly issued patent cannot give rights over gene as found in persons chromosomes the artificial nucleic acid construct claimed by the patent would not be the same as found in living

resolution of the patentability of such inventions should be left to congress on its way to reversing the pto decision the court disagreed rule that unanticipa ted inventions are without protection would conflict with the core concept of the patent law that anticipation undermines patentability98 the court also dismissed concerns over the possible perils of genetic research it stated that researchers would assuredly pursue work in biotechnology whether their results were patentable or not and the regulation of genetic research was task that also fell to the legislature99 following the

genetically engineered to be susceptible to cancer102 the pto notice did advise that the grant of limited but exclusive property right in human being is prohibited by the constitution103 this statement appears consonant with the thirteenth amendment which provides that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted

have arisen to patentin g the inventions of biotechnology most of these objections have been raised with regard to human genetic materials and genetically modified organisms but they typically apply with varying force to other biotechnologies central position of many commentators is that the grant of proprietary rights for these inventions is degrading and inappropriate these concerns principally stand on ethical moral and theological grounds some individuals believe that patenting biotechnology devalues the worth and dignity of living beings these commentators believe that biotechnology patents would allow individuals to obtain an ownership right in another sentient being from this perspective such patent right is akin to slavery and morally wrong105 other observers have identified fundamental right of species and individuals to biological integrity biotechnology activist jeremy rifkin for example has expressed concerns that the patenting of genetic materials reduces living beings to mere bundles of information when living creatures are abstractly expressed as claims in patent instrument rifkin urges the notion of manipulating them at fundamental level becomes more palatable106 theological arguments have also been raised against patenting biotechnology some observers believe that reverence for life is eroded by economic pressures to view living beings and genetic materials as industrial products noting these theological concerns reverend wesley granbergmichaelson identified background of judeochristian thinking about how we relate to the natural environment in nutshell that background says that we have responsibility for preserving the integrity of that creation and for working with it to preserve its intrinsic values the doctrine of trust in legal parlance is synonymous about the relation of creation to humanity the judeochristian view says that the creation is in essence held in trust there are limitations on what we can do we have responsibility to see that its integrity is preserved this background has led to legislation such as endangered species laws animal welfare laws laws regarding environmental quality107 others are concerned that biotechno logy patenting places the values of the traditional agricultural community at stake they explain that patenting may cause handful of large multinational enterprises to control

materials and other biotechnologies will encourage their continued commercial development109 others are concerned that granting patents lends an aura of legitimacy to biotechnology110 in either case this set of concerns about patenting biotechnology echoes concerns about the impact of biotechnology more generally although such arguments are numerous and diverse some of the principal objections are summarized here during his june 26 2000 remarks commemorating the completion of the first survey of the human genome project president clinton noted several common concerns regarding the identification of genetic information as explained by president clinton we must ensure that new genome science and its benefits will be directed toward making life better for all citizens of the world never just privileged few as we unlock the secrets of the human genome we must work simultaneously to ensure that new discoveries never pry open the doors of privacy and we must guarantee that genetic information cannot be used to stigmatize or discriminate against any individual or group111 other observers oppose patents on genetically modified organisms due to their belief that they contribute to animal suffering they cite such instances as the incorporation of the bovine growth hormone gene into pigs this gene encourages an increased lean to fat ratio that produces healthier meat product animals expressing the gene were found to be lethargic arthritic and possessing an heightened vulnerability to stress112 other biotechnologies such as the harvard mouse dramatically increase the

diamond v chakrabarty 447 us 303 314 n9 1979other commentators have expressed concerns over diminishing genetic diversity according to jeremy rifkin while biotechnology may provide gains in the short run the long term consequences include the depletion of genetic stock in his view because biotechnology would may lead to the development of optimal plants and animals the gene pool will suffer for lack of variety these specialized breeds may be susceptible to unknown weaknesses and not be sustainable114 observers have also noted the environmental hazards associated with release of artificial entities the consequences of the release of genetically modified organisms are difficult to predict as living entities these organisms may reproduce mutate and migrate once released into the environment artificial products may also result in deleterious interactions with other animals and plants in uncertain ways115 benefits of patenting biotechnology proponents of biotechnology patenting offer numerous arguments in favor of their position first they observe that patent rights provide the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention116 patent ownership does not provide an affirmative right to market the technology these commentators believe that disallowi ng patents to issue on biotechnologies may decrease research and development efforts but would neither suppress biotechnology nor allow meaningful control on the manner in which biotechnologies are employed observers such as professor robert p merges have further stated that the patent system is not the proper vehicle for technology assessment117 he explains that the patent system has more basic goal to promote the progress of science and useful arts as stated in the constitution118 as result professor merges believes that potential social consequences of biotechnologies are better addressed through regulatory regimes agencies such as the food and drug administration could review health and environmental hazards scientists could establish seed banks to preserve the genetic variety of various crops for example or establish protocols to address concerns over privacy in the view of professor merges these measures have little to do with patents in deciding to uphold pto decisions to grant patents on living inventions the courts have also observed that patents have long been granted on living inventions exemplary is the 1873 patent issued to louis pasteur on yeast free from organic germs of disease as an article of manufacture119 microbiological processes have been used

asserts this step would merely encourage inventors to maintain biotechnologies as trade secrets the concealment of the workings of biotechnologies would only hinder the development of regulatory measures that would reduce any perceived threats of harm121 mr chiapetta also explains that purpose of the patent system is to enhance industrial efficiency part of this process can be the obsolescence of older technology as result of innovative advances mr chiapetta finds it unfortunate that biotechology may place further strains on the viability of the traditional family farm but observes that biotechnologies are hardly unique in this regard many technical economic and social factors are leading to fewer and larger farms within the united states and he argues that biotechnology should not be singled out within the patent law for this reason122 proponents of biotechnology patenting also observe that this prospect appears rather benign in the face of current social norms according to leroy walters phd director of the kennedy institute of ethics at georgetown university given that individuals routinely buy sell breed confine eat and perform research on plants and animals the practice of patenting them does not seem particularly worrisome123 number of scientific commentators have dismissed the notion of species integrity as specious for example dr oliver smithies of the university of wisconsin explained that many mammalian species with possible means of interbreeding have remarkably similar genomes124 dr smithies further observed that interspecies genetic transfer has occurred naturally albeit rarely without human intervention through viral and other microbial agents dr finnie murray of ohio university has explained that all species are constantly evolving species has fixed genome and genetic plasticity is fundamental property of living beings125 as result many observers do not believe that artificial interspecies genetic

without concomitan t selection of others127 in arguing that biotechnology may be put to work to diminish animal suffering some observers have pointed to the genetically engineered transgenic chicken that resists avian leukemia virus the result has been healthier birds and significant savings to the chicken industry128 finally proponents of patenting in this field point to the many gainful advances already achieved by the biotechnology industry the continued availability of patent protection may encourage innovation and product development proponents say yielding concomitant social benefits although many of these commentators are cognizant of concerns for animal results they regard the treatment of human diseases and the amelioration of human suffering as primary moral imperative129 the chimera application team of inventors decided to place the issue of biotechnology patenting squarely before the pto and the courts in conjunction with biotechnology activist jeremy rifkin cellular biologist dr stuart newman filed patent application on december 18 1997 claiming method for combining human and animal embryo cells to produce single embryo130 this embryo could then

need only supply single operable use of the invention that is credible to persons of ordinary skill in the art as demonstrated by justice storys 1817 instructions to the jury in lowell v lewis133 and bedford v hunt 134 the notion of utility is longstan ding feature of united states patent law in lowell justice story remarked all that the law requires is that the invention should not be frivolous or injurious to the wellbeing good policy or sound morals of society the word useful therefore is incorporated into the act in contradistinction to mischievous or immoral but if the invention steers wide of these objections whether it be more or less useful is circumstance very material to the interest of the patentee but of importance to the public if it be not extensively useful it will silently sink into contempt and disregard under justice storys view the utility requirement does not provide significant place for technology assessment outside of the most narrow limits valuation of the invention is left to the market rather than to the mechanisms of the patent law historically courts employed the utility requiremen t to strike down patents concerning inventions that were judged to be immoral or fraudulent handful of early decisions invalidated patents on inventions intended for use in gambling or other disfavored activities patented toy automatic race course135 lottery devices136 and slot machine137 were among those held to lack utility because their functions were judged unwholesome inventions that were designed to mislead consumers were similarly invalidated138 the modern view is that so long as the invention may be put to single lawful use it possesses utility within the patent statute representative of the contemporary position is the federal circuit opinion in juicy whip inc v orange bang inc 139 the plaintiff juicy whip held patent concerning postmix dispenser that included transparent bowl according to the patent the bowl was filled with liquid that appeared to be the beverage available for purchase while the bowl was arranged in such way that it seemed to be the source of the beverage in fact fluid connection existed between the bowl and

sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement of utility the appeals court reasoned that many valued products ranging from cubic zirconium to synthetic fabrics are designed to appear as something that they are not140 the federal circuit further concluded that the utility requirement does not direct the pto or the courts to resolve issues of product safety or deceptive trade practices which were left to such agencies as the federal trade commission or the fda141 as result of decisions such as juicy whip in most technical fields the utility requirement is employed merely to sift out utterly incredible inventions from the domain of patentability for example the utility requirement has led to the rejection of patents claiming perpetual motion machine142 and method of slowing the aging process143 in modern practice the utility requirement most often comes into play in the fields of biotechnology and chemistry in these disciplines inventors often synthesize new compound or method of making new compound without preexisting knowledge of particular use to which the compound may be put scientists may generate compound based on their knowledge of the behavior of related pharmaceutical compounds for example or may wish to isolate fragment of genetic material for which some application may develop in the future however at the time the inventor generates the compound precise knowledge of the compounds utility is known today there are considerable incentives for biotechnicians to obtain patent protection on compounds of interest as soon as possible for example in the case of medical treatments food and drug authorities require extensive product testing before the pharmac eutical can be broadly marketed before investing time and effort on laboratory testing and clinical trials biotechnology concerns desire to obtain patent rights on promising compounds even where their particular properties are not well understood but when patent applications are filed too close to the laboratory bench inventors have discovered that the utility requirement can pose considerable hurdle the supreme court opinion in brenner v manson addressed such situation144 the inventor manson filed patent application claiming method of making known steroid compound although the particular compound manson was concerned with was already known to the art chemists had yet to identify any setting in which it could be gainfully employed however it was known that another steroid with very similar structure had tumorinhibiting effects in mice manson s new method of making the compound was research tool of interest to the scientific communityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30648crs21 145 ibid at 53435 146 ibid at 535 147 ibid at 536 quoting application of ruschig 343 f2d 965 970 ccpa 1965 148 51 f3d 1560 fed cir 1995the patent office board affirmed the examiners rejection of the application the board reasoned that because manson could not identify single use for the steroid he produced the utility requirement was not satisfied the board was unimpressed that similar compound did have beneficial effects noting that in the unpredictable art of steroid chemistry even minor changes in chemical structure often lead to significant and unforeseeable changes in the performance of the compound manson appealed to the court of customs and patent appeals which reversed key to the courts reasoning was that the sequence of process steps claimed by manson would produce the steroid of interest according to the court of customs and patent appeals because the claimed process worked to produce compound the utility requirement was satisfied the supreme court however reversed the court took issue with justice storys understanding that the utility requirement is fulfilled so long as the claimed invention is not socially undesirable at least within the context of scientific research tools the court imposed requirement that an invention may not be patentable until it has been developed to point where specific benefit exists in currently available form145 chief among the courts concerns was the breadth of the proprietary interest that could result from claims such as those in mansons application until the process claim has been reduced to production of product shown to be useful the metes and bounds of that monopoly are not capable of precise delineation such patent may confer power to block whole areas of scientific development without compensating benefit to the public146 the court closed by noting that patent is not hunting license it is not reward for the search but compensation for its successful conclusion patent system must be related to the world of commerce rather than to the realm of philosophy147 although brenner v manson appears to take strict view of the utility requirement more recent federal circuit opinion on utility in re brana 148 suggests more limited role like manson brana claimed chemical compounds and stated they were useful as antitumor substances the scientific community knew that structurally similar compounds had shown antitumor activity during both in vitro testing done in the laboratory using tissue samples and in vivo testing using mice as test subjects the latter tests had been conducted using cell lines known to cause lymphocytic tumors in mice the pto board rejected the application for lack of utility and on appeal the federal circuit reversed among the objections of the pto was that the tests cited by brana were conducted upon lymphomas induced in laboratory animals rather than real diseases the federal circuit

treatment of the disease in live animals the federal circuit found that proof of utility did not demand tests for the full safety and effectiveness of the compound but only acceptable evidence of medical effects in standard experimental animal150 the holding of brana along with its failure to discuss or even cite brenner v manson suggests that the federal circuit has adopted more liberal approach to the utility requirement than did the supreme court151 the federal circuit did indicate that in cases where the invention lacks wellestablished use in the art the applicant must disclose specific credible use within the patents specification152 brenner v manson and brana were chemical cases the pto applies the utility requirement to the analogous discipline of biotechnology as well inventors often seek patent protection on biological compounds soon after they have been synthesized such compounds include complementary dna cdna which corresponds to proteins used by human cells and expressed sequence tags ests dna sequences that correspond to small portion of each cdna because this nascent field is highly unpredictable the functions of cdna fragments and ests are usually unknown at the time they are discovered yet they remain extraordinarily valuable for their potential uses and scientists from private industry government facilities and university laboratories alike have marketed these research tools for commercial sale the patentability of these genetic materials has proven controversial while brenner v manson holds that serious scientific interest alone does not fulfill the utility requirement brana and other federal circuit opinions suggest more lenient posture in an attempt to address cdna ests and other biotechnology patents the pto published revise d interim utility examination guidelines in the federal register on december 21 1999153 the 1999 utility guidelines require all patent applicants to identify explicitly specific substantial and credible utility for their inventions unless such utility is already wellestablished according to pto director q todd dickinson the patent office has raised the bar to ensure that patent applicants demonstrate real world utility one simply cannot patent gene itself without also clearly disclosing use to which that gene can be put as result we believe that hundreds of genomic patent applications may be rejected by the uspto particularly those that only disclose theoretical utilities154 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30648crs23 155 ibid at 45 156 ibid at 5 157 ibid 158 ibiddirector dickinson explained the meaning of terms specific substantial and credible in the context of the utility requirement as follows an asserted utility is credible unless the logic underlying the assertion is seriously flawed or the facts upon which the assertion is based are inconsistent with the logic underlying the assertion for example at least some nucleic acids might be used as probes chromosome markers or diagnostic markers therefore the per credibility of assertions regarding the use of nucleic acids is not usually questioned however even if credible at least one asserted utility must also be both specific and substantial utility is specific when it is particular to the subject matter claimed for example polynucleotide said to be useful simply as gene probe or chromosome marker does not have specific utility in the absence of disclosure of particular gene or chromosome target similarly general statement of diagnostic utility would ordinarily be insufficient to meet the requirement for specific utility in the absence of an identification of what condition can be diagnosed substantial utility is one that defines real world use utilities that require or constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm real world context of use are not substantial utilities for example basic research that uses claimed nucleic acid simply for studying the properties of the nucleic acid itself does not constitute substantial utility155 many observers have greeted the new pto guidelines favorably the former director of the national institutes of health nih dr harold varmus stated that he was very pleased with the way the pto has come closer to the nihs position about the need to define specific utility156 dr francis collins director of the national human genome research institute has said that the new utility guidelines are quite reassuring in terms of making sure that we end up with an outcome where the patent system is used to provide an incentive for research and not disincentive157 in addition dr craig venter the president and chief scientific officer of celera genomics corporation recently stated that he was pleased to see the pto is raising the bar on gene patents158 an interesting aspect of the new pto utility guidelines is their compatability with the governing case law although each application must be considered on its own merits the guidelines

g kunin has expressed his view that it may remain for the board of patent appeals and interferences and the federal courts to determine the true scope of the substantiality criterion of the utility requirement on casebycase basis160 proponents of strict utility standard some legal and scientific commentators have expressed concern that proprietary interests in scientific knowledge will impede research efforts overall following the lead of brenner v manson professors heller and eisenberg have invoked the tragedy of the anticommons to argue against the patenting of genetic materials161 the tragedy of commons is familiar metaphor for many economists lawyers and scientists resource is prone to overuse in tragedy of the commons when too many owners each have privilege to use given resource and one has right to exclude another overpopulation air pollution and species extinction result from tragedies of the commons in mirror image of the tragedy of the commons resource may be prone to underuse in tragedy of the anticommons in this circumstance multiple owners each have right to exclude others from scarce resource and one has an effective privilege of use transaction costs strategic behaviors and the cognitive biases of participants often prevent individuals from reaching socially optimal agreement allocating property rights use of the resource then becomes difficult or impossible professors heller and eisenberg argue the granting of intellectual property rights to early research results holds the potential to create tragedy of the anticommons in biomedical research they specifically identify two mechanisms through which patents on gene fragments may hinder innovation first too many concurrent fragments of intellectual property rights may hinder the exploitation of potential future products in spiral of overlapping patent claims held by different individuals one enterprise may own patent on raw genomic dna fragment another on the corresponding protein and yet another on diagnostic test for genetic disease professors heller and eisenberg explain that each upstream patent allows its owner to set up another tollbooth on the road to product development adding to the cost and slowing the pace of downstream biomedical innovation second upstream patent owners may be able to stack licenses on top of the future discoveries of downstream users the use of reachthrough license agreements on patented research tools is exemplary these covenants give the owner of patented invention used in upstream stages of research rights in subsequent downstream

downstream products proponents of lenient utility standard others have urged that originators of research tools too require return on investment and that allowing patents only on final products would further industry concentration162 if independent researchers and research enterprises were unable to patent their discoveries then they might have option but to join large companies capable of seeing this earlier research through to completed product this trend might chill the market for preliminary genetic materials and ultimately diminish research commentators further note that research tools are subject to lively market within the biotechnology industry many enterprises are interested in purchasing research tools and as result many enterprises are engaged in making them attorney scott chambers says that describing these products as preliminary and arising within the realm of philosophy is simply inaccurate163 those in favor or more porous utility standard also argue that research products do not present special case they observe that patented products and processes often are later found to possess additional more valuable uses than those named in the original patent in such cases advance knowledge of one particular use does not somehow restrain the patentees proprietary interest in those additional applications for example the chemical compound nitroglycerine originally developed as an explosive was later found to be useful as heart medication if an inventor had obtained patent on the nitroglycerine compound itself then he would continue to possess proprietary interest in that compound matter what applications were discovered for it whether characterized as basic research tool or an applied technology any invention potentially serves as the basis for later developments164 finally observers have noted that arguments similar to those of professors heller and eisenberg have been made in the past the techniques of polymer chemistry for example involve the

biotechnology industry some observers believe that particularly for entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial biotechnology firms patents facilitate capitalization and therefore support technological advance166 experience also suggests that legal uncertainties regarding biotechnology patents may impact the ability of enterprises to acquire funding for their research and developmen t efforts

the government itself without just compensation 172 us library of congress congressional research service patents on methods of doing continuedof the trips agreement reads similarly this language confirms the broad sense of patent eligibility under current us law both nafta and the trips agreement do allow signatory states to exempt higher life forms from the patent system as further stated in article 17093 of nafta signatory may exclude from patentability plants and animals other than microorganisms and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than nonbiological and microbiological processes for such production article 273 of the trips agreement reads almost identically the impact of these exceptions is that signatory may disallow patents from issuing on living entities other than microorganisms thus microscopic organisms such as bacteria viruses and protozoa must be classified as patentable signatories may but need not issue patents on higher life forms ranging from genetically modified rice to the harvard mouse signatories to nafta and the trips agreement may also deny patents to processes that are deemed essentially biological in character whether particular process is essentially biological depends upon the degree of artificial activity required to perform the process method of selectively breeding animals by selecting particular animals and bringing them together would likely be deemed essentially biological and therefore may be held unpatentable however method of treating plant to improve its yield such as method of pruning tree would not be judged essentiall biological due to the more significant degree of human intervention169 excluding this later sort of process from patentability would not comport with nafta or trips agreement us law arguably includes this exception already given case law requiring that biotechnological inventions be subject to artificial invention in order to be patentable170 should congress choose it could take an approach other than that suggested by case law and pto practice by making certain biotechnologies unpatentable numerous patent applications have been filed on variety of biotechnological inventions these applications have resulted in many issued patents and some of these patents have been litigated in the courts legislation affecting these patents would prompt concerns over governmental takings under the fifth amendment171 limiting biotechnology patenting would counter prevailing trends within the patent community both domestically and abroad as suggested by the recent patenting of methods of doing business many patent systems are tending towards an increasingly broad scope of patentable subject matter172 biotechnologies

patentable in japan and after several years of debate the european parliament issued directive approving biotechnology patents173 the utility requirement the utility requirement is judgemade law its only statutory mooring is the term useful recited in 101 of the patent act although the pto has issued utility guidelines congress has never elaborated on the utility requirement the concern of many actors within the biotechnological industry that the utility requirement be calibrated appropriately174 concern within the research community that some patents could provide disincentive for further research and arguable inconsistencies within the case law175 suggest that these issues may draw congressional interest congress could examine whether the definition of patentable utility should be legislatively specified for example the patent act could list the pertinent factors suitable for demonstrating the utility of expressed sequence tags ests pto deputy assistant commissione r for patent policy stephen g kunin has suggested that pertinent factors include knowledge of the corresponding mrna sequence protein coding sequence or genomic sequence whether there are sequence polymorphisms linked to the corresponding genomic location the function of the protein encoded by the corresponding messenger rnucleic acid mrna the phenotype of mutation in the corresponding gene the tissue distribution of the corresponding mrna and tissuespecific expression levels and the map location of its corresponding genomic sequence176 recurring complaint is that patent applicants specify minimal and rather abstract utilities such as the possible use of an est merely as probe or marker177 congress could resolve whether these uses fulfill the patentable utility requirement some caution however that specifying such technical detail in law has drawbacks to the extent the law would need to be amended in order to reflect changes in rapidly evolving technologies
