bolle specialist in international trade foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560 singapore and chile are the fourth and fifth countries to sign trade agreements with the united states that include labor provisions the first three were canada and mexico under the north american free trade agreement nafta and jordan under the usjordan free trade agreement these agreements build on historical us support and promotion of worker rights through the international labor organization and us trade laws major issues for congress are 1 do these agreements balance the promotion of worker rights with trade and investment opportunities for businesses and 2 are these agreements appropriate role models for future trade agreements the us chile free trade agreement hr 2738 was implemented by pl 10877 and the ussingapore free trade agreement hr 2739 was implemented as pl 10878 both on september 3 20031 this report will be updated as events warrant us historical policy on worker rights for many years members of congress have heard arguments for and against linking worker rights protections to trade promotion vehicles in favor of the linkage are human rights activists who argue that some workers in developing countries are being denied protections available to us workers and labor rights activists who argue that labor protections are necessary to help level the playing field against lowwage foreign competition against the linkage have been some business interests arguing that worker rights provisions in trade promotion vehicles are disguised form of protectionism congress has responded to these concerns by promoting worker rights in three ways first it has supported the international labor organization ilo united nations organization chartered in 1919 to promote worker rights through voluntary compliance 1 for details on other aspects of the agreements and legislative tracking see us singapore free trade agreement by dick k nanto crs report rl31789 and uschile free trade agreement economic and trade policy issues by jf hornbeck crs report rl31144 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 technical assistance and moral suasion ilo members are obligated to uphold handful of core labor standards which are listed in table 1 second congress has promoted worker rights through us trade laws which tie preferential trade treatment to adherence to internationally recognized worker rights these rights similar to ilo core labor standards but grounded in us labor law are referenced in variety of us statutes primarily those offering trade preferences to countries taking steps to afford their workers these rights such statutes and programs include the generalized system of preferences gsp the andean trade preference act atpa and the caribbean basin initiative cbi2 the extent to which ilo and us standards duplicate each other is evidenced in table 1 the combined lists include six rights of which four the right of association right to organize and bargain collectively prohibition of forced labor and child labor protections are virtually identical ilo core labor standards additionally include freedom from employment discrimination while the us list includes acceptable conditions of work relating to minimum wages maximum hours and occupational safety and health protection table 1 definition of core labor standards and internationally httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560 recognized worker rights us internationally recognized worker rights ilo core labor standards 1 the right of association 1 1 and 2 are combined 2 the right to organize and bargain collectively 2 same 3 prohibition of forced labor 3 same 4 minimum age for the employment of children and protection 4 same from the worst forms of child labor ie drug trafficking prostitution and soldiering 5 acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum 5 freedom from employment wages hours of work and occupational safety and health discrimination sources ilo and trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended by sec 503 of pl 98573 the third way the united states promotes worker rights is through trade agreements which include pledges to uphold both ilo core labor standards and us internationally recognized rights promotion of these rights is mandated by trade promotion authority tpa previously known as fasttrack authority whereby congress agrees to consider trade agreements the president has negotiated on fasttrack basis voting them up or down without amendment and with limited debate since 1993 four trade agreements the north american free trade agreement nafta the usjordan free trade agreement fta adopted without tpa and now the pending ussingapore fta and the uschile fta pledge partner countries to adhere to standards on both lists3 labor provisions nafta jordan singapore and chile ftas table 3 shows how the four ftas that include labor provisions nafta jordan singapore and chile compare in this regard between nafta implemented by pl 2 internationally recognized worker rights are included in the 1984 amendments to the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 amended by sec 503 of pl 98573 see also crs report 96661e worker rights provisions and trade policy should they be linked by mary jane bolle 3 the most recent tpa was included in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 crs3 103182 1993 and the usjordan free trade agreement implemented by pl 10743 2001 the location of the labor provisions shifted from side agreement into the body of the agreement where they have remained in the chile and singapore ftas the basic labor provisions have remained consistent through the four trade agreements under them each party country agrees to support ilo core labor standards and internationally recognized worker rights b agrees to effectively enforce its own labor laws in traderelated matters and c retains discretion in allocating enforcement resources nafta singapore and chile ftas also provide for domestic remedies and procedural guarantees the nafta and jordan ftas differ from the chile and singapore ftas in terms of labor provisions subject to dispute panel proceedings sanctions and maximum penalties under nafta only failure to enforce occupational safety and health child labor or minimum wage standards is subject to these remedies4 under jordan violation of any labor provision is subject to any appropriate and commensurate action if the dispute cannot be resolved5 under the chile and singapore ftas only the sustained failure of party to enforce its own laws in matter affecting trade may be subject to the abovementioned remedies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560 maximum penalties for sanctionable offenses also differ among three of the four trade agreements naftas maximum penalty is 20 million for the first year and failure to pay could result in suspension of nafta benefits to the amount of the monetary enforcement assessment maximum penalties under the chile and singapore agreements are 15 million annually with failure to pay as under nafta leading potentially to suspension of benefits to the equivalent dollar volume jordan lists maximum singapore and chile ftas labor advisory committee issues the labor advisory committee lac us trade advisory committee of 58 members representing unions from every economic sector evaluated the chile and singapore agreements against nafta and the usjordan fta and came out against them on three points6 first the lac argues that the chile and singapore ftas represent big step backwards from the jordan fta and largely replicate nafta which permits only communication investigation and recommendations to resolve most complaints second the lac argues that the chile and singapore ftas will not protect the core rights of workers in any of the countries involved for several reasons first they argue the dispute settlement process may not be used to challenge whether party is striving to meet ilo standards and to not derogate from domestic laws even though failure in effort may be arguably hard to prove second they argue that either country if it were 4 for more detail see enforcement aspects of labor and environment provisions of us free trade agreements with jordan singapore and chile summary and chart by jeanne j grimmett july 1 2003 crs general distribution memo 5 however before congress approved the implementing legislation the united states trade representative and jordans ambassador exchanged letters pledging to resolve any differences that might arise by avoiding traditional trade sanctions 6 the uschile free trade agreement report of the labor advisory committee for trade negotiations and trade policy february 28 2003 crs4 challenged for failing to enforce its existing labor laws could simply weaken or eliminate those laws to avoid dispute settlement finally they argue labor enforcement procedures allow parties long timelines for consultations and cap the maximum amount of fines and sanctions available at an unacceptably low level finally the lac argues the chile and singapore ftas neither fully meet the negotiating objectives laid out by congress for trade agreements nor promote the economic interests of the united states while potentially threatening job loss they argue that the labor enforcement provisions of the singapore and chile ftas are weaker than in the jordan fta because labor and commercial obligations which were treated identically in the jordan fta are treated differently from each other in these most recent trade agreements this they argue violates the tpa legislation on dispute settlement as principal negotiating objective7 principal negotiating objectives of the tpa legislation call for trade agreements that treat all complaints eg labor and commercial equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and the availability of equivalent remedies perspective of the ustr and the usitc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560 the us trade representative ustr responded to the concerns of the lac citing the larger benefits of more open trade that reducing foreign trade barriers increases economic growth stimulates job growth and makes consumer products more affordable the ustr also emphasized that chile and singapore already have strong labor rules consistent with ilo core labor standards see table 2 and that chile amended its labor laws to ensure that its standards meet the benchmarks set out in the fta in addressing specific concerns of the lac the ustr focused on lac charges that table 2 core labor standards and internationally recognized worker the ftas failed to protect core rights of rights adopted by chile and singapore workers in response to lac criticism that chile and singapore might be tempted to roll core labor standards back their labor laws if their enforcement of chile has ratified all core labor standards them were under challenge the ustr replied singapore has ratified one out of two in each of the four categories freedom of association that 1 chile had strengthened its labor laws and collective bargaining elimination of in anticipation of the inclusion of forced labor elimination of employment enforceability issues in the fta 2 under discrimination and abolition of child labor it the chile and singapore ftas system of has denounced convention 105 on forced labor labor consultations available for addressing any matter arising under the trade agreement internationally recognized worker rights creates forum for discussing any labor both chile and singapore have laws covering disputes and 3 the us department of all five internationally recognized worker labor has already embarked on cooperative rights sources ilo and department of state program with chile to improve the administration of its labor laws and enhance labor justice lac concerns about potential job loss from the ussingapore and us chile ftas are addressed in us international trade commission usitc reports on the 7 trade act of 2002 pl 107210 august 6 2002 sec 2102b12g crs5 economic effects of the ussingapore and uschile free trade agreements8 based on the global trade analysis project gtap modeling framework9 these studies estimated that the employment effects of the singapore and chile ftas would be quite small few of the sectoral impacts are estimated to exceed onetenth of one percent of sector employment through 2016 this is because tariffs and trade barriers to be removed are generally small and trade with singapore and chile the united states12th and 36th trading partners accounts for 17 and 03 of total us trade exports and imports combined the larger potential job effects are with chile where by 2016 net imports of vegetables fruits and nuts could cause us production to decline by 005 to 008 and us production of machinery and equipment to expand by 002 to 005 chile and singapore ftas as potential role models there was much debate when the usjordan fta was being approved about whether it should be role model for other agreements some argued that the jordan fta should be onetime case because it already had strong worker protections others argued that trade agreements to follow should be further strengthened the us has begun fta negotiations with 1 morocco 2 five nations in central america the central america httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21560 free trade agreement cafta which includes costa rica salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua 3 five nations in the southern african customs union botswana lesotho namibia south africa and swaziland and 4 australia some argue that the chile and singapore ftas which authorize dispute resolutions leading to possible sanctions only if country fails to enforce its own labor laws would be inadequate as template for ftas with certain developing countries 1 if the text does not address egregious conditions for workers 2 where countrys laws do not reflect international standards and 3 where there is history of nonenforcement andor hostile environment toward the rights of workers others argue that the united states is working closely with number of countries to improve their labor laws and enforcement efforts in anticipation of entering into trade agreements with them however certain developing countries they point out may lack the funding and resources to adequately enforce their laws and might balk at pressure from the united states to overhaul existing legislation or introduce new measures therefore it might be difficult for such countries to agree to trade pact that attempts to go above the chilesingapore standard conclusion achieving economic growth better jobs and improved labor standards are some of the goals of modernday trade agreements challenge in further removing barriers to international trade is to balance the objectives to achieve trade and investment opportunities and worker protections at the same time 8 usitc ussingapore free trade agreement potential economywide and selected sectoral
