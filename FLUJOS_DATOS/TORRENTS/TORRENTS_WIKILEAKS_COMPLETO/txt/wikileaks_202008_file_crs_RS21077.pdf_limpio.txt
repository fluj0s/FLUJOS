attorney american law division summary citing the need to ensure that individuals in federal custody are not able to facilitate acts of terrorism through conversations with an attorney the department of justices bureau of prisons instituted an interim rule on october 30 2001 authorizing the monitoring of attorneyclient communications when the attorney general determines that reasonable suspicion exists to believe that such communications might facilitate acts of violence or terrorism this report provides an overview of the provisions of the interim rule as well as brief synopsis of sixth amendment implications regarding intentional intrusion into the attorneyclient relationship on october 31 2001 the department of justices bureau of prisons published an interim rule in the federal register effective october 30 2001 1 altering regulations regarding the imposition of special administrative measures designed to prevent the dissemination of information by certain inmates that could endanger national security or lead to acts of violence and terrorism and 2 authorizing the monitoring of attorneyclient communication s subject to specific procedural safeguards upon certification by the attorney general that reasonable suspicion exists to believe that an inmate may use such communications to further or facilitate acts of violence or terrorism1 overview of the interim rule the interim rule makes several changes to provisions in the code of federal regulations authorizing the imposition of special administrative measures with respect to specified inmates upon certification by senior intelligence or law enforcement officials that such measures were necessary to prevent the dissemination of classified information that could endanger national security 28 cfr 5012 or other information that couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21077crs2 2 id at 55062 the interim rule also expands the definition of inmate to include all persons in the custody of the federal bureau of prisons or bureau contract facilities including persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the united states dc code felony offenders and persons held as witnesses detainees or otherwise 28 cfr 5001c

in administrative detention limiting correspondence and visitation media interviews and use of the telephone to the extent such limitations are reasonably necessary regarding the potential disclosure of classified information that could threaten national security the interim rule extends the initial period of time such measures may be imposed from period of 120 days to period up to one year as designated by the director of the bureau of prisons also whereas the original regulation allowed for 120 day extensions of special administrative measures upon certification that the factors identified in the original certification continued to exist the interim rule allows the director to extend the period for imposition of such measures in increments of up to one year upon subsequent certification that there is danger of disclosure3 relatedly the interim rule extends the initial imposition period applicable for the prevention of acts of violence and terrorism from 120 days to period of up to one year likewise the interim rule alters the extension period from 120 days to periods of up to one year upon subsequent certification that the inmates communications could result in harm4 most significantly the interim rule adds new provision to 5013 authorizing the monitoring or review of communications between an inmate and his or her attorneys in any case where the attorney general orders based on information from the head of federal law enforcement or intelligence agency that reasonable suspicion exists to believe that particular inmate may use communications with attorneys or their agents to further or facilitate acts of terrorism5 the interim rule establishes that absent prior court authorization the director of the bureau of prisons is required to provide written notice to the inmate and attorneys involved prior to the initiation of any monitoring or review6 also the interim rule provides that the bop director with the approval of the assistant attorney general for the criminal division shall employ procedures to ensure that all attorneyclient communications are reviewed for privilege claims and that any privileged material not be retained during the course of the monitoring in an effort to protect the attorneyclient privilege and to ensure that the investigation is not compromised by exposure to privileged material relating to the investigation or defense strategy the interim rule provides for the designation of privilege team comprised of individuals not involved in the underlying investigation to monitor communications finally the interim rule provides that the privilege team may not disclose any information obtained during monitoring unless and until the disclosure has been approved by federal judge except in instances where the head of the teamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21077crs3 7 id at 55066 5013d3 8 us const amdt vi 9 united states v levy 577 f2d 200 209 3d cir 1978 see also united states v rosner 485

548 determines that the information obtained indicates that an act of violence or terrorism is imminent7 sixth amendment implications the sixth amendment to the constitution of the united states provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the rightto have the assistance of counsel for his defense8 while the fundamental justification for this provision is the general inability of criminal defendant to make informed choices about the preparation and conduct of his defense the sixth amendment has also been held to guarantee the privacy of communications with counsel as free two way communication between client and attorney is essential if the professional assistance guaranteed by the sixth amendment is to be meaningful9 accordingly this maxim raises the question of whether the monitoring of attorneyclient communications as provided for in the interim rule could constitute an impermissible intrusion into the attorneyclient relationship endangering an individuals right to effective assistance of counsel intrusion upon attorneyclient communication s in weatherford v bursey the supreme court addressed sixth amendment concerns surrounding governmental intrusion into the attorneyclient relationship10 in weatherford an undercover law enforcement agent weatherford was arrested and indicted with the defendant bursey in order to protect weatherfords undercover status in an effort to obtain information helpful to burseys defense bursey and his counsel invited weatherford to participate in attorneyclient meetings still wishing to maintain his undercover status weatherford participated in two such meetings but did not convey any information regarding trial plans or strategy to his superiors or the prosecuting attorney or his staff11 weatherford subsequently testified for the prosecution at burseys trial but did not make any reference to the attorneyclient meetings upon his conviction bursey sued weatherford under 42 usc 1983 alleging that weatherford had communicated defense strategies and plans to the prosecution depriving bursey of his right to effective assistance of counsel the district court rejected this argument finding that weatherford had in fact not discussed or made available any details or information regarding the plaintiffs trial plans strategy or anything having to do with the criminal action pending against the plaintiff12 the court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed imposing rule that whenever the prosecution knowingly arranges and permits intrusion into the attorney client relationship

of the sixth amendment while acknowledging that the privacy of attorney client communications is important for the meaningful realization of the sixth amendments guarantee of effective assistance of counsel the court found it significant that the government had not made the intrusion in bad faith and had not obtained any improper information14 accordingly the court held there being tainted evidence in this case communication of defense strategy to the prosecution and purposeful intrusion by weatherford there was violation of the sixth amendment15 particularly pertinent aspect of the weatherford decision as it relates to the present scenario was the courts determination that the governm ent had legitimate interest in maintaining the agents undercover status thereby justifying his presence at meetings between the defendant and his attorney16 subsequent to weatherford the lower courts have continued to uphold governmental intrusions necessitated by legitimate law enforcement interests17 furthermore in united states v mastroianni the court of appeals for the first circuit indicated that the government could intrude into the attorney client relationship upon establishing substantial record that there is possibility of criminal activity18 based upon these factors it is arguable that the interim rules requirement that there be reasonable suspicion of potential terrorist activity could be interpreted as sufficient to establish legitimate governmental interest in monitoring the communications of certain individuals furthermore the effective operation of privilege teams as provided for in the interim rule might serve to obviate judicial concerns regarding the potential of prejudice that arises from governmental intrusion into the attorneyclient relationship specifically courts deciding intrusion cases subsequent to weatherford have established different standards regarding which party bears the burden of establishing the absence or existence of prejudice in united states v steele for instance the court of appeals for the sixth circuit determined that even where there is an intentional intrusion by the government into the attorneyclient relationship prejudice to the defendant must be shown before any remedy is granted19 upon determining that governmental informant who had intruded upon defense preparations had not divulged any information obtained from the conferences the court held that there was indication that the defendant was denied effective assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21077crs5 20 steele 727 f2d at 587 21 levy 577 f2d at 209 22 schillinger v haworth 70 f3d 1132 1141 10th cir 1995of counsel20 under this approach privilege team operating effectively pursuant to the interim rule might persuade reviewin g court to determine that the monitoring is presumptively valid absent an indication of improper disclosure of privileged information relatedly in the event of such disclosure this approach might lead court to require showing of prejudice prior to finding sixth amendment violation conversely other courts have held that per violation occurs in instances where there is an intrusion into the attorneyclient relationship that results in the disclosure of information to the prosecution irrespective of finding of prejudice in united states v levy for example the court of appeals for the third circuit held that the inquiry into prejudice must stop at the point where attorneyclient confidences are actually exposed to the government enforcement agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting the case any other rule would disturb the balance implicit in the adversary system and thus would jeopardi ze the very process by which guilt and innocence are determined in our society21 similarly in schillinger v haworth the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that there was need to determine whether governmental intrusion resulting in the disclosure of information to the prosecution was prejudicial to the defendant as such purposeful intrusion on the attorneyclient relationship strikes at the center of protections afforded by the sixth amendment22 under this standard it would appear that while secure monitori ng by privilege team might garner court approval any indication of improper disclosure could result in an automatic determination that the sixth amendment had been violated in light of the aforemention ed factors it would appear that weatherford and subsequent cases requiring the demonstration of prejudice prior to establishing sixth amendment violation may lend credence to the notion that the government may monitor attorney client communications so long as there is justification for the intrusion and the information obtained is not used to the prosecutions advantage in its case however it may likewise be argued that the legal rationales discussed above do not support such conclusion given that they do not appear to contemplate the sixth amendment implications of systematic monitoring b the chilling effect of systematic monitoring it is important to note that the aforementioned cases address discrete instances of governmental intrusion into the attorneyclient relationship even in situations where an intentional intrusion was upheld the intrusion was of temporary nature with the focus of the judicial inquiry centering on whether the intrusion resulted in the production of information that was prejudicial to the defense while the holdings in these cases may be cited for the proposition that governmental intrusions are not inherently violative of the sixth amendment they shed little light on the concern that pervasive monitoring of attorneyclient communications will have chilling effect on the full and open consideration of the legal options available to covered inmate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21077crs6 23 weatherford 429 us at 554 n 4 quoting brief for united states in hoffa v united states ot 1966 32 p 71 quoted in brief for united states as amicus curiae in weatherford v bursey 429 us 545 p 24 n 13 24 weatherford 429 us at 554555 n 4 25 united states v didomenico 78 f3d 294 7th cir 1996 cert denied 519 us 1006 1996 26 id at 299 the court stated that such practice would because of its pervasiveness and publicity greatly undermine the freedom of communication between defendants and their lawyers and with it the efficacy of the right to counsel because knowledge that permanent record was being made of the conversations between the defendants and their lawyers would make the defendants reluctant to make candid disclosures totalitarianstyle continuous surveillance must surely be great inhibitor of communicationas such the calculus traditionally employed by the courts to identify whether particular intrusion constitutes sixth amendment violation would not appear to be fully applicable to the present scenario there do not appear to have been any cases that directly address the sixth amendment implication s of the type of monitoring authorized by the interim rule there is indication however that courts may be hesitant to allow such pervasive monitoring given its potentially chilling effect on the attorneyclient relationship in weatherford for instance the supreme court noted the governments acknowledgment that the sixth amendments assistanceofcounsel guarantee can be meaningfully implemented only if criminal defendant knows that his lawful preparations for trial are secure against intrusion by the government his adversary in the criminal proceeding23 the court went on to state that one threat to the effective assistance of counsel posed by government interception of attorneyclient communications lies in the inhibition of free exchanges between defendant and counsel because of the fear of being overheard24 furthermore the court of appeals for the seventh circuit explaining the importance of privacy in attorneyclient communications has indicated that systematic monitori ng of such communications could raise potentially fatal sixth amendment concerns specifically in united states v didomenico the court addressed at length the hypothetical implementation of governmental policy to tape all conversations between criminal defendants and their lawyers for archival purposes without turning them over to the prosecution25 the court opined that such systematic monitoring of attorneyclient communications would violate the sixth amendment as the knowledge of continuous surveillance would inhibit clients willingness to engage in open and full discussion with his or her attorney26 applying these considerations to the interim rule it is possible that reviewing court would determine that an inmates privacy interests are not protected sufficiently specifically while the application of procedural safeguards such as the use of taint team could mitigate judicial concern regarding the impermissible disclosure of privileged information to the prosecution it is possible that reviewing court would find such measures to be of little value in ameliorating the chilling effect on attorneyclient communications that is likely to arise upon application of the interim rule these factors viewed in relation to weatherford and its progeny indicate that reviewing courts may reach different conclusions regarding the sixth amendment validity of the monitoring plan as implemented in the interim rule
