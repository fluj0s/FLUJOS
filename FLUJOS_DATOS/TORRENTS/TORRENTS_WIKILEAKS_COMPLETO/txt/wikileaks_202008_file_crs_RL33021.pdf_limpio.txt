report is written in response to number of requests from c ongress concerning profits in the oil industry this report provides background in formation concerning the level of oil industry profits the sources of those profits and discussion of the potential uses of profits in response to the increased price of crude oil since the fall of 2004 profits of virtually all firms in all segments of the oil industry have incr eased however the greatest increases have been in the downstream or refining and marketing segments of the industry these increases in prof it are apparent whether the major integrated oil companies the independents or refine rs are considered lending some credence to the viewpoint that industry profits ar the result of factors beyond the elevated price of crude oil historically the curre nt combination of high oil prices and high profits have been seen befo re and periods of low prices and profits tended to follow the relatively high profit levels earned in refining and marketing suggest that conditions in the petroleum pr oducts markets including the gasoline diesel and jet fuel segments contributed to earned prof its above and beyond the effect of higher crude oil prices key factors in these markets included tight refining capacity and low inventory levels merger s acquisitions and asset sa may also have changed the relative profit positions of many firms in the industry all of these factors have been influenced by investment decisions in the oil industry firms in the oil industry are likely to use their recently earned profits in variety of ways they are holding record cash balances buying back their shares and increasing dividends merger and acquisiti on activity in the industry again appears to be on the rise in addition the major oil companies are investing in variety of energy related projects alt hough not necessarily oil including liquified natural gas and gastoliquids technologies these proj ects tend to be intern ational in scope in the longer term investments in explor ation production and refining capacity are likely to be needed to mitigate the high prices of 20042005 this report will not be

3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021oil industry profits analysis of recent performance the rapid increase in the price of crude oil which began in 2004 and has continued into 2005 has been major factor contributing to the record profits earned in the oil industry however other factor s were likely also at work high capacity utilization in the refining industry led to in creases in profit for refiners exceeding that for the industry as whole companies ability to expand output either of crude oil or petroleum products also mig ht have affected profitability the effects of mergers acquisitions and other asset transactions also likely affected the profit performance of many firms in the industry perhaps of even more long term importa nce than the level of profits in 2004 and 2005 is what the oil industry chooses to do w ith them if firms invest earned profits into expanding capacity at key stages in the production chain consumers might expect to see expanded supply with mode rating effect on price if firms do not make significant investments in produc tion capacity or if those investments experience sharply diminishing returns in terms of volumes of oil and petroleum products per dollar invested then the moderating effect on price is likely to be limited in market economy decisions on the us of profit is the responsibility of the industry in which they are earned howeve r because of the central importance of petroleum based products to the functioning of the economy as well as the direct effect of oil prices on consumers budgets pub lic interest in the vel as well as the use of profits tends to be high also government regulation can have direct impact on the ability or willingness of firms to make investments ie refineries and this could have ripple effect on other ups tream and downstream investments and ultimately affect petroleum product supply on the market the price of crude oil surged during th last eight months of 2004 with the price of barrel of west texas intermed iate wti the standard benchmark oil reaching over 55 in october this pric represented 60 increase over the low price for the year reached in january 2004 of 3431 the average price of wti per barrel was 25 higher in the last six months of the year than in the first six months after moderating somewhat at the end of 2004 and early in 2005 crude oil prices went above 60 per barrel in the summer months gasoline prices which more directly affect consumers peaked in may 2004 earlier than those of crude oil which peaked in october the price of reformulated gasoline at new york harbor in ja nuary 2004 was 100 per gallon by may 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs2 1energy information administration weekly petroleum status report for the week ending july 22 2005 table 14 p27

gallon1 these price increases represent mone transfer from consumers of oil and petroleum products to the us oil industr and foreign oil producers for example us consumers used on average about 9 million barrels per day of gasoline in 2004 with the average price of gasoline for th year about 028 per gallon higher than in 2003 american consumers spent an add itional 105 million per day for gasoline compared to 2003 this money became incr eased revenues for the oil industry in functioning market economy increases in revenue are likely to lead to investment in the industry expansion of supply and ultimately moderating pr ices for consumers in the longer term if this selfcorrecting process is not working this could be an indication that factors other than traditional profit and investment incentives are at work these would likely result in additiona l long term increases in price and profit for the industry the public has an obvious interest in determining whether the market process is working effectivel to expand supply in the oil industry in 2004 the net incomes of the nine in tegrated oil companies rose by 39 compared to similar period in 2003 while revenues rose by 262 net incomes of independent oil and gas produc ing firms rose by 37 over the same period while the net incomes of independent refiners and marketers rose by 190 over the same time period on revenue increases of 27 and 45 respectively3 an obvious explanation cited for these elevated profit levels is that the world price of oil was high factor attributable to forces in the global oil market force over which even the largest oil companies have little direct control this report analyzes the profit performance of firms in the oil industry evaluates factors th at might have affected profitability in the oil industry and examines the use of prof its by the industry and the implications for the development of the oil market profit performance introduction profit analysis may be carried out using total profits and their yearly growth or with profit rates total profit analysis is useful in evaluating the effect of the industrys profitability on expenditure fl ows within the economy as well as the potential command over resources held by comp anies in the industry yearly growth of profits can show whether the industry is becoming more or less of factor in over all expenditure flows in the economy profit analysis based on profit rates is useful in examining the effectiveness of the firms management in using available resources profit rate analysis is also usefulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs3 4a more complete discussion of profit analysis is in the appendix to this report 5historical net income data for the major ener gy companies is available at

basi s for futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange cushing oklahoma is the delivery point for new york mercantile exchange traded crude oil in making comparisons based on the relativ performance of firms in the industry and is widely used by investment analysts in this report the focus is on total prof its and the growth of profits within the oil industry and the likely uses of profits by the industry specifically the potential ability of the industry to invest in oil supply related projects4 profits in the oil industry have been volatile over the past three decades reflecting oil price changes as well as other market effects for example net income for the major energy companies as defined by the energy information administration eia increased almost threefold by 1981 compared to 1977 on the oil price increases associated with the ir aniraq war by 1986 net incomes of the major energy companies had sunk below 1977 levels profits peaked and declined at least three other times during the period 198720025 volatility in the price of oil which leads to volatility in profits makes investment planning risky investments which might qualify for implementation if high oil price is assumed may not qualify if lower price of oil is assumed this uncertainty may have contributed to the cyclical nature of inve stment and capacity expansion in the industry major oil compan profits in 2004 oil industry profits are wide ly identified as related to world oil price levels figure 1 shows the movement of the monthly price of wti crude oil at cushing oklahoma from 2003 through 20056 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs4 upward pressure on the price of wti which began in 2003 strengthened during the summer of 2004 leading to peak price levels in october 2004 the daily peak price for the year 5517 per barrel of wti occurred in late october the average price of wti for the second half of 2004 4601 per barrel was 25 or almost 10 per barrel higher than the average price for the first six months of the year which was 3679 per barrel if the profit perf ormance of the oil industry was based or related only to the price of oil given normal lags in the production

source oil daily profits profile supplement vol 55 39 february 28 2005 p 8 na not available the recent record of the major integrat ed oil companies in expanding production of crude oil and oil pr oducts may be the result of several factors unfavorable geologic and political factors might have inhibited output expansion while the decision to expand oil and gas production in the united states is generally based on the underlying market economics the ge ology of many producing regions in the united states may not support large increases in output especially without financial investment in new technologies many us oil and gas fields have either peaked or are in decline making it difficult to ex pand production irrespectiv of the available price incentives overseas oil and gas pr oduction decisions may reflect the policies of the host governments the organizati on of petroleum exporting countries opec quotas or host nati ons tax policies another possible explanation for the re latively slow production response by the major integrated oil companies in reaction to high oil prices might be that significant investments are required and that the re sulting time lags might be long enough to delay the appearance of additional supply on the market the major oil companies have been active in interna tional investment although g ood part of that investment has been in new product technologies such as gas to liquids and liquefied natural gas these projects requiring multibillion dollar investments take up to five to seven years to complete this could be one explanation why little additional output of gasoline and other refined products has appeared to resu lt from higher prices in the short termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs10 oil companies are owned by sharehol ders and managerial performance is evaluated in terms of corporate earnings it is possible that because of limitations on the ability of the firms to invest in additi onal oil and gas producti on in the short term profits have been returned to investors in the form of dividends or the buy back of shares to enhance the market capitalization of the companies independent oil company profits the profit picture for the independent il and gas producers with respect to net incomes and total reve nues in 2004 was in some ways similar to that of the major integrated companies however some features of their pe rformance differed from that of the major companies table 5 presents data for n independent producers aggregate net income for the group of 10 independent oil and gas producers in 2004 rose by approximately th same rate just below 40 as that of the major integrated oil companies similarly revenues grew by over 25 the major difference in the picture for the independent oil and gas pr oducers is that they raised output during 2004 by multiple of the amount s registered by the major companies oil production was up by over 125 and natural gas producti on rose by almost 4 this increased production may however be partly the result of asset acquisition by the independent companies over the past several years the major integrated oil companies have sold off smaller producing fields nd facilities which have been acquired by the independent companies for this reason it is possible that the increased production in this sector as we ll as the small production increases recorded by the major companies might be relate d and reflect an ownership transfer of existing assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021 crs11 table 5 financial performance of independent oil companies

gas journal europe sees growing dieselgas mismatch vol103 issue 8 february 28 2005 pp 58the gross refining margins of 2003 and 2004 which increased by greater percentage than the price of crude oil are likely indication that tightness in the gasoline market which is linked to refini ng sector running at nearly full capacity has led to profits that increased by larger percentage than the price of crude oil another indication of tightness in the refini ng sector is that imports of finished gasoline as well as gasoline blending co mponents have been increasing and were at record levels in 2004 it is also true that the number of operating refineries in the united states has declined to 149 from peak of 324 in 1981 significant new refineries have been construc ted in the united states for quarter of century the refining capacity growth that has occurre d in the united states since 1990 has been largely due to improvements made at existing facilities called capacity creep use of oil profits refinery investment an expansion of refinery capacity in the united states might alleviate the portion of petroleum product price increases not due to the high price of crude oil construction of new refineries in the unite d states would add stability to the supply of gasoline and other petrol eum products the current capac ity is stretched nearly to the limit to accommodate growing petrol eum product demand in addition the growing us dependence on imported ga soline and petroleum products would be reduced reinvesting profit into growing profitable business is also normal business strategy however current conditions may limit potential expansion the key factor in determining whether new refinery capacity will be constructed in the united states is the underlying ec onomics an oil company seeking to meet gasoline demand in the us market can do that in any of three ways the company can either expand existing refineries bu ild new refinery or import additional gasoline from overseas the economics dict ate that companies choose the cheapest alternative given that all gasoline will sell for the same price irrespective of source in 2005 it is likely that the cheapest source of gasoline is through imports europe is thought to have surplus gasoline capacity as their vehicle fleet is in transition to diesel fuel and refineries are still largely oriented toward now excess gasoline production12 expansion of existing refineries is likely the next cheapest source of product expansion of existing refineries avoids many or all of the fixed costs associated with new refinery and allows firms to benefit from economies of scale in the refining process construction of new refineries is likely the most expensive source of new product as shown in table 7 not only have the returns to refiners been low on average but they have also been volatile ev recent profit performance has not been uniformly good although returns in 2004 and 2003 were favorable 2002 was year of very

of high refining returns is longer term projection for the price of crude oil supply increases up and down the oil supply chain are normally linke d to investment based on net present value analysis investment is likely to take place only if the long term forecasted price of crude oil is high enough to genera projected cash flows sufficient to justify the multibillion dollar costs of major petr oleum projects if the companies use projected oil prices in the 25 to 35 per barrel range in investment planning decisions limited extra investment and supply expansion can be expected to develop one oil analyst has asserted that prices might need to remain in the 50 to 80 per barrel range for sustained period for inve stment to occur in sufficient volume to build up comfortable cushion of spare oil production capability13 reluctance to invest based on current price levels might reflect historical experience with the pricei nvestmentsupply dynamic of th oil market as result of the rise in the price of crude oil ssociated with the iraniraq war of 197980 supply from nonopec sources increased and demand declin ed prices during this period reached real values c orrected for inflation of between 50 and 80 per barrel and then declined to nominal valu of 11 per barrel by 1985 investments undertaken early in the decade based on an expectation of continued high prices would have likely not been profitable in th market conditions that actually evolved refinery investment trends over the past two decades have been influenced by environmental compliance requirements eia has studied the effect of refinery investment required by environmental regulations and its relationship to profitability the eia report found that return on investme nt in the refining industry was reduced by 42 from 1996 to 2001 as result of mandated investme nt expenditures14 the industry is currently preparing to expand and introduce low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuels these investment requirements may claim share of the companies capital budget and reduce returns in parallel with past experience the permitting process has been identified by some as an impediment to refinery investment in the united states critics contend that even if it is possible to assemble all of the necessary permits to construct refinery the long time line required for approvals will tend to make the investment less attractive one example that has been cited concerning the length of the time required for the permitting process associated with the possible construction of new grassroots refinery is the facility

permit from the arizona department of environmental quality expected to be issued in 2005 after that permit is obtained approximately two dozen additional permits need to be obtained ranging from county permit for zoning approval to presidential permit from the us state department to allow the importation of mexican crude oil16 the tight petroleum products market in california with the resulting high prices as well as the generally good retu rns to refining since 2000 have maintained interest in this project the long delays in construction startup might have led to the project being cancelled if the underlying economics especially in the california market had not been so strong in recent years mergers and acquisitions the oil industry of today has evolved to its current stru

petroleum industry17 gao found that between 1991 and 2000 there were over 2600 mergers acquis itions and joint ventures in the us petroleum industry major ity of the transactions took place in the last five years of the decade the transac tions took place at all stages in the chain of production from exploration and production through refining and marketing these transactions included deals among the very largest oil companies for example in 1999 exxon corporation acquired mobil oil in 1998 br itish petroleum and amoco formed bp amoco which acquired arco in 2000 nd in 2001 chevrontexaco was formed merger activity is again on the rise in the us petroleum industry in april 2005 chevrontexaco made 17 billion stock and cash bid to acquire unocal the number 9 oil company in the united

largest refining company in the united states in 6 billion deal as result of the profitability of the last year companies with large cash reserves on their balance sheets are searching for ways to better position themselves on the world oil market increase their crude oil reserves and other assets and create economies of scale and cost savings individually they are able to accomplish these goals through mergers and acquisitions in addition large amount of accumulated profits is returned to investors usually at premium price through these transactions although these transactions may impr ove the market position of the firms involved and imply the expenditure of billi ons of dollars of accumulated profit they do little to improve the nation s demand and supply balance with respect to oil and petroleum products in the near term dividends and share purchases19 the firms that make up the oil industry are private firms th at use shareholder capital to engage in business operations when they make profits they are obliged to return those profits to shareholders unless management deems it likely that business opportunities exist such that rei nvestment will yield even larger future profits for shareholders the major oil companies have increased dividends for shareholders but in general by less than increases in av ailable funds for example exxonmobil increased quarterly dividends by 002 pe r share during 2004 an increase of about 8 however during the last quarter of 2004 earnings per share increased by 042 an increase of about 47 for the years 2002 through 2004 earning per share increased from 168 to 389 an increase of approximately 130 but dividends the amount actually paid out to share holders increased by only about 15 exxonmobil did however reduce the number of shares outstanding over the period by about 300 million to 64 billion from 67 billion if company repurchases its shares the value of shares outstanding is likely to increase and the company may choose to resell them on the market if it needs capital in the future exxonmobil also held over 18 billion in cash at the end of 2004 an increase of 75 over the year similar dividend strategy was in pl ace at chevrontexaco where quarterly dividends increased by 003 per share dur ing 2004 an increase of about 8 while earnings per share almost doubled compared to levels attained in the last quarter of 2003 for chevrontexaco earnings per share increased over the period 2002 to 2004 by an approximate factor of 10 fro m 054 to 628 while yearly dividends per share increase from 140 to 153 an increase of about 9 the number of chevrontexaco shares outstanding declined by about 29 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs18 conocophillips over the period 2002 thr ough 2004 increased yearly dividends from 074 per share to 090 per share an increase of about 21 however earnings per share increased from loss of 031 in 2002 to 581 in 2004 conocophillips increased the number of shar outstanding over the period by about 34 million limited dividend payouts coupled with modest expansion of investment in relation to profit has left oil companies highly liquid and well positioned to take advantage of future market opportunities conclusion since oil price increases began in 2004 the oil i ndustry s earned increased profits these profits might have resulte d from other factors in addition to the increased price of oil key factor in increased profitability might be the tightness in the us gasoline market factor rela ted to the lack of enough refinery capacity to meet us demand for petroleum products if oil and petroleum product pri ces are to decrease supply w ill likely have to increase relative to demand expanded suppl results from investment in the various stages of the oil industry production pro cess from exploration and development of new oil fields to increased refinery capacity if the underlying economic parameters and the regulatory environment are not encouraging investment might not be undertaken historically volatile prices and profit levels coupled with tight regulatory environment contri bute to industry uncertainty other legitimate uses for earned profits include paying higher dividends and retiring outstanding shares acquiring ssets through merger and acquisition and investing in new product areas these uses of profit may benefit shareholders and strategically position the firm in the global market but they do less to expand the supply of oil and products on the market and thereby reduce prices for consumers as result of significant time lags that tend to occur in the oil industry it may be too soon to know whether or not investme nts in the industry if taken will result in the increased supply of oil and petrol eum products needed to reduce prices and consumers costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs19 appendix measuring profit in market economy firms key meas ure of success is its ability to earn profit profit is important to firms because it is signal to the financial markets and investors that the firm is worthy of fundi ng either through bt or equity capital firms that earn less profit than expected by the market have difficulty funding investment opportunities w ith negative implications for growth firms that consistently earn less than adequate profits tend to experience slow growth stagnation and ultima tely failure profit is seemingly simple concept total cost is subtracted from total revenue leaving residual to tal profit in this appr oach profit is measured in dollars for the oil industry the simple total revenue minus to tal cost approach is complicated by the difficulty in neatly separating the revenuegenerating outputs of the firms from the costcreating production i nputs for any given oil company crude oil price changes may affect both the revenues and costs of the company if the company is an upstream producer and sells crude oil the produc tion of crude oil is revenue generating however downstr eam operations notably refining and marketing make use of crude oil as ra w material and for them the acquisition of crude oil is cost as result it is not always clear that an increase in the price of crude oil will raise or lower profits for firms with differing positions in the upstream and downstream segments of the industry another key factor in the profit calculation is how easily the increase in the cost of crude oil can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for gasoline and other refined products w ithout suffering more than proportionate decrease in sales if cost increases can be passed on to consumers and the firm has significant upstream business interests then it is more likely that an increase in the price of crude oil will yield increased profits simple way to rank companies for comparative purposes is by total profit however this type of simple ranking is likely to provide misleading picture of the relative performance of the companies in the oil industry while the total dollar value of profit is important it may be equally important to know the value of the resources or assets at firms disposal that were used to earn given dollar level of profit the size of the firm relative to the level of total profit is important especially for investment analysts for this reason the most commonly used measures of profit in investment analysis are expressed as percentages or rates inde pendent of specific magnitude s the use of percentages allows meaningful comparisons to be made between companies of different sizes and differing access to resources profit also can be measured to include or exclude special nonrecurring items that may temporarily affect companys revenues and costs for example if company incurs substantial costs and legal penalties associated with an environmental cleanup due to an oil spill at one of its facilities its profit performance for the relevant time period might well be negatively affected however profit numbers that include the costs resulting from the spill may tell potential investorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs20 20a large nonrecurring expense might however affect companys financial condition 21opportunity costs are the value of the retu rns that could be earned in the next best alternative for example if firm earns 100000 in profits according to the tax laws but could earn 150000 from liquidating the firms resources and applying them to another activity an economist would observe that the firm lost 50000 by engaging in its current activities rather than having made 100000 in profit 22the answer to this question requires set of profit results over time as sales have presumably grown in general it is more revealing to have time dependent set of profit data rather than one data point so that trends may be ascertained 23operating income is defined as gross profit minus operating expenses it is profit before the payment of interest and income taxes it is considered to be measure of how well the firm has succeeded in making money from the sales of goods and services before financial and tax obligations are consideredand other interested partie s little about the real continuing business performance of the company20 profits from continuing operations excluding onetime charges or revenues may be more info rmative for some purposes all stakeholders in company do not necessarily have an interest in the same conceptual definition of profit accountants are interested in profit calculations that meet generally accepted accounting practices and are consistent with the tax code economists use profit as signal to judge the efficiency of resource allocation decisions and include opportunity costs in their calculations21 potential investors in the companys stocks and bonds may choose to evaluate profit from still different perspective comparing profit to measure of the assets management had available for business purposes relative to the risk the company faced the profit rate even once the efficacy of using profit rate is determined measurement issues still need to be addressed since profit as rate or percentage must be expressed relative to some base an appropriate base must be specified three possible bases widely used in business analysis are sale s assets and net wo rth or shareholder equity each is useful in answering particular questions about the operation of the business but none necessarily serves as an allpurpose profit measure the profit margin on sales uses the tota l sales revenue of the business as the base and expresses pr ofit or net income as percen tage of sales revenue profit rates expressed in this manner can answer questions as to whether increasing sales become more or less profita ble as the business grows22 this profit measure can also lead analysts to basic questions as to wh ether the businesses prices were too low or too high or whether adequate cost contro ls were in place as the business expanded variation on this profit measure results from replacing net income in the calculation with operating income23 profits based on ssets or the return on assets di vides profit or net income by the value of the total assets of the bus iness this measure allows analysts to determine how well management uses the asset base of the company to generate profits for investors if the asset base represents the tools available to managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs21 24in the case where firm has debt assets must equal owners equity and the two profit measures will be identicalto carry out business activities the return on assets gives an indication of how effective management has been in using those tools this approach has been criticized by some because certain intangi bles important to the functioning of the business may not receive adequate weight in this measure profitability rate popular w ith potential investors is th return on equity or the return on net worth this measure divide s profit or net income by the value of shareholders equity in the firm ce the fundamental accounting identity assets liabilities owners equity must always hold for every business this profit rate is generally greater than and at leas t equal to the return on assets24 this measure is especially interesting to investors who mig ht plan to buy shares of stock in the business while this profit measure may be revealing to potential investors care should be exercised in its use if two bus inesses have the same asset value and the same level of profits differences in return on net worth can arise solely as result of the amount of debt financing on the firm s balance sheet difference purely of financial structure unrelated to firms ability to efficiently produce goods and earn revenues from selling goods this can gene rate misleading conclusions about the strength of the firms performance because the choice of financial structure for business is not generally related to its current profitability from continuing operations another measure sometimes identified w ith profitability is earnings per share this measure divides profit or net income by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding earnings per shar provides the prospective maximum of dividends per share that might be paid by the firm however it is not relevant measure to evaluate profit like the return on net worth it is affected by the capital structure of the company the division betw een equity and debt financing earnings per share can also be directly affected by strategic management decisions firms may decide to buy back shares of common stoc k and retire them holding them as treasury shares this type of strategy raises earnings per share by decreasing the number of outstanding shares over which any level of net income is divided this strategy might well be viewed negatively by financial analysts who might interpret it as signal that the firm does not have or r ecognize profitable i nvestment opportunities available and hence chooses to return to shareholders the money they had invested in the company an important factor in analyzing profit data is that in many cases it is more informative to use comparative analysis comparisons can be made over time with other companies in the same industry or with other companies that bear the same level of risk timebased comparative profit analysis may be helpful because it suggests the direction the company is heading or the dir ection of market trends particular rate of profit might be viewed as favorable if it was embedded in trend of rising profit rates or unfavorable if embedded in tre nd of falling profit rates time trends might also help to identify correlations between profit and other fact ors which influencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33021crs22 25risk is defined as the dispersion of the rate of return for the company in terms of the stock market risk is usually measured somewh at incompletely to reflect the dispersion in the movement of share prices without accounting for variations in dividends profits in addition key lags that affect profit are also mo re likely to be identified in time trend standing alone any rate of profit might be difficult to evaluate comparisons can be drawn with other firms in the same or closely related lines of business to determine whether particular firm is profit leader average or low profit earner within its industry cohort barring speci circumstances wh ich should be clearly reported in the companys financial statements if two firms in the same line of business with approximately the same asse t base report very di fferent profit rates it is possible that this differential might suggest that one or the other firms management strategy is superior looking at profit rates of different sized firms within the same industry allows the analys t to assess whether growth of the firm to larger scale may imply any advantage or disadvantage with respect to profit in some cases particularly for inve stment decisions the most relevant comparison is with firms with comparable level of risk independent of the line of business in which the firms are engaged25 this approach is appropriate for prospective investors because they may ve less interest in what business activity firm undertakes than the re sults of that activity in rms of profits earned and risk borne in many cases profits can be expr essed in comparison to an index of firms designed to show average or market returns and risk
