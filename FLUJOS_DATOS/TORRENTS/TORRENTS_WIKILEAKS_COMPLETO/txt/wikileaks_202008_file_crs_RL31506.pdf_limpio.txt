federal jurisdiction section amends section 1332 to provide for federal jurisdiction in class actions where the aggregate amount in c ontroversy of all individual claims exceeds 2 million and any member of the putative plaintiff class is citizen of state different from any defendant this section excepts actions where 1 substantial majority of the proposed plaintiffs and the primary defendants are citizen s of the state where the case was filed 2 the primary defendants are states or state offi cials or 3 the proposed plaintiff class has fewer than 100 members hr 2341 and s 1712 also deems socalled private attorney general actions and cases involving claims of more than 100 people with common questions of law or fact to be class actions for purposes of federal jurisdiction and removal 3hr 2341 and s 1712 removal provision allows any defendant or absent class member to remove class action to federal court if section 1332 is satisfied regardless of whether defendant is citizen of the state where the action was filed and without the consent of other defendants or class members 4the bill of rights portion of the proposed legislation requires hearing and written findings before court

valuable to our legal system 2 abuses of the class acti on process that injure both plaintiffs and defendants ie plaintiffs lawyers receiving large fees while class members are left with coupons or other awards of little or value unjustified rewards being made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members and the publication of confusing notices that prevent class memb ers from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights 3 the impact of interstate class actions on principles of federalism through the use of artful pleading thereby permitting the plaintiffs to avoid litigating class actions in federal court and forcing businesses and other organizations to defend inte rstate class action lawsuits in county and state courts where i the lawyer rather than the claimants is likely to receive the maximum benefit ii less scrutiny may be given to the merits of the case and iii defendants are effectively forced into settlements in order to avoid the possibility of huge judgments that could destabilize their companies and 4 the cost that these suits impose on the national economy section 3 consumer class action bill of rights and improved procedures for interstate class actions this section would add seven new sections to 28 usc which are intended to provide greater pr otections for class members in particular sec tion 3 would add the following section 1711judicial scrutiny of co upon and other noncash settlements this provision is aimed at certain pr oposed settlements of class actions in which the plaintiffs lawyer and the defe ndant work out settlement that provides class members with essentia lly valueless coupons while rewarding the lawyers with substantial attorneys fees to address this problem this section provides that judge may approve proposed settlement under which the class members would receive noncash benefits or would otherwise be required to expend funds in order to obtain part or all of the pr oposed benefits only after h earing to determine whether and making written finding that the settlement is fair reasonable and adequate for class members section 1712protection against loss by class members

members of the class are located closer to the courthouse in which the settle ment is filed section 1714prohibition on the payment of bounties this provision provides that class action may not be settled on terms that award special and disproporti onate bounties to the named class representatives class representative will however be able to be compensated for his reasonable time or costs that were required to be expended in fulfilling his obligations as class representative the payment of bounties give s the class representatives share of the damages award that is dispr oportionately larger than that provided to absent class members section 1715clearer and simpler settlement information this provision provides that class notices should present information in plain english the notices must be designed to attract the attention of class members by stating at the outset in 18point type that the recipient is plaintiff in class action lawsuit and has legal rights that are affected by the settlement described in the notice in addition the notice must offer the subject matter of the class action b the members of the class c the legal consequences of being member of the

notice include the authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over defendant in any state in which any member of the class resides section 1717sunshine in court records hr 2341 only this provision precludes courts from sea ling the records of class actions or making them subject to protective order unless the order is narrowly tailored in the public interest consistent with the protecti on of

actionthe term is defined to include any civ il action filed in federal district court under rule 23 of the federa l rules of civil procedure as well as actions filed under similar rules in state c

members in proposed or certified class action 3 class membersthe term is defined as the persons who fall within the definition of the proposed or certified class action 4 plaintiff class actionthe term is fined as class action in which class members are plaintiffs 5 proposed settlementthe term is defined as an agreement that resolves claims in class action that is subject to court approval and
