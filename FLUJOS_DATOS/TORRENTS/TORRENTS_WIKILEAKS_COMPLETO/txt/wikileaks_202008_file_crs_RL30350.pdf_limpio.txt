congress beginning in mid1997 much of this activity occurred in the house which early in november 1997 passed package of chinarelated bills by wide margin some of these provisions were also included in senate bills and eventually were enacted into law the clinton administration opposed many of these measures not only for policy reasons but because administration was planning the resumption of uschina summitry late in 1997 in october 1997 president jiang zemin became the first chinese leader to visit washington since 1985 in june 1998 president clinton became the first democratic us president to visit china the number and diversity of chinarelated bills in the 105th congress suggested that significant divisions remained both within the congress and between congress and the administration about the direction of us china policy in addition the stage was set for further consideration of china issues early in the 106th congress with the passage of hres 463 which created select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic of china the select committees initial mission was to investigate allegations that us company loral space and communications may have provided china with sensitive information in 1996 capable of improving chinas missile launch capabilities later the select committee expanded its inquiries to include allegations of longterm chinese espionage at us nuclear science labs the select committee released classified version of its findings in february 1999 as in past congresses members offered legislation protesting aspects of chinas human rights record including bills dealing with prison labor exports coercive abortion practices and religious intolerance congress also considered bills relating to taiwan in particular about taiwans entry into the world trade organization wto and about the us role in helping taiwan in its national defense and relating to chinas missile proliferation activities technology transfer issues radio free asia broadcasting to china and us support for multilateral development bank loans to china several multipleissue bills such as the foreign relations and defense authorization acts combined some or even most of these issues finally congress again considered joint resolutions to disapprove chinas mostfavored nation or normal trading status mfnntr ultimately rejecting the measures in both sessions in general the legislation the 105th congress considered on china offered one of two approaches either an assertive sanctionoriented approach to china requiring punitive us actions or less punitive approach that while targeting many of the same issues leaned more heavily on senseofcongress language in the house many harsher measures were toned down in committee consideration while new punitive measures were sometimes introduced to replace them in addition the senate attached some of the language contained in the house bills to more comprehensive authorizations and appropriations bills httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350contents introduction 1 policy trends and legislative initiatives 4 human rights measures 6 sres

1999china and the 105th congress policy issues and legislation 19971998 introduction1 for host of assorted reasons and despite extensive investment and trade linkages uschina relations have remained troubled in the 1990s to great extent the stage for bilateral tensions was set by the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown from which china has never been rehabilitated in american eyes against this backdrop us and chinese policymakers have clashed repeatedly over human rights violations nonproliferation questions and economic issues relations reached one low point in 199596 when taiwan problem long thought to have been resolved by 1982 uschina communique reemerged as major bilateral issue the swiftness and severity of that crisis which included livefire chinese missile tests in the taiwan strait and the deployment of two american carrier battle groups to the area appeared to take policymakers in both capitals by surprise in response to the taiwan crisis both governments undertook policy reassessments in efforts to put the relationship back on track as part of that effort presidential summitry resumed having been effectively suspended since president bushs trip to china in 1989 in october 1997 president jiang zemin became the first chinese leader to visit washington since 1985 in june 1998 president clinton became the first democratic us president to visit china at the same time the relationship was beset by new troubles specially formed select committee in congress spent much of 19971998 investigating allegations that china had conducted espionage at us nuclear science labs and had acquired illegally from us companies sensitive informati on capable of improving chinese missilelaunch capabilities2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350crs2 3on july 9 1998 congress cleared for the presidents signature hr 2676 the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act hrept 105599 that act contained provision replacing the term mostfavorednation status mfn with the term normal trade relations ntr the intent of the provision enacted as pl 105206 was to reinforce that this trade status was not special or preferential trade status but simply the normal status that the united states gives to all but handful of its trading partners tensions in uschina relations have been paralleled by tensions within us policy circles both within the executive branch and between members of congress and the white house over the direction of us policy toward china while there has been general agreement in us policy circles that washington should use its influence to have beijing conform to international norms and to foster political and economic change in china there has been little agreement in washington on how the united states should achieve these objectives both the bush and clinton administrations have stressed policies of engagement with china and congressional critics of this approach have sought consistently to pressure the white house to take firmer more sanctionsoriente d approach initially in 1990 congress brought this pressure to bear largely through the vehicle of annual renewal of chinas mostfavorednation mfn treatment either by voting to withdraw chinas mfn status or by placing further conditions on it3 in subsequent years members placed increasing emphasis on diverse and separate initiatives that have implications for uschina relations including initiatives on human rights nonproliferation trade taiwan and others many of these initiatives resurfaced in the 105th congress either as renewed attempts to enact past measures or as refinements of previously enacted ones in addition the 105th congress considered several new initiatives in general american policymakers continued to use combination of three approaches to influence us china policy with little indication as to which approach will ultimately prevail first is moderate engaged and less confrontational posture toward china favored by many in the clinton administration congress and elsewhere some favoring this approach are impressed with chinas growing economic and national strength and the opportunities this provides for the united states they promote us engagement with china as the most appropriate way to guide the newly emerging power into international activities compatible with us interests underlying this approach generally is belief that trends in china are moving inexorably in the right direction that is china is becoming increasingly interdependent economically with its neighbors and the developed countries of the west and is increasingly unlikely to take disruptive action that would upset these advantageous international economic relationships therefore according to this view us policy should emphasize working more closely with china in order to encourage what are seen as positive longterm trends second approach encourages us leaders to be less accommodating according to this approach rather than trying to persuade beijing of the advantages of international cooperation the united states should keep military forces as counter weight to rising chinese power in asia deal firmly with economic arms proliferation and other disputes with china and work closely with traditional us allies and friends along chinas periphery in order to deal with assertiveness orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350crs3 disruption from beijing proponents of this approach stress that beijing officials still view the world as statecentered competitive environment where interdependence counts for little chinas leaders are seen as determined to use all available means to increase chinas wealth and power conforming to many international norms as china builds economic strength once china succeeds with economic modernization according to this perspective chinese leaders will be disinclined to sacrifice national ambitions to international interdependence or other concerns third approach is based on the premise that the political system in china needs to be changed before the united states has any real hope of reaching constructive relationship with china proponents of this approach believe beijings communist leaders are inherently incapable of longterm positive ties with the united states us policy should focus on mechanisms to change china from within while maintaining vigilant posture to deal with disruptive chinese foreign policy actions in asian and world affairs while the clinton administration has favored the engaged approach all three approaches have their advocates within the us policy community in the 105th congress of 19971998 debate over the appropriate policy approach resulted in proliferation of legislatio n relating to china some of which were enacted into law many believe that this more legislatively active trend on china issues is likely to continue into the 106th congress and beyond httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350crs4 policy trends and legislative initiatives several broad and overlapping trends affected the us policy process on china during the 105th congress in 19971998 these trends illustrated that despite number of efforts to bring improvements to bilateral relations the process of making us policy decisions involvin g china is still characterized by incongruity and disagreement in retrospect much about the uschina relationship at the beginning of 1997 seemed destined to improve its prospects the congressional debate over chinas mostfavorednation mfn status appeared likely to be minimal and relatively congenial as it had been in 1996 american policymakers spent the first half of 1997 focusing on hong kongs reversion to china which occurred smoothly on july 1 1997 easing us and international fears about chinas potential intervention in hong kong in the future the death of chinas paramount leader deng xiaoping in april 1997 was uneventful contrary to some expectations that it would result in destabilizing political infighting chinas decision not to devalue its own currency as the asian financial crisis unfolded was viewed as helpful and responsible act and was welcomed by the united states throughout 1997 administration officials appeared increasingly convinced that china had assigned high priority to good relations with the united states us officials also believed that china had made important shifts in its willingness to abide by international agreements such as deciding to minimize its nuclear cooperation with iran consequently when chinese president jiang zemin came to washington for the first uschina summit in ten years on october 27 1997 president clinton announced that he was prepared to move forward on range of bilateral issues in the coming months including initiating us nuclear energy cooperation with china under the terms of neverimplemented 1985 bilateral agreement nevertheless having finally begun to move forward with more comprehensive china policy the clinton administration in 1997 found its effectiveness in pursuing that policy hampered by number of domestic controversies that surfaced in 1997 and intensified into 1998 the state department report on human rights that was released january 30 1997 accused china of silencing virtually all public dissent in 1996 through intimidation exile imposition of prison terms administrative detention or house arrest in the face of this report some members of congress were unimpressed by chinas october 1997 summit decision to sign the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights something administration officials considered sign of chinas improved commitment to human rights issues in february 1997 us news sources began reporting that officials of the chinese government and in particular chinese military officials had made illegal contributions to us political campaigns in the 1996 elections congress began investigati ng these allegations and later expanded that investigation to include whether any such campaign contributions if they occurred had influenced decisions the clinton adminis tration made about china pressure on the administration increased in april 1998 when it was revealed that space systems loral us aerospace company may have illegally transferred sensitive information to china inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350crs5 4in response to nuclear tests by india earlier in the month pakistan detonated 5 nuclear devices on may 28 1998 for years china had been suspected of clandestinely helping pakistan in its nuclear weapons program 5the text of the shanghai roundtable discussion of june 30 1998 can be found at httpwwwwhitehousegovwhnewchinaspeecheshtml for additional information on the socalled onechina policy see crs report rl30341 chinataiwan evolution of the onechina policy by shirley kan 1996 concerning missile guidance and control systems additional pressure came from critics who believed that chinese assistance was key factor in pakistans sudden emergence as confirmed nuclear power4 because of these continuing controversies the house late in 1997 passed series of chinarelated bills unrelated to mfn status and congressional critics continued to target the clinton administra tions policy of engagement with china pressuring the white house to take firmer more sanctionsoriented approach it was in this atmosphere of controversy that the president made his planned summit visit to china from june 25july 3 1998 the summit got mixed reviews members of congress criticized the president for agreeing to be received in tiananmen square the site of chinas 1989 bloody military crackdown for the official welcoming ceremony some criticized the summit as lacking in substance others were pleased by the unprecedented live coverage that chinese television and radio gave to several presidential appearances including joint press conference between clinton and chinese leader jiang zemin where the president was able to speak directly to the chinese people about us human rights concerns the most controversial moment of the 1998 summit came at roundtable discussion in shanghai when the president made statement about us policy toward taiwan that the united states did not support independence for taiwan did not support twochina policy and did not believe taiwan should be member of international organizations where statehood is prerequisite the statement was criticized by some in the united states as significant departure from past policy5 as result legislation involving taiwan and us policy became features of activity late in the 105th congress in both 1997 and 1998 the annual divisive congressional debate over extending chinas mfn status ended as it had in previous years joint resolutions that would have ended chinas mfn status hjres 79 and hjres 121 respectively were defeated in the house by wide margins making senate consideration moot also as in past years critics of chinas human rights and proliferation policies turned to alternatives to mfn introducing measures that would have more selectively targeted sanctions and other punitive policies several new factors also characterized the debate on china in the 105th congress first significant emphasis was placed on chinas intolerance for many religious practices supported by several conservative religious groups the concern about religious freedom led to several freestanding bills dealing with this aspect of chinese policy alone second sharp differences occurred within each party on many major policy issues leading to differing approaches toward china among members seekinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30350crs6 legislative alternatives to the mfn vehicle and third congressional attention during the second session focused on allegations involving comprises in us national security one of these involved charges that two us aerospace companies had transferred sensitive technologies to china in the course of their commercial activities there and that us national security had been damaged both by these transfers and by us government decisions to loosen hightech export restrictions second involved allegations of chinese espionage in us nuclear science labs among the chinarelated measures introduced in the 105th congress was package of 9 bills all critical of china which the house considered under one rule hres 302 beginnin g on november 5 1997 these measures as well as others are described below the public law number is indicated for those measures that were enacted human rights measures chinas human rights abuses have been among the most visible and constant points of contention in uschina relations since the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown early in his term president clinton had supported linking chinas most favoredna tion mfn status with its human rights performance and in 1993 executive order spelled out the human rights conditions china would have to meet by may 26 1994 the president had decided to delink human rights from chinas mfn status saying that the united states had reached the end of the usefulness of that policy chinas human rights record since then has presented mixed picture with both setbacks and minor improvements providing plenty of ammunition for policy debate sres 187hres 364 the commission on human rights early in 1998 us officials let it be known that the united states would not introduce resolution critical of chinas human rights practices at the annual geneva meeting of the commission on human rights even though the united states had introduced such resolution in previous years as result on march 3 1998 senator connie mack introduced sres 187 measure urging the united states to introduce human rights resolution at the annual meeting in 1998 the senate foreign relations
