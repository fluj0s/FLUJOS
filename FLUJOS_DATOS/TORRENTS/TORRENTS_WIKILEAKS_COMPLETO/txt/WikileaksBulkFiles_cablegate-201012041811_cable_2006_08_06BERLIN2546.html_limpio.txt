to go opinion polls and political commentators and contacts all say berlins september 17 election of new parliament is the spds to lose the social democrats lead the christian democrats by over ten percent in all polls and the ratings gap between the two parties candidates for mayor is even greater real interest is already focusing on whom the spd will chose as coalition partner the left partypds with which the spd now governs the city or the green party the election which is expected in essence to confirm berlins left of center majority will have immediate national political implications however mayor wowereit has signaled his interest in playing role in national spd politics in the future because of the predicted low turnout concerns have been expressed by some observers that parties of the farright will gain seats in some of berlins district assemblies end summary the campaign spd in charge cdu in tatters 2 c the state of berlin leaves much to be desired the weak school system has been the subject of steady drumbeat of critical headlines for months the business climate is at best stagnant and highprofile departures or attempted departures of big employers are an issue the citys enormous debt continues to grow steadily and is now at 60 billion euros nonetheless support for the spd remains strong at 3035 percent ahead of the 29 percent taken in 2001 and mayor wowereit is genuinely popular cdu xxxxx admits that the cdus lead candidate friedbert pflueger simply cannot match wowereit for charisma and campaign skills moreover the berlin cdu has been damaged by 1 years of infighting and tension between modernizers in the party including pflueger and oldschool conservatives and 2 the lingering effects of banking scandal that drove it from office in 2001 pflueger from lower saxony also suffers from carpetbagger image his lastminute announcement that he would give up his bundestag membership and defense ministry state secretaryship to concentrate on berlin has not helped the cdu has been hovering at around 20 percent in polls since even before the campaign began 3 c cdu and spd contacts agree that the turnout for the election will likely be very low spd berlin business manager ruediger scholz fears this could hurt the spd more than the cdu and so the party intends to focus on getting its core supporters to the polls in the final weeks of the campaign scholz points out that low turnout is likely to benefit smaller parties with more ideological voters meaning the farleft wasg and the farright npd and republicans he and most other interlocutors seem to expect that the farright will win seats in the district assemblies in at least some of berlins eastern districts while the wasg could win seats in kreuzbergfriedrichshain the threshold for entry is winning only three percent of district votes neither farright nor farleft is given any chance of clearing the five percent threshold for entry into the state parliament coalition politics 4 c the left partypds according to berlin leader klaus lederer cannot expect repeat of its 23 percent performance in 2001 that showing was the result of the banking scandal which briefly tarred the spd as well as cdu and the star quality of thenpds lead candidate gregor gysi now fully occupied in the bundestag polls put the lppds at around 15 percent which is where the greens also stand thus either party could be plausible partner for the spd mayor wowereit has stated his desire to remain in government with the lppds though the two parties have not concluded formal electoral alliance the spds scholz green berlin caucus leader sibyll klotz and berlin fdp leader markus loening all agree that the lppds would make the more comfortable partner for wowereit because of the ease of their cooperation thus far and because keeping the lppds in government defuses large bloc of voters who could be mobilized easily to protest the cuts and privatizations which the government has used to try and recover control of the budget however scholz notes that it would probably be better for the city and for wowereit given his political ambitions if he were to form coalition with the greens who are more centrist especially on finance and at the federal level presentable green state parliament member oezcan mutlu argued strongly that wowereit will opt for the greens based on these considerations though he acknowledged that working with the greens would be harder he even said that given green fractiousness they would have to bring 78 seat majority into coalition to make it stable 5 c if the numbers did not work out for twoparty coalition and all our contacts reject the idea of grand coalition then the most likely option seems to be an spdlppdsgreen alliance however some in the fdp now at 89 percent in polls hope that in such situation they might have chance of sidling into power berlin fdp lead candidate martin lindner and loening have told us that they believe the greens would rather work with them than the lppds this seems quite long shot though as berlin greens stand quite far to the left in the green spectrum comment 6 c the berlin election is unlikely to have major national significance under any circumstances the grand coalition recognizes this and unlike in the period before the spring elections in badenwuerttemberg rhinelandpalatinate and saxonyanhalt is not postponing debate on contentious issues however in two aspects the elections are noteworthy first victory will boost klaus wowereits chance of playing greater role in the spd nationally especially as he is seen as standardbearer for the party left second even very localized success by the farright will provoke comment and measure of consternation and signal that the particular problem posed by farrightist ideologues in eastern germany remains to be resolved end comment koenig
