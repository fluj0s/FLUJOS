grow act of 2005 hr 3304 kathleen romig analyst in social security domestic social policy division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278 summary hr 3304 would establish voluntary individual accounts called grow accounts as part of social security it would also reduce the traditional social security benefits of account owners if accounts are invested in treasury bonds account owners would have combined account payments and reduced social security benefits that are equal to their current law social security benefits if other investment options are offered account owners are expected to receive higher

securitys cash surplus into individual accounts ssas actuaries project similar solvency effects for both plans and nearly identical budgetary effects this report will be updated as events warrant hr 3304 the growing real ownership for workers grow act of 2005 was introduced on july 14 2005 by representative jim mccrery and several cosponsors crs2 this report describes the provisions of the bill it also analyzes the effect of hr 3304 on benefit levels trust fund solvency and the overall unified budget1 finally it compares hr 3304 to s 1302 similar individual accounts plan2 major provisions of hr 3304 account financing currently annual social security tax revenues exceed program costs surplus revenues are credited to the trust funds as treasury bonds which social security can redeem to pay future benefits in other words social securitys surpluses like proceeds from all government bonds become part of the treasurys general fund which can be used for tax cuts spending or repaying debt under hr 3304 bonds equal to social securitys annual cash surplus would be credited to the trust funds as they are under current law general funds equal to this surplus would also be used to fund individual accounts called grow accounts the same money cannot be spent twice so hr 3304 would require new spending account contributions hr 3304 stipulates that workers born in 1950 or after httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278 would be eligible to enroll in accounts starting in 2006 eligible workers would be automatically enrolled workers could opt to disenroll once those who disenroll could reenroll once social security benefits would not change for people born before 1950 the ssa actuaries estimate that each account would be credited with 222 of its owners taxable earnings in 2006 declining to 022 in 2016 after which the actuaries project more surpluses3 at that time contributions would cease though interest would continue to accumulate in the accounts in the case of divorce before retirement account contributions made during marriage of year or more as well as earnings on those contributions would be divided equally between spouses account administration and investment the president would appoint sevenmember board to oversee grow account administration between 2006 and 2009 all account assets would be collectively invested in marketable treasury bond fund the board would develop plan to expand investment options in 2009 and congress would have 90 days to disapprove it before it took effect 1 for hr 3304 benefit and solvency analysis is based on the social security administration memorandum to reps mccrery shaw johnson ryan and shadegg from stephen c goss chief actuary and alice h wade deputy chief actuary estimated financial effects of the growing real ownership for workers act of 2005 hr 3304 july 15 2005 at httpwwwssagovoactsolvencymccrery_20050715pdf budgetary analysis is based on congressional budget office memorandum to sen max baucus from director douglas holtz eakin hr 3304 growing real ownership for workers act of 2005 sept 13 2005 at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs66xxdoc66450913baucusletterpdf 2 the analysis of s 1302 is based on the social security administration memorandum to sen jim demint from stephen c goss chief actuary and alice h wade deputy chief actuary estimated financial effects of proposal to finance individual accounts with the oasdi cash flow surplus june 23 2005 at httpwwwssagovoactsolvencydemint_20050623pdf 3 taxable earnings are all earnings covered by social security up to the taxable maximum which increases annually by average wage growth in 2005 the taxable maximum is 90000 crs3 grow account owners would be assessed up to 03 of account assets each year in administrative costs during the first five years general funds would cover any administrative costs above this amount social securitys actuaries project that the treasury bond fund would yield average annual returns of 30 over inflation ie real or 27 after administrative costs they project that diversified portfolio if offered would earn average annual real returns of 49 or 46 after administrative costs4 benefit offset the social security retirement benefits of workers who contribute to grow accounts would be reduced using benefit offset the total benefit offset would be equal to workers grow account balance if it had been invested only in the treasury bond fund at retirement the total benefit offset would be converted into lifetime inflationadjusted monthly amount called an annuity this monthly offset would be subtracted from participants social security benefits5 because preretirement account access would not be permitted offsets would not be deducted from nonretirement benefits such as disability and young survivor benefits if an account owners monthly offset were larger than his or her social security benefit the remaining offset would be deducted from the benefits paid to the owners httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278 spouse if the account holder is married at retirement for example if married mans monthly offset exceeds his social security benefit his wifes social security benefit would be subject to two offsets 1 an offset based on her contributions to her own account if any and 2 an offset based her husbands contributions to his account account distributions workers could access their grow accounts when they begin to collect oldage benefits including spousal and survivor benefits and benefits for disabled workers whose disability benefits convert to retirement benefits when they reach full retirement age preretirement account access would not be permitted workers not eligible for traditional social security benefits ie those with less than 10 years of work covered by social security could access their accounts at their full retirement age at retirement workers would be required to make withdrawals from their accounts in the form of inflationindexed annuities so that their monthly annuity payments combined with their reduced social security benefits were at least equal to the federal poverty level any remaining account balance could be withdrawn as the worker chooses there would be one exception to the povertylevel annuitization requirement beneficiaries whose combined benefits and annuities would be below the poverty level would not have to annuitize married grow account owners would be required to purchase joint and twothirds survivor annuities with their entire account balances unless both spouses consent to another arrangement joint and twothirds survivor annuity provides monthly payments to its owner for life then twothirds of the owners payment to survivor beneficiary grow accounts can be inherited when their owners die when married workers die before retirement their surviving spouses would inherit their grow account balances which would count toward their surviving spouses offsets when married workers die 4 the actuaries assumed 50 stock 25 corporate bond and 25 treasury bond portfolio 5 in hr 3304 the total benefit offset is called benchmark account the monthly offset is called an excess grow account credit crs4 after retirement their surviving spouses would inherit the balance of their grow account balances if any andor the survivor payment from joint annuity if one was purchased the surviving spouses benefits would also be reduced by an offset twothirds the size of the deceased spouses offset when unmarried account owners die their accounts would be inherited by person they designate or in the absence of designated heir by their next of kin these heirs would not be subject to offsets based on the inherited accounts analysis of the grow accounts plan benefit impact under hr 3304 account owners would receive their individual account assets as well as reduced ie offset social security benefits only the offset would directly affect the way traditional social security benefits are calculated the following section compares current law social security benefits to projected payments from grow accounts and reduced traditional benefits under hr 3304 table 1 annual grow account

congressional research service note these estimates assume that stocks and bonds earn constant rates of return ie the same rates every year in practice the rates of return on stocks and bonds vary over time table 1 above shows estimated annual grow account contribution rates as percent of taxable earnings annual grow contribution amounts cumulative grow account balances and cumulative offsets in real 2005 dollars these estimates use the ssa actuaries projections for hr 3304 and the actuaries scaled medium earnings crs5 pattern6 the worker in this example is assumed to be born in 1985 to begin work in 2006 to earn average lifetime wages to have average patterns of work and earnings and to retire at age 65 in 2050 the grow account accumulation column shows the expected cumulative balance of the account if additional investment options are offered in 2009 and the account is diversified at that time if the worker invests only in the treasury bond fund the cumulative balance would be the same as what is shown in the offset accumulation column only the value would be positive people who invest their accounts in the treasury bond fund and purchase annuities with their entire accounts would receive combined monthly payments under hr 3304 that are equal to their current law social security benefits since their grow annuity payments and the reduction to their benefits would be equal if the worker in the example invested only in the treasury bond fund his or her grow account would contain an estimated 10298 at retirement this sum could be used to buy an inflationadjusted singlelife annuity of 62 month the workers benefit offset would reduce his or her social security benefit by 62 so the combination of reduced benefits and annuity payments under hr 3304 would be equal to current law social security benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278 if account owners had investment choices beyond the treasury bond fund and opted to diversify their accounts their retirement payments would depend on the returns those investments earn stocks and corporate bonds have higher average returns than treasury bonds but also greater risk if participants average returns were greater than the treasury bond rate his or her combined payments under hr 3304 would be greater than current law benefits if average returns were less than the treasury bond rate his or her combined payments would be lower the bill has minimum benefit guarantee if additional investment options were offered in 2009 ssas actuaries project that workers would have higher combined payments on average if worker chose the diversified portfolio used in the actuaries projections the account would contain an estimated 20817 at retirement this sum could be used to purchase an inflation adjusted singlelife annuity that pays 126 month the workers benefit offset would reduce his or her social security benefit by 62 month leaving the worker with combined monthly payment under hr 3304 that is 64 greater than current law benefits solvency impact under current law ssas actuaries project that the social security trust funds will not be able to pay the full amount of scheduled benefits after 2041 under hr 3304 the actuaries estimate that the trust funds will be solvent through 20437 this improvement is due to the general fund transfers to grow accounts which would reduce the trust funds obligation to pay benefits since offsets are based on account contributions two additional years of trust fund solvency would allow some future beneficiaries to receive fully scheduled benefits for two more years than they would have in the absence of any changes to social security 6 social security administration office of the chief actuary actuarial note 20043 scaled factors for hypothetical earnings examples under the 2004 trustees report assumptions by michael clingman and orlo nichols dec 2004 at httpwwwssagovoactnotes ran3an20043pdf 7 the actuaries project 75year trust fund deficit of 192 of taxable payroll under current law and estimate that hr 3304 would decrease this gap by 023 to 024 of taxable payroll crs6 unified budget impact the unified budget is the total federal budget including the social security trust funds hr 3304 would not change the transfers from the trust funds to the general fund however to fund grow accounts on top of the existing trust funds the government must raise taxes cut spending andor borrow thus adding to annual deficits and the national debt since hr 3304 would not raise taxes or cut spending grow accounts would likely be funded through borrowing cbo estimates that from 2006 to 2015 hr 3304 would increase annual budget deficits and the national debt by more than 1 trillion in real terms this estimate includes about 6 billion for administrative costs above those charged to grow accounts and over 200 billion for increased debt service ultimately it is the governments overall fiscal position not the size of the trust funds that will determine whether social security benefits can be paid borrowing to fund grow accounts would reduce the governments fiscal position by increasing the national debt cbo projects that relative to current law the national debt would increase by over 6 of gross domestic product gdp by 2015 and by 24 of gdp by 2080 even if hr 3304 were not debtfinanced the cost of grow accounts would httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278 exceed the savings from the offset for two reasons first offsets would not apply in certain cases such as when unmarried workers die before retirement second fully recouping the cost of the accounts over the long term would require an offset calculated with the treasury bond rate hr 3304 uses the treasury bond rate minus administrative costs that way account owners who invest in the treasury bond fund would receive monthly payments equal to current law as cbo explained in effect the 03 percentage points administrative costs would be paid from the social security trust funds how grow accounts compare to senator demints plan hr 3304 is very similar to s 1302 senator jim demints plan the contribution rates eligibility requirements enrollment rules offset amounts and payout provisions in the plans are nearly identical though s 1302 may offer diversified investments year earlier in 2008 the primary difference is how the accounts are financed under s 1302 surplus social security revenues would go directly into individual accounts the surpluses would not be credited to the social security trust funds as they are under current law and would be under hr 3304 without other changes diverting surpluses into accounts would accelerate the date of insolvency s 1302 would transfer general funds to the trust funds to maintain solvency through 2041 as under current law8 though the source of account funding in s 1302 and hr 3304 is different the amount of funding is the same thus ssas actuaries project that the two plans would have nearly identical effect on the annual budget deficit and the national debt9 however some economists believe that the trust funds mask the true size of annual budget deficits and the national debt so trust fundfinanced accounts like s 1302 might spur policymakers to reduce other spending 8 the actuaries project that s 1302 would narrow the solvency gap by 015 of taxable payroll 9 ssas actuaries project that both hr 3304 and s 1302 would increase annual budget deficits and the national debt by 929 billion in real terms over 10 years and by about 14 trillion in present value terms over 75 years
