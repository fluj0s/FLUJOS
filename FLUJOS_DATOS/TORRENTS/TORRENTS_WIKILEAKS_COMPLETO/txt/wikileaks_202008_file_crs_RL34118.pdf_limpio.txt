but recent legal sc ientific and technological changes are prompting some policy makers to reexamine the law hr 6100s 3040 would amend tsca to reshape risk assessment and management of industrial ch emicals in us commerce tsca regulates potential risks based on three policies 1 chemical manufacturers are responsible for testing chemicals to termine their potential effects on health and the environment 2 epa should regulate chemicals that present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment and 3 epas implementation of the law should not create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovation few have expressed concern about the last tsca purpose but tscas progress in achieving the first two goals has been debated wher some see success others see failure and both groups point to epas history of implementation and voluntary initiatives in support of their views to date epa has compiled an inventory of roughly 82000 chemicals that have been produced in or imported into the united states at some time since 1976 the agency has promulgate d regulations to restrict production or use of five chemicals under tsca recently many states and localities have acted to regulate chemicals not regulated under tsca using state or local authority some large chemical manufacturers processors nd distributors object to the emerging legal patchwork the us congress is considering legislation restricting use of specific chemicals for example s 742 as reported by the nate committee on environment and public works in the 110th congress and hr 6903 as introduced would ban many asbestoscontaining materials from us commerce multinational companies also are faced with variety of national laws restricting international commerce in chemicals international cooperation to harmonize re gulations and to eliminate certain persistent pollutants has led to several international agreements that aim to ease the legal confusion but amendments to tsca would be required if the united states is to fully implement the agreements new laws in other nations also have provided alternative models for chemical regulation which so would prefer to tsca others defend the us approach arguing that tsca is based on sound risk based science recent changes in science and technology pose challenges to epa implementation of tsca scientists now know that the timing and duration of exposure to chemical can determine its eff ects as can the age gender and heritable traits of people who are exposed biot echnology and nanotechnology have created genetically modified organisms and nanom aterials respectively which epa must categorize as existing or new and mana ge as chemical substances under tsca faced with these challenges to tsca some analysts and most in the regulated community nevertheless belie ve that tsca has performed as intended and they support tsca in its current form they praise tsca as flexible efficient and effective limit to overregula tion other legal commentators analysts and some policy makers want to amend tsca because they think that it has not accomplished the tasks laid out for it by congress and is unlikely to do better in the future httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118contents introduction 1 t s c v r v i w1 p l i c i s n d i n t n t 2 c h m i c l t s t i n g 3 p r m n u f c t u r n t i c s n d s i g n i f i c n t n w u s n t i

control act tsca implementation and new challenges introduction recent legal scientific nd technological developmen ts affecting chemicals in us commerce are prompting legislators to reexamine the toxic substances control act of 1976 tsca1 this is change from the situation that prevailed in most of the previous thirty years since it was enacted during that time most legislators have demonstrated little interest in amending the law despite the longstanding concerns of few members the basic tsca provisions in title i have never been amended2 companion bills in the 110th congress hr 6100 and s 3040 would amend tsca to significantly reshape us chemical assessment and management this report provides an ove rview of basic tsca pr ovisions briefly examines the history of tsca implementation by the us environmental protection agency epa and describes the lega l scientific and technologi cal developments that are being used to provide support to calls for tsca reform for

lead and school environments respectively see crs report rl31905 the toxic substances control act summary of the act and its major requirements by lindajo schierow tsca overview federal legislation to regulate us commerce in chemical substances was originally proposed in 1971 by the pres idents council on environmental quality ceq its report toxic substances fined need for comprehensive legislation to identify and control chemicals whose manufacture processing distribution use andor disposal was potentia lly dangerous and not adequa tely regulated under other environmental statutes the house and senate each passed bills in both the 92nd and 93rd congresses in 1972 and 1973 respectively but controversies over the scope of chemical screening prior to commercia l production and distribu tion level of costs and the relationship to other regulatory laws stalled final action episodes of environmental conta mination including contamina tion of the hudson river andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs2 3 tsca section2bother waterways by polychlorinated bipheny ls pcbs the threat of stratospheric ozone depletion from chlorofluorocarbon cfc emissions and contamination of agricultural produce by polybrominated biphe nyls pbbs in the state of michigan together with more exact estimates of the costs of imposing toxic substances controls opened the way for fi nal passage of the legisla tion president ford signed tsca into law on october 11 1976 title i contains the original general provisions of tsca which are the subject of this report policies and intent tsca established three general federal policies with respect to chemical substances and mixtures in us commerce that adequate data should be develope d with respect to the effect of chemical substances and mixtures on health and the environment and that the development of such data should be the res ponsibility of those who manufacture and those who process such chemical substances and mixtures adequate authority should exist to regulate chemical substances andmixtures which present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and to take action with respect to chemical substances and mixtures which are imminent hazards and authority over chemical substances and mixtures should be exercised in such manner as not to impede unduly or create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovati on while fulfilling the primary purpose of this act to assure that such i nnovation and commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures do not presen t an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment3 in addition congress expressed its intent in tsca section2c it is the intent of congress that the ad ministrator shall carry out this act in reasonable and prudent manner and that the administrator shall consider the environmental economic and social im pact of any action the administrator takes or proposes to take under this act the scope of tsca is very broad c overing all chemical substances as defined in section 32 the term chemical substance means any organic or inorganic substance of particular molecular identity including i any combination of such substances oc curring in whole or in part as result of chemical reaction or occurring in nature and ii any element or uncombined radical the law excludes from this definition substances that are otherwise regulated such as mixtures pesticides tobacco nuclear material substances subject to certain taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs3 4 the potential chemical universe the

2007 the chemical abstract service had indexed more than 30 million organic and inorganic chemi cals 12 million of which it classifies as in commerce worldwide although it is not clear how this num ber is determined and it is much larger than would be expected based on the numbers in national inventories roughly 245000 chemicals are regulated or inventoried http

food drug and cosmetic act chemical testing to attain these policy goals tsca s ection 4 directs epa to require chemical manufacturers and processors to conduct tests for existing chemicals if 1 the manufacture distribution processing use or disposal of the ch emical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment or 2 the chemical is produced in very large volume and there is potential for substantial quantity to be released into the environment or for s ubstantial or significant human exposure under either condition epa must issue rule requiring tests known as test rule if existing data are insufficient and b testing is necessary to develop the data because there were roughly 61000 chemi cals covered by tsca and in us commerce at the time epa was to begin developing test rules congress established special interagency committee to help epa determine which chemicals should be considered first and to coordinate sting needs and efforts among government agencies4 at least every six months the interagency testing committee itc must consider candidate chemicals for inclusion on list of substances that the itc recommends to epa for development and promulgation of test rules5 tsca directs the itc to designate subset of chemicals for epa action within 12 months in response to new listing on this priority sting list of chemicals designated for testing epa is required to publish federal register notice within 12 months either to propose test rule or to provide reasons for not doing so6 the priority testing list can contain more than 50 designated chemicals at any time epa also is authorized under tsca sec tion 8 to collect existing information about chemicals to help evaluate the potentia l risks of exposure section 8a allows epa to issue rules requiring record k eeping and reports by manufacturers and importers for specified chemicals required elements of such reports may include the chemical identity molecular structur and names categories of use amount manufactured or processed and expected to be manufactured or processed description of any byproducts existing envi ronmental and health effect data number of individuals exposed occupationally nd duration of exposure and the manner of its disposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs4 7 exemptions are authorized at tsca 5h 5i and 12 for epa interpretations of these authorities see 40 cfr 72030 72036 and 72038 and 723tsca section 8c requires chemical manufacturers processors and distributors to maintain records of signi ficant adverse reactions to health or the environment alleged to have been caused by the substance or mixture all records must be maintained for five years and r ecords of employee allegations must be kept for 30 years under section 8d epa must require that manufacturers submit lists of unpublished health and sa fety studies known to have been conducted and copies of such studies finally section 8e requires that any commercial chemical manufacturer processor or distributor who has information that reasonably supports the conclusion that such substance or mixture presents substantial risk of injury to health or the environment must immediately inform epa other data may be collected through fede ral research programs tsca section 10 directs epa to conduct nd coordinate among fede ral agencies research development and monitoring that is necessa ry to the purposes of the act in addition tsca section 27 authorizes research and velopment of test methods for chemicals by the public health servi ce in cooperation with epa premanufacture notices and significant new use notices epa also is required to prevent future risks through premanufacture screening and regulatory tracking of new chemical products section 5 of tsca requires manufacturers importers and processors to notify epa at least 90 days prior to producing or otherwise introducing new ch emical product into the united states at the same time those submitting premanufacture notice pmn also must submit any information or test data that are known to reasonably ascertainable by or in possession of the notifier and that might be useful to epa in evaluating the chemicals potential adverse effects on human health or the environment exemptions from these requirements are provided or allowed upon application under certain circumstances7 for existing chemicals similar notification procedure may be required if the administrator has determined by rule that new uses of particular chemical may produce significant changes in human and environmental exposures and therefore require notification the 90day notice required by significant new use rule snur provides epa with the opportunity to evaluate the chemical use and if necessary to prohibit or limit such activity before it occurs to prevent unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment epa has 90 days after notification or up to 180 days if it extends the period for good cause to evaluate the potential risk posed by the chemical that is the subject of pmn or snur if epa determines that there is reasonable basis to conclude that the substance presents or will present an unreasonable risk the administrator must promulgate requirements to protect adequately against such risk epa may determine that the proposed activ ity related to chemical may present an unreasonable risk based on the available scientific evidence with respect tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs5 potential for exposure and adverse effects or when data exist to document such effects on what is known about the eff ects of chemicals with similar chemical structures the latter method known as stru ctureactivity relations hip analysis often is used to screen new chemicals if data are inadequate to make an info rmed judgment about inherent hazard and potential for exposure and 1 manufacture processing distribution in commerce use or disposal may pr esent an unreasonable risk or 2 chemical is to be produced in substantial quantities and the potential for environmental release or human exposure is substantial or significant ep may issue proposed order to prohibit or limit such activities until sufficient data are submitted although the legislative history of tsca includes presumption that testing of new products would take place before they we re widely used either as the chemical was developed or as its mark ets grew tsca forbids prom ulgation of blanket testing requirements for all new chemicals th is prohibition arose due to concern that uniform testing requirements mig ht stifle innovation in the chemical industry thus epa must decide which chemicals or categories of chemicals warrant the costs of testing regulatory controls for hazardous chemicals tsca section 6 requires epa to c ontrol unreasonable risks from existing chemicals when they become known under tsca section 4f if epa receives test data in response to test rule or in c onnection with pmn or snur or any other information that indicates there may be reasonable basis to conclude that chemical substance or mixture presents or will present significant risk of serious or widespread harm to human beings from cancer gene mutations or birth defects within 180 days of receiving such inform ation epa is required to initiate action to prevent or reduce that risk or to publish finding that such risk is not unreasonable the decision to publish finding and not to initiate rulemaking is subject to judicial review the law directs epa to regulate manuf acturing processing distribution in commerce use or disposal under tsca if chemical poses an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and the risk cannot be reduced to sufficient degree under another federal law administe red by epa alternatively tsca section 9 allows epa to refer cases of chemical risk to other federal agencies that have the authority to prevent or reduce th risk tsca section 6 provides various regulatory alternatives epa has authority to prohibit or limit the amount of pr oduction or dist ribution of substance in commerce prohibit or limit the production or di stribution of substance for particular use limit the volume or concentration of the chemical produced prohibit or regulate the manne r or method of commercial use require warning labels andor instructions on containers or products require notification of the risk of injury to distributors and to the extent possible consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs6 require recordkeeping by producers specify disposal methods and require replacement or repurchase of products already distributed epa also may impose any of these requirements in combination or for specific geographical region however epa is requi red by tsca to regulate only to the extent necessary to protect adequately against risk and to use the least burdensome regulatory approach in controlling unreasonable risks chemical production inventory section 8b of tsca requires epa to gather and disseminate information about chemical production use and possible adve rse effects to human health and the environment it directs epa to develop nd maintain an inventory of all chemicals or categories of chemicals manufactured or processed for commercial purposes in the united states to aid epa in its duties under tsca the agency was granted considerable authority to collect information from indus tries epa may re quire maintenance of records and reporting of chemical identities names and molecular structures categories of use amounts manufactured and processed for each category of use descriptions of byproducts resulting from ma nufacture processing use and disposal environmental and health effects num ber of individuals exposed number of employees exposed

of such information generally is not permitted except to other federal employees or when necessary to protect health or the environment howeve r data from health and safety studies of chemicals is not protected from disclosure unless it would reveal chemical process or chemical proportion in mixture wrong ful disclosure of confidential data by federal employees may result in criminal penalties role of the states all of the mandates in title i are federal there is provision for authorizing state programs to implement title i provisions neither does tsca provide special access for state officials to confidential business information that is reported to epa tsca section 18a does not allow state or local law to remain in effect if it restricts the use of chemi cal for which epa has promul gated rule or order under section 5 or 6 if the federal rule is intended to protect against risk of injury to health or the environment state or local w is permitted only if it is identical to the federal requirement dopted under another federal law or prohibits the use of such substance or mixture within the relevant jurisdiction except use in manufacture or processing of other substances tsca section 18b allows states or localities to petition epa to issue rule exempting state or local law if compliance would not cause violation of federal law it provides significantly higher degree of

and chemicals that would enter commerce after enactment of tsca the first version of the inventory of existing chemicals was compiled under tsca section 8b between 1978 and 1979 it identified approximately 61000 chemicals10 that manufacturers and importers reported had been produced in or imported into the ited states for commercial purposes after january 1 197511 this included naturally occurring as well as synthetic chemicalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs8 12 although noc technically means the chemi cal has entered commerce in fact it may or may not ever be marketed according to

inventory generally because they were reported in error and were not being pr oduced commercially epa does not list chemicals if they are only produced in small quantities for purposes of experimentation or researc h as of september 2006 ep estimated that there were 82700 chemical substances on the inventory meaning that they had at least for while been in us commerce after 197614 included in this number were 50200 organic substances that are not pol ymers 29500 polymers and 3200 i norganic chemical substances15 16 beginning in 1986 and every four years thereafter epa has

inventory updates issued under tsca section 8a changing the frequenc of future updates to once every five years19 epa also amended the inventory update rule to require reporting for inorganic chemicals for which reporting has not been required in recent years and to raise the threshold for chemical production volume that triggers reporting20 the new rule requires reports from roughly 3000 facilities that produce more than 25000 pounds as opposed to the old level of 10000 pounds of chemical per year21 in addition information about the current us and exposures of chemicals will be required from facilities that produced or imported more than 300000 pounds of chemical per year22 review and management of new chemicals all chemicals not on the tsca chemical inventory are by

estimate physicalchemical properties environmental fate and human and environmental effects associated with more than 55 classes of chemicals27 these models are based on relationships the agency has observed between molecular structures and properties of chemicals that determine their impact on the environment and human health such models usually are referred to as structureactivity relationships sars or sometimes quantitative structureactivity relationships qsars as of september 30 2005 epa repor ted it had taken 3899 re gulatory or voluntary actions to gather data or restrict use of roughly 10 of all pmns28 epa issued 1320 consent orders under secti on 5e subjected 575 new chemicals to snur requirements without an accompanying 5e order29 took four actions to protect against unreasonable risks under s ection 5f and received information gathered through voluntary testing for at least 300 chemicals in addition 1705 pmns were withdrawn of ten in face of action epa also has acted proactively to encourage the development of chemicals that are likely to be less hazardous to that end the agency has shared set of its models known as the p2 framework with chemical manufacturers so that they may avoid designing or developing chemicals that are likely to raise concerns and prompt requests for additional data30 for example one of the models in the set epi suite evaluates chemical structures and estimates the melting and boiling points vapor pressure and other physical and chemical ch aracteristics of new chemicals another model the cancer expert system wh ich is registered under the trademark oncologic analyzes chemical structur to determine the likelihood that they might cause cancer31 by using epas models some manufacturers have been able to design greener products

before 1999 for possible addition to the priority sting list and 1000 to 2000 were in fact added to the priority testing list33 epa has addressed its re sponsibilities for screening and managing the 61000 existing chemicals on the original inventory by categorizing them according to relative risk based primarily on the info rmation reported by manufacturers between 1975 and 197934 many chemicals have been assigned low priority for evaluation and management because they are thought to pose risk or relatively small risk of harm generally because they ar produced in quantities less than 10000 pounds per year per site or because they are pol ymers epa has not required reporting for such chemicals under the tsca 8a invent ory update rule as result it is not known whether many of them still are pr oduced and distributed within the united states epa has estimated that roughly 15000 or ganic and inorganic chemicals are produced at significant volumes mor than 10000 pounds per year and are not polymers that are generally of less concern35 of these about 3000 were producedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34118crs12 36 the estimated number of such chemicals roughly 3000 has not changed since the late 1970s but chemical identities have changed some chemicals produced in high volumes at that time longer are produced at such high levels while others are being produced at high volumes now that were not then moreover some chemicals qualify intermittently as high production volume being produced in greater volumes in some years and lesser volumes in others 37 40 cfr 712 38 epa overview p 16

section 4 its almost as if we have to first prove that chemicals are risky before we can have th testing done to show whether or not the chemicals are risky51 this situation results in high transaction costs due to legal challenges when test rules are promulgated the regulated community generally can argue that there is insuffi cient evidence supporting the agencys determination that rule is needed52 goldman testified for example in july 1993 we promulgated tsca section 4 multichemical toxicity end point test rule covering 10 chemicals in october 1993 however we were sued by the chemical manufact urers association now the american chemistry council settlement was only reached earlier this month may 1994 we also promulgated final tsca secti on 4 test rule on october of 1993 on four chemicals and were sued by the manufac turers for two of those four chemicals settlement negotiations are still underway for those53 in recent report on federal requirements for toxicity testing the national research council agreed with dr goldman and noted that tsca authorizes epa to review existin g chemicals but toxicity and exposure information on them is typically so inco mplete that it does not support the review process epa can require testing if it termines that chemical meets specific set of criteria however in vitro and wholeanimal tests are rarely required thus the basis for

tools are described below voluntary initiatives to gather data epa also obtains data about chemical properties through various voluntary programs some aimed at particular chemical groups such as cer

the flexibility of tsca that permits such voluntary programs to be one of the tscas greatest strengths58 epa efforts to develop toxicity data on hpv chemicals date back to the late 1980s at that time

an epa rule prom ulgated under section 6 that prohibited the manufacture importation proce ssing and distribution of asbestos in almost all products85 the substantive heart of the corrosion proof decision was its conclusion that epa had insufficiently justified its ban the ruling is described in more detail in the appendix to this report with very limited exception legal comment ators have viewed tsca section 6 particularly as construed in corrosion proof fittings as imposing high evidentiary hurdles on epa regulators so that little regulation under its authority may be expected86 as explained by robert b haemer corrosion proof fittings may have done the most damage to epas ability to regulate chemical substances he continues the fact that the court found ten year s of rulemaking and 45000 page record inadequate to support ban on asbestos makes it appear that epa management has good reason to avoid rulemaking altogether requiring epa to use the balancing approach recommended by the corrosion proof court would result in the agency making tough policy choices that cannot be resolved solely by science the time and effort required to flawlessly follow rulemaking procedures affects sic epas decisi ons about whether to pursue section 6 rulemakings especially considering that more procedure may not necessarily produce better administrative decisions it is even more difficult for epa to surmount an overly restrictive interpretation of reasonable risk87 the courts remand of the asbestos rule in corrosion proof fittings indicates that tscas failure is tied to its

legislative proposals derive from university of california berkeley re port commissioned in january 2004 by members of the california legislature95 that report concluded that the cause of the chemical challenges facing california is the failure of tsca to provide an effective vehicle to motivate chemical producers to generate nd distribute adequate information on the toxicity of their products this informa tion deficit the repor t continues makes it difficult for businesses and consumers to choose safer chemicals and has undermined the efficient opera tion of the market as result the market is driven by the function and price of chemicals more than by their toxic properties according to the reports principal author96 the report also suggested that the process is self sustaining because the

chemicals adversely affect the health of individuals it is an ancient area of study but its modern form emerged only recently largely during the 1960s and 1970s the first textbook of toxicology was published in 1972108 since that time the science has grown and developed rapidly the presidentialcongressiona l commission on risk assessment and risk management which was blished by congress in the clean air act amendments of 1990 recommended in 1997 that tsca be updated to reflect advances in toxicology and regulation since tsca was enacted109 tsca reflects the concerns of the early days of toxicology and the knowledge and methods of that first toxicology book at the time tsca became law concerns focused on acute effects birth defects or cancer due to accidental poisoning incidents pharmaceutical drugs or occupa tional exposures thus tsca addresses individual chemicals and does not account fo r the variety of metabolic processes leading to toxicity vast individual differences in sensitivity and vulnerability to toxic effects and consequently the inherent difficulty of provi ng that an individual case or group of cases of disease resulted from particular exposure or for effects on neurological development reproduction the immune syst em or endocrine systems in recent years congress has directed epa to conduct its risk assessment taking into account potential vulnerability and sensitivity of developing human embryos and children as well as other major id entifiable subgroups of consumers to toxic chemicals110 ability of chemicals to disrupt the functioning

cells of particular ssue at particular time the field of study is known as proteomics when the focus is on the function of various portions of genome human or otherwise the field is called ge nomics when the focus is on how genomes are affected by exposure to toxic substan ces the field is called toxicogenomics although such factors are not excluded as considerations unde r tsca public health advocates have argued that they do not influence decisions enough given the uncertainties of the toxicology and the n eed to balance risks and benefits under tsca114 computational toxicology the most recent innovation with respect to toxicology emerged in the late 1990s an d is developing rapidly computational toxicology115 computational toxicology refers to computerassisted techniques for estimating risks to human health or the environment based on mathematical models that link scientific knowledge about various chemicals environmental media air water land etc and the biology of human and other potentially affected organisms computational toxicology is particularly valuable for comparing and analyzing large amounts of very detailed biol ogical data for example on the molecular structure of the human genome and the functions of its parts this has allowed scientists to identify genetic variations that may make some individuals more or less vulnerable to damage from exposure to certain chemic als for more information about these emerging techniques see the interim re port by the national research councils committee on toxicity testing and assessment of environmental agents116 computational toxicology also is expected to improve the scientific basis for epas decisions about whether to require data collection or to regulate particular chemicals for which data are lacking data can be easily and relatively quickly collected on the identities of proteins produ ced within living cells as they respond to different chemicals or other stressors117 such data indicating biological effects of exposure are generated using rapid soca lled highthroughput biochemical tests and recorded in vast database s the databases then are analyzed for patterns which may be used to inform models intended to predict the environmental and toxicity characteristics of chemicals not yet tested by matching this information on the biological response to toxic substances with

tsca that would require such tests with the aim of more rapidly veloping these tools for toxicity assessment118 as mentioned previously epa already relies heavily on its quantitative structureactivity relations hip qsar models for tting priorities and conducting screeninglevel risk assessments these models quantitatively correlate what is known about particular chemical structures and the biological activity or chemical reactivity of the chemicals in which such structures are found the correlations then are used to predict the activity or reactivity of other chemicals with similar structures but for which data are lacking if these models become even more reliable predictors of chemical properties the question may arise whether qsar is sufficient basis for an unreasonable risk determination119 epa may make this decision on its own authority but congress also might wish to weigh in on that decision one form er epa assistant administrator argues that the empirical basis for sar is weak and that sar has allowed both epa and the chemical indus try to defend the tsca program and to claim that it adequately protects the public120 the empirical basis for sar is expected to strengthen over time however and many scientists see sar positively as potentially powerful tool that in the long term may reduce costs for the regulated community and reduce the need to require some animalbased toxicity tests exposure data when tsca was enacted risk assessment was primitive tool based on simple toxicological models usually of single incident of exposure to single chemical followed usually rela tively quickly by an obvious health effect multiple lowlevel episodic or chronic exposures to multiple chemicals were thought to be too complex to model t oday epa routinely models longterm low level exposure through multip pathways and someti mes looks at cumulative exposure to different chemicals with similar modes of action121 such complex exposure assessment was mandated by the food quality protection act of 1996 and is conducted routinely for pesticides research also has determined that the timing of an exposure can be important especially to developing fetus or young child thus if there are data indicating that exposure to chemical is likely to adversely affect fetal or infant development rat or mouse experiments may be conducted in which exposure

or after mating during the gestation period or soon after birth122 tsca does not prevent consideration of aggregate or cumulative exposure or of its timing but neither does it require them tsca also does not provide guidance with respect to the use of such information in regulatory decisions for example if an unreasonable risk results from exposure to two or more chemicals it is not clear whether tsca authorizes epa to contro l the individual chemicals contributing to the risk123 amendments to tsca might address such issues technological developments and issues advances in science and technology so are raising some concerns about tsca particularly with respect to whether and how epas procedures for identifying and managing unreasonable ri sks might be applied to new forms of chemical substances like genetically modified organisms or nanoparticles genetically modified organisms soon after tsca was enacted entrepreneurs began applying new technol ogies for cutting copying

environmental risks with economic cost s and benefits analysts and policy makers currently are evaluating tsca performance over the past 30 years and considering how the law is likely to perform in the future some analysts and most in the regulated community believe that tsca has performed as intended and they support ts ca in its current form they praise tsca as flexible efficient and ffective

international agreements by lindajo schierownot accomplished the tasks laid out for it by congress and is unlikely to do better in the future given recent and emerging changes in science and technology164 the available evidence i ndicates that epa has had limited success using tsca to gather information about new chemical s but has demonstrated creativity and expertise in making use of available information to categorize such chemicals based on hazard potential thereby reducing risks potentially associated with exposure to chemicals entering us commerce the agency has had some success in gathering information about existing chemicals but has regulated only handful based on lack of expressed concern by stakeholders and the competitive strength of the us chemical industry epa also appears to have avoided imposing regulatory burden that unduly oppresses innova tion and commerce whether the amount of chemical regula tion in the united states adequately controls unreasonable risks is key policy stion however it is clear that few chemicals posed risks that congress f ound unreasonable and tsca title i failed to control congress amended tsca on three occasions to control risks associated with asbestos lead and ra don some remain dissatisfied with tsca for example s 742 as reported by the senate committee on environm ent and public works in the 110th congress and hr 6903 as intr oduced would ban many asbestos containing materials nu merous states also have acted to control risks from chemicals that are not regulated under tsca in addition many nations have joined together to regulate persistent organic pollutants and persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances in ways that the unite d states cannot under the current provisions of tsca165 the european union recently adopt ed new law reach that takes new approach to the regulation of chemicals eliminating the distinction between new and existing chemicals and requiring manufacturers to identify hazards and manage risks for all uses of their chemicals multinational companies therefore may have to comply with multiple possibl redundant or conflic ting regulations even if one concludes that tsca has

imposing an asbestos ban epa chose the most burdensome of the options afforded by sec tion 6a by analyzing only two scenarios the ban and tsca regulation at all the court held that epa failed to show as tsca requires that there was not some intermediate regulation that would achieve the acceptable risk level the proper course for the epa to follow is to consider each regulatory option beginning with the least burdensome and the costs and benefits of regu lation under each option167 only such an exercise assures that the agency has not skipped lessburdensome alternative second the court said epa also must present stronger case for ban of products for which subs titutes are not now available as describes some of the asbestos products covered by the ban here than of produc ts for which substitutes are available this it did not do as to asbestos products for which substitutes are now available epa declined to consider the harm from probable substitutes increased use even where it is known carcinogen the court added thus epa cannot assure that its ban will increase workplace safety depriving the ban of reasonable basis to be sure epa need not seek out and test every possible substitute but where interested parties introduce evidence showing the toxicity or decreased safety of probable substitutes epa must consider th comparative toxic costs of each that is whether its chosen section 6a option is increasing workplace safety at all as another facet of this insufficient evidence issue the court determined that epa failed to consider adequately the costs imposed by its ban under section 6a epa may regulate only to address unreasonable risk that is whether the severity of the injury that may result fro m the product factored by the likelihood of the injury offsets the harm the regu lation itself imposes upon manufacturers and consumers168 the high costs imposed on industry by the asbestos ban compared to the small number of lives predicted to be saved suggested to the court that epa could not have given the fo rmer serious consideration finally the court examined both the failure to examine intermediate options first ground above and the insufficiency of evidence second ground above as these issues affected sp ecific asbestos products covere d by the ban spelling out the deficiencies in greater deta il for example in the case of friction products epa failed to study the effects of nonasbest brakes on automotive safety despite evidence that nonasbestos brakes could increase the number of highway fatalities
