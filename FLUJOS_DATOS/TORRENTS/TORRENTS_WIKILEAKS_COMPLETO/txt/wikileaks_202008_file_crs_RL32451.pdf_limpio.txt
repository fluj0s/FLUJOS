welfare reform violates the first amendment ie freedom of speech rights of lsc grantees and their clients and is thereby unconstitutional the supreme court agreed with the second circuit courts ruling that by prohibiting lscfunded attorneys from litigating cases that challenge existing welfare statutes or regulations c ongress had improperly prohibited lawyers from presenting certain arguments to the courts wh ich had the effect of distorting the legal system and altering the traditional role of lawyers as advocates for their clients 3 this system supplanted the previous system of presumptive

request lsc f unding makes up about half of all funding for the national ci vil legal services system for the poor reconfiguration beginning in july 1995 in anticipation of funding cutbacks the lsc started formulating plan to provide states with an array of strategies by which the legal services programs in the state could st retch federal dollars the lscs state planning initiative was formally introduced in 1998 according to lsc special report to congress until the implementation of the state planning initiative determining service areas in given state was more product of geographic and historical happenstance than reasoned judgment about the precise configuration that would yield the best legal services system for the greatest number of clients with fewer resources to expend and growing client base to serve lsc has embraced service area reconfiguration as one important way to insure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery of legal assistance to persons in both urban and rural areas5 the number of grantees receiving ls c funding decreased from 325 in 1995 to 262 in 1998 to 207 in 2001 to 170 in 2002 to 161 in 2003 to 143 in 2004 the reduction in the number of local programs is due to both cutbacks in funding and lscinitiated reconfiguration of the lsc program in which states were urged to merge reorganize and consolidate local pr ograms into more efficient regional and statewide delivery system of legal services to the poor in congressional testimony the lsc chairman and the lsc president stated that the state planning initiative directed all lsc programs to develop comprehensive plans to coordinate and integrate their work in seven areas expanding client access and efficiency utilizing technology to expand access and enhance services promoting client selfhelp and preventative legal education and advice coordinating legal work and training collaborating with the private bar and other community stakeholders expanding grantees resource development efforts and configuring lsc service areas in more efficient and effective manner to enhance client services and reduce barriers to assistance6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32451crs5 7 testimony by lsc chairman president p 6according to the 2001 lsc special report to congress the lsc has used its competitive bidding process to ensure that grantees improve and expand legal services to clients in their respective states many policymakers and program analysts agree that even with reduced financing grantees have managed to lessen geographic disparities for clients livin g in remote or underserved areas while simultaneously making the tire legal delivery system for the poor more efficient by merging small legal services progra ms with larger programs by providing selfrepresented pro litigants with accurate and easily understood legal information by promoting the use of vi deoconferencing by courts to enable witnesses with transportati on challenges to testify and by using technology to improve case management and intake systems in fy2004 143 grantees were serving 212 service areas even though lsc grantees are becoming more efficient in stretching reduced funding the ratio of attorneys to clients has diminished substantially when the lsc was established in 1974 its foremost goal was to provide ll lowincome persons with at least minimum access to legal services this was defined as the equivalent of one legal services attorney for ev ery 5000 poor persons the goal of minimum access was achieved in fy1980 and fy1981 curre ntly in most states there is only one legal services attorney for every 11500 poor persons clients legal services provided through lsc f unds are available only in civil matters to individuals with incomes less than 125 of the federal poverty guidelines the lsc places primary emphasis on the provision of routine legal services and the majority of lscfunded ac tivities involve routine lega l problems of lowincome people legal services cases deal with variety of issues including family related issues divorce separation child custody support adoption spousal abuse child abuse or neglect housing issues evictions foreclosures welfare or other income maintenance program issues access to health care benefit claims consumer and finance issues debt collection and individual rights employment health juvenile and education most cases are resolved outside the courtroom eg via legal advice referrals telephone calls by attorneys which is very costeffective approach to settling legal matters according to testimony before the house appropriations committee on april 1 2004 by the lsc chairman and the lsc president lsc clients represent the diversity of th is country encompassing all races ethnic groups and ages they include the working poor veterans family farmers people with disabilities and victims of natural disasters about threequarters of lscs client

the remaining 94 on local legal services programs table 2 also shows lsc spending per poor person in each of the states the district of columbia and the territories for fy2004 the variation occurs because some jurisdictions lost funding because their poverty populations increased by less than the nationwide increase during th period from 19902000 some jurisdictions gained funding because their poverty popul ations increased by more than the nationwide increase during the period fro m 19902000 some states were given additional funding to offset losses due to censusbased lsc funding
