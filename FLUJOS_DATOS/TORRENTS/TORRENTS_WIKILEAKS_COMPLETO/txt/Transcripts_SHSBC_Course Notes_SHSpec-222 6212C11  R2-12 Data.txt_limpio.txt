6212c11 shspec222 r212 data much of the data in this lecture is given in hcob 15dec62 urgent r212 the fatal error and hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance dont overuse 2wc eg did you just think of something in midsession have you thought of anything tends to put responsibility on the pc this tells him to selfaudit if the pc says that he has forgotten something dont say what was it give the missed withhold question cleaning needle is just fundamental auditing you could do it thoroughly with an eighteen button prepcheck in auditing or even just suppress and invalidate as prepcheck assist you could assess the eighteen buttons and run what reads best that would clean up needle very high ta will also be brought down with this basic stuff dont spend lot of time fixing up the case before you audit it you can also clean up needle with r212 if case doesnt move on r212 assume that he is rockslammer and take the largest read on list one and oppose it or just do an oppose list on scientology cf the green form handling what are you trying to prevent there is disgrace in being rockslammer some people have lied about whether it was pain or sensation so as not to seem declasse so lrh checks untruth because if you write backwards list it is useless as well as hard on the pc there are two ways to approach the persistent dirty needle if you dont have someone to do r212 pull missed withholds etc do prepcheck of sorts to clean the needle and teach the auditor to get missed withholds if these attempts to clean the needle go on too long there is point where the pcs anxiety about auditing dirties the needle so dont overrun this repair action noauditing can be counted on to dirty needle the pc can also get anxious if nothing is reading on nulling he can be afraid that you are going to go into midruds and get dirty needle from that the first symptom of session blowing up is the pc getting little bit critical of the auditor this is the only thing lrh stops at when putting in midruds it is always the sign of an ow underlying it to neglect it lets it multiply into screaming arc break later so pick up critical with missed withhold at once this is fundamental any indication of missed withholds makes lrh go after them you dont use missed withhold to punish the pc but to prevent the pc from blowing up in r212 one mistake you can make is not to know what rock slam looks like and therefore to neglect rockslamming item the auditor knows that it reacted so he represents it this isnt invariably disastrous the command value of rockslamming item is terrific but the pcs attention is not on the slamming item it is on what opposes it in the gpm so when you do represent list it takes the pcs attention off the item that claims it and it drives the pc around the bend if you really get mad at someone when he is rockslamming on something represent it instead of opposing it he will practically go out the bottom another goof would be to null the opposition list just to the point where all the reads are gone without finding the item then quit just short of getting the package this leaves hidden pair in pt the pc will feel better but there is still something there nulling the represent or oppose list makes it easier for the pc to extend it you can get to point where list can be nulled even though it is incomplete just continue the list and you will see another rock slam turn on and the rock slam on the original item you were opposing will come back another error that people are making is abandoning lists that had rock slams on them they can get into this mistake by representing instead of opposing rockslamming item the list will go nowhere because there is nowhere to go except to the original item sometimes an item which didnt rockslam at first will unburden enough when you start to represent it to start rockslamming so check for this when the represent list gives dirty needle and item the less attention one has in pt the more one is likely to go down the tone scale as the pc takes his attention off past incidents to handle pt these past incidents collapse in on him and he dramatizes this is applicable to the fact that we have found the worst attention trap there is ris represented in pt the rock slam is caused by the fury and franticness of the pcs attention and opposed attentions never fail to pair an item once found if you only find one item of rockslamming pair especially if you do this several times after awhile you will get rock slams that amount of attention is absorbed in the bank and all you will get will be dead horses thenceforth this isnt terribly serious since we can take the folder and go back to find the incomplete packages if you dont do this the packages can add up to point where the pc wont go clear an auditor who repairs situation like this gets all the residual gain the pc will already have gotten gains he will have felt much better even before the repair it is not dangerous to put r212 in clumsy hands as long as good records are kept and common ordinary good auditing gets done doing r212 right is last in order of importance if you simplify this down to the bare minimum omit midruds and anything at all complicated you have r210 to be run on heavily supervised coaudit basis the only place you will have trouble is deciding whether to represent or oppose an item that rockslams cyclically so you dont know if it is an ri learn what one of these cyclic dirty needle opposition lists looks like then you will know what you are listing
