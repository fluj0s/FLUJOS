include turkey in the qi z tariffreduction program see footnote 1 for details on the legislation and text box 1 for qiz definition was passed by the house in the 107th congress the turkeyqiz legislation had the strong support of the administration which numbered among its objectives 1 rewarding turkey for its support in the afghanistan war turkey comma nded the international security assistance force in afghanistan and any potential war with iraq 2 enhancing trade between turkey and israel and 3 bolstering the economy of turkey by enabling it to attract more foreign investment and diversify its exports so it can contribute to greater regional stability3 t t h s m t i m under continuing pressure from the us domestic textile apparel and leather production industries the administration excluded turkey from qiz benefits in the industries where turkey could likely benefit most in the short run qiz proposals the qiz legislation would have done two th ings first it would have added turkey to the list of countries jordan and egypt eligible to establish qizs with israel the qiz concept was 1996 extension of the us is rael free trade agreement usifta and was designed to promote middleeast peace political stability and economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21458crs3 4 the qiz concept was first authorized in 1996 amendment sec 9 of pl 104234 to the usisrael free trade area implementation act of 1985 usifta pl 9947 rules of origin are defined in pl 104234 19 usc 2112 note development through economic partnership with israel specifically the 1996 amendment which created the qiz program authorized the president to exempt from customs duty those articles imported into the united states that are made in the west bank gaza strip or qiz meeting specific rules of orig in requirements enumerated in text box 1 below the amendment further defined qi z as any area that 1 encompasses portions of israel and jordan or israel and egypt nd 2 has been so designated by both the local ie country authority and th us trade representative 4 text box 1 what is qiz qizs are specific type of free trade zone other examples are maquiladoras in mexico and special economic zones in china free trade zones of which there are about 800 worldwide employing more than 24 million workers are typically industrial parks housing manufacturing operations built with foreign direct investment typically by multinatio nal corporations trade zones simplify cooperative production between countries because they are fiscally outside the customs territory of country this means that for raw materials flowing into and goods moving out of zones customs procedures are streamlined and tariffs do not apply until the goods fo rmally enter country as imports for consumption qizs are distinguished from other trade zones as follows trade zones in general are standalone entities not directly connected to other countries b produce for export to any country and c operate solely under the authority of and conditions determined by the host government qizs however are like threelegged stool with each leg representing producing country israel the united states and another middle east country linked together by the seat which is the united states b produce goods solely for export to the united states and c operate under both the authority of the host countries and the oversight authority of the united states which determines conditions for and authorizes tariff relief the mechanism of qiz establishmen t production and export is as follows establishment managers of publicly or privately owned industrial parks in an authorized country apply to the us trade representative ustr for qi z status the qiz tariff benefit designation plus tax and other benefits typically offered by the host country attracts manufacturers production these manufacturers must submit for approval detailed production information to committee composed of government officials from israel and other qiz partner governments this information is to demonstrate that the costs of materials and labor of goods produced meet us rules of origin requirements which are as follows 1 the manufactured product must contain both israeli and turkish content 2 must be imported directly from israel the west bank the gaza strip or qiz and 3 the appraised value cost content plus di rect cost of processing operations must include 35 local value content from israel and turkey of this 35 15 percentage points slightly less than one half may be in us imports export once the product is completed the shipper andor importer may put an n before the product harmonized tariff system hts number on the customs invoice this tells the us customs service that the imported goods come from qiz and are eligible for tari fffree and quotafree status second the qiz bill would have added restrictions to pa rticipation by turkey that do not apply to participation by any other members specifically the qiz legislation would have prohibited tari ff reductions and consequently quota removals from linkage to usifta on eight item groups made in turkey israel qizs textiles apparel footwear handbags luggage flat goods eg

military aid totaling several billion do llars in return for its cooperation against iraq 7 calculation duties on all goods imported from turkey for which qiz tariff reductions would apply were divided by the total dutiable value in 2002 us exports to turkey were 31 billion unchanged from 2001 imports from turkey were 35 billion up 15any other articles the president determines to be import sensitive for these categories turkey would have retained its existing dut rates normal or pr eferential under the generalized system of pr eferences gsp and its quota limits under the agreement on textiles and clothing explained below in addition the president could have excluded from tariff reductions any items he determined to be import sensitive implications turkeys reaction to the proposal the qiz proposal was not as favorable as turkey had hoped turkey has reportedly pressed for more market access for textile s reduction of tari ffs and elimination or expansion of quotas and movement toward free trade agreement commenting on the qiz proposal turkish economic source indicated that benef its to turkey from the zone program would be not very much5 this may have played role in turkeys subsequent request for additional aid in return for allowing the united states to station more military troops in turkish bases in order to open northern front against iraq6 how useful would the qiz legislation have been for turkey the shortterm usefulness of any qiz legi slation for turkey would have depended largely on the treatment of textiles and apparel framers of the qiz legislation argued that the program would have helped turkey in th long run by promoting development of its high tech industry and wean itself from its traditional textile nd apparel exports supporters of the turkey qiz legislation so pointed to jordans success in expanding its exports under the qiz program jordans qiz exports to the united states began only in late 1999 at 159000 and th ree years later totale d 3695 million jordans qiz exports are concentrated in two out of the 10 categories of apparel and accounted for 90 of its total exports to the united states of 412 million in 2002 to benefit in the short run from expande d investment and exports turkey would have had to overcome three key obstacles fi rst it would have had to overcome the fact that 49 of its exports with tariffs aver aging 137 are ineligible for tariff reduction and quota removal see table 17 second turkey would have had to expand the remaining 51 of its eligible exports with tariffs averaging 35 high tech products for which the united states seeks to encour age expansion are included in this group if high tech is defined as ectronics it accounted for only 13 of turkeys exports in 2002 with tariffs averaging 3 third pot ential investors in ligible industries inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21458crs5 8 the stock of us foreign direct investme nt in turkey was 12 billion in 2001 compared with 41 billion for israel and only 14 million in jordan 9 also the us customs collected less that 28 million in revenues from turkey on goods that were eligible as compared with 234 million on goods that were ineligible for tariff reduction 10 these figures update p 8 of nafta estimates of job effect s and industry trade trends after 5 ½ years by mary jane bolle crs report 98783turkey could be discouraged by both economic interruptions of war with iraq and its aftermath and the challenges of trans porting components between the noncontiguous qiz partner states israel and turkey in order to adhere to qiz rules of origin

textile and apparel industry as noted above the qiz legislation would not apply to textiles apparel and leather or other goods the president determines to be import sensitive thus those industries in the united states are not likely to be dversely impacted in the short run the impact on other us industries however is unclear9 what would have been the impact on the u s economy if turkeys textile apparel and leather industries were give n greater access to it in these three industries combined us employment has suffered large declin of about 38 or 680000 jobs declining from about 18 million to 11 million jobs between 1993 and 2001 much of this job loss 23 of the 38 percentage points or roughly 157000 jobs10 can be attributed to increased imports from or plant relocations to mexico or canada

amendment and with limited debatequotas for turkey even on these ineligible items could be significant but still small relative to other us imports this is b ecause turkey with 2001 us textile apparel and leather export total of 15 billion ranked as the uss 17th supplier of these goods compared to china the first supplier w ith 19 billion and mexico the second supplier with 10 billion any trade increase from turk ey in these industries could represent trade diversion fro m other countries potentially greater impact on us textile and apparel industries than relaxing qiz requirements on turkey

quotas is scheduled to expire at that point flood of new xtile apparel and l eather imports from wto countries could enter the united states quot afree from nations throughout the world other alternatives at least two other trade proposals have been mentioned as alternatives or supplements to the qiz program for turkey first is possible free trade agreement fta with turkey referred to earlier wh ich was broached by envoys from turkey seeking to upgrade their economic relationshi p enhance trade and investment ties and gain support for turkeys economic reform pr ogram see footnote 5 at least three considerations would affect the if and when of such negotiations the political and economic merits of such proposal th already full schedule of us trade representative ustr zoellick and concerns of us states second in february 2003 the ustr reporte dly floated an add itional congressional package of textile and apparel trade benef its separate from the qiz proposal to reward turkey for stationing us military pe rsonnel during likely war with iraq11 t h i s package would among other things 1 ffer turkey dutyfree and quotafree access to the united states for apparel made with us fabric and yarn and 2 allow the us military to purchase certain xtile products from turkey for year during which the berry amendment would be waived and turkey would be exempt from the buy american act providing pr eference for american goods in government purchases12 this proposal might have been more attractive for turkey and shown us concern for the domestic textile and pparel industry however it might also have encroached on the administrations commitment to minimize trad effects on the us textile industry13
