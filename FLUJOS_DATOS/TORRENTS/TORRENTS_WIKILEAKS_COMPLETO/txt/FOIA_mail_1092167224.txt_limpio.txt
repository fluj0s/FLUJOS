from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to gabi hegerl hegerldukeedu michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject re mann and jones 2003 date tue aug 10 154704 2004 cc tom crowley tcrowleydukeedu gabi second attempt dont know what the first was well be doing new instrumental data set surprisingly called hadcrut3 but thats it at the moment attached is good review of corals just out cheers phil at 1036 10082004 0400 gabi hegerl wrote hi mike and phil thanks yes factor 129 will get closer to my best guess scaling factor 16 to samesize signals the scaling is tough issue and i think there are lots of possibilities to do it depending on what one wants to do for comparing underlying forced signals i think tls is best to get conservative size paleo reconstruction like what part of instrumental do we reconstruct with paleo the traditional scaling is best ill write up what myles and i have been thinking and send it phil if there is second attempt at that with the hadley centre let know i dont like racing anybody gabi michael mann wrote dear phil and gabi ive attached cleanedup and commented version of the matlab code that i wrote for doing the mann and jones 2003 composites i did this knowing that phil and i are likely to have to respond to more crap criticisms from the idiots in the near future so best to clean up the code and provide to some of my close colleagues in case they want to test it etc please feel free to use this code for your own internal purposes but dont pass it along where it may get into the hands of the wrong people in the process of trying to clean it up i realized i had something bit odd not necessarily wrong but it makes small difference it seems that i used the long nh instrumental series back to 1753 that we calculated in the following paper mann rutherford s bradley rs hughes mk keimig ft 1optimal surface temperature reconstructions using terrestrial borehole data journal of geophysical research 108 d7 4203 doi 1010292002jd002532 2003 based on the sparse available long instrumental records to set the scale for the decadal standard deviation of the proxy composite not sure why i used this rather than using the cru nh record back to 1856 for this purpose it looks like i had two similarly named series floating around in the code and used perhaps the less preferable one for setting the scale turns it this has the net effect of decreasing the amplitude of the nh reconstruction by factor of 011014 129 this may explain part of what perplexed gabi when she was comparing w the instrumental series ive attached the version of the reconstruction where the nh is scaled by the cru nh record instead as well as the matlab code which youre welcome to try to use yourself and play around with basically this increases the amplitude of the reconstruction everywhere by the factor 129 perhaps this is more in line w what gabi was estimating gabi anyway doesnt make major difference but you might want to take this into account in any further use of the mann and jones series phil is this worth followup note to grl w link to the matlab code mike ps gabi when do you and tom plan to publish your nh reconstruction that now goes back about 1500 years or so it would be nice to have more independent reconstructions published in the near future maybe i missed this thanks ______________________________________________________________
