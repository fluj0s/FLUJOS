executive summary results based budgeting rbb was first introduced in the united nations peacekeeping operations in 2002 2003 with an underlying intention to establish versatile planning and management tool that would directly link resource alloc ation to achievement of results this report is second in series of office of internal oversight services oios reports in response to request by the controller for review of the relevance efficiency and effectiveness of rbb in peacekeeping operations and specifically examines the rbb process as applied at the united nation s mission in liberia unmil unmil operations are currently in consolidation drawdown and withdrawal cdw phases in which the mission s emphasis is shifting from peacekeeping to peace building involving capacity development for the government of lib eria and support to civil society structures to enhance long term peace the unmil strategy for this process is embodied in the integrated mission priorities and implementation plan impip which incorporates the long term objectives for all stakeholders including the united nations country team unct and the government of liberia unmils rbb framework reflects the missions annual priorities in the context of the broader impip the controllers budget instructions which are common to all missions set the policies procedures and methodology for rbb in unmil while the department of peacekeeping operations dpko strategic guidance addresses the planning parameters for each specific mission in accordance with its mandate oios sees merit in combining t he two documents into single dpko guidance on the basis of which the mission should then issue detailed mission budget instructions mbi that articulate the priorities and operational direction envisaged for each component oios note s that the coordina tion between support and substantive components of the mission is weak since mission performance is ultimately reported on the basis of the rbb framework oios sees need to enhance formal coordination between them in the development of the draft rbb fra mework similarly individual sections in the substantive component should formally coordinate to identify areas of overlap in their outputs and to determine how these may impact their indicators oios also conclude s that there was need to streamline the rbb review process when the mission finalizes and submits the draft to headquarters noting that the mission answers separately to the financial management support service in the department of field support dfs office of operations in dpko as well as p eacekeeping finance division in the office of programme planning budget and accounts oppba through disparate channels of communications oios note s that some indicators of achievement in unmils rbb framework did not have specific baselines and targets and some of the activities of the mission could not be linked to the rbb framework because of the inconsistency in some indicators oios findings also hinted at difficult in including some aspects of the work programme that was qualitative in 2 nature and that could not easily be expressed in quantitative terms in the framework oios note s however that the rbb framework is integrated into the strategic planning process and that missions senior leadership was actively involved and supportive of rbb oios f ound unmil to be in compliance with the controllers budget instructions on the portfolio of evidence but noted that collection and monitoring of performance data was done in an ad hoc manner and needed to be streamlined oios also note s that there were standard operating procedures sop for rbb focal points and that most had not received formal training in rbb overall oios found unmil to be on the right path in its implementation of the principles of rbb and has established solid foundation for it s eventual transition to full fledged results based approach for effective management and decision making in peacekeeping the report contains eight recommendations to help the mission improve its rbb planning process formulation and reporting of the f ramework as well as training and capacity development oios further notes that relevant recommendations for specific attention of oppba andor dpko and dfs are only referred to but not explicitly made in this report as they were already made in the oios report on the review of rbb in the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik this final report takes into consideration and reflects adjustments undertaken in response to

introduction 1 the office of internal oversight services oios at the request of the controller1 is undertaking review of the relevance efficiency and effectiveness of the results based budgeting rbb in peacekeeping operations the review covers all phases of the rbb process as applied in peacekeeping operations and encompasses rbb at the mission level as well as support and guidance provided by h eadquarters to the missions throughout the rbb process 2 this report is second in series of oios reports on rbb and specifically examines the rbb process as applied to the united nations mission in liberia unmil the review focuses on the congruence an d alignment of the rbb operational framework in regard to the missions mandate its relevant processes policy guidelines and standard operating procedures sops for peacekeeping operations particular emphasis is on the practical application of the rbb framework to unmils operations including the presence of time bound performance indicator baselines and targets documentation of performance indicator methodologies at mission level observed change in indicators of achievement and whether the elements of the framework provide an adequate m easurement of results achieved the review further addresses integration of the rbb framework into the missions planning process self monitoring and any adjustments to the framework capacity development training and the use of best practices 1 controllers memorandum to oios of 28 nov ember 2005 5 ii methodology 3 in conducting this review oios utilized variety of qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods basing its findings on the following six data sources 1 interviews with personnel from the department of peacekeeping operation dpko the department of field support dfs and the office of programme planning budget and accounts oppba at headquarters 2 individual and focus group interviews with mission staff during field visit to unmil2 3 surveys of senior management in all 18 peacekeeping missions to assess their understanding nature and extent of involvement in rbb systems application 4 similar surveys of staff at the operational level in all 18 peacekeeping missions 3 5 programme data ana lyses and 6 literature revi ew oios greatly appreciates the cooperation and assistance extended to it by dpko dfs oppba and senior leadership and staff in unmil during the course of the review this final report takes into consideration and reflects djustments undertaken in response to comments received from oppba dpko dfs and unmil in response to draft report submitted for their respective review on 17 september 2007 4 there were few limitations in conducting the survey of mission staff d ue to high vacancy rates staff absences on leave and staff turnover it was difficult to define fixed universe of staff from which to survey and oios was also unable to apply consistent sampling criteria in the selection of the survey population by the ssions as result oios is not able to determine precise survey response rate in order to address these limitations all findings were based on evidence derived from multiple sources of data including survey data iii rbb in united nations peacekeepin g overview and context 5 the united nations undertakes complex multidimensional peacekeeping operations throughout the world and works with diverse partners each focusing on specific aspects of the integrated peacekeeping effort such as humanitarian rel ief elections monitoring and supervision economic reconstruction and institution building over the past seven years the aggregate peacekeeping budget has increased more than fourfold from us1 billion in 1999 to over us5 billion in 2006 it is agains t this backdrop that former secretary general kofi annan proposed organization wide reforms including shift away from input based budgeting to rbb with the intention of establishing versatile planning and management tool that would link resource allocation to results4 6 there are certain considerations unique to peacekeeping that influence the ultimate effectiveness of rbb as planning and management tool peacekeeping budgets are by their very nature multidimensional and integrated and need to be v iewed from different perspectives for example some missions operate within very broad mandates as interim administrations 2 oios held meetingsinterviews with 105 unmil staff in the form of one onone interviews and focus groups at unmil headquarters and 2 field sectors 3 the two separate rbb surveys for senior management and staff at the operational level were administered during february april 2007 period yielding 51 and 110 responses respectively 4 united nations interim report on results based b udgeting for the biennium 2002 2003 a57478 of 15 october 2002 6 while others have more narrow objectives associated with humanitarian assistance restoring rule of law or supervising elections this diversity across missions extends to the budgeting process as well implying different stages in the mission life cycle differences in structure as well as differences in the scope and focus of respective budgets in addition the peacekeeping miss ions frequently operate in an especially fluid and uncertain context of political and security change this high degree of uncertainty therefore undermines the ideal rbb scenario in which each mission could establish logical framework with clear objectiv linked to set of stable and predictable outputs and performance indicators against which mission performance would be assessed third consideration is that results in peacekeeping missions tend to be collective responsibility of various contribut ors and partners where ach contributor tends to seek to establish plausible claim of contributing to the envisaged results in these multidimensional scenarios it is difficult to parse out the specific proportion of an outcome attributable to each individual partner iv application of rbb in unmil 7 established by security council resolution 1509 of 2003 unmil is currently in process of consolidation drawdown and withdrawal cdw5 that entails shift in emphasis from peacekeeping to peace building s well as support to structures and capacities that enhance longer term peace this process also requires proper cooperation and coordination between unmil and the united nations country team unct for liberia in the context of one un6 and between the unct including unmil and civil society with emphasis on capacity building for the government of liberia in military building national army and civilian facets including strengthening the rule of law through legislative reform train ing the police force advancing human rights protection and promoting economic development 8 the unmils strategy for cdw is complementary to the missions integrated mission priorities and implementation plan impip and provides an integrated assessment of progress based on the governments four pillar framework namely security economic revitalization governance and rule of law and basic services and infrastructure the impip serves as 1 shared strategic planning tool in monitoring the progressive transfer of responsibility to the government 2 align s annual objectives in the logical framework and budget with mission strategic planning process and 3 coordinate s activities of the unct around integrated mission implementation plan it is designed to ensure t he smooth and orderly handover of security responsibilities and the cessation of capacity building tasks to allow for the eventual withdrawal of the mission further the cdw is based on series of benchmarks which reflect the transition of the mission f rom peacekeeping to peace building in the post election period and also takes into account the capacity of government institutions the benchmarks are considered in the development of carefully calibrated unmil drawdown strategy that takes into consider ation security sector reform and institutional capacity building issues unmil also convenes and 5 report of the secretary general to the security council of 12 september 2006 s2006743 6 in liberia the is made up of two key components one is the unct collection of 16 specia lized agencies funds programmes and the world bank these along with the international monetary fund are present on long term basis to support humanitarian and development efforts in the country the other is the unmil mandated by the security counc il to secure the peace until the liberian state can take over that responsibility the concept of one here refers to teaming up so that the delivers as one 7 chairs the strategic planning group of the unct further enabling tracking of mission progress and operational decision making with reference to the rbb framew ork within the overall context of impip the strategic planning group serves as forum for the mission operating within the framework of an integrated mission to involve the unct in discussing longer term peace building issues it is also an opportunit for the unct to discuss the transitional issues which are in many ways linked to the cdw its core mandate is to develop and periodically review strategies on particular subjectsareas of unmil focus review and recommend follow up action on the quarter ly report on the cdw plan monitoring group and associated reports including the impip review and recommend action on the missions threat assessment as well as review timeliness and feasibility of the transfer of security responsibilities on county by c ounty basis to the government of liberia as indicated by the cdw plan 9 the unmil rbb cycle is initiated by the issuance of two sets of guidance i the controllers budget instructions from the oppba that address the budgetary content of rbb frameworks methodology issues and timelines as well as generic budget related policy objectives and ii the strategic guidance from dpkos office of operations oo that broadly outline key political and operational assumptions underlying these priorities additi onally the strategic guidance also outlines procedural expectations and any changes to prior procedural expectations 10 staff members at unmil note d that the controllers budget instructions achieve dpko wide standardization at the expense of mission speci fic relevanc e7 likewise staff members perceived the dpko strategic guidance as generic and inadequate in guiding them to develop relevant mission specific plans they noted that this lack of adequate guidance has cascading effect through the entire ssion in regard to its rbb framework development making it difficult to not only devise well tailored results framework in the substantive components but also making it difficult to align the support component behind the substantive components plans nd effectively allocate resources for both components oios also received feedback from senior and mid level management staff in unmil that the strategic guidance either failed to adequately account for changes in unmils operating environment or that it c ontained substantive inaccuracies about the situation on the ground in order to ensure the accuracy of substantive information s ome focal points in the mission suggested that the political narrative in the guidance should originate from the mission and not from headquarters 11 on oios observation in paragraph 10 above that staff members at unmil noted that the controllers budget instructions achieve dpko wide standardization at the expense of mission specific relevance the oppba commented that while there may be perception of standardization in regards to the approach to be followed by all peacekeeping missions opportunity is given to missions to articulate their specific situations and consideration is given to these during budget formulation 12 oios found that the strategic guidance transmitted to unmil in 2006 2007 and 2007 2008 did in fact enumerate strategic goals and operating assumptions specific to conditions in liberia however unmils strategic guidance for 2007 2008 appears to be at va riance with the missions emphasis on shifting from peacekeeping to peace building by proposing scaling 7 this finding is common across all missions surveyed 8 down of activities within the strategic objective for humanitarian and reconstruction issues8 this contradicts the role that the mission envisioned when formalizing the inter agency strategic planning group and the explicit mention of the need for greater rather than less integration of peace building efforts across the unct9 oios note s however that dpko does include provisos for the mission to r evert with comments and recommendations10 includ ing qualifier that the strategic objectives are subject to change pending any revisions to the mandate in the security council11 13 on oios observation in paragraph 12 above unmil has noted that with the shift towards peace building the support provided by the mission for humanitarian activities is being gradually handed over to the government or as needed to other agencies in addition the mission noted that the scaling down of humanitarian activi ties d oes not contradict the role that the mission envisioned when formalizing the inter agency strategic planning group and the explicit mention of the need for greater rather than less integration of peace building efforts across the unct this is so because the mission will continue to coordinate and collaborate with agencies in the deliver of humanitarian assistance although at scaled down level 14 in oios opinion combining the two sets of instructions into single consolidated rbb guidance would enhance the relevance and utility of the guidance while also clarify ing the context in which the guidance is being set recommendation to that effect was made to oppba and dpko based on similar finding in the oios review of rbb in the united nation s interim administration mission in kosovo unmik 15 on oios recommendation in paragraph 14 above the oppba noted in their response to the oios review of unmik that this recommendation is problematic due to the distinct roles of oppbapfd and dpko in the peacekeeping budgeting process oios appreciates the concerns of oppba and reiterates that the recommendation is an opportunity for the parties to consider the issues and ascertain whether change would be appropriate that would be beneficial to the rbb process in peacekeeping v preparation of the rbb framework at unmil 16 oios found that unmil faced number of challenges in preparing the rbb framework staff involved in the preparation of unmils rbb framework noted that their ability to produce compr ehensive accurate and representative draft was drastically hampered by the short time provided to prepare the framework for example for the 2007 2008 budget cycle the mission received the strategic guidance on june 29 and was given until july 14 total of 14 days to 8 for example within the strateg ic objective of humanitarian and reconstruction issues the 2007 2008 strategic guidance does underscore the need for unmil to continue to coordinate and collaborate with agencies in the delivery of humanitarian assistance and to support the gove rnments reconstruction and national recovery efforts importantly however it states that these efforts should continue albeit at scaled down level 9 see strengthening peace building efforts in liberia discussion document for unmil and the ct revised draft dated 15 april 2007 office of the deputy special representative to the secretary general odsrsg for recovery and governance united nations mission in liberia 10 see cnl 352 2006 2007 paragraph 15 and cnl 428 2007 2008 paragrap h 13 respectively 11 see cnl 428 2007 2008 paragraph 13 9 submit the draft rbb framework rbb focal points said the time was insufficient to prepare comprehensive accurate and truly representative draft for the mission 12 in addition it was pointed out that headquarters was not always conside rate of the missions particular circumstances for instance requiring the mission to produce its rbb framework during scheduled visit of the secretary general to unmil13 17 oios also note s that upon receipt of the strategic guidance the mission announc ed the event through broadcast email instructing section level rbb focal points to submit their inputs in oios opinion given the short timeframes from hq more proactive and participatory approach in the planning process could yield more useful and ffective outcomes the internal planning process in the mission should start with enough anticipation as to be able to respond to the exigencies and requirements of hq instructions hq offices in turn should at least establish referential timeframes for ny given year so that missions would be better prepared to respond to stringent deadlines in that line unmil should issue detailed mission budget instructions mbi to all components precisely articulat ing the methodology and process for the formulatio n of the rbb framework including vision and priorities of senior leadership this should be followed up by series of formal mission wide rbb meeting s where senior leadership may field questions and comments from their chiefs of sections and rbb focal po ints on the mbi 18 oios note s that coordination between the missions substantive and support components on rbb is weak oios found that there is lack of consultation and communication between the substantive and support components for more precise tailo ring of resource requests both human and financial in line with missions operational needs some sections where their resource only comprised staffing posts observed that their posts remained unchanged even though their outputs and indicators had change d leading to perception that there was direct link between their outputs and resource allocations oios note s that s ome sections from the substantive component claimed to have never been consulted when resource planning for the mission was being fin alized oios learned that to some extent the support component relies on standardized ratios for predicting resource needs for the mission ie units of support input needed per unit of out put14 however conditions on the ground particularly in remot areas of the country often lead to premature obsolescence of physical equipment and delays in logistical assistance in these situations standardized ratios can not be failsafe in predicting resource needs with accuracy however the mission noted that standard ratios are used as guidelines and are adjusted to meet specific needs such as the need for additional vehicles above the ratios in remote locations greater communication and coordination at the outset of the rbb process would help the mission c raft more accurate resource projections in the support component oios also learned that some sections in the support component were already monitoring client satisfaction which suggests that the data collection infrastructure needed to undertake effectiv assessment of client needs may already be in place unmil should therefore improve 12 refer to unmil s strategic guidance for time period provided for planning rbb log frames cnl428 of issue date 24 may 2005 allowing 28 days for submission of 0607 log frames see cnl352 of issu date 28 june 2006 allowing 22 days for submission of 0708 log frames 13 oios acknowledges that this submission deadline was in part driven by the impending budget workshop consultations for which headquarters needed ample time to review the missions rbb frameworks in order to provide meaningful feedback at the workshop 14 for example the number of vehicles would be determined solely on the basis of number of personnel without regard to the specific tasks and the location of the unit 10 coordination between the support and substantive components in the mission to enable better appreciation of resource requirements and also promote transparency of the rb b process 19 oios also note s similar need for coordination between different sections of the substantive component s during preparation of the draft framework overlap in activities often occurs between sections at the mission for example between the civil affairs and human rights and gender affairs sections on areas where both are working with the government on the work of their respective section human rights an d gender affairs for example for expected accomplishments 312 and 313 there are outputs regarding interaction with the government on human rights and civil affairs matters that require input of both the human rights and civil affairs sections15 additionally expected accomplishment 314 and related outputs on gender affairs issues requires input by both the ci vil affairs and gender affairs sections 16 this was also confirmed by interviews with staff members who note d there is often overlap of their work and need to work to coordinate work and hence coordination between different sections d uring the preparation of the framework would be useful overall there is need for formal coordination between them in formulating their respective inputs to the framework in order to avoid duplication and to ensure that appropriate attribution for the activity this point was further expressed by survey respondents with 50 percent of them noting the need for more conduciveness andcollaboration on planning implementation and reporting 20 oios note s that there is protracted submission and plan review pr ocess on finalization of the rbb framework draft it is submitted to headquarters for review and presentation to the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions acabq for endorsement and eventual app roval oios note s that the draft rbb framework from the mission is first reviewed within dpko and dfs by oo fmss and then submitted to oppbapfd for their review this review process involves extensive communications between dpko and oppbapfd through multiple means 17 oios concluded from th data collected from the rbb focal points that the review process at headquarters was not coordinated and often required the mission to provide the same information to different individuals seeking similar clarifications oios notes disparate duplicativ and uncoordinated request for queries on the draft budget proposal coming at different times and from different entities oios also notes that the queries were often similar in nature and could be more efficiently and easily addressed at one time during the review period after review in dpko the draft is then submitted to pfd for their review and in the process more queries are requested from the mission oios concluded that the entire review process could be better coordinated between headquart ers fmss oo and pfd and the mission if the review process was streamlined and formalized resulting in improved efficiency and effectiveness of the process 21 oios note s that the review process from start to final review can last up to three months which wa s frustrating to unmil staff as it deprived them of sense of progress in oios opinion it would be more productive to circulate the draft to all relevant offices in dpko after which joint video conference can then be held between dpko and the mission to discuss the draft and make necessary amendments before forwarding the final draft to pfd once dpko has 15 budget for th united nations mission in liberia for the period 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 a61783 pp 21 22 16 ibid 17 communication with the mission is done using telephone calls email and video conferencing 11 completed review of the draft and submitted it to oppbapfd any queries or outstanding clarif ications should be made to dpko 18 proper feedback and details on the changes that were made to the proposed plans should be properly exchanged and shared between oppb apfd dpko oos and the mission vi analysis of the unmil 2007 2008 rbb framework 22 oios notes that unmils 2007 2008 rbb framework consists of three substantive components security sector peace consolidation and rule of law and support component whereas in the 2006 2007 framework the mission had five components namely ceasefire humanitarian and human rights security reform peace proce ss and support19 oios learned that the framework components were changed from the 2006 2007 rbb framework to reflect progress in the implementation of the mandate under which several key elements of the comprehensive peace agreement of 18 august 2003 eith er had been completed or were on their way to completion additionally the new components reflect the work of the current consolidation phase of the mission and the benchmarks covering this phase20 oios notes some reticence and lack of flexibility on t he part of dpko to make necessary changes to the missions components to reflect the progress made in achieving part of its mandate as well as to reflect the consolidation phase it had now entered into 23 oios observed that despite dpkos reservations to ma ke the changes it was appropriate for unmil to make the relevant change s to the components as these we re in line with the rbb guidelines for peacekeeping operations issued by oppba which outline that the rbb logical frameworks should be aligned with th structure of the mission reflected in either the security council resolution or the secretary generals report21 in oios opinion changes that reflect more accurately the situation and needs on the ground and that reflect the progress made in achieving the mandate should not only be allowed but should be made mandatory in every peacekeeping operation in the case of unmil it would then be appropriate for the components to be changed again in coming years to further reflect the progress of the mission in achieving its mandate 24 in the 2007 2008 framework unmil has total of 9 expected accomplishments 25 indicators of achievement and 107 outputs oios found the framework to be comprehensive and its elements to be specific attainable realistic and mebound however oios found that only 14 of the 25 56 percent indicators of achievement had performance measures ie baselines and targets against which performance could be tracked 22 oios believes that this hampers the 18 at this point fmss and the mission have developed common position on the draft but in the event of other substantive issues being raised by pfd fmss can communicate via telephone or email with the mission 19 ibid p 2 20 budget for the united nations mission in liberia for the period 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 a61783 p 4 21 rbb guidelines 2005 2006 performance reports and 2007 2008 budget proposals peacekeeping finance division office of programme planning budget and accounts department of management 22 oios analysis in this regard is ba sed on baselines and targets that were measurable and indicated the progress of the work of the mission from year to year such as various numbers or percentages that are used to measure progress for example indicator 211 increase in the total number of civil servants returned to their duty stations in the counties 2005 2006 12 missions ability to properly monitor the performance of results most of the rbb focal points surveyed also confirmed that it was difficult to demonstrate results achieved at the end of the cycle either because the mission had implemented programme responding to real time events during the cycle that d id not completely conform with its approved framework or because the indicators of achievement established in the framework were not adequately measur ing the results achieved only 9 percent of respondents were confident that the indi cators of achievement in the framework could accurately measure results 25 oios notes from data collected that the 2007 2008 rbb framework does not fully reflect the total programme of work of some section s instead the sections have their detailed work plans that guide their work programme while the rbb framework details only those aspects of the work programme that are considered to be measurable oios notes that the measurability required of rbb frameworks meant that work of qualitative nature was not included in the framework23 for example the results of the frequent interaction by the office of gender affairs with g overnment of liberia in the area of technical assistance is very difficult to measure and when quantified in terms of number of meetin gs the qualitative nature of assistance provided cannot be appropriately reflected in the framework survey respondents suggested that the rbb framework would better reflect the work of their respective sections if the components included short narrativ paragraph outlining the sections work plans and overall purpose 26 oios learned that the rbb framework only reflected work that could be predicted in advance because it was prepared 9 to 12 months ahead of its implementation sixty two percent of respon dents in senior mission leadership said that their flexibility would be unduly restricted if they focused only on the outputs and indicators stipulated in the framework they said that the framework did not capture all the activities performed by the missi on in its response to changing situations noting that several activities become necessary after approval of the framework or because of the need for collaboration with stakeholders whose activities are not necessarily reflected in the framework oios conc luded that unmil could be performing some tasks that may not be reflected in the rbb framework either because the rbb framework is not being adjusted to reflect current outputs and indicators or because the work cannot be measured using the indicators of chievement established in the approved framework recommendation was made to oppba and dpko to review the framework methodology for reflecting both qualitative and quantifiable indicators based on similar findings in the review of rbb in unmi k24 27 oios tes that unmil has gender affairs office in accordance with security council resolution 1325 200025 on women peace and security the office is located in the office of the s pecial representative of the secretary general s rsg and gender is treated as cross cutting issue across the mission programme of work unmil recently moved the gender 1200 2006 2007 1400 2007 2008 2400 indicators of achievement of the yesno type are only considered appropriate if the indicator of achievement pertains to critical i ssue and it can be objectively verified 23 for example both civil and gender affairs frequently interact with the government of liberia and its varying needs and demands with technical assistance this assistance and interaction is difficult to quantify and if quantified the qualitative nature of the work is hard to reflect in the framework 24 oios report on the review of results based budgeting in united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik 6 august 2007 recommendation sp 07001004 paragraph 46 25 sres13252000 31 october 2000 13 office from the support to the substantive component oios found that gender mainstreaming is represented throughout the substantive components of the rbb framewor k with nine gender initiatives appearing in the 20072008 rbb framework26 oios further notes that in developing the draft rbb framework unmils rbb focal point has successfully integrated gender mainstreaming principles into the substantive component ins tead of under the support component as was previously don oios commends unmil for taking the initiative to incorporate gender issues where appropriate such as promoting gender balance in the police force27 and the reintegration of war affected populati ons in host communities28 these examples represent good practice of monitoring the gender aspects of the work of the mission and to have specific and measurable targets that are relevant and achievable vii linkages of rbb to strategic planning and manage ment 28 impip incorporates the various mission objectives and p lans including the integrated mandate implementation plan imip and the rbb framework impip constitutes the benchmarking and development plan for unmil and is also closely aligned to the four pillar framework of the g overnment of liberia 29 oios found i t to be comprehensive planning framework that provides strategic direction and options for decision making in line with the united nations priorities impip also provides mechanism for unmil t link its work to that of other united nations agencies working in liberia30 29 oios note s that impip has evolved as unmils strategic planning framework representing the missions operational and management plan for implementing and supporting strategic go als and objectives integrating the work of the components as well as harmonizing the work of external partners and stakeholders engaged in development work in liberia such as other agencies funds and programmes however being long term macro plann ing framework sometimes spanning three or more years impip does not represent concise linkage between strategic planning and resource allocation for this the rbb framework can serve as the driver for planning and estimating resources oriented toward s achieving intended results and on providing important feed back for day to day management in the mission in that regard oios notes positively unmil senior leaderships efforts in linking missions rbb framework to impip and in applying rbb as tool fo r planning and operational decision making although rbb is clearly not regarded as the strategic planning tool for the mission respondents were able to clearly demonstrate how it links to the mission strategic planning process through impip31 26 see nine gender items from 0708 log frame ioa 132 plus one

national security economic revitalization strengthening governance and the rule of law and rehabilitating infrastructure and basic social services 30 for example unmil and the united nations county support teams cst j ointly produce the county assessment and action report which outlines cross cutting issues in the key areas of the four pillars and the united nations development assistance framework undaf which is the overall framework under which programmes are deve loped for support to national priorities and joint programmes are encouraged when and where feasible 31 oios survey results on the review of rbb in pkos administered to all missions including unmil 14 30 in result sbased approach it is useful that expected results are transposed into unitsection work plans in order to obtain clear picture of whether the expected results have been achieved and to help cla rify the attribution or contribution to achieving such res ults large number of unmil respondents mentioned using impip as work planning tool in their day to day operations for example the legal and judicial system support division ljssd and its subunits work plans for the current year are in line and in tegrated with the priorities and projects included in the strategy agreed by rule of law task force as reflected in impip oios commends unmil for its robust programme planning in which unit work plans serve to inform individual work plans for mission staf f including senior managers 31 oios also established that through their involvement in impip senior management are fully engaged and supportive of the work of rbb focal points with regard to the framework and budget being an integral component of the impip process there is full ownership and accountability for the rbb framework on the part of senior leadership in the mission in that context oios note s with satisfaction that unmil is progressing in the right direction in its gradual implementation of the principles of rbb in its strategic planning process and establishing more comprehensive results based management approach for example oios found that it was appropriate for unmil to continuously review its progress according to the impip and adjust its log frame components to reflect the achievement of the missions mandate and the consolidation phase it is in now such changes are in line with oppba guidelines requiring alignment with mission structure security council resolutions and the secretary generals reports dpko might benefit from review of the lessons emerging from unmils experiences with rbb particularly with regard to the integration of rbb into strategic planning and with other results based approaches in peacekeeping to improve manage ment and decision making viii performance measurement monitoring and reporting 32 performance measurement at the mission level is two fold tracking progress on efficiency ie whether inputs and activities were converted into the planned outputs according to plans and schedules and monitoring effectiveness by way of determining the extent to which results were achieved as planned although the focus of performance measurement under rbb is on results and its various dimensions there should be equal emphasis n the efficient use of resources and alignment of work processes while t he improved integration and cohesion of rbb with impip in unmil should lead to greater efficiency in the delivery of services and achievement of results oios notes that the staff per formance appraisal cycle pas beginning in april each year is not consistent with the missions rbb cycle which starts in july the resultant inconsistency in staff performance and mission performance cycles lead to potential inefficiencies in work plan ning and performance assessments 32 33 oios found unmil to be in compliance with the requirement for submitting the portfolio of evidence which is part of the controllers instructions for rbb frameworks the portfolio of evidence should provide data on miss ion performance and ultimately establish an audit trail for verification by management oio s notes that an audit conducted in 2006 found 32 interviews with chiefs of sections 15 discrepancies between the outputs reported in the portfolio of evidence and the actual numbers reported in supporting d ocumentation provided by the mission33 in response to this observation the mission developed and introduced system and guidelines for preparation of the portfolio of evidence every six months and data collection record template that chiefs of section s maintain for their respective indicators34 oios commends unmil for responding to the audit recommendations and developing robust system for collecting data for the portfolio of evidence 34 in addition oios also found that rbb focal points were monitori ng and reporting performance data for their respective sections on regular basis throughout the year however oios note s that it was being done in an ad hoc manner and they were not making use of the data collection record template developed in the miss ion35 the focal points used different methods and techniques for collecting and reporting performance data ranging from use of spreadsheets internal correspondence by email and ther manual notations oios note s that there was systematic process to collect and aggregate data received from the different rbb focal points oios is aware that this might be addressed through the enterprise budgeting application eba project to modernize budgeting and performance reporting for peacekeeping missions that oppba is working on however in the interim unmil could improve its monitoring and reporting of performance data by making use of the data collection record template already developed in the mission and exploring the potential for automating some of these processes if anything on temporary basis and through the most efficient and economical means perhaps by using systems that already are in place elsewhere ix capacity development 35 oios learned that the support component rbb focal points and chiefs f sections who are all directly involved with rbb at the mission had not received training on rbb this was further corroborated through the survey respondents from unmil 36 oios further learned that the mission had requested training team from fmss t visit the mission and conduct training but due to budget constraints this was not approved37 oios found however that training session for the substantive component focal points had just been conducted by the missions integrated mission training cente r imtc in may 2007 although the rbb focal points from the suppor t component did not take part in the training they did however review the training material developed by imtc and provided feedback on it oios commends this effort but encourages dpko to develop maintain and disseminate to missions standardized training materials on rbb in order to ensure that there is common understanding of procedures terms and methodology used in rbb dpko should further ensure that such materials for rbb is regular ly updated and is readily available to all missions 36 oios also note s that unmil does not have standard operating procedures sops for rbb to underscore the importance of sops oios asked rbb focal points what they understood as their role in the miss ion in regard to rbb and note s the variances in their 33 oios audit re port ap200662603 unmil results based budgeting portfolio of evidence 5 february 2007 34 unmil memorandum results based budgeting portfolio of evidence and performance reports 19 january 2007 35 focus group interviews with rbb focal points 36 none f the respondents said they had received any formal rbb training or preparation on rbb 37 interview with senior management and rbb focal points in unmil 16 responses ranging from drafting the framework 31 percent b coordinating and follow up 31 percent c reporting 15 percent and d 23 percent could not specify their role oios note s that none of the respondents indicated monitoring of the rbb framework to be their role oios also notes that for rbb to be fully institutionalized in the mission staff should have rbb information available to understand the processes and mechanism used to determine the missions plans and gauge its success as noted in related oios report on unmik there are several documents and materials with relevant information in dpko that can be used for drafting detailed sops and oios urges unmil to use these to devel op mission sops for rbb focal points38 x best practices 37 oios observed that every section in unmil has two rbb focal points including an alternate focal point that participates in all rbb activities throughout the year and is kept informed on all relev ant matters concerning the section in the rbb framework this enables sections to have continual presence of focal point on rbb despite high staff turnover and other absence such s vacation and sick leave in oios opinion this is good practice that could be replicated in other missions 38 oios was also informed that many staff members would find it useful to have list of best practice terms for the rbb framework particularly on indicators of achievement and outputs which should be compiled and disseminated mission wide they suggested that separate list containing terminology that was approved in previous rbb frameworks could be compiled for every component 39 the list of terms would serve as useful guide in developing indicators of achiev ement and outputs for the sections while also enabling staff members to appreciate the terminology used in the other sections in formulation of rbb terminology in addition as was also notes in the report on unmik oios learned that there is little formal sharing of best practices related to rbb except for the informal exchanges that take place at dpkos annual workshops and some reference on the oppba rbb website even then only few respondents in unmil claimed to be aware of this website and none d any memory of visiting the web site recently b ased on similar findings in the review of rbb in unmik recommendation was made to dpko to develop tools such as peacekeeping rbb website and compendium of rbb best practice s40 xi conclusion 39 an integrated approach to budget and planning in peacekeeping operations is necessary for achieving an appropriate allocation of resources and for managin g these resources efficiently oios concluded that unmil is on the right path in its implementation of the principle s of rbb 38 dpko document titled rbb process and people table and peacekeepers pocket guide on rbb terminolo gy 39 focus group interviews with rbb focal points 40 oios report on the review of results based budgeting in the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik dated 6 august 2007 recommendation sp 07001010 paragraph 52 17 and has established solid foundation for its eventual transition to full fledged results based approach that can support management decision making unmils s enior leadership is fully supportive of rbb and there appear s to be general accepta nce and buy in for rbb at the different levels of the mission oios also found the practice in unmil of appointing alternative rbb focal points for each section to be good practice that can be replicated in other missions 40 oios found however that the ssion rbb process could be strengthened by increasing intramission coordination between the support and substantive components and by more careful formulation of indicators that have specific baselines and targets oios also note s the absence of formal mechanism for the issuance of mission budget instructions and formal meeting for intramission dialogu between senior leadership chiefs of sections and rbb focal points oios is of view that such forum would present staff with opportunity to better u nderstand the vision and priorities of senior leadership and thereby reflect these aspects adequately in the rbb framework xii recommendations 41 oios has made eight recommendations in this report in addition oios found that some of the rbb issues in unmil are common to other missions and may have been observed in the report on unmik some recommendations arising from such findings were already made in the oios report on the review of rbb in unmik dated 6 august 2007 and have therefore not been repeated in this report except for those recommendations specifically directed to the mission 42 recommendation 1 unmil should formalize procedures for issuance of comprehensive set of mission budget instructions based on the dpko guidance to anticipate rticulate and coordinate processing of the rbb framework 17 sp07 003001 43 in regard to recommendation 1 unmil noted that budget instructions are being issued each year and it is committed to continue this practice and hence suggested closur of the recommendation however oios reiterates the recommendation after review of the mission budget instructions which are not sufficiently comprehensive as they deal mostly with the support component and not all of the components at the mission oios will further review the implementation of this recommendation and its closure once it is verified that more specific budget instructions are issued 44 recommendation 2 unmil should establish formal mechanism s to enhance coordination between substantive nd support components and among its sections in the preparation and planning phase of the rbb framework paras 1819 sp07003002 45 concerning recommendation 2 unmil confirmed that the substantive sections lead the rbb process by formulating their s ections plans first which is then utilized by the support component sections to prepare their rbb and cost estimates in support of the substantive elements draft substantive rbb plans are circulated by the chief budget officer to all support internal code used by the office of internal oversight services for recording recommendations 18 component sections for review and adjustment of their plans before costing are done to ensure that the outputs are in line with one another substantive and support additionally mission planning guidelines such as the force overwatch concept of operation and th unpol deployment plan are developed in cooperation with the joint logistics operation centre and discussed at length in support section chiefs meetings unmil noted that t hese procedures are working well and are assisting the mission to facilitate coor dination among the parties in formulating the rbb frameworks and hence suggested that this recommendation be closed however oios reiterates this recommendation and emphasizes the need to establish formal coordination mechanism between the missions co mponents and among its sections in the preparation and planning phase of the rbb framework oios acknowledges that sufficient coordination is occurring within the sectionscomponents through different mechanisms such as the force overwatch concept unpol deployment plan but did not find sufficient coordination between the missions components nor was there any established formal mechanism to ensure such coordination takes place 46 recommendation 3 unmil in conjunction with dpko headquarters should develop streamlined process for review and feedback of the draft rbb framework between headquarters and the mission ensuring that all entities involved are kept fully aware of the progress and changes made to the missions plan paras 2021 sp07003 003 47 recommendation 4 unmil should ensure that indicators of achievement in the rbb framework clearly establish performance measures so that actual progress can be based on specific baselines and targets 24 sp07003004 48 recommendation 5 dpko sh ould document best practices regarding the integration of the different levels of work planning in unmil as well as the use of lessons learned in adjusting subsequent work plans and include them in the rbb planning guidelines additionally compendium f good practices and lessons learned on the implementation of rbb should be developed and be made available to all missions s 2831 sp07003005 49 from comments concerning recommendation 5 oios is pleased to note various developments that are t aking place in dpkodfs including review of the needs and opportunities for survey of best practices on rbb including those developed by unmil once the lead team and structures are in place oios awaits further progress in this area 50 recommendatio n 6 unmil should streamline the monitoring and reporting of performance data by rbb focal points through the use of the data collection record template automation of the monitoring and reporting essentials should be explored and if successful applied to all peacekeeping missions until the eba becomes operational 34 sp07003006 51 in regard to recommendation 6 unmil noted that it will re issue the srsg instruction of 19 january 2007 which sets out responsibilities and timelines in the collectio n of data and reporting thereof oios awaits further progress in this area 19 52 oppba noted that they had previously commented in their response to the oios report on rbb at unmik that the project for development and implementation of eba is i n place as planned and approved by legislative bodies the eba project is driven based on detailed project timeline including all aspects of training for its introduction in peacekeeping oios notes these comments and reiterates that until eba is fully operational automation of the monitoring and reporting essentials should be explored to ensure that the monitoring and reporting of performance data is done 53 recommendation 7 dpko should develop standardized training materials on rbb for use by the integrated mission training centers in missions on an ongoing basis 35 sp07003007 54 dfs commented that training materials on rbb is being used by missions as the basis for training to officers and focal points at the field missions and t hese training materials have been used at number of rbb workshops conducted between 2002 2005 they further mentioned that dpko in partnership with pfd and d epartment of management has developed training materials for budget workshops which included training on rbb for missio n personnel in unmi l 2003 unoci 2004 unmis 2005 unmik 2005 and onub 2005 they also noted that the controllers budget instructions have guidance on best practices to facilitate the formulation of rbb frameworks also dpko has published on its peacekeeping intranet reference document containing all budget and performance reports on rbb frameworks to provide missions with examples of how other missions formulate rbb elements based on this information they suggested that this recommendatio n be deleted oios acknowledges the training material s on rbb that have been used at rbb workshops conducted between 2002 05 however the material is available in the form of customized presentations for each workshop and do not provide template of rbb training materials specific to missions additionally these training materials were most recently used in 2005 and may require updating with relevant examples from missions furthermore as noted in the report paragraph 3 5 none of the rbb focal point s and chiefs of sections reported having received any training on rbb the mission requested for standardized training material to be provided to the imtc to be utilized for training at the mission oios reiterates the recommendation and encourages dpko dfs to develop standardized training materials on rbb based on available materials for the use of imtcs in missions on an ongoing basis 55 recommendation 8 unmil should develop clear sops using existing material and documentation on rbb and effectively d isseminate them including through the mission intranet website this could also be included in the briefing package provided to new staff members that join the mission 36 sp07003008 56 dfs commented in regard to recommendation 8 that the recom mendation has been implemented as unmil has prepared comprehensive rbb process and theory training presentations which were approved in june 2007 unmil noted that t hey have been reflected on the best practices website and were also circulated to the subs tantive section chiefs and rbb focal points unmil also noted that t he srsgs instruction of 19 january 2007 clearly sets out roles and responsibilities and are available to the new staff members who join the mission as noted in paragraph 3 6 oios ackno wledges the presence of several documents and material with 20 relevant information on rbb in dpkodfs but reiterates the need to use these materials to develop clear sops and disseminate them to rbb focal points in the missio n to ensure that focal points hav guidance on the ir role and responsibilities with the rbb process
