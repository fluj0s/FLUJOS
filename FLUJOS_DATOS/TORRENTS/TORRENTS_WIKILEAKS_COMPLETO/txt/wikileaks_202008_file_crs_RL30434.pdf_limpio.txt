modernization act of 2000 derivatives regulation reconsidered summary in december 2000 congress passed the commodity futures modernization act the most significant amendments to the commodity exchange act in 25 years this report describes the historical market developments and the major issues that shaped consideration of that legislation in 1974 congress created new independe nt agency the commodity futures trading commission cftc to oversee trading in derivative financial instruments derivatives which are used to avoid ri sk of price changes in some underlying commodity or financial variable or in search of speculative profits from the same price changes were on the verge of major expansion from contracts based on farm commodities and minerals to finan cial futures base d on bonds currencies and interest rates the commodity ex change act cea amendments in 1974 gave the cftc exclusive jurisdiction with some exceptions over derivatives regardless of the nature of the underlyi ng commodity or interest during the 1980s however new derivatives market grew up where neither the cftc nor any other agency exercised comprehensive oversight derivatives can now be divided into exchangetraded cft cregulated instru ments and overthe counter otc instruments the two type s of instruments serve the same economic functions and are often in direct competiti on however the existence of two markets where the 1974 commodity exchan ge act amendments envisioned single market regulated by the cftc led many to conclude that the cea was out of date and in need of major revision the futures exchanges contended that cea regulation put them at competitive disadvantage versus the unregulated otc market otc market participants claimed that the cftcs exclusive jurisdiction unde r the cea created legal risk for them otc contracts could possibly have been inva lidated by court finding that they were in fact illegal offexchange futures contr acts both groups viewed the cea as an impediment to financial innovation and portray ed themselves as vulnerable to foreign competition joint group of us financial regula tors recommended in 1999 that the cea be amended to 1 exclude certain otc derivatives from the cea and 2 permit the deregulation of financial futures except when they are marketed to small investors on the grounds that these contracts are less susceptible to manipulation than physical commodities this was the general approach followed by the congress in enacting the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 this report analyzes the transformation of derivatives markets and the legislative response and will not be upda ted the legislati on passed by the106th congress the commodity futures modern ization act of 2000 is described

the major issues that were involved in the consideration and passage of the commodity futures mode rnization act of 2000 hr 5660 pl 106 554 the legislation that created the cftc in 19741 contains sunset provision the agency must be reauthorized periodica lly the cftcs authorization expired on september 30 2000 reauthorization legisla tion has usually been the vehicle for consideration of regulatory issues related to futures and derivatives markets the reauthorization legislation considered and passed in 2000 ar described in crs report rs20560 derivatives regulation legislation in the 106th congress this report provides background on the ma jor reauthorization issues the 2000 reauthorization process took pl ace as many regulators and market participants were calling for fundamental reevaluation of the commodity exchange act cea the statutory basis for the cftc basic changes in the cea and in the regulation of financial deri vatives were proposed and ev entually enacted markets had changed dramatically since the cftc was created and the existing regulatory framework was under challenge from all sides some analysts claimed that cftc type regulation was unnecessary in most of the markets where it then applied that it slowed financial innovation and that it placed the us futures and derivatives industries at disadvantage relative to th eir foreign competition much of which did not exist in 1974 on the other hand some believed that deregu lation or the growth of unregulated derivatives markets may pose serious risks to market participants and to the stability of the global financial system what is the appropriate framework for the regulation of financial derivatives which federal regulator shoul d have jurisdiction over whic h forms of trading and how can jurisdictional quarrels among regulato rs be prevented to what extent can industry selfregulation be re lied upon to maintain fair st able and efficient markets these broad questions the background agai nst which congress in 2000 weighed the future of the cftc are examined briefly in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs2 2 futures contracts are markedtomarket daily losses must be paid up and gains are credited to the winners accounts trader may take his profits at any time up to the expiration of the contract by entering into an opposite or offsetting contract so that his net obligation to buy and sell the commodity is ze ro holders of physical commodity futures have the option of settling the contract by making or taking delivery of the commodity itself at expiration but only about 07 of us futures contracts are settled this way the rest are settled in cash 3 the original version of this report was written in early 2000 when many internet companies shares traded at over 100 in early 2003 cisco trades at under 15share making the option described above profitable indeedbackground derivative markets derivatives are financial in struments or contracts whos value is linked to the price of some underlying commodity or fi nancial variable ther are several forms of derivatives the bestknown variations are futures contracts options and swap agreements but all have this common centr feature two parties promise to make transaction or series of transactions in the future at price that is agreed upon today it is expected that the underlying price or rate will fluctuate over the life of the contract but the price specified in the derivative instrument remains fixed if they succeed in forecasting the direction of pri ces derivatives trad ers will be entitled to buy the underlying commodity for less or ll for more than the going market price for every winner there is loser here are three examples trader who expects the february price of corn of 220bushel to rise over the spring and summer may enter into long futures contract committing himself to buy 5000 bushels at that price promise to sell is short contract if the price rises to 230 the contract gains value the trad er can buy 5000 bus hels at 220 thanks to the futures contract and sell them at the market price of 230 making profit of 10 cents per bushel or 500 which is credited to the traders account2 an option to sell 100 shares of cisco systems stock at 120share3 has an intrinsic value of 1000 if the current market price is 110 100 x the 10 price differential if the market price rises above 120 the option is out of the money and the holder will not exercise it the difference between options and futures is that the option buyer is not obliged to ma ke the transaction on unfavorable terms if prices fail to move as expected in exchange for this right the seller of the option receives cash premium financial institution with large am ounts of floatingrate debt fears that interest rates are about to rise which would increase its debt service costs it enters into an interest rate swap it agrees to pay its swap dealer fixed rate of intere st on principal amount equal to itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs3 4 the principal in an interest rate swap is notional or imaginary it is never actually exchanged but serves as reference point to determine the size of the swap payments 5 in addition to its intrinsic value the diffe rence between the market price and the options exercise or strike price an option has tim value the probability that its value will increase before expirationoutstanding debt4 and in return will receive floatingrate payment on the same principal amount thus if interest rates do rise the swap payments it makes remains constant while the swap payment it receives rises allowing it to meet the rising claims of its floating rate creditors the swap converts floatingrate to fixedrate debt thus the owner of derivative gains or loses as the underlying price or rate changes without actually owni ng the underlying commodity itself derivatives allow traders to take position in markets at fr action of the cost of buying an equivalent amount of the underlying item 5000bushe l corn futures contract might require an initial cash outlay called margin payment of about 500 even though the total underlying commodity value is 11000 to buy 100 shares of cisco at 110share would also cost 11000 but the pr emium price of the option described above might be less than 11005 derivatives speculation is therefore said to be leveraged because traders take relativel large positions in markets with relatively little capital outlay as result the effect s of changes in the underlying commoditys price are magnified if cisco stock ri ses by 10 the option holder doubles his money leverage also implies th risk of large sudden losses derivatives are often descri bed as bets on future price changes this is not incorrect but it is incomplete derivatives can be used to speculate but they can also provide protection against the risk of unfavorab turns in prices or interest rates on the other side of corn speculators contract might be farmer who feared that prices in the fall would be even lower taking the short side would allow him to sell at 220bushel matter how low the market price went similarly the financial institution in the third example above uses an interest rate swap not to seek trading profits but to protect itself agai nst rise in interest rates derivatives are used by businesses units of government and financial institutions to manage risk often they permit the unbundling of risks in ways that give market participants greater control over the risks they assume for example the holder of foreign bond faces two separate ri sks that is the value of the bond will fall if 1 interest ra tes rise or 2 the currency in which the bond is denominated loses value relative to the holders domestic curre ncy using derivatives the holder may choose to assume either of these risks or to pass them off to someone else in sum derivatives users can be divi ded into two groups who use the markets for opposite purposes speculators seek to profit by anticipating future price changes while hedgers whose business generally involves them in the cash market for the underlying item avoid price risk by transferring it to others namely the speculatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs4 6 although notional principal is the only basis fo r comparing the two markets it is not very satisfactory measure notional value does not convey any useful information about the market value or riskiness of particular in strument moreover contracts are traded much more frequently on the exchanges so that co mparisons of value outstanding at the end of period may be misleading as gauge of total market activity 7 bank for international settlements the global otc derivatives market at endjune 1999 november 1999 5 p available on the internet at wwwbisorgdevelopment of derivatives markets derivatives began as an adjunct to agriculture producers distributors and processors of farm commodities devised futures options and forward contracts to protect themselves against rising or fallin g prices these mark ets became the futures exchanges and flourished because of the ex istence of speculators willing to assume the risks that others wished to avoid in the 1970s the chicago futures exchanges expanded the market dramatically by introducing contracts based on financial instruments potential derivatives user s now included not just producers and commercial users of commodities but any business whose profits were affected by interest rates or foreign exch ange rates today as figu re 1 shows financial futures and currency futures account for about 23 of contracts traded on us exchanges the success of financial fu tures attracted competition in the 1980s banks and securities firms those who dealt in the actual stocks bonds and currencies underlying financial futures began to offe r swap contracts and options that had the same functions as exchangetraded future s they could be used to hedge or speculate growth in these markets has b een explosive as figure 2 below shows the new derivatives market where swaps and similar instruments are traded overthecounter otc or offexchange has grown much faster than the exchangetraded derivative market since its inception in the 1980s in terms of the notional principal amount of contracts in force6 when other otc instruments such as options and forward agreements are in cluded the total notional value of the otc market was 814 trillion in june 19997 traders often view otc contracts nd exchangetraded futures and options contracts as close substitutes the ove rthecounter and the exchange markets compete for the same business central issue for the cftc reauthorization in 2000 was whether regulation under the cea put the us futures industry at competitivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs5 figure 1 notional value of otc swaps versus exchangetrade d financial contracts 199199 disadvantage relative to the otc markets and to foreign futures exchanges pre2000 regulation of derivatives federal regulation of futu res trading dates from the grain futures act of 1922 pl 67331 which became the commodity exchange act however the major features of the pre2000 regulatory framework date from 1974 when congress perceived that derivatives markets were on the verge of expanding from contracts based on farm commodities and metals into financial futures contracts based on government bonds interest rates and later stock inde xes in response to the growing economic scope and importance of futures trading congress replaced the existing futures regulator an office within the department of agriculture with an independent agency the cftc with excl usive jurisdiction with few important exceptions over all derivatives trading re gardless of the nature of the underlying commodity the cea as amended in 1974 specified that trading of derivatives any contracts that were in the character of futures contracts was to take place only on registered futures exchange whose rule s and practices were under cftc regulation the rationale for this grant of regulatory authority was that derivatives are susceptible to manipulation and excessive speculation which can cause artificially high or low prices in the underlying cash markets or in extreme cases instability and panic in the financial system at time when oil and other commodities we re in short supply and prices were soaring congress sought strong law to pr otect investors and to insulate the economy from the potentially distorting effects of derivatives trading much as the securities and exchange commission sec was created in 1934 in response to the stock market crash of 1929httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs6 8 in april 1993 the cftc issued separate exemption for otc energy derivatives these would not be considered subject to the cea as long as all parties were actually involved in the underlying energy businesses all contracts were subject to negotiation as to their material terms contracts were held to expira tion rather than traded actively and all trades involved only principals see federal register v 58 april 20 1993 p 21286however the extension of exclusive juri sdiction to the cftc had to take note of other agencies claims the major excep tions to the cftcs exclusive jurisdiction were contained in the socalled treasur amendment part of the 1974 law the treasury expressed concern that exclusive cftc jurisdiction would conflict with the us government securities market and the foreign exchange market where several forms of offexchange contracts very simila r to futures and options were in common use these were professional markets wh ere small investors were not present and were for the most part unregulated they were in the treasurys view performing in satisfactory manner without signifi cant government oversight therefore treasury saw reason why these selfregu lating markets should be brought under cftc regulation congress wrote the treasury amendment into law excluding contracts based on us government securities or foreign exchange from the provisions of the cea what one could have foreseen in 1974 was the development of the otc swap market despite the fact that swaps and futures serve exactly the same economic purposes and are sometimes interchangeable the cftc generally exercised regulatory authority over th otc market how did this market now measured in the tens of trillions of dollars develop outside the regulatory framework of the cea as the market was estab lished in the1980s the cftc made move to assert its jurisdiction the major swaps dealers were large banks and securities firms rather than the futures brokers that were cftc registrants banking regulators took laissezfaire attitude perhaps viewing swaps as welcome source of income for depository institutions whose recent results in commercial and international lending had ranged from poor to disastr ous securities brokerdealers tended to locate their swaps business in unregulated affiliates where sec authority was extremely limited still legal uncertainty remained could the courts rule that swaps were in fact in the character of futures contracts and thus illegal nd unenforceable unless traded on cftcregulated exchange in 1989 the cftc issued an exemption for swaps which was revised in 1993 pursuan t to the futures trading practices act of 1992 pl 1025468 under the terms of the 1993 exemption swaps would not be regulated under the cea as long as they t four conditions that distinguished them from exchangetraded futures swaps may be traded only by eligible participants that is financial institutions corporations governmental units and individuals with assets over 10 million the terms of swap agreements must be individually negotiated between the counterparties rather than standardized contracts like futures and exchangetraded options httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs7 9 all futures contracts are guaranteed agains t one partys default through the exchanges clearing house an association of exchange mbers which in effect takes the opposite side of each trade thus the creditworthiness of th other party is not consideration to futures traders under the exemption sw ap traders must assess and assume the risk of counterparty default themselves 10 presidents working group on financial markets overthecounter derivatives markets and the commodity exchange act november 1999 35 p hereinafter cited as working group report the working group consists of the secretary of the treasury and the chairmen of the federal reserve the sec and the cftcthe creditworthiness of the counterparty must be material consideration in swaps transactions9 and there must be multilateral transaction execution facility ie swaps exchange in 2000 the financial swap market satisfi ed only the first of these conditions many swap contracts are standardized and fungible and are traded shortterm like any other financial instrument both in the united states and elsewhere swaps exchanges and clearing houses had been intr oduced or proposed therefore the legal uncertainty of possible conflict with the cftcs exclusive jurisdiction remained and there were concerns that the cea and the cftc exemptions were preventing the swaps market from adopting features of the exchange system eg the clearing house that would improve market safety and efficiency or may have pushed such developments abroad legal uncertainty in the us otc market was major issue in the 2000 cftc reauthorization market participants nd regulators supported making the current exemptions from the cea matter of statut rather than regulation thereby settling the long dispute over who does or should have regulatory ju risdiction over swaps this was done by the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 as described in crs report rs20560 derivatives regulation legislation in the 106th congress regulatory jurisdiction over derivatives regulation of otc contracts jurisdiction over otc derivatives was central issue in the 2000 cftc reauthorization congressional efforts to address the issue in the past were made difficult by disagreements among federal regulators 1999 report issued by the presidents working group on financial markets however showed that the regulators had reached consensus on this and some related issues10 the report recommended that swaps and other otc ma rkets should be excluded from the cea provided 1 that retail inve stors are active in the markets and 2 that the contractshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs8 11 while the working group did not recommend that finite supply commodities be excluded from the cea because of manipulati on concerns it did endorse the exemption for energy derivatives that the cftc had issued in 1993 and urged that the cftc retain and use its exemptive authority in those markets that it did regulate 12 ibid p 16 13 swaps exchange could mean greater transparency as prices became available to all market participants the ability to open and close positions quickly could increase liquidity reducing the cost of hedging clearing house would reduce the cost of monitoring counterparties creditworthiness again possibly lowering the costs of hedging 14 testimony before the senate banking comm ittee on the report of the presidents working group on financial markets hearing 106th congress 2nd session february 10 2000 15 clearing house is vehicle by which the mark et collectively assumes the risk of default continuedtraded are not based on nonfinancial commodities whose supply is finite11 these recommendations proceeded from the regulators conclusion that the two justifications for ceastyle regulation of derivatives small i nvestor protection and the potential for price manipulation did not apply to the swaps market that is participants in that market are sophisticated and have th means to protect their own interests and secondly mani pulation of interest or exchange rates via the swaps market has not been observed in 20 years and is highly unlikely to occur in the future12 in short the regulators argue that the swaps market is like the government bond market or the foreign exchange market where the general longstanding view is that public interest is served by more than minimal regulatory presence the choice before congress in 2000 was whether to accept the recommendations of the working group it could choose to exclude swaps from the cea by expanding the existing exempti on to permit swaps clearing houses and exchangelike trading facilities and making the exclusion matter of statute rather than of regulation the effect of such action besides reducing legal uncertainty in the swaps market would be to allow the otc market to adopt features clearing houses and multilateral trading sy stems of the exchange markets to strengthen self regulation in other words some viewed such changes in the marketplace as not only desirable in themselves13 but essential to protect the u s industry federal reserve chairman alan greenspan testified on february 10 2000 that i see real risk that if we fail to rationalize our regulation of centralized trading mechanisms for financial instru ments these markets and the related profits and employment opportunities will be lost to foreign jurisdictions that maintain the confidence of global invest ors without imposing so many regulatory constraints14 the working groups implicit conclusion was that unregulated financial speculation is generally benign the othe r view of speculation embodied in the pre2000 cea is that it may at times beco excessive and th at artificial and unwelcome price volatility and market instability may follow accordingly congress could have chosen to apply to the otc market some of the regulatory requirements that applied to the exchan ges the working group recommends that swaps clearing houses which represent concentration of risk15 should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs9 15 continued removing the risk that single swaps dealer could be hurt by customer default on the other hand clearing house failure during vere market disruption could cause wider systemic problems than single dealer failure 16 working group report p 19 the report does not make specific recommendations as to the kind of regulatory oversight that would be desirable 17 ibid p 34 this would involve amending the securities laws as well as the ceaoverseen by some federal regulator or foreign regulator that sets appropriate standards but acknowledges that jurisdic tional problems may emerge as differently regulated institutions offer clearing services for contracts based on many different underlying interests16 the working group report also recommende d that currently unregulated otc derivatives dealers should be required to disclose certain fina ncial information to regulators in order that the regulators ma be aware of developing problems in the otc dealer affiliate that may threaten the regulated parent firm whose financial stability is matter of public interest17 other aspects of cea and exchangetype regulation that congress could have imposed on otc dealers include minimum capital standards registrati on of personnel reporting of large trades and market positions various record keeping requirement s disclosure of transaction price and volume data and so on however measures of this type would draw the objection that unilateral us regulation will simply drive the business overseas the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 cfma as enacted excludes financial otc deri vatives from cftc regulation provided that trading occurs only among eligible contract participants financial institutions businesses government units professional traders and brokers institutional investors individuals with over 10 m illion in assets and so on but not small businesses or individual investors derivatives based on agricultural commodities on the other hand remain under cftc jurisdiction nd can only be traded on regulated exchanges all other commodities including energy and metals fall into third category of exempt commodities otc derivatives in exempt commodities may be traded among eligible c ontract participants without cftc regulation but certain cea provisions against fraud and manipulati on continue to apply to these markets otc clearing houses and exchanges are subject to various disclosure and oversight provisions in the cfma th 2000 law contains provisions requiring disclosure by unregulated derivatives dealers deregulation of the futures exchanges the issue of fair competition otc derivatives and exchangetraded financial futures contracts are direct competitors in the marketplace before the 2000 legislation the futures exchanges contended that the unregulated status of the otc markets constituted an unfair competitive advantage the pre2000 cea required the exchanges to submit rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs10 18 such international poaching is not hypothetical singapore dominates the market for japanese stock index futures and london was the center

excluded and which woul d as result be free of most of the requirements of the cea19 similar proposals reappear in the working groups report which questions the need for direct regulation of financial futures markets ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30434crs11 20 working group report p 2123 21 remarks of cftc chairman william j rainer at the 22nd annual chicagokent college of law derivatives and

authority for the cftc to provide regulatory relief for exchangetraded financial futures markets if it determines that such relief is in the public interest20 again the line is drawn between financial futures and contracts based on physi cal commodities where supply is limited making the creation of artificial shortages possible and where the futures markets serve price discovery function that is where the futures market price is benchmark for cash market transactions chairman william rainer of the cftc supported these deregulatory initiatives the cftc had in progress two rulemaking initiatives that would allow the exchanges to introduce new contracts or to change th eir rules without prior cftc approval to the exchanges these were crucial changes that would allow them greater flexibility in responding to competition the chairman stated his intention of moving the cftc from being frontline to an oversight regulator21 this meant basically that the cftc would stand back and let the financia l derivatives markets evolve in response to market forces and step in only if something goes wrong the working group takes similar attitude towards the rapidlychanging otc market such systems should be allowed to grow unburdened by new anticipator statutory structure that could prove entirely in appropriate to their eventual evolution22 the cfma includes provisions that allow the futures exchanges to establish lessregulated or unregulated markets in nonagricultural contracts from which small investors would be excluded as of early 2002 however year after passage of the cfma the exchanges had not proposed to create such unregulated markets it is worth noting that the major costs of exchange trading margin requirements markingtomarket which re quires losses to be paid up daily and clearing fees are not the results of g overnment regulation but of selfregulation they are imposed by the industry itself to assu re market integrity to insure that is that all contracts are fulfilled number of current ventures propose to bring some of these selfregulatory mechanisms to the otc market as noted above however it is not clear that exchangetrading of swaps or swaps clearing house will succeed in the marketplace the major swaps d ealers 10 institutions accounted for 45 of the market at the end of 199823 may resist changes in market structure that could challenge their

market integrity will also influence their choice of trading venues it is uncertain how the futures trading would change if financial futures were deregulated would major features of exchange system such as standardized contracts and uniform margin rules be abandoned even as the otc market considers adopting them an advantage of the otc market is said to be the flexibility of tailoring the terms

exchange system and which the otc market would like to foster other regulatory issues singlestock futures and the shadjohnson accord in november 1999 senators gramm and lugar sent tter to regulators asking for study of the feasibility of removing the pre2000 ban on futu res contracts based on individual stocks the ban dated from the shadjohnson accord of 1982 which demarcates sec and cftc jurisdiction over stockbased deri vatives contracts24 the sec traditionally opposed such futures c ontracts on the grounds that the leverage available in futures contracts purchase of futures contract generally requires cash outlay of only 36 percent of the cash valu of the underlying commodity could lead to excessive price volatility and manipulation of the underlying stocks price and that individual stock futures could also serve as vehicle for illegal insider trading nevertheless the working group report stat that the members agree that the prohibition against singlestock futures can be repealed if issues about the integrity of the underlying securitie s marketare resolved25 the report does not call for immediate repeal however but urges further study of the issue by the sec and the cftc the cfma authorized trading in single stock futures although over the course of consideration of the legislation the instruments came to be known as security futures security futures will be traded on either stock or futures exchange and the sec and cftc will share regulatory jurisdic tion the cfma states that trading may begin one year after enactment but as of december 20 2001 the rules and regulations were not yet in place when trading begins single stock futures can be expected to boost trading volume in futures and in the underlying stoc ks themselves millions of shares are traded

consensus that speculation in financial derivatives by sophisticated institutions and individuals is generally beneficial activity which government regulation is more likely to hinder than help the pre 2000 commodity exchange act with its tailed guidance for market practices and its statutory bias against excessive speculation is viewed by the working groups report and by much of the derivatives industry as an appropriate model for regulation of traditional agricultural commodity futures where shortages occur and attempts to corner or squeeze the market have been more or less successful in the past but the working group report viewed the cea as an obstacle to progress in the new world of derivative finance and as competitive disadvantage to american firms competing in an international market the 2000 cfma responds to most of the recommendations in the working groups report the final legi slation included codificati on of the unregulated status of otc derivatives markets and gave the cftc authority to deregulate the financial futures contracts traded on the exchanges earlier in 1999 the working group issued report on hedge funds unregulated investment pools available only to
