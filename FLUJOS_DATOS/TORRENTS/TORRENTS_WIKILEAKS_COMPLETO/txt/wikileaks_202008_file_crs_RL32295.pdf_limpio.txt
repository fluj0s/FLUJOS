longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and co mmunitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an incremental appr oach to longterm care without major federal policy involve ment leaving to state governments the

modify their programs for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated longterm care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct payments made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benefits and vendor payments ma by states with federal matching payments on behalf of individuals th kerrmills medical ssistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 pred ecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32295crs2 2 us congress senate special committee on aging

home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as resu lt of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments were the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry sign ificant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 in 2003 there were about 16400 nursing homes with 18 million beds3 during the latter part of the 1960s nd the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of th eir state medicaid plan s effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of health education and welfare now

the desires of pers ons with disabilities to remain in their homes and in community settings rather than in institutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative action to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it authorized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of dhhs may waive certain medi caid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the emphasis in the medicaid program on institutional care services under the section 1915c waiver include case management personal care homemaker home health aide adult day care habilitation environmental modifi cations among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their wavier programs notwithstanding wide use of the section 1915c waiver authority by states over the last two decades total spending for medicaid home and communitybased services waivers is significantly less than institutional care about 144 billion in 2001 compared to 531 billion for nursing f acility care services and care for persons with mental retardation in intermediate care

stat officials indiana did not have the expected number of persons leaving nursing facilities and therefore did not obtain the funding for most of the unus ed slots as result the waiver was amended in october 2002 to decrease the maximum number of waiver slots to 6000 indiana is addressing excess nursing hom capacity in number of ways the state received nursing facility transition grant of 770000 in 2001 from the us department of health nd human services dhhs to move persons from nursing homes into the community and to divert persons who live in the community and are at risk of nursing home placement from these facilities8 use of grant funds allows area agencies on aging and nursing hom ombudsmen to identify nursing home residents with relatively low care needs nd inform them about opportunities to move into the community using waiver funding in addition the state has established nursing home occupancy standard to address excess capacity the state has stipulated that if any nursing facility has less than 75 occupancy level then its medicaid reimbursement amount would be reduced some homes have decertified beds as result of this rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32295crs12 9

the issues many states have confront ed is how to serve these people indiana has addressed this issue in part through its community and home options to institutional care for elderly and individuals

for example people with conditions such as cancer or kidney failure could not obtain medicaid coverage16 the state had originally estimated the cost of compliance with the decision to be 850 million that figure declined to 130 million because just 3665 of 17559 persons who were contacted and expected to be eligible for medicaid actually applied and were found eligible for the program the state

persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in the united states changed dramatically over the last half of the 20th century as result of number of converging f actors these include the advo cacy efforts of families and organized constituency groups various changes to the social security law that provided payments to individuals through ssi and social security disability insurance ssdi and to service provide rs through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with mental retardation17 trends in institutional care the early history of services to persons with developmental disabilities and mental retardation is characterized by the development of large state institutions or training schools begun during the latter part of the

for the mentally retarded waiver icfmr waiver 11 years after enactment of the federal law use of the waiver program has affected the type of care for persons with developmental disabilities in that care has been shifted to small communitybased settings the icfmr waiver was replaced with the dd waiver in 2001 the replacement occurred because of serious quality problems that routine cms regional office audit uncovered the regional audit found that the state had failed to insure safe environment in the communitybased waiver settings and that case management and quality assurance systems were inadequate interviewees indicated that safety problems occurred because th ree icfsmr with 40 beds each closed and the state was forced to find placements for the residents quickly and therefore placed residents in communitybased waiver settings that turned out to be unsafe the state reacted to the waiver audit in number of ways it moved administration of the waiver from baihs to the bureau of developmental disabilities services bdds in 2001 in addition the dd waiver was modified to give the state more flexibility to pay for beneficiary participation in community activities vocational skills training and transportation to community activities to improve the quality of services the state has also applied for targeted case management waiver to provide intensive case management to some persons and began requiring 18 months of traini ng for case managers persons with developmental disabilities can choose between area agency on aging aaa case managers and service coordinators from the bdds field offices for intake activities they can choose between aaa case manage rs and private case managers for on going case management activities to address quality the state hired

shortage of different sort occurs among state and local officials as in other states programs have grown in scope without concomitant increases in f unding for the staff needed to administer them consumer direction the state has established pilot programs under the state funded choice program to test consume rdirected personal ssistance services but the programs faltered because only few area agencies on aging participated interviewees attributed this reluctance to confusion about who is considered the employer of the personal assistant and how taxes should be withheld23 in 2001 the legislature enacted provision to provide choice and waiver beneficiaries the opportunity to recruit hire pay supervise and dismiss persona l services attendant housing and tr ansportation interviewees view lack of affordable housing and convenient transportation as major barriers to assist persons with disabilities to remain in the community housing issues include 1 ablebodied people occupying accessible housing that is designed for pe rsons with disabilities and 2 the choice program limiting its home adaptations to one home with 5000 lifetime limit transportation problems are exemplified by the situation in indianapolis where accessible buses cover only part of the city or some routes operate only once day making going to work difficult if not impossible for persons with disabilities quality assurance issues indiana has had quality problems in its section 1915c home and communitybased rvices waivers for persons with developmental disabilities as result th state replaced its fo rmer waiver with new one and implemented new quality assurance mechanisms including use of routine independent audits licensure standards for assisted living facilities have been source of controversy draft regulations were cont roversial because they would have required discharge of residents if they had certa in medical conditions or needed regular assistance with two or more adls at th time of the site visit summer 2002 the department of health was rewriting regu lations to require facilities that provide services themselves to obtain licensure but this would not be necessary if the facilities hired an agency to deliver services in the facility waiting lists the statefunded choice pr ogram had waiting list of 8577 people in sfy2002 decrease from 11922 in sfy200124 some interviewees said that the number of persons on the waiting list may not be good indication of who needs services because some people join the list before they really need care otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32295crs26 interviewees said that the top three ways of getting off the list are in order to die go into nursing home or to receive servi ces generally after wait of 35 to 4 years the state also had long waiting list for its aged and disabled waiver despite the fact that it has many availa ble waiver slots slots re main unused because the state has not appropriated
