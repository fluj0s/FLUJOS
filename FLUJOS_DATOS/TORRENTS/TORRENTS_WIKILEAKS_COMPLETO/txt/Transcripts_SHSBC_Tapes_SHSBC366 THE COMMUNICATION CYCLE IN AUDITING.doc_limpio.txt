the communication cycle in auditing lecture given on 6 february 1964 thank you thank you very much now what is the date here whats the date audience sixth of february february what audience six six sixth of february what year audience ad 14 thank you thank you february 6 ad 14 saint hill special briefing course im going to talk to you about very arduous subject the subject is the communication cycle and i think you might like to know something about the communication cycle as used in auditing its new subject new to many if you look over communication youll find out that the magic of communication is about the only thing that makes auditing work and if you could sit down to meter onehand electrode all by yourself and run some process on yourself itd make citizen out of you and the reason itd make citizen out of you is youd see little bit of tone arm action at first or if you tripped across something like an active loud large gpm why you might get yourself quarter or half tone arm division or couple of needle flashes now you can always get needle flash you can always get something of that sort now the amount of tone arm action you would get doing this would make you blink because its none and you could run some hot process on you that had been run by some auditor and which gave him good ta you see this process that has been run give you good ta when the auditor was auditing it then you sit down there with onehand electrode while the process is still hot and run the commands on yourself youre going to get for moment the residual of the auditing that is to say the auditor will have stirred up enough so that youll see little bit of charge go off and then your tone arm is going to go dead and its going to stay dead now the reason for this has to do with the thetan in this universe now he has begun to consider himself mest and hes begun to consider himself mass and the being who considers himself mass of course responds to the laws of electronics and the laws of newton and is actually incapable of generating very much you see or which was what were interested in asising very much theres not very much going to disappear there in the way of mass and this is very discouraging sort of an activity now i have had to explore this particular field of auditing self auditing because most anybody does it and so forth and what was this all about and i have even gotten ambitious enough to run an actual gpm bangitybangitybangitybang on onehand electrode that makes your hair stand on end well it made my hair stand on end and my auditor fished out it didnt kill i was able to breathe afterwards that is if i didnt move much but the same gpm run with the same items and so forth would produce upwards to 175 ta divisions down and the gpm selfaudited produced 2 now what was this all about what was this all about it tells us now it isnt that experiment other experiments were made in this particular line and it tells us that an individual considers himself mesty or massy if you see and therefore he has to have second terminal and second terminal is required to discharge the energy now lot of auditors go further than this and they go downhill to point where they think theyre being the second terminal to the degree that they think they pick up the somatics and illnesses of the person theyre auditing well get that actually there is backflow of any kind hits the auditor there is backflow hits the auditor of any kind but if he is so convinced that he himself is mest why of course he will turn on somatics and everything else in echo to the pc because hes simply doing matched terminal with the pc dont you see actually nothing hits the auditor it has to be mocked up or envisioned by him i think you find thats quite amusing because there are whole schools of healing back in the early days of greece particularly where they picked up the pain out of somebodys ead or off somebodys arm and they got the somatic very nicely and took it away and dumped it in the trash bin spiritual healing has this in its textbooks and so forth well that is its genus is just this twopole proposition now you dont have to know anything about electricity or electronics in order to go into this very deeply but its obvious to you that for motor to run or for something to occur like light go on that two poles have to be involved and energy passing between two terminals or two poles makes an interchange and it gives you what you call electric light now of course that is the burning of energy in this particular case you dont have the burning of energy you have the asising of energy where the auditor and the pc is concerned now the ability to hold position or the ability to hold two terminals apart is definition of power not how much energy can be thrown by unit but the base the strain that is put on the base the ability to hold these two positions thats little bit outside of what were talking about but here we have two poles we have an auditor and pc and as long as the auditor audits and the pc replies we get an exchange an apparent exchange of energy from the pcs point of view which doesnt bit the auditor but because they think of themselves dont you see at this low subvolitional level as terminals why you get these exchanges of energy going on you see and nothing hits the auditor and it asises as far as the pc is concerned but you have set up in essence twopole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass and thats why there is nothing hitting the auditor now that is the essence of the situation and the magic involved in auditing is contained in the communication cycle of auditing you see now you are handling the smooth interchange between these two poles eventually the individual will get up to point where he does not consider himself to be matter and this longer occurs when youve got pcs half of pcs actual gpms run out you start running into trouble im running into that trouble right now unless the pc makes up her mind or recognizes the truth of the situation i cant knock any energy off i can ask the question and the meter is the deadestlooking meter you ever saw in your life yet theres redhot gpm sitting under this sort of thing see therell be redhot item or redhot this or redhot that but i have to ask the pc whether or not that is it and when the pc looks at it and decides that that is it or that isnt it only then do i get an active meter and this is most amazing this is most amazing the gpm can be sitting right there ready to read and unless the pc has looked at it and has thought it over why nothing happens on the meter yet this same pc before those half of the bank was run out dont you see all i had to do was sneeze at the meter and i got rocket reads on anything and the pc didnt know anything about what was rocketreading and what wasnt rocketreading you get the advance the advance is upwards toward knowing one is one see and you get out of these automatic physicalenergy manifestations of the physical universe and getting out of these things you then get to point where youve got intention now what is one of these gpms anyway but method of limiting the pcs ability to intend and that is the whole idea behind implanting or anything of that nature the whole idea is that if he intends positive he gets negative if he intends negative he gets positive so therefore he cannot decide now if you take somebody and every time he says yes you say he eventually will get into an indecisional state of mind he can longer intend yes completely see so this is how you could wear somebody down break his spirit or make him private in the army get the idea every time he has thought you deny it you see theres where you get your original power of choice the ideas of power of choice and all such other ideas the ideas of selfdeterminism versus otherdeterminism all these other various ideas stem out of this alone it is the ability to intend something now somebody cannot write he intends to write and hell go around talking about writing but he doesnt write well what is happening there he is intending to write but something is intending that he not write and that is his mind kicking back at him which is simply positive negative proposition there of two poles do you see this all right he intends to talk arabic but the mind says that he cant talk arabic see theres your positivenegative he intends not to talk arabic and finds himself chattering strange phrases and you get these speakings in foreign tongues that the hysterical religionist very often is found to have and so forth in other words you get the positive and the negative proposition well person has to be very mesty indeed before they are subject to these particular phenomena and the more mesty that they consider themselves the more enmeshed in matter that they consider themselves and the more energied up they are why the more trouble they have with this particular action and of course as you go upscale this phenomena drops away as progress is made in this particular direction now what value is the auditor well the auditor of course is at his greatest value at the lowest level of the case is necessary all the way up through to step six end of actual gpms is necessary all the way but the auditor at very low levels can produce some of the most interesting phenomena and it was in the dianetic days that they were able to absolutely break their hearts because you could say to somebody sososo andso and soandso and you could handle engrams you could handle matters associated with the bank and the pc would lose his or her arthritis would lose psychosomatic ills of one kind or another and never find out about it in other words the auditor could sit there and asis bits of the thing just by the automatic mechanical process of twoway communication with the pc but the pc was so snarled up and so sunk in and considered themselves so much brick or piece of rock or wooden slab that they would never find out about it and after the auditor had cured up somebodys lumbosis completely why the person would say well yes but you havent done anything about my worries about my wife well yes he was incurable he was bedridden he had to go around the most he could look forward to was wheelchair and the auditor would fix him all up and hes walking around now and he complains because he hasnt had his wife straightened out in other words he was actually influenced without his knowledge do you understand this now from twopole arrangement wherever an individual wherever an individual then thinks of himself as an animal as matter as bit of mud as algae which has coagulated into the difficulties of manhood when you get these various things what do you eventually see you see whole scientific world indulging in the philosophy of man is matter so the spiritual values and natures of man are of course lost completely only auditing can restore these nothing else is going to restore them but when you look over the difficulties of auditing realize that you are handling simply the difficulties of communication cycle and when you yourself as the auditor do not permit smooth flow between you as terminal and the pc as terminal and the pc as terminal back to you you get asising of matter so you dont get tone arm action now part of the trick of course is what has to be asised and how do you go about it but that we call technique and if you remove technique if you remove technique from the area lets not worry about the particulars what button has to be pressed or stepped on were not going to wonder about this what button were going to wonder only about the communication cycle we find oddly enough if the auditor is actually capable of making the pc willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit button to get tone arm action do you see this now the person who is insisting continuously upon new technique new technique or very fancy technique or that sort of thing is neglecting the basic tool of his auditing which is the communication cycle of auditing he cannot make the pc get tone arm action well he cant make the pc get tone arm action basically because the communication cycle doesnt exist and when the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session we get this horrible compounding of the felony of trying to get technique but the technique cannot be administered to the pc because theres communication cycle to administer it so basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes prior to the technique the communication cycle must exist before the technique can exist and therefore any case supervisor is very very well advised to merely heal up the various points and portions that are missing as far as that communication cycle is and hit it as buttons and in view of the fact that the auditor is trying and the auditor is doing something to actually neglect whether or not the auditing is good or bad thats up to an auditing instructor isnt it just neglect that but just look at the case from the basis of what parts of this communication cycle are awry and what isnt here in the form of response to the auditing question and simply heal those points up now if you had man lying unconscious in the street you certainly wouldnt be thinking up what technique to run on him if you wanted to bring him back to life and livingness what you would want to do is get him to talk to you or breathe or flutter an eyelid that would be something oddly enough the communication cycle all by itself will cause him to flutter that eyelid you can take an unconscious person who has been in coma for some time and by picking up their hand and making them touch the pillow and even touch your arm you know picking up the hand they have volition here picking up the hand touching the shoulder picking up the hand touching the pillow giving them the command at the same time talking and so forth that person will come back to life this is the greatest magic that anybody ever saw its very startling but look youre just trying to get this man into communication with the auditor and communication with his surroundings and hell come back to battery and theres technique so that should demonstrate to you that the fundamental entrance to the case is not on level of technique but on level of the communication cycle now all you have to do is mark out how many branches of this communication cycle can there be there can be communication cycle between the pc and the auditor and the pc and the auditing room and thats about it now you can get particular and you can have parts of the auditing room or you can have specific portions of the auditor or the auditors beingness you can mark down to that and then you can maybe go afield from this particular zone or area if the person is already in communication cycle with the auditor you can go afield and start to address his present time problems now you can address whether or not his wife fixes the tea properly or puts arsenic in the coffee as he is worried about now you can address that sort of thing but this of course because it is distant from where you are sitting requires technique first you have to know what he is worried about out there because it is not present and visible for you to see or for him to see the technique selects out what he is worried about little form of assessment dont you see and now youre into techniques and processing having left the field of the communication cycle if the field of the communication cycle with the auditing room and with the auditor is all solid ground and if all of that is squared away you can now worry about technique now the auditor who comes tearing down to you sometime as when youre dofping someplace and the auditor who comes down and says to you hohahai i i just cant get anyplace on mrs hepsibah cant get anyplace on mrs hepsibah and you say well why dont you run soandso and soandso will inevitably come back you give him technique you seewill inevitably come back half an hour or so later and say that doesnt work either and you can keep up this silly cycle for long long time because of course there is technique being delivered to the pc because there is communication cycle present now what needs to be repaired is the communication cycle and when youve got communication cycle repaired then you can audit technique its as elementary as that now there are many parts of this communication cycle that can be addressed because you have the pc there and you have the auditor there and of course the first part of it that has to be addressed is the fact that the person is having session and is in room and is being faced by an auditor now if you take all those and write down the categories you write down all the categories all the different little bits that can be written down that are part of this its best for you as an auditor to imagine them rather than for to give you long catalog on them you see and then figure out how youre going to get him into communication on each one of these points realizing that communication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw even when you speak to pc even when you speak to person you are reaching when you cease to speak you are withdrawing when he hears you he has something withdrawn and at that moment hes bit withdrawn dont you see but then he reaches toward you with the answer and youll see him go into withdraw while he thinks it all over see he gets back and well hes which why did my grandfather have to marry the girl see and he thinks over this and youll see him think this over and he thinks that cycle through on withdrawal dont you see and then he will reach back to the auditor now hes already reached this reason now he will reach the auditor with the reason and he will say that was it now you have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor and will see it reflect on meter because that exchange now is giving an asising of energy in the absence of that communication you do not get meter action so the fundamental of auditing the fundamental of auditing is the communication cycle thats the fundamental of auditing and that is really the great discovery of dianetics and scientology it is such simple discovery that and everybody does it but you realize that nobody knew anything about communication when it came along the number of the number of chaps in communication companies and that sort of thing who fall around our neck saying really you know you say well communication it consists of cause distance effect you know i yeah by golly it does you know well its just this sort of thing its fundamental that everybody knew was there theyve been watching apples fall off trees for very long time and newton had to come along and see an apple fall off tree see and he said hey apples fall off trees and when they leave the tree they bit the ground see everybody says wow you know terrific you know and his name has gone singing down through the ages because he noticed that apples fell off trees its always this sort of its always this sort of thing its always this sort of thing which escapes the attention of people because mest is basically very complex stuff and being very complex composed as it is out of electrons and molecules and minerals and geewhizzes of all kinds or another wavelengths and all this sort of thing because of its tremendous complexity so complex that nobody can understand it they can only you know therefore people who are very plowed in you might say into matter and who are themselves thinking as matter think very complexly and they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted and they observe none of these things now you look over this i call this to your attention the case with which you can handle communication cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing now we have to add to the simplicity of the communication cycle the obnosis the observation of the obvious if the pc hasnt been talking to you and if the pc hasnt said anything to you for very long time it is time for you to be thinking on the subject of what do i say to the pc you say what do i say to the pc please i invite your attention that your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training and thereafter is taken up exclusively with the observation of what the pc is doing or is not doing and your handling of communication cycle ought to be so instinctive and so good that you are never worried over here about what you do now lets see am i doing it right or am i not doing it right lets see i wonder how my acknowledgment was that time did i say okay in an artificial frame of voice or should i say it naturally like oookaay that wasnt right the time for you to get this all fixed up is in training and in actual auditing the communication cycle that you watch is the pcs thats the communication cycle you watch you know yours is good so you dont worry about it anymore now if you know your communication cycle is good you havent any longer got to be upset about whether youre doing it right or not and you ought to be well enough trained that when somebody says catfish to you you look at them and recognize they are longer saying catfish and have finished saying catfish and having finished saying catfish it is time for you to acknowledge but you only acknowledge because they have finished the communication and your observation is simply limited to the fact that they have completed their communication and that is your observation your observation is the observation of the communication cycle of the pc and you get good enough so that you just lay in mothballs your worry about your communication cycle when youre finished training thats the time it goes into mothballs you understand you know how to do it now your business is the communication responses and cycles of the pc do you see that this pc you ask what technique shall we run on this pc technique what are you doing with technique lets look at the pc for few minutes oh yes but we say well the pc has got to have something to talk about oh come come come youve been in scientology or dianetics all this time and you cant dream up something for him to talk about its as corny as this you had any problems lately see or its corny as this how are you doing lets get this pc to talk so we can see what the score is now this is the true the true touch of genius on case this is what makes that auditor who can crack any case and when its absent has an auditor who couldnt crack an egg if he stepped on it this is the difference this is the difference its whether or not this auditor can observe the communication cycle of the pc and repair its various lacks now im now talking to you when i talk to you about the auditors communication cycle im talking to you about something thats so simple it simply consists of asking question that the pc can answer and then the pc observing that the pc answers it and when the pc has answered it observing that the pc has completed the answer to it that the pc has answered it and has completed his answer to it and is through answering it and then saying cheerios giving him the acknowledgment bang like that say all right you finished that and then giving him something else to do thats all you can ask the same question or you can ask another question it doesnt matter but the communication cycle is simply asking something that the pc can answer theres lot of little trickery involved in this because that includes clearing the auditing command see you dont say to somebody whos got you got fiveyearold kid and you say to him you say to him have you had any marital troubles lately and i dont think youre going to get much of an answer see it requires that much good sense ask question that can be answered and then ask it of the pc so the pc can hear it and knows what hes being asked and then the pc answers the question and being bright enough to know that the pc is answering that question not some other question and then knowing and this by the way is very interestingly developed instinct you can tell when the pc is finished and if you dont develop that instinct youre very often lost youll say well did he end or didnt he end and so on well some auditors try to make it up making another technique inside technique like have you finished answering that auditing question of course this is so much balderdash you should be able to know it is piece of knowingness see you just know hes finished he looks like hes finished he feels like hes finished your telepathy tells you hes finished you get the idea its that esoteric he said well i i didnt have grandfather and you now know that he is not going to say any more see its part sense its part his vocal intonation you see but its an instinct that you develop you know hes finished so knowing hes finished then you tell him hes finished its like pointing out the bypassed charge dont you see youve answered it you say you answered it actually if you said okay good you might as well say youve answered it you have now found and located the bypassed charge in answer to the question and there it is and you have said it see thats the magic of acknowledgment dont you see but naturally you say good very good you know all right okay but if you got long continuing thing you dont want to stop him too hard so the degree of stop you put on your acknowledgment is also your good sense because you can acknowledge pc so hard and if your impingement on pcs is way up in the stars that you finish the session right there you just end the session you waste all that remaining two hours that you had to go so hes talking on consecutive line of thought and you acknowledge as though youre not going to ask it anymore ever and he wont think of it anymore ever either so frankly now when youve acknowledged it you knew he was finished and you said he was finished by acknowledging it and then you gave him something else to answer now thatahohurrrrrrmmm second we got into itsa we got into trouble man because we dropped out giving him something else to answer and an auditor will sit there without giving the pc anything to do and youve got to develop sensitivity when did that pc finish answering what you asked at that point you say cheers and give him the next question but when you dont have that sensitivity the pc answers it gets nothing from you you sit there and look at him his social machinery goes into response that we must not be sitting here quietly doing nothing some pcs take up humming i hear because the auditor hasnt acknowledged and given him new question the auditor just is not there thats all now its all very well to do that sort of thing in training and its forgivable but not in an auditing session really now after all pcs finished answering the question cheers thank you good all right now you know youve acknowledged something you finished off that cycle so you better ask him do fish swim man are there any other problems youve been worried about see hes finished that one anything else upset you between sessions see but be in there man dont stand there tanglefooted saying what do i do now oh because at this point the pc is going to overrun hes going to start making session out of it hes going to go on to auto and what did i just tell you about selfauditing it gives tone arm action so the degree that the pc hasnt any communication cycle with the auditor he doesnt get tone arm action so then the degree that the pc is sitting there all by himself selfauditing gives you tone arm action and thats actually the absence of tone arm action is the degree of selfaudit the pc is indulging in you understand this cycle all right well thats all there is to that cycle thats all there is to that cycle now for heavens sakes get yours sufficiently well repaired that you dont have to worry about it after training and after that spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repair the communication inabilities of the pc and youll be genius man you crack 99 percent of the cases that walk in screaming genius people will look at you wow you know well this fellow is awful worried because his wifes waffling and ran off with wafwaf and so forth wafwafwafwafwafwafwaf and you say thank you and he goes wafwafwaf thank you wafwafwafwaf thank you thank you thank you yeah i heard i heard about your wife running off with the chauffeur tha thank you i got that i i i got that i heard it yeah yeah good thank you all right thank you thank you very much thanks all right guy will be looking at you like snake that has just been faced with shotgun see what has entered into my perimeter is there something else around here i could have sworn i heard somebody speak lot of you take over case and the guy is going yipyipyapyap yap and he says waffle waffle waf and so forth and so on and so on and i really dont have any and so on and all these lollipops they keep coming out of the wahblahblah you say thank you and he goes wawawananawawa you say thank you and wawa and then the all the lollipops and the wife ran away with the chauffeur and so on and its all very terrible and you say thank you and so forth and its all very terrible and the wife ran away with the lollipops and oh the chauffeur came out and oh dont be an idiot and sit there and let this go on forever he isnt talking to anybody now thats what youve got to recognize lets get down to some of these problems here lets get down what is this guy doing with his communication cycle you want to know how to bust cases thats how you bust them whats he doing ill give you an idea let give you very very high school way upstairs analysis of this situation show you how far this can go way up in the clouds bang pc takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question now the auditor see in this particular case he knows scientology he knows it backwards forwards and upside down see guy takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question and in that answer of the auditing question doesnt answer it now the very smart auditor the very very very smart auditor in repairing this communication cycle from the pc would look at that and hed have three processes just like that three processes hed know hed have to do on this pc pang pang pang this i told you is very high school see its very up very upstairs 1 pc cannot have an auditing question its pretty obvious isnt it didnt answer the question so he couldnt have gotten it so your first process would be what auditing question wouldnt you mind being asked or what auditing question should you be asked or what question could you answer this is getting very elementary isnt it what question wouldnt you mind answering you say thats running him at effect it isnt because youre asking him to have the power of choice over what question youd be surprised you could probably run that as repetitive process for an hour or two and everything would get much brighter to this person person would say terrific process absolutely terrific process never heard of such process before when did you dream that process up i mean dream process up be damned you just start processing him on part of the communication cycle now lets get more esoteric lets get much more esoteric if he says he hasnt had any auditing we obviously would adjudicate that he cant have any auditing but wed have to repair something of the communication cycle of what question wouldnt he mind answering before we could ask him question that he would answer quite obvious isnt it so youd have to take first things first and then we would have to find out about this auditing thing and i think youd find out as your second process itd be necessary for you to get him to get the concept of wasting auditing and others wasting auditing well if he cant have it hes wasting it because its sitting in front of him cant have auditing well if you got him to waste it in concept for few minutes or half an hour or session or something like this get the idea of you wasting auditing get the idea of someone not have him pick up anything on recall man because if youre auditing case like that youre obviously auditing somebody who doesnt dare go back on the backtrack so dont say what auditing have you had that you wouldnt mind you see because youre asking him to go into the past well obviously that is like going out into the outer perimeter the past is not in the session thats going abroad isnt it memory processes and that sort of thing are out of the session and out of the communication cycle thats something you repair after youve got somebody insession so your next process would be as i said waste auditing get the idea of wasting auditing what could you do here that would waste auditing thats very good you see what could an auditor do here that would waste auditing because person cant have something they must waste it if he isnt getting auditing he must not be able to have it i mean lets get elementary lets go way back to 1952 get elementary have the ability to do you could also get him to waste communication or anything else but im just dreaming up three processes in row here your first one is what question could he answer see wouldnt he mind answering your next one is get the idea of wasting auditing and the third one who would i have to be to audit you now youve done subvert here youve gone below the session see youve brought him up to point where he could hear the fact that youre going to ask him very significant question after i did that id maybe work on his memory because those three points would really be healed youd see that whole case change youd see that whole case change and yet youre worried because he keeps talking about his lollipops running out with away with his wife or something of the sort and you just get fixated on the fact you say this guy cant be audited because he talks all the time all the time all the time about lollipops and the chauffeur and it goes on and on and on and on and on and therefore if we dont if we dont remedy this button about the lollipops the chau why hells bells he doesnt even know what hes talking about its whether or not he can receive an acknowledgment whether or not he can receive an auditing question whether or not he can have an auditing session whether or not he can sit in an auditing room whether or not he can have an acknowledgment whether or not you see he can say something to the auditor whether or not so forth you get all the little processes that go with this see now the person took twenty minutes to answer an auditing question and didnt answer it for those twenty minutes three processes based on what just your knowledge of scientology and what the pc is doing in front of you simple huh all right we got pc whos sitting there and he doesnt say anything lets take another case lets just do all this off the cuff pc isnt saying anything yeah all right do birds fly youre running some process you know do birds fly ill repeat the question oh hmm oh hmm sigh yeah well lets dream up process we obviously cant have what question wouldnt you mind my asking you because hes sitting there silent man probably not question of being asked question its question of not being able to respond to question lets take it apart lets find out what the pc is doing dream up something accordingly see so we say what could you say to elementary long comm lag and he finally says something he can say to you you get this question over somehow to him what could he say to you and he finally says i i could say hello good big win see all right lets build this up on gradient next thing you know youve got him talking to you but you see if you dont have the auditing cycle going from the pc to the auditor if you have tremendous communication disabilities on the part of the pc you actually dont have any auditing cycle going that will discharge energy and so you dont have tone arm action that simple thats all there is to it actually so as soon as he can talk to the auditor dont get so overjoyed about this wonderful change in him that you cease now to inspect his communication cycle because if youve cured that you will now find another piece of it thats missing in other words you can go the whole way do you see after hes gotten so that he can say something to you well now now you might have to figure out what would he answer dont you see and now you might have to figure out if he could have an auditor now you might even go so far as to find out what constituted getting better i dont think you have to invent process as complicated as what would be worse than getting better but what the pc isnt doing is where well let put it this way theres little formula involved its what the pc isnt doing that it might be possible for the auditor to get him to do see thats the thats the formula it isnt what isnt the pc doing that were going to get him to do what is the missing ability because obviously hes not ot so you say all right be ot now youre going to have lose here im afraid thats going to be lose do you see so its what can you get the pc to do that the pc can regain the ability in doing see thats the formula on which youre operating and operating on that formula you can find all sorts of things you can thresh around in the environment of the pc one way or the other and if youre an alert auditor youll see these little disabilities showing up here and there and so forth stammerer is about the easiest diagnosis anybody ever had anything to do with but how many stammerers have i seen being audited on processes and techniques well its absolutely foolish to audit stammerer on technique he obviously is having difficulty communicating what are you doing in an auditing session doing anything but to improve his ability to communicate to the auditor now you might find something silly like this happen if you were auditing somebody who stammered that he would talk to the auditor eventually with complete clarity still stammered to other people well this is quite obvious this is extremely obvious what you would now do we now you dont now instantly extend it to other people because there are other pieces of the communication abilities right there in the session to be straightened up before you go out into the outer perimeter of the society and usually where the auditor gets his lose is he repairs something gets big win and then theres thirty other things to be repaired sitting right in front of his face right in front of him and he doesnt he does some kind of jump into memory or engram running or something my god just because the pc is now perfectly willing to talk to you is reason that the pc who few minutes ago could not remember anything its reason he now can remember something thats another ability lets say somebody is trying to improve their memory well you improve somebodys memory after youve got somebody who can receive an auditing question and answer it and then receive the acknowledgment resulting therefrom and who can sit there in an auditing session and be pc and be audited now you can go about improving memory but oddly enough memory improvement starts with being able to remember something in the auditing room not something that happened to him eight trillion years ago it begins just minute ago ive seen pc absolutely ruined become unauditable by repetitively being asked questions having to do with memory that the pc couldnt answer so another rule in observing the communication cycle and so forth is dont ask the pc to do things the pc cant do and if youve inadvertently asked the pc to do something the pc now cant do well for heavens sakes be enough on the ball be sharp enough be really bright on this and recognize that youve asked the pc something the pc cant do and therefore youve given lose and you better not compound the lose dont ask them to do the same thing again that they now cant do this goes very elementary you talk about flattening processes very often youre asking pc process you see from where could you view catfish see from where could you view catfish from where could you view catfish and the pc finally says thats all the answers there are and you know the process had better be flattened so you say well from where could you view catfish and he says well thats all the answers there are and you say from where could you view catfish and now he has to invent an answer and youre running create process your pc if he doesnt arc break snarls up right there i always respect pc saying there arent any more answers i bail out of there in hurry and when i ask the pc when i ask the pc from where could you view catfish and we just took off into the blue here from where could you view catfish see thats the question i want you to answer now answer the question and the pc says im sorry i i never viewed any catfish i know right away i have been guilty of giving the pc an auditing question which the pc couldnt answer and i am guilty of not having cleared the auditing question ive given the pc lose lets have pc who is very deathly afraid of touching mantels mantelpieces just invent nuttiness see all right well say all right walk over there and touch that mantelpiece we already knew he was this way see or we dont know hes this way we say walk over there and touch that mantelpiece and he says uughh i i i cant do that soon as youve gotten into that situation you got yourself lose lets find out if the pc could do these things lets discuss this process little bit with the pc like hows about i dont care how grammatical or esoteric or patterned you are about this you see because sometimes you have to be very very communicative and you say hows about if i ask you to walk around here and touch parts of this room what would you think about that what if i ask you to do something like that and the pc says oh my god i couldnt do that hohohoho oh oh particularly mantelpi ohohoh dont ask to do anything like that you say all right i wont see swift recovery now you havent given the pc any lose in fact you might have given him little win this caused him spooky feeling you know im really i dont really want to walk around here and touch the room ah hes interested now well is there anything around here you you you wouldnt be too upset about touching hows that how about how about some question like that oh i could i wouldnt be too scared of touching that that spot on the floor what else wouldnt you mind looking around here and smooth as glass you see see you cleared it he said he couldnt do it this intrigued him now you can hit gradient that he can do and build it back up and youve got it made every once in while you see something like this but if youre not if youre not observing what the communication cycle of the pc is why youre adrift all the time pc isnt answering the question well thats obvious maybe theres hundred thousand remedies could be dreamed up for this particular activity all within the perimeter of the auditing room pc is this way pc is that way pc every time they sit down in the chair they dust the chair off very carefully and take some kleenex and wipe the arms of the chair and then they sit down very gingerly into the chair youve observed this couple of times well theres point in bringing it sharply to their attention but you must realize it must be borne home to you with that much exaggeration certainly itd bring it home that this pc doesnt want to touch very much around an auditing session i mean that would be an elementary observation dont you see it might have to do with chairs it might be gpm but you cant run all of that lets just chalk this up lets chalk this up pc gingery on this subject obviously somewhere up the line youre going to run some objective process on this pc somewhere up the line but ahead of that there might be some much more attainable but much less obvious thing such as the pc never looks at the auditor that might be touchable if you looked over here what would you see doesnt really require him to look over there he only need guess at it what might you see you could even soften it up to that dont you see theres all kinds of things here that depend on auditor observation where the pc breaks down in his communication cycle with the auditor and where the pc breaks down in his communication cycle with the environment is your entrance point to the case those are the entrance points to the case if you havent got him squared around so that he can respond to the auditor he of course cant answer any auditing question so whats this technique worry why are you worried about technique technique you ever dreamed up is going to arrive well you have some fortuitous feeling that an automaticity will turn on in the pc and answer you well thats how youre going to get the pc getting well and never finding out about it they ran into that in dianetics they could actually run em through an engram the engram was so easy to trigger and the bank responds to the auditor so beautifully that practically the whole session could be carried on without the presence or benefit of pc pc didnt have to enter into it and case loses occurred resultingly but these are the ways you crack cases and the best way to study it is just walk around it and take look at all possible ramifications that could be done about it get some acquaintance with processes from 52 53 55 wonder which one of these processes are applicable to what dont you see theres all kinds of these processes first saint hill who would i have to be to audit you see thats nice process see but theres tons of these processes you can oh lord well theyre being cataloged now lots of them but theyre honeys theyre honeys sometimes you find pc cant absolutely cannot run some process because one leg of it is wrong lets say scs and yet the pc cant stand still and its required in the process to stand still and yet youre running start change and stop on the pc well the pcs disability is the pc cant stand still the pc can start the pc can change and the pc can stop as long as they dont have to stop much so you say well we can flatten stop this will be all right oh there must be leg underlying this see pc disability the pc cannot stand still well what would you do about something like this well ill tell you what not to do about it neglect it dont keep on running scs scs scs and the pc is going on and they go on because what are they doing theyre running with prior consideration of the process therefore they never really take on any of the auditing commands they are running each auditing command when i say start you start that body and so forth all right i just that thatll give chance not to stand still see the pc always amends it always amends the auditing question always amends the auditing question dont you see ill stop it but ill stop it quick enough and get off of it so at point during the stop have i stood still see you get this idea well little discussion with the pc will show up these various things now you can take process and you can walk parallel with scs and you can repair that point and run scs afterwards well how would you go about standing still well the crudest way to go about it is just say stand still all right dont stand still thank you stand still thank you dont stand still thank you thats the crudest thing i know of see this is obviously right out of the textbooks and technology of scientology you see stand still thank you dont stand still thank you stand still thank you dont stand automaticity is going to go away this must be some kind of an automaticity thats all ready to trigger there so if we get the person into any familiarity with it because the person already realizes they cant do it that recognition tells you that its within the range of itsa but if you get somebody walking in on crutches that dont know theyre walking on crutches you wouldnt say throw away your crutches now walk see too high gradient and they dont even worry about it you get somebody walking in and saying i got to get rid of these crutches man worry worry worry present time problem see well the thing to do is inspect their communication cycle and their communication cycle with the auditor communication cycle with their mind the communication cycle with the environment see theres many of these little communication cycles lets inspect these various things lets find out hes all right before we say all right throw away your crutches thank you you got the idea see normally what the person is worried about is in actual fact not what the person is bugged with you very often will get somebody running off on total automaticity of whats wrong with them and theyre not even listening to themself talk actually they will run off total automaticity of whats wrong with them and theyre not even listening to themselves talk sometimes they listen to themselves talk to find out whats wrong with them when you get into that situation why its elementary to repair the existing livingness of the pc but only after youve repaired their auditingness an auditing session is highly artificial action highly artificial its dreamed up invented from scratch nothing like it has really ever existed before thats why psychoanalyst would lay an egg minute in minute if he cracked textbook on scientology and took it back to the office to run it on one of his patients aughhh and boy do they lay eggs why well theyre running scientology with psychoanalytic auditing cycle and of course thats wild auditing cycle if youve ever inspected it one psychoanalyst said i dont see how you can stand to listen hour after hour after hour and the other one says who listens but thats their appreciation of the auditing cycle and its too bad to produce any great effect which is probably fortunate because the theory which goes back of it and so forth is highly artificial they dont produce any impingement the auditing cycle isnt there and so on but this artificiality of an auditing session approximates its only artificial because it approximates in such harsh staggering visible reality the exact precise points of contact with existence and what it is is hoppedup gunnedup contact with beings in existence dont you see way up its something like putting modelt ford and putting lycoming aircraft engine in it see and bzzzzzzzz ell all of communication always has consisted of cause distance effect well you jam it up into an auditing communication cycle and its full of bombs man see bang things are going to happen because its highlighted the exact important points for instance you ask somebody on the street out here whats important about communication they say well being polite good what are the parts of communication oh theres past participles and theres present participles and theres grammar and see they couldnt tell you any of this dont you see all right you gun in there with cause distance effect you see ask question get it answered acknowledge it see porowww see wrooof youre handling raw meat and you rehabilitate any part of this and so forth and then something wakes up thetan cant help but wake up the ability to communicate is always terribly visible to reporter or somebody doing work in this particular field they get around scientologists it knocks them flat and this photographer that was here today from the saturday evening post and so forth who has gone now i imagine this boy this boys first remark to is theyre all so uninhibited after he got through taking pictures of you you see youre all so uninhibited he sees communication happening hes very impressed with you you see youre walking straighter and you arent all tightened up and youre not bundle of nerves dont you see and all this sort of thing and he cant quite express this thing but hes already in state of shock because hes been hit you see with too much life livingness you know just hit him in the face and yet none of you really probably said anything to him its that apparent well now you take this up and gun this up into an auditing cycle and the auditor is saying do birds fly and the pc is supposed to listen to this and he is supposed to understand this and he is supposed to sort out the answer to this and he is supposed to deliver it up now and hes going to get for that thank you straight into his skull and it isnt the parts of grammar and it isnt this and it isnt that and it isnt the other thing and if he can stand up to this hell start getting the idea that he can communicate and he goes out of session and hell start communicating with the environment and the only thing really wrong with people is is theyve withdrawn from contact if you wanted to capsulize the entirety of difficulty with the mind take somebody who is longer looking the last time he looked there were three sabertoothed tigers ready to bite him now he is longer looking of course he believes that there are three sabertoothed tigers there hell sometimes put up screens between himself and the tigers and then of course he never dares take down the screens so he never finds out if the tigers have gone and he does this throughout enough trillenia hes got an awful stack of tigers all of which have left but he doesnt know it he cant be sure theyve left and so hes in condition of total withdrawal from his environment from himself hes safeguarded himself with an automatic bank hes safeguarded himself with an automatic beingness hes got valence standing where he ought to be and he knows that he came straight from mud and that he is mud and that hed better not be anything else because mud is relatively unpalatable when eaten by sabertoothed tigers and capsulization of all aberration is just total withdrawal i dont care thats psychiatric term of course they have some condition they say total withdrawal the psychiatrist is standing there totally withdrawn telling you about somebody who has gone into withdrawal which i always considered very interesting this is not an apt term its one point where were crossing terms but were not talking about the psychiatric withdrawal were just talking about the fact the guy has retreated thats all he longer dares put out beam mile away first he could put one out lightyear then he put one out year you see and then he put one out mile and then he got down to hundred yards and each time he got enough being bitten dont you see that he longer puts out to distance his remedy is always shorten the reach and the thetan has as his standard remedy for safety shorten the reach and what does he do when he gets into zero reach he actually can figure out how to invert withdrawal into an inverted withdrawal and you get the cycle of the dynamics coming on down which is he comes away from actual reach dont you see and he comes down to zero actual reach well hes got to reach somehow so he figures some other way to reach dont you see he reads travel books or something you know and he goes into these various cycles and theres always zero of what he is doing which then has remedy which is lower than that and he gets down into not just total withdraw he gets down to an inversion of the inversion of the inversion of the inversion withdrawal of course the first point this shows up is in an auditing session and his ability to talk to the auditor about pertinencies the sensibility of his communication is also in point here youve asked him do you have car and he has explained to you that general motors stock has gone down for the last year or so and drops it at this point so pertinencies he didnt answer the question did he so you get him into some condition where he can answer the question he can speak up where he can hear what youre saying where he can therefore receive the auditor because youve got somebody on total withdrawal one of your best remedies is to see that he gets reached dont you see and you reach him in order to get him to reach dont you see and these are the conditions which youre trying to remedy with an auditing cycle now if you want to be an absolute geewhizzer to end all geewhizzers on cracking cases dont you ever go around drooling about this fellow sitting there and hes saying and my wife lollipopped with the chauffeur and and its just all too tough so on and so forth and so on and so on and youre trying to say to him this is you know the session has ended and he says and so and so on and came down the chute and there were eight sides of it and so forth they were all hexagonal you see and so forth and you said the the session the session ended some time ago and he says and so on and so on so ive always said to chauffeurs since that particular time ive said it lollipopped the chauffeurs dont now go to somebody or try to crack textbook to find out what to run what technique to run on this case it isnt case of technique he hasnt got anybody there to talk to he isnt talking to anybody if he is its somebody else he isnt talking about problem he could have see he isnt even talking about problem hes got he probably isnt even listening to himself anymore he has familiarity with the environment he is disoriented as to where he is and so forth and you want technique hes got paw well you could say now pick up your hand and put it on the side of the chair and feel the side of the chair he might go right on talking for some time without noticing youre doing this then eventually say hey theres chair here big win but if youre going to deal in pcs at all who have disabilities of any kind whatsoever youve got to have session before you can have class iv v vi vii viii ix x you get the idea now youve got to have session before you can have technique operating this is the value of the auditing cycle this is its use and this is how to become one of the wildest case crackers anybody ever had anything to do with you get to be screaming genius on this subject and something oh you make errors youll get too accusative youll all of sudden find you overcut youve overestimated the pcs ability here and there and so forth and you have to cut it back but remember that it always requires adjustment the only other thing i would teach you and like to teach you about this and i really wish i could is that after youve remedied it its been remedied and dont keep on because this pc had lot of tone arm action on what question he could receive from the auditor and so forth dont make that lifetime profession because this is just another method of nonobservation now that he can do this and is doing it note that he is doing it see he feels all right about it and he is doing it note that and now notice notice in other words that hes changed and then notice what else you can put together so theres two more things to notice dont you see is when has that condition been remedied when has that little ability been regained so that you can pull foot out of there and the other thing is observe now newly and freshly for something else to do for the pc the reason i give you those other two is that sometimes it happens so rapidly that it youre just rocked back on your heels pc has never talked to anybody before in their life and you all of sudden have them talking to you pertinently in blue streak well lets not go on remedying their ability to talk to the auditor see ability regained so you want to be able to notice that and thats all part of the observation and the real hot the real hot auditor the real guy that gets case wins all over the place is sitting in there observing what is going on in the session and if things are going all right doesnt remedy them and if things are going all wrong picks up that point that can be remedied and remedies it until they are all remedied and then carries on those are the magic ways to go about this sort of thing well you take over the technical aspect of some scientology organization youre sitting in there doing nothing but coaching up cases doing nothing but coaching up cases dont pay any attention to the auditing of the cases consider thats sincere and its being done as best it possibly can be ignore that aspect dont keep picking on the auditors thats training job but just keeping watching watching those communication cycles note the communication abilities and so forth the appearance and that sort of thing of pc dont depend on large tests having been made every fifteen minutes and fourteen pounds of auditor reports to tell you whether or not the pcs had change lets look at this pc lets listen to this pc insession is this pc talking better answering more pertinently and so forth if so fine were winning and so forth lets not worry about that pc until we get bog and theres nochange condition begins to take place with that pc and the pc looking brighter and got more spark in the eye than they had well their eye was remember that this is gradient their eye was absolutely complete pebble stone flat lightless and now you can see trace of color through the fog thats an improvement see note the improvements dont just be cynical about it the whole way you see note the improvements because they sometimes take place rather slowly and just keep them keep them moving up and only pay attention to only pay attention to the communication cycle and the ability of the person to handle the environment in his immediate vicinity particularly an auditing session and only pay attention to those things never pay any attention to the persons problems never pay any attention to their goals in session never pay attention to any of these other things because obviously any auditor they got would take care of these things if the pc was insession see auditors are good at that what theyre not good at is having somebody there fully insession because of course thats the hardest trick thats the roughest trick but there lie the biggest gains and it looks so easy it looks so kindergartenish that you very often neglect it so you see that somebody is all straightened out he can talk to an auditor an auditor can talk to him that an auditing cycle can take place the person can receive an acknowledgment the person can have an auditing room the person can have an auditing session all of these things are possible everything is fine and so forth well aside from occasionally catching somebody with tremendous goof on the subject of theyre running the service facsimile on the person and when it was got service facsimile the auditor in this particular case couldnt find any service facsimile because the person had been raised in poor family and didnt have any maids then the thing to do is to get hold of the d of t and say that auditor needs some training on service facsimiles not to go into it but the only trouble youre going to run into from there on dont you see is going to be the application of technique and that is never the trouble in scientology and it is not the trouble it is not the trouble with your pc that youre having any trouble with at all these techniques work like mad but all of them have the dependency of the pc fully insession the pc is fully insession you can run almost anything on them and theyll sail dont you see pc not in session wont the big bog is people dont get the pc into session before they start running something and therefore they expect technique will remedy something thats sitting right in front of their faces which is the pc not at all insession do you see all right thats actually thats actually how to undercut cases left right and center make wide swath in all directions and i think you can do it thank you
