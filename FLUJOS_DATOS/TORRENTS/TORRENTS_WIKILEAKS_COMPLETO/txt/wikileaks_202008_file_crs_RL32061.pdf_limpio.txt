functions for fy2004 the administration requested 173 billion for these functions while the house provided 176 billion and the senate 181 billion the omnibus appropriations resolu tion for fy2003 pl 1087 funded activities transferred to dhs to secure the borders and increase transportation security but the administrations request for fy2004 was the first attempt to submit an explicit integrated estimate of the funds needed by dhs for those activities the total amount provided for dhs for fy2003 was 297 billion of which 64 was for the operations of border and transportation security as identified in this report of the amounts appropriated for fy2003 and requested for fy2004 for these activities administration documents sugge st that 27 of the funding for the accounts would be used

budget for fy2003 and fy2004 introduction increasing border and transportation security are essential strategies for improving and maintaining homeland security border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people across the borde rs so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are denied entry transportation security entails inspecting people and goods as they move among different loca tions within the country to reduce the possibility of terrorist attacks or the incursion of unwanted people or goods determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into the us involves system of good border management so that the distinctions are recognized without interfering with essential commerce nd the legitimate free flow of citizens and authorized visitors across the borders the system must be capable of examining minute details of g oods and people seeking entry but still fit within budget constraints and be administratively feasible improving transportation security s meant an expanded federal role in screening passengers and ba ggage traveling through airports and increasing the presence of federal officers aboard domestic and international flights with plans to extend that presence to other modes of transportation more intensively in the future finally these management systems must accomplish their functions with minimum of disruption of legitimate ac tivities and without unnecessary intrusion into the civil liberties of persons affected by them major issues in border and transportation security include determination of the optimum number of air marshals and airport screeners port security implementation airline cargo security measures implementation of the visitor immigrant status indicator project us vi sit alien tracking system border security efforts at the northern border with cana da extension of transportation security administration tsa border security effort s beyond airline security to other forms of transportation trains buses trucks and pipelines and funding for the coast guards deepwater effort to replace its aging ships and planes background the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 transferred the functions relevant funding and most of the personnel of 22 agencies and offices to the new department of homeland security dhs created by the act the dhs was organized in four major directorates bord er and transportation security emergencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32061crs2 1 the us customs service among the first of federal functions at the origins of the republic apparently remains in existence but in name only official dhs documents sometimes refer to operations pertaining to the customs function and link them to the bureaus of the directorate some documents re fer to the us customs service but without reference to its location or operations some documents refer to dhs inspectors without distinguishing among their ins customs or animal and plant health responsibilities 2 for more detail on operation li berty shield see crs report rs21475 operation liberty continuedpreparedness and response sc ience and technology and information analysis and infrastructure protection the first directorate border and trans portation security along with its close functional sibling the us coast guard ar responsible for the first line of defense against terrorism as well as remaining re sponsible for securing and managing the nations borders included in this respons ibility are the inspection investigative and enforcement operations of the former i mmigration and naturalization service ins which had been responsible for managing and coordinating entry into the us and enforcing immigration laws dhs border and transportation security objectives also include fulfilling the newly expanded federal role of the tsa in protecting the nations transportation system s initially involving airlin passengers baggage and freight the customs function previously the res ponsibility of the department of the treasurys us customs service1 is now under the directorate the customs function administered by dhs together with the us coast guard are expected to effectively secure commercial traffic entering the nations ports the directorate includes planning office and training activity to assist state and local entities with homeland security objectives the directorate also assumes responsibility for inspecting and monitoring plants and animals entering the us to minimize the risk that noxious pests and diseases will be introduced into the country on january 24 2003 the department of homeland security began operations as separate federal depa rtment web sites were unched some employees given different locations to report for duty dhs managers began to issue directives to employees and preparations were made to begin the transfer of most functions including personnel and funds on march 1 2003 at the sa time federal officials responsible for administering the new department also d responsibility for homeland security issues that could not aw ait the full operations of an established bureaucracy not only was there suspected evidence of terrorist plans against the us being developed around the world but the us was also preparing to use military force to remove the existing rogue regime in the nation of iraq an effort that some believed could lead to increased terrorist threats to the us homeland operation liberty shield as the country anticipated the impending conflict with iraq considerable attention inside and out of the administration focused on the possible increased terrorist threat that could be present as result of the military campaign in response to the perceived increased threat on march 17 2003 the administration announced op eration liberty shield2 as comprehensive nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32061crs3 2 continued shield border transporta tion and domestic security updated by jennifer lakeplan to increase protections for americas citizens and infrastructure while maintaining the free flow of goods and people across our border with minimal disruption to our economy and way of life although some of its enhanced security steps will continue indefin itely operation liberty shie ld terminated on april 17 as the threat appeared to diminish as hostilities in iraq wound down in spite of its short duration as plan of heightened security operation liberty shield served as an example of the ac tivities that could accompany any such alert furthermore the program served as an ex planation of funds requested for dhs in bill requesting supplemental appropriations for operati on iraqi freedom some of the requested funds could be expected to accomplish purposes that would remain in place after operation liberty shield was ended including those directed to border and transportation security border security land border security was increased by adding agents to the northern and southern border regions in cluding additional numbers between major ports of entry maritime security was incr eased by adding patrols of major ports and waterways more escorts of passenger ship s and more sea marshals on board high interest vessels with cargoes crewmembers or other characteristics that warrant closer scrutiny in addition the coast gu ard enforced published security zones in close proximity to critical infrastructure sites in key ports transportation security operation liberty shie ld implemented additional airport security measures increasing th presence of law enforcement officers on patrol in and around airports new flight restrictions were established for the airspace over washington dc and new rk city dhs requested states to provide additional police or national guard forces at sp ecified bridges railroads including amtrak were as ked to increase security at facilities and rail hubs and to improve the monitoring of hazardous ma terials hazmat and the trains carrying such materials shipping companies as well as trucking companies were encouraged to improve employee identification checks communications systems improved operator awareness and coordination between the us and canada on crossborder shipments of hazmat budget for homeland security the effective date for shifting most of the responsibilities from former departments and agencies to the new dhs was march 1 2003 while the transfer of functional lines of aut hority and the personnel to ca rry out those functions was relatively straightforward problems arose with initial attempts to ascertain the amount of the appropriated funds actually transferred because functions now performed by dhs were previously performed by predecessor agencies with somewhat diffe rent purposes than homeland security comparisons of responsibilities and anal yses of requests for increased budget authority were difficult to develop the funding lines between fy2003 and fy2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32061crs4 were not identical to lines of functional responsibility before nd after transfer problem made more difficult because the basic documentation of appropriations in the presidents fy2004 budget was prepared after the formation of dhs but before final enactment of appropriations for th remainder of fy2003 furthermore the fy2003 appropriations bill was developed using the predhs configuration of ppropriations accounts nd functions while th presidents request for fy2004 used dhs and its administrative layout as the basis for the requests in the similar functional lines the administrations request for additional supplemental funds for operation liberty sh ield also used the new configuration given the different accounting purposes for ppropriations lines be fore and after the formation of dhs amounts for the various functions of the new agency are not always directly aligned with previous accounts from which those functions were funded in their former agencies with the completion of appropriations for fy2004 baseline will be established making future appropriations decisions more easily compared to the previous years levels but at the moment we have comparable numbers for fy2002 which would be the base for showing the large increase in funding which has occurred in nearly all these programs for both 2003 and 2004 table 1 shows appropriations for various as pects of border and transportation security for fy2003 requested amount s for fy2004 amounts approved by each chamber and the conferen ce committee as they completed work on hr 2555 appropriations for the department of homeland security for fy2004 the distinction between border nd transportation security f unctions and other functions funded through the same account lines is so mewhat arbitrary in this sense our analysis uses something akin to functional classification for border and transportation security consequently it does not include activities in the directorate for border and transportation security that have direct bearing on that function such as the office for domestic preparedness odp federal building protection and the secret service on the other hand this functional grouping does include the activities of the coast guard separate agency in dhs not part of the directorate for border and transportation security but which has an essential role in providing border and transportation security as t hose words are commonly understood as noted earlier definitions are arbitrary and some functions contained in other accounts that are related to bor der and transportation secur ity such as those aspects of the science and technology account which improve that security are excluded from this table this table shows an approximation of costs for border and transportation security based on identifyi ng the accounts for which such security functions are the primary function invol ved and do not reflect dhs breakdowns as to estimated am ounts specifically associated with the directorate for border and transportation security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32061crs5 table 1 summary of appropriations border and transportation security

additional funding in the area of border and transportation security the issue for congress is to determine the appropriate levels of such funding in the context of the current budget situation and competing claims for resources the follo wing sections of th report provide detail concerning the operational co mponents of border and trans portation security these details include selected appropriation detail issues of potential interest to the conferees and discussion of some of the challenges facing the different components of border and transportation security securing the nations borders and trans portation systems includes the regulation of imports and exports enforcement of laws pertaining to immigration and visitation borderrelated inspection of ag riculture and livestock oversight of the security of ports federal inspection of airline pa ssengers and baggage and comprehensive approaches to improving overa ll transportation security in addition to these explicit activities associated with securing the borders are set of disparate activities in support of broader goals whic h have been collected under the title border security these ancillary activities include protection of federal buildings training for law enforcement personnel and development of strategic plans and support assistance for state and local first responders this re port excludes these ancillary activities from both the numbers and discussion of border nd transportation security that follows3 some observers might question the exclusion of the bureau of citizenship and immigration services bcis from the discussion of border and transportation security there is question that homel and security is enhanced by the well managed administration of routine immigration services however such services would remain even in absence of any th reats to the homeland immigration activities would continue in any event and including the cost of these activities would distort the true summary costs of borde r and transportation security4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32061crs9 5 us general accounting office major management challenges and program risks department of treasury

this missions vs resources situation prior to september 11 2001 both the gilmore and the hartrudman commissions made specific recommendations regarding the coast guard the hart rudman commission noted that the coast guards ships and aircraft were aging and technologically obsolete and that the coas t guard cutter fleet was older than 39 of the worlds other 41 coastguardlike naval fleets35 the commission noted that the coast guard faced serious readiness issu because of increased operating and maintenance costs and lack of essential capabilities in speed sensors

rebuilding the coast guard the gilmore commission noted that the coast guard has taken on number of additional homeland security missions and that coast guard resources to perform its ordinary missions have been reduced in recent budget cycles with concomitant reduction in mission as an example the commission noted that the coast guard lacked sufficient resources to conduct port vulnerability assessments at the more than 350 us ports the commission recommende d increasing resources for the coast guards homeland security missions but did not suggest vel of appropriate funding36 the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 increased coast guard requirements for homelandsecurity missions including border and transporta tion security without obviously reducing requirement s for other missions as result numerous observers have expressed increased concern for the coast guards ability to perform all its missions as desired levels gao testimony noted that levels of effort on homeland security related functions remain at much higher levels than prior to september 11 2001 while levels of efforts on missions including fisheries enforcement and drug interdiction have dropped substantially gao also stated that the fy2004 budget request for the coast guard contains little that would substantially change levels of effort for most missions and noted th at if the fy2004 coast guard budget request is approved about half of the agencys operating expenses will be directed to fulfilling homeland security responsibilities37 few observers appear to oppose the ge neral notion that the coast guards resources will need to be increased to bring them into better alignment with the services postseptember 11 2001 mission requi rements the issue appears to center more on the question of the size of the increase that will be needed funding for deepwater program more specific coast guard budget issue concerns funding for the deepwater program the coast guards 20year acquisition program to repla ce and modernize its current aging fleet of deepwater capable cutters patrol boats and aircraft among other things these assets perform the outermost portion

guard awarded 17billion 20year contract for the deepwater program to an industry team led by lockheed martin and northrop grummans ship systems prior to th contractaward nnouncement the coast guard estimated that equipment acquisition for the deepwater program was estimated to require over 20year pe riod an annual average of 530 million in constant ie inflationadjusted fy 1998 dollars 500 million for the contractor and 30 million for coast guard administra tion of the program for total equipment acquisition cost of about 106 billion in fy1998 dollars the program has received total of 9142 million to date including 423 million in fy2001 3202 million in fy2002 and 478 million in fy2003 some observers have long been cerned about the coast guards ability to secure adequate funding for the deepwa ter program deepwater supporters are concerned that the annual funding requi rement of 500 million in constant fy1998 dollars for the contractor is being reinte rpreted in budget requests to mean flat figure 500 million per year in nominal dollars which w ill result in less and less actual purchasing power for the program each year due to inflation they are also concerned that the 500 million figure is be ing interpreted as including the annual 30million cost for coast guard administr ation of the program deepwater supporters argue that unless the program is funded at the equivalent of about 530 million per year in constant fy1998 dolla rs the deepwater program will become increasingly underfunded each year the coast guard estimates that funding the program at 500 million per year in nominal dollars would stretch the pl anned deepwater acquisition period from 20 years to about 27 years on march 12 2003 gao testified that under current funding plans the coast guard faces signif icant potential delays and cost increases and that if appropriations hold steady at 500 million in nominal dollars through fiscal year 2008 the coast guard estimates that the
