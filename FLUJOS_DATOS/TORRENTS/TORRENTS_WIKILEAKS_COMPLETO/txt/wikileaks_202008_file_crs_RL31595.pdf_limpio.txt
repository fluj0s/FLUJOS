divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31595organic agriculture in the united states program and policy issues summary congress passed the organic foods produc tion act ofpa in 1990 as part of larger law governing us department of agriculture usda programs from 1990 through 1996 pl 101624 the food agricu lture conservation and trade act of 1990 the act authorized the creation of national organic program nop within usda to establish standards for producers and processors of organic foods and permit such operations to label their pr oducts with usda organic seal after being officially certified by usdaaccredited agents the purpose of the program which was implemented in october 2002 is to give consumers confidence in the legitimacy of products sold as organic pe rmit legal action against those who use the term fraudulently increase the supply and va riety of available organic products and facilitate interna tional trade in organic products policy issues affecting the national organic program since implementation largely reflect the differences in interpretation among st akeholders of the language and intent of ofpa and the actual operation of the program under the final rule the nop was challenged in 2003 by lawsuit cl aiming that many of the regulations were more lenient than the original statut permitted although the issues around the lawsuit were ultimately resolved partly by courtordered rulemaking and partly by an amendment to the ofpa that was att ached to the fy2006 appropriations bill new issues concerning program ope ration continue to arise one of these relates to usdas efforts to write new regulation governing access to pasture for organic dairy cows nd other ruminants tight supplies of certain organic commodities particularly dair products and the entry into the market of major grocery reta ilers wanting to sell organi c foods are adding pressure to this debate critics charge that large organic dairy operations are not abiding by the intent of ofpa by feeding organic grain to cows in feedlots and that the principle of grazing is central to consum ers concept of organic milk supporters of existing regulations point to the need for flexibility in order to maintain an organic dairy sector that can meet growing mand usda published its proposed rules on october 24 2008 the new omnibus law that will govern usda programs and policies through fy2012

as defined in the final rule establishing the us department of agriculture usda national organi c program nop is production system that is managed in accordance with th organic foods production act and regulations to respond to sitespecific c onditions by integrating cultural biological and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources promote ecological balance and conserve biodiversity2 this definition indicates th at organic agriculture is both an approach to food production based on bi ological met hods that avoid the use of synthetic crop or livestock production input s spelled out in detail in the december 2000 rule and broadly defined philosophical approach to farming that puts value on resource efficiency nd ecological harmony interest in organic farming migrated from europe to the united states in the early 1900s beginning in th 1950s as the us public b ecame more concerned about the potential adverse nvironmental and public health effects of agricultural chemicals and socalled fact ory farming methods private research organizations began to conduct scie ntific investigations into nonchemical and nonintensive farming techniques and sm all but slowly increasing number of farmers began to adopt organic production practices ex cept for brief period from about 1978 to 1981 usda did not conduct any activities in support of organic agriculture until ofpa required the department to begin rulemaking to establish the national organic program in 1990 organic sector statistics the annual rate of market growth fo r organic foods and other products has remained around the 20 rate it achieve d beginning in 1990 although analysts generally expect it to moderate over the next decade3 the organic trade associations otas 2007

midwest smallscale growers of organic fruits vegetables herbs and flowers are significant component of individual states agriculture industries8 the high growth rate in sales of organic products can be attributed in part to the higher prices that organic producers nd processors receive for their products according to ers agency economists specula that part of the price premium may be due to higher production costs and to hi gher demand relative to supply for the 20002004 period the most recent data available the annua l average farmgate price premiums for fresh organic broccoli and carrots fluctuated from 75 to 133 above the prices of conventionally grown brocco li and carrots according to ers price premiums for the two vegetables at the wholesale level neve r went below 125 in the same period the ers study goes on to say that laws of supply and demand however make it unlikely that price premiums contributing to higher profits and market growth can coexist over the long run as long as higher profits exist new suppliers will enter the market and once market supply increases faster th an demand price premiums and the commensurate level of higher profits are likely to decline many organic industry participants and observers believe that the price premiums need to decrease if organic foods are to penetrat much beyond the 2 to 3percent level into the mainstream9 the consumer studies that ers reviewed did not permit any clear estimate of future demand for organic products the studi showed that price size packaging appearance and concerns about health and nutrition taste food safety and the environment all play varying roles in consumer decisions to buy organic food surveys on race ethnicity and income levels showed significant diversity the organic foods production act of 1990 congress passed the organic foods pr oduction act ofpa of 1990 title 21 of pl 101624 the food agriculture c onservation and trad act of 1990 the 1990 farm bill with widespread support from organic industry groups the national association of state departments of ag riculture and other farm and consumer groups the organic industry petitioned cong ress to draft the act in the late 1980s after it had been frustrated in its attempts to come to an internal consensus on production and certification st andards the industry ma intained that federal standards would reduce consumer confusion over the many different state and private standards then in use and would promot confidence in the integrity of organic products over the long term manufactur ers of multiingredient

sserted that consistent us organic standard would fac ilitate access to potentially lucr ative international organic market the organic foods production act of 1990 authorized national organic program

processors and handler s to certify that their operations abide by the standards they conduct annual reviews to verify c ontinued compliance it is illegal for anyone to use the word organic on product if it does not meet the standards set in the law and regulations10 the presence of the usda organic seal on product means it is 95 or more orga nic labels on products having 70 to 95 organic content can say made with organic specified ingredients or food groups but cannot carry the seal fore ign organic producers and handlers wishing to export products to the united states may be certified by

another nations organic program11 the regulations under the ofpa are intended to set uniform minimum standards for organic production states may adopt additional requirement s after review and approval by usda furthermore private organic organizations are permitted to affix their own labels in addition to the usda bel indicating that the product meets their standards as well as the nati

da iry operation shed light on major controversy within the organic industry and certain consumer groups12 the article focused on 5300 cow organic farm where the animals were fed almost exclusively on grain and allowed outdoors into feedlot for air and exercise the nop regulation at the core of th dispute is 7 cfr 205239a12 the producer of an organic livestock operation must establish and maintain livestock living conditions which accommodate the health and natural behavior of animals including 1 access to the outdoors shade shelter exercise areas fresh air and direct sunlight suitable to the species its stage of production the climate and the environment 2 access to pasture for ruminants the news article cited organic dairy producers who argued that the regulation means that organic cattle must get some of their nutrition as well as fresh air and exercise from grazing on pasture the colorado operator maintained that his animals have outdoor access but that in an arid state like colorado providing sufficient pasturage for all his cows to graze would be an insurmountable requirement this issue illustrates an underlying tens ion within the organic industry the existence of regulatory standards for or ganic production and pro cessing has allowed more conventional food companies to cr eate organic product lines and enter the market some of the older and generall smaller companies in the industry hold that organic farming practices are an integral part of the meaning of the term organic particularly with respect to standards for the treatment and feeding of livestock these stakeholders maintain that if the pasturage in certain parts of the nation can support only small dairy or beef cattle herds or none at all then such farms should be small or nonexistent in t hose areas others notably some of the newer entrants into the organic market are concerned lest the regulations become so prescriptive that they deprive producers and processors of the opportunity to benefit from the expanding market for organic produc ts the recent entry into the organic market of some large supermarket chains is putting pressure on the industry to meet demand particularly for organic dairy products httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31595crs6 13 nosb meeting minutes february 28 through march 3 2005 at httpwww amsusdagovnosbmeetingsmeetingshtml 14 nosb meeting minutes august 15

allow for subpar organic fish to be sold at premium thus undermining organic standard s and consumer confidence in the organic marketplace environmental groups also criticize the nosb recommendations for not specifying that farm fish be produced in closed controlled production systems these groups criticize the nosb recommendations for 1 allo wing farmed fish to receive feed that is not 100 organic 2 allowing farmed fish to be fed fishmeal derived from wild fish which critics say has the potential to carry certain waterborne contaminants and 3 allowing for the use of open net cages at
