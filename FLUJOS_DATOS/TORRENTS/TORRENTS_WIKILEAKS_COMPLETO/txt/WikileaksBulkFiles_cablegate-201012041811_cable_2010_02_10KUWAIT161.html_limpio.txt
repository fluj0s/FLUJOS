kuwait 137 classified by political counselor pete odonohue for reasons 14 b and d 1 polcouns on february 23 raised ref points regarding usg policy on irans tehran research reactor with counselor rashid alhajiri mfas desk officer for iran alhajiri offered substantive response to our points noting merely that the gok has been following the issue through its representative to the iaea alhajiri added that the gok shares usg concerns about the lack of transparency in irans nuclear program and regularly encourages iran to comply with international safeguards at the same time alhajiri said the gok hopes that the international community can persuade iran to come into compliance through peaceful dialogue rather than through expanded sanctions 2 comment alhajiris tepid response to our demarche reflects the overall gok approach to iran which as noted ref b consists of quietly urging tehran to abide by iaea safeguards while maintaining friendly relationship with its much larger and more powerful neighbor trapped in difficult neighborhood the gok will welcome any proposals that can move iran off its nuclear path including iaea proposals noted ref to ensure that iran receives needed medical isotopes but will not expose itself to iranian ire by getting out front to push for these emblematic of kuwaits position was the statement by deputy pm and fm shaykh dr mohammad sabah february 22 who told the local press that we wish our friends in iran can do their best to reassure the international community about the iranian nuclear program so that there will not be an excuse for imposing sanctions there are wise people in iran he added continuing to call on iran to abide by the requirments of international legitimacy and the iaea end comment for more reporting from embassy
