dollardenominated bonds were converted to valued pesos pesified4 the government of argentina reasoned that both the ifis which continued to lend to argentina and those creditors who participated in the voluntary restructuring and pesification of debt should not have been further penalized because they were actively engaged in helping argentina solve its financial problems in fact there was

in fu ll except under the rare st of circumstances such default would have placed argentin in small group of countries completely shut off from external capital nor was there much room to restructure most of the domestically held bodens many were placed with depositors and financial institutions under some govern ment pressure so defau lt or writedown could have jeopardized the banking system restru cturing bodens held by public sector pension funds would have been politi cally unfeasible for similar reasons5 this left two categories of nonperforming bt that had to take the brunt of the writedown the smaller of the two was 67 billion of mostly bilateral debt owed directly to countries paris club and so commercial bank loan s argentina has yet to deal with the paris club the im

adjustment by increasing taxes and reducing expenditures wh ich combined with the return of robust economic growth in mid2002 allowed argentina to move toward large primary budget surpluses this is the surplus that exists after all public expenditures have been met except for interest on debt the primary surplus is direct measure of countrys fiscal capacity to rvice its debt and theoretica lly is available entirely for debt service it may be increased by rais ing taxes or reducing spending in other areas of the budget the correction of the curre nt account balance from deficit to surplus points to the reversal of borrowing abro ad and the generation of foreign exchange available to repay foreign obligations and rebuild international reserveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32637crs5 7 roubini

structuring process p 182 structural adjustments proved to be more elusive usually the imf helps define the macroeconomic framework for achieving these policy adjustments as third party the imf can lend credibility to the targets from which both debtors and creditors should be able to develop r ealistic expectations regarding the debt workout7 the imf cannot dictate policy but theoretically it can exert leverage through its lending authority with the imf involved in setting policy goals the hardship linked to adjustments especially fiscal may be politically more palatable for the debtor country if promoted as necessary measures to achieve longterm recovery rather than simply appeasing creditor demands for greater repayment in addition creditors may be more accepting of the implied recove ry rate on debt second the imf is the last source of emergency financing for country in default specifically imf policy allows fund lending into sovereign arrears to external private creditors in circumstances in which prompt fund support is considered essential for the successful implementation of the members adjustment program and b the member is pursuing appropriate policies and is making good faith effort to reach collaborative agreement with its creditors8 imf assistance provides breathing room for financially troubled country as it attempts to recover third the imf also has role to play in restructuring the debt although it does not participate directly in debt restructuring negotiations by setting the policy adjustment guidelines and providing emergency financing the imf acts as an official arbiter and obviously has an influe ntial role in encouraging consensual and expeditious negotiations it also has intere st in quick resolution as creditor and in the case of argentina was one of the largest the major dispute between the argentine government and its creditors involved differing perceptions of the countrys ability versus willingness to service its debt argentina insisted that not all residual fi nancial resources ava ilable for debt the primary surplus should be so used the countrys massive economic downturn resulted in 50 poverty rate with real per capita gdp re treating to levels not seen for 30 years argentina deemed social programs and domestic investment critical for its economic recovery and political stability under these circumstances it is serious political some would say moral decision to determine the percentage of public res ources that should be spent on social programs versus debt reduction decision that also hinges on defa ulting countrys bargaining power9 this is where argentina and its creditors were unable to come to terms while it was widely understood that argentina would not be able to repay its debt in

rate c ountrys ability to adjust policies and the amount of debt issued shortterm and in foreign currenciesthe question remained what amount and conditions would satisfy both creditors and the argentine government this probl em was never satisfactorily resolved in part because the traditional arbitrati on role of the imf was compromised countries in default come to an agreemen t with creditors or like argentina risk costly prolonged litigation and ostracization from financial markets there are formal rule books for how to proceed but all parties are usually best served by avoiding protracted and confrontati onal negotiation negotiations may include formal meetings between creditor committees and government advisory groups less formal consultation arrangements or even less structured communications part of the process is assessing the market va lue of the defaulted debt one important benchmark the process can be lengthy and in some respects may resemble more of an exchange of views than true negotiation historically this has resulted in timely resolutions and greater than 90 bondholde r participation rate with argentina clearly being the exception widely accepted basic guidelines suggest that creditors should be treated equally in terms of taking losses although domestic and foreign debt tend to be treated diffe rently and that the govern ment in default should make every reasonable effort to pay as much as it can th generalities obviously allow for great deal of leeway for interp retation in individua l debt negotiations10 sovereign debt workouts typically invol ve issuing new debt for old under more lenient conditions that allow country eventu ally to recover its financial standing in the international community recovery rates have varie d depending on the circumstances of each case since 1990 for example sample of nine latin american sovereign debt restructurings i ndicates that the reduction in the value of the debt often referred to as the ircut ranged from 0 to 45 with an unweighted average of between 3540 considerably more generous than argentinas final offer of 7074 reduction see below11 clearly there is room for different reso lutions but the important goal to achieve for argentina was longterm debt sustainability this may be defined as an overall debt burden being consis tent with the countrys overall capacity to make payments12 the concept implies that the debt payment schedule must be reduced smoothed out and extended so that the count ry can afford payments under reasonable economic assumptions it is in the creditors interest to get country to pay as much as possible within this constraint to ignore it is to risk future default and starting over againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32637crs7 13

default was unprecedented in si ze leading to highly complex and contentious debt restructuring process significantly because only 53 of argentinas debt carried the burden of rest ructuring the writedown had to be huge for argentina to achieve its debt sustainability goals notwithstanding argentinas predicament creditors argu ed that argentina was not absolved of its responsibility to negotiate and devise restructuring plan that would allow argentina to reduce its overall debt treat multiple creditors in nondiscriminatory fashion and minimize the potential for lengthy and costly law suits restructuring over 100 bonds denominated in seven currencies and governed by the laws of eight legal jurisdictions greatly complicated the task for example debt falling under british and japanese law operates under collectiveaction clauses which makes for relatively easier resolution by allowi ng majority of bondholders to make binding decisions for all coll ectiveaction clauses did not apply to debt governed by us new york german or italian law the result was multiple class action and individual law suits filed in the united states and european countries13 argentina initially juggled its debt dilemma by putting off private bondholders to negotiate with the imf in fact bondhol ders did not have th eir first real contact with argentine authorities until march 2003 15 months after the crisis began at that time argentina intimated that all debt would not be treated equally with foreign bondholders expected to take the largest bt writedown deta ils of argentinas offer however would not surface for another six months while negotiations with creditors remained stalled on septem ber 10 2003 argentina entered into new controversial threeyear 126 billion imf st andby arrangement replacing recently expired sevenmonth interim arrangement following tense negotiations the imf with strong support from the united states acquiesced to what some characterized as soft agreement with argentina after it missed 29 billion payment putting it technically in arrears with the imf for one day14 the imf agreement provided the necessary policy framework for formal negotiations with private bondholders to be gin importantly this framework was limited and included accepting argentinas formal offer to commit to primary fiscal surplus of 3 of gdp for 2004 alt hough it would devote slightly less than that to actual debt payments15 the imf interpreted this effectively as minimum for argentinas commitments to debt service but in retrospect creditors correctly saw it as more of longterm maximum that signaled they should expect larger debt writedown than initially anticipated in setting what many viewed as low primary surplus target the imf lost credibility with

debt restructuring process the dubai proposal shortly after the imf program was in place argentina turned to bondholders making an initial offer on septembe r 22 2003 at the imfworld bank annual meetings held in dubai the united arab emirates it was widely interpreted as an offer to pay 25 cents on the dollar of th principal value of the debt with recognition of past due interest an unpr ecedented stand on net present value npv basis financial institutions estimated this to be 90 rather than 75 reduction in the value of the bonds16 argentina argued from the outset that this was consistent with the 3 primary surplus target controversial position given that strong economic growth supported much larger surplus by december 2003 even the imf recognized that argentina could muster higher primary surplus and make good on greater portion of its defaulted debt17 the dubai pr oposal met with resistence from creditor groups their governments and the imf initial speculation that the offer was only bargaining ploy soon gave way to sense that argen tina was sincere and unlikely to change its position bondholder groups immediately rej ected the dubai offer and the imf delayed the

creditors complained that argentina continued to meet with them only on its own terms effectively dictating its position rather than offering an exchange of terms many meetings were held in buenos aires which increased creditor costs and ran counter to historical precedent in response many refused to meet with the argentine debt consultation groups others pressed for injunctions in us courts to have liens placed on argentineowned property in the united states argentina also took hard stand with the imf declaring it would refuse to make the schedul ed 31 billion payment unless it could be assured that the imf would approve the second review and th related disbursement of funds needed to cover that payment20 these events led to an unusual standoff nd highlighted not only the fact that large debtor like argentina wields its ow n leverage against lenders but that the imf with 15 billion invested in argentina had its own interests at stake in keeping argentina from falling into arrears to the extent that this was motivating factor for imf actions it worked against priv ate bondholders who had hoped that the imf standby arrangement would be an effec tive inducement for argentina to improve its debt restructuring offer in the end compromise was reached in which argentina agreed to negotiate formally with all cr editors but it did not change its fundamental offer with respect to the depth of the debt writedown or increasing its financial commitment beyond the 3 primary budget surp lus the imf was criticized in the press and by investment firms for failing to deal more strictly with argentina which again became the central i ssue of the third review scheduled for june 2004 the final buenos aires offer argentina began seemingly earnest negotiations with bondholder groups in april 2004 but bondholders again contested this process in the middle of series of meetings which bondholders again char acterized more as presentations than negotiations argentina unexpectedly canceled further talks and tabled its final offer on june 1 2004 formal 18ka filing wa s made with the us securities and exchange commission sec on june 10 outlining the provisions of this agreement21 bondholders rejected this unilateral offer even before it could be fully analyzed arguing that argentina had failed once more to live up to its imfimposed commitment to make good faith effort to reach collaborative agreement the buenos aires offer differed by recogn izing past due interest through the end of december 2001 provided at least 70 of the bondholders

could restart the review proc ess as have other countries in the paststipulated that argentina would increas payments should economic growth exceed predetermined baselines this provision was predicated on strong and sustained growth of the argentine economy which c ould not be guaranteed and in any case bondholder groups found it to be marginal increase at best and unattractive for those unwilling or unable to wait years for the full valuation of this option to be realized22 many features of the dubai proposal were retained so that the debt write off still amounted to 75 of outstanding debt but on present value rather than nominal basis this arrangement w ould have allowed president ki rchner to save face by still claiming 75 writedown in debt wh ile improving the offer to bondholders considerably over the dubai proposal the huge loss to bondholde rs however would still have been unprecedented nd the offer was widely rejected the timing of the offer was also intere sting coming before the june 2004 imf review argentina needed to represent its elf as making good faith negotiations with creditors in order to remain in good standing with the imf while the june

ultimatum and lobbied to have argentina declared in breech of imf conditions they also returned to the courts and responded with counter proposal that would have 1 shortened ma turities 2 included

its bondholders whose respective assumptions re garding argentinas ability to repay creditors proved irreconcilable the imf and any leverage it had was sidelined in august 2004 however when argentina announced it would suspend its imf agreement thereby giving up temporarily access to further borrowing24 it was clear at that point that argentina was out of compliance with the imf arrangement including the commitment to enter into good faith negotiations with creditors argentina was effectively playing off agai nst each other the three pillars of crisis resolution policy adjustment imf

output and revenue needed to achieve debt sustainab ility without huge writedown even after the restructuring which provided argentina with significant debt relief the stock of public debt exceeded 80 of gdp although debt service has been greatly reduced by the lower interest rates and leng thened maturities of the new bonds33 debt sustainability is still not assured but has been buttressed by other factors such as continued strong economic performance and tax collection as well as the beginnings of renewed financial relationships with the international financial markets the need for sustained fiscal discipline is anothe r key challenge to argentine public policy the default was not only unprecedented fo r its lengthy resolution over three years low recovery rate 30 of npv and large residual holdout 24 of creditors but for the process that stre tched creditors would say flaunted the guidelines of sovereign bt negotiations this app lies to both broadly understood informal guidelines and more formal understanding as embodied in the imfs policy of lending into private arrears other countries may l ook to argentina as model for reneging on sovereig n debt but the cost of ar gentinas financial collapse in longterm social and economic terms has been devastating under the best scenario argentina faces decad of foreign debt repayments while it tries to rebuild an economy that has suffered through high levels of poverty unemployment and crime for investment firms and other holders of developing country debt the mere thought that others might follow argentina s example reinforces their belief that such default is highly negative precedent creditors vilified ar gentinas negotiating tactics but the financial markets appear willing to return to argentina it will also be interesting to see if argentina can avoid any future borrowing from the imf it had an imf arrangement in place continually from 1984 until january 2006 but appears determined to remain free of imf influence the imf there are important questions related to imf decision making first an imf audit of its own actions found that prior to the crisis surveillance was ineffective and conditionality weak while assumptions about ec onomic growth and debt sustainability were overly optimistic so the fund lent too much for too long into an untenable situation thereby hurting more than helping argentina34 t h i m f struggled with the difficult task of defini ng clear threshold for insolvency doing so earlier would have helped argentina in not cutting argentina off sooner the additional imf lending only increased argentinas debt problem displaced other creditor debt for seniority in repayment nd left fewer financial resources to be used in assisting argentina postcrisis this severely constrained

the imf was virtually assured of being repaid argentina repeatedly threatened to default on the fund lending the appearance of having undue leverage when it came time for discussing quarterly reviews and imf debt rollover third the imfs leverage proved insufficien t to persuade argentina to negotiate truly consensual understanding with credito rs and so the imf lost some credibility as the official arbiter of debt restructuring in fact the imf was critical factor in supporting the 3 primary surplus targ et repayment ceiling creditors found unacceptable creditors and analysts furt her criticized the imf for not weighing in clearly on argentinas debt repayment capacity fourth argentina also demonstrated the now wellknown lesson that imf financial assistance without policy reforms is insufficient to resolve serious debt problem experts on interna tional financial crises including those at the imf understand that imf lending should be ava ilable to countries dedicated to policy reform and with the political will and strength to see the reforms through in the alternative investor confidence and thei r money does not retur n and the financial crisis only tends to deepen35 in practice policy reform can be politically difficult but argentina presents clear case where the ultimate costs were much higher for lending too long to country incapable of achieving it since argentinas restructuring the imf has sought to modify its policies to limit the possibility of repeating such prolong ed and painful debt workout it seeks to provide clearer rules for 1 limiting bo rrowing from the fund 2 providing better oversight and monitoring 3 improving options for policy support without lending and 4 reevaluating the good faith criterion in the context of resolving sovereign debt arrears36 us policy the argentine situation points to the evolution of an interesting policy dilemma for the united states as well the ited states government including the congress is concerned with the treatment of us investors abroad but in the case of argentina the official us re sponse was limited mostly to communications through the imf this is consistent with philosophy supporting market solutions particularly in light of the moral hazard criticism made against earlier bailouts it may also reflect priority for concerns over international financial stability and imf liquidity which may be at odds with s upporting the interests of private bondholders historically this too is an interesting outcome during the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s the solvency of us creditors was of paramount concern for th us government and so they had the upper hand in negotiating sovereign restruct urings by the 1990s however congress in particular began to rais concerns

focusing on the bilateral relationship between the united states and argentina march 10 2004 s hrg 108879financially troubled countries by th time argentina defaulted the pendulum appears to have swung in the opposite dir ection with little interest in the official sector and particularly the united states directly intervening in debt workouts37 since taking office the bush administration has made clear that the united states would longer support large sovere ign bailouts but instead allow markets to resolve these financial disruptions this commitment however proved easier to articulate than enforce although the bush administration did not jump to the bilateral rescue of argentina as the clinton administration had with mexico in 1995 it has made smaller efforts with uruguay for example more to the case at hand when argentina repeatedly sought help fro m the imf the united states proved to be one of the strongest voices of support spite the silence emanating from the us treasury therefore any criticism of the imfs response to argentina cannot be divorced from us policy which when faced with this serious developing country financial crisis was not in position to steer the parties away from costly and prolonged resolution and which has been criticized for its overall lack of leadership38 the us congress also chose not to ex ercise its voice strongly paying more attention to the economic crisis in argentina than the actual debt restructuring in the one hearing on argentinas debt us i nvestors were afforded little sympathy by members and witnesses alike and much mo re concern was directed at the potential loss of credibility in international financial markets and the role of the imf little doubt was left that the time had passed when official government action would be sanctioned to support us privat investors in cases like this39 emerging markets and debt restructurings investors paid heavy price in the arge ntine default including those in the united states who sought bigger role from congress and the us treasury in seeing that their rights and investme nts were honored us bondholders hoped to have the united states weigh in officially on the restructuring agreement either through its voice at the us treasury or the imf the united states carries much weight at the imf and can send strong signal as to whether imf reviews will be supported given the limitations of litigation against sovereigns this was the primary leverage available to influence argentin as decisions and the united states was not perceived as pursuing this option with an zeal the message sent was that the creditors were on their own to deal with the argentine government some analystshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32637crs17 40 porzecanski ibid pp 33032 41 for

markets have already adjusted by adopting collective action clauses as standard provisions in emerging market debt ot her changes are being discussed in the financial community to evaluate options for imposing some form of enforced guidelines or code of c onduct on countries reluctant to meet their contractual obligations41 as far as designing and creating an international bankruptcy agency there remains little enthusiasm for resurrecting this idea after the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism sdrm promot ed by the imf failed to take hold42 the fact that debt workouts are being completed even if not always smoothly or in timely fashion may suggest that the market system with imf assistance approach is still preferable to again trying to reinvent the international financial architecture with some type of statut ory sovereign bankruptcy option but the argentine case was not resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all parties with quarter of the bondholders opting for cos tly litigation spite the uncertainty of outcome the success of this litigation may yet influence the future of debt workouts because as argentina has s hown once insolvency occurs and debt becomes far too large to manage there ma be little incentive for countries to work within the existing unenforceable system in finding quick and consensual solution leaving all parties worse off
