the house and senate versions of hr 3199 reauthorization of sunset provisions in the usa patriot act pl 10756 the house version of this measure addresses riskbased funding for homeland security grants the house version of hr 3199 passed july 21 2005 would direct dhs to allocate 100 of funds appropriated for homeland security assistance to states based on risk and it would establish mechanism for doing so the senate version passed july 29 2005 is silent on the matter this crs report addresses several policy questions raised by the grant allocation method proposed in the house version of hr 3199 and the method in pl 10990 it does not focus on the differences in the amounts appropriated for homeland security grants and reauthorization of usa patriot act provisions legislative context the context within which conferees will consider the two versions of hr 3199 includes three elements first concern about current dhs practices in allocating homeland security assistance grants to states based on arguably minimal guidance from the usa patriot act second the recommendation of the 911 commission that homeland security assistance supplement state and local resources based on risk and vulnerability and third the provisions of hr 3199 as passed by the house which would establish riskbased method for distributing grants1 current dhs practice since fy2003 dhs has allocated funds based on risk through only one of its state and local homeland security assistance programs 1 the house originally passed the grant formula provisions as separate bill hr 1544 on may 12 2005 crs2 the urban area security initiative uasi program2 other grant allocations were based on statutorily guaranteed share of available funds or on state population in fy2003 and fy2004 dhss office for domestic preparedness odp allocated funds from the other programs3 using formula that guaranteed each state and the district of columbia base of 075 of total appropriations 0025 for territories with the remainder of total appropriations allocated in proportion to the ratio of the recipient jurisdictions population to the total national population4 in the fy2005 department of homeland security dhs appropriations pl 108334 congress directed odp to allocate funding for the state homeland security grant program shsgp the law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp the emergency management performance grant program empg and citizen corps programs ccp in the same manner as the fy2004 allocations5 in the absence of statutory or other congressional guidance dhs allocated the remaining fy2005 homeland security assistance funding in direct proportion to the ratio of each states population to the total national population6 911 commission recommendation in august 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission criticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommended that the distribution not remain program for general revenue sharing7 while acknowledging that every state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response the 911 commission recommended that state and local homeland security assistance should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support the 911 commission offered two highrisk vulnerable cities as examples saying now in 2004 washington dc and new york city are certainly at the top of any such list8 hr 3199 this bill as passed by the house includes provisions directing dhs to allocate 100 of funds appropriated for homeland security assistance to states based on risk and it would establish mechanism for doing so house 2 the uasi program includes grants to highthreat highrisk urban areas port security grants rail security grants intercity bus security grants trucking industry security grants and buffer zone protection program grants 3 the programs include the state homeland security grant program the law enforcement terrorism prevention program citizen corps programs and the emergency management performance grant program 4 pl 10756 usa patriot act section 1014 guarantees each state base of 075 of total appropriations for domestic preparedness however it is silent on how the remaining appropriations are to be allocated to states and localities 5 ibid 6 us department of homeland security office for domestic preparedness fiscal year 2005 homeland security grant program program guidelines and application kit washington nov 2004 p 1 7 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report washington gpo july 2004 p 396 8 ibid crs3 conferees are likely to take into account these provisions which were included as well in another housepassed bill hr 1544 this crs report addresses the following four policy issues that may confront the conferees as they consider how homeland security funds are to be allocated to the states what is the difference between guaranteed base allocation and guaranteed minimum allocation what is the conceptual difference and how would the difference affect the amount of money states would receive what risk factors should be included in riskbased funding formula should natural and technical disaster risks be considered as factors who should determine the risk factors legislation in the 109th congress conference to resolve the differences between the house and senate versions of hr 3199 could possibly determine new homeland security assistance distribution formula additionally congress passed the fy2006 dhs appropriations and the conference on the act addressed the distribution formula it did not however alter the formula pl 10990 pl 10990 maintains the current formula in which states dc and puerto rico are to receive 075 of total appropriations and us insular areas are to receive 008 of total appropriations9 it does require however states to update their state homeland security strategies in accordance with the interim national preparedness goal to be eligible for federal homeland security assistance additionally the act does not specify what risk factors the office for domestic preparedness odp is to consider in determining the remainder of appropriations following the distribution of state base amounts pl 10990 requires the government accountability office gao to review the threats and risk factors used by the dhs secretary in determining discretionary grant allocations the urban area security initiative uasi and subgrants10 and report to congress on the review later than november 17 2005 hr 3199 hr 3199 as passed by the house proposes to change the distribution of dhs homeland security assistance to states and localities the 9 pl 10756 section 1014 10 the subgrants include port security trucking industry security intercity bus security intercity passenger rail transportation security and buffer zone protection grants crs4 senatepassed version is silent on the manner the house version of hr 3199 proposes to allocate total appropriated funds for dhs homeland security assistance based on risk and proposes to establish first responder grants board to review state homeland security plans and to assist the dhs secretary in determining state riskbased allocations grant allocation methods discussion of the house version of hr 3199 and pl 10990 formulas and other grant allocation provisions follows housepassed hr 3199 this bill proposes to allocate 100 of appropriations for dhs federal homeland security assistance programs at the discretion of the dhs secretary based on risk and in consultation with first responder grants boards evaluation and prioritization of state homeland security applications11 the first responder grants board would be established to evaluate and prioritize state homeland security applications based on the following risk criteria the variables of threat vulnerability and consequences with respect to the nations population including transient commuting and tourist populations and critical infrastructure12 the bill would guarantee minimum amount to each state 025 of total appropriated funds for shsgp letpp and uasi without significant international border or not adjoining body of water through which an international boundary line extends13 states with significant international border14 or adjoining body of water through which an international boundary line extends would be guaranteed minimum of 045 of total appropriations for shsgp letpp and uasi15 us possessions and territories and eligible tribes collectively would be guaranteed minimum of less than 008 of total appropriations for shsgp letpp and uasi16 state would receive the guaranteed minimum if after dhs allocates funding based on the discretion of the dhs secretary and the first responder grants boards evaluation and prioritization of applications the state is not in line to receive 025 or 045 respectively of total appropriations as an example if wyoming received an amount that equaled 020 of total appropriations based on the discretion of the dhs secretary and the evaluation and prioritization by the first responder grants board wyoming would be given an additional 005 to reach the guaranteed minimum or floor of 025 wyoming does not have an international border or 11 hr 3199 section 128 sec 1803 12 hr 3199 section 128 sec 1804a 13 hr 3199 section 128 sec 1804c5a 14 hr 3199 proposes the determination of significant international border be at the discretion of the dhs secretary 15 hr 3199 section 128 sec 1804c5b 16 hr 3199 section 128 sec 1804c5cd crs5 adjoin body of water through which an international boundary extends wyoming would not receive any additional funding after receiving the guaranteed minimum pl 10990 pl 10990 does not alter the funding formula dhs uses in distributing state and local homeland security assistance it maintains the requirement of 075 of total appropriations for domestic preparedness guaranteed to states17 the act is silent on which risk factors dhs should use in determining state and local allocations of homeland security assistance since population could be considered risk factor it is possible that dhs could allocate funding in fy2006 in the same manner as it allocated funding in fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 dhs secretary michael chertoff testified however before the house homeland security committee in april 2005 that funding to states and localities for homeland security assistance should be based on specific risks instead of states population percentage of the national population18 dhs secretary chertoff however did not specify what risk factors should be used policy questions the development and implementation of riskbased distribution formula including or excluding guaranteed base and minimum amounts raise some policy questions that may confront conferees on hr 3199 guaranteed minimum versus guaranteed base both hr 3199 as passed by the house and pl 10990 would guarantee to each state certain percentage of the total appropriation housepassed hr 3199 would guarantee each state minimum pl 10990 guarantees each state base on the surface the two terms may appear to be similar but they differ in that each is associated with distinctive allocation method minimum as defined in hr 3199 is the smallest amount each state would receive after riskbased state allocations are determined were the riskbased calculations to result in any state allocation less that the statutorily defined minimum the allocations of states receiving more than the minimum would be reduced proportionally so that all states would receive at least the minimum base as defined in pl 10990 is an amount guaranteed to each state without regard to risk after allocation of base amounts to states pl 10990 silent on how the remainder of total appropriations is to be allocated 17 pl 109090 title iii 18 us department of homeland security

visited oct 20 2005 crs6 the present allocation of federal homeland security assistance and the allocation method in pl 10990 which includes base was criticized by the 911 commission which referred to the base as revenue sharing without regard to states risk of terrorist attacks some however argue that the base allocation is way to ensure that each state receives some sort of homeland security funding and is prepared at some level for terrorist attacks as conferees negotiate to resolve house and senate differences on hr 3199 they may opt to consider whether to legislate the grant allocation method with guaranteed base or guaranteed minimum that is they may choose to decide whether to provide every state with the same amount of base funding and then allocate the remainder of total appropriations based on risk or b to allocate total appropriations based on risk and then if state does not receive certain amount or percentage minimum provide additional funding to the state to meet

determine what constitutes significant international border b 045 is not base but an amount state is guaranteed if it has significant international border or borders on body of water through which an international boundary runs hr 3199 authorizes dhs to determine what constitutes significant international border riskbased factors fundamental policy question associated with riskbased funding is what risk factors to use in determining the allocation of federal homeland security assistance examples of possible risk factors include perceived threats homeland security capabilities population size critical infrastructure assets and transportation assets to accurately assess the risk factors one would need to determine the threat to the population critical infrastructure and transportation and determine the consequences of such threat additionally the homeland security capabilities needed to prevent respond to and recover from terrorist attacks and natural and technical disasters would need to be assessed the methods of threat and vulnerability assessment suggest variety of factors that might be used in devising riskbased funding formula for allocating homeland security assistance to states and localities see appendix for list of possible threat homeland security capability population critical infrastructure transportation and other factors that might be considered in risk assessment natural and technical disaster risks19 recent history highlights the threats posed by natural and technical disasters as evidenced by the 67 major disaster 19 technical disasters are unintentional manmade emergencies such as an accidental chemical spill crs11 declarations in 2004 and most recently by hurricanes katrina and rita20 the dhs office for state and local government coordination and preparedness slgcp is currently tasked with developing and implementing national program to enhance the capacity of state and local agencies to respond to incidents of terrorism particularly those involving weapons of mass destruction wmd as well as natural disasters through coordinated training exercises equipment acquisition and technical assistance21 slgcp performs these functions through its administration of dhs homeland security assistance programs the assistance includes the state homeland security grant program shsgp the urban area security initiative uasi the local law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp the assistance to firefighters grant program fire the emergency management performance grant program empg and citizen corps programs ccp22 as indicated later in this report some observers acknowledge that since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 dhs has been primarily focused on terrorism rather than on natural and technical disasters the majority of dhss grant programs emphasize preparing for responding to and recovering from terrorist attacks23 as an example the administrations fy2006 budget request proposed that assistance to firefighters grant program fire applications that enhance terrorism response capabilities should be given priority24 as conferees negotiate house and senate differences on homeland security grant funding they may be asked to consider not only the grant allocation method but also the inclusion of specific natural and technical disaster risks in the funding distribution formula possible issues in considering this type of change include potential implementation difficulties in adding natural and technical disaster risks to the funding distribution formula b whether dhs should be granted discretion in determining natural and technical disaster risk factors associated with any riskbased formula and c whether it is advisable to change the status quo or whether the dhs terrorism emphasis should be retained without change the following table displays risk factors proposed in hr 3199 as passed by the house and pl 10990 neither specifically identifies natural and technical disaster risks as funding formula factors but hr 3199 proposes that other risks or catastrophic risks be considered after priority is given to specific terrorism risks 20 see federal

board to evaluate and prioritize state homeland security assistance applications based on current risk assessment of terrorist threats against critical infrastructure sectors it also proposes the board specifically consider the following threats biological threats nuclear threats radiological threats incendiary threats chemical threats explosives suicide bombers cyber threats and any other threats section 1804 c3 proposes the board take into account any other specific threat to population or critical infrastructure giving greater weight to threats of terrorism section 1804 c4 federal homeland security assistance programs whether dhs homeland security assistance programs are suitable for addressing natural and technical disasters is another policy question conferees may be asked to consider congress appropriated 297 billion for dhs homeland security assistance in fy200625 three assistance programs the state homeland security grant program shsgp the urban area security initiative uasi and the law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp focus specifically on preparing for responding to and recovering from terrorist attacks these programs were appropriated 211 billion in fy2005 71 of total funding for dhs assistance programs three assistance programs are considered allhazard focused the emergency management performance grant program empg citizen corps programs ccp and assistance to firefighters fire these grant programs were appropriated 860 million in fy2005 29 of the total funding for dhs assistance programs shsgp uasi and letpp specifically identify training and equipment that are developed to respond to terrorist attacks including wmd incidents it could be argued that the programs currently administered by dhs meet state and local needs in preparing for responding to and recovering from natural and technical disasters because the training equipment planning and exercises could support response to terrorist attack or to natural or technical disaster

responders allhazards capabilities continue to evolve gao05652 washington july 2005 p 27 one could argue that most first responder capabilities in the areas of protection response and recovery are similar across all emergency events these similar capabilities are reflected in such activities as controlling entry to emergency areas recovering victims treating casualties providing basic living needs for survivors restoring essential services and maintaining law and order26 on the other hand some might argue that the programs focus on terrorism inhibits state and local governments ability to adequately respond to natural and technical disasters as examples the state homeland security grant program shsgp funds are to be used to enhance the capability of state and local governments to prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism including those involving the use of weapons of mass destruction wmd the urban area security initiative uasi funds are to be used to enhance highthreat highrisk urban area governments ability to prepare for and respond to threats and terrorist attacks involving wmd and the law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp funds are available to assist state and local law enforcement agencies in activities to prevent terrorism states and localities might maintain that they do not receive enough funding to prepare for respond to and recover from natural and technical disasters because 71 of dhs homeland security assistance is terrorismfocused allhazards some favor shifting governments focus to one on all hazards capabilities assistance and funding that support states and localities in preparing for responding to and recovering from any emergency whether natural and 26 us government accountability office homeland security the

stated by the government accountability office gao in report dated july 2005 prior to september 11 2001 the federal governments role in supporting emergency preparedness and management was limited primarily to providing guidance and grants for planning mitigation and equipment before largescale disasters like floods hurricanes and earthquakes and response and recovery assistance after such disasters since september 11 2001 the federal government has awarded billions of dollars to state and local governments for planning equipment and training to enhance the capabilities of first responders to respond to terrorist attacks and to lesser extent natural and accidental disasters27 the gao report stated as well that officials from four first responder agencies reported that dhs required too much emphasis on terrorismrelated activities in requests for equipment and training the first responder agencies also reported that they had greater need for assistance in preparing for natural and technical disasters than for terrorist attacks28 also the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states recommended in the 911 commission report that dhs should make homeland security funding contingent on adoption by emergency response agencies of an all hazards incident command system ics29 on september 14 2005 the 911 commission issued status report on its recommendations and stated in the event of terrorist attack or natural disaster clear lines of command and control for responding authorities are essential to minimize civilian and responder casualties30 further allhazards emergency planning was emphasized by president bush in televised speech on september 15 2005 he said our cities must have clear and uptodate plans for responding to natural disasters and disease outbreaks or terrorist attack for evacuating large numbers of people in an emergency and for providing the food and water and security they need31 the conferees might be urged to review the purpose and authorized activities of the dhs homeland security assistance programs specific proposals that could be put forward might include the authorization of shsgp and uasi funding for preparing for responding to and recovering from natural and technical disasters or 27 ibid p 43 28 ibid p 39 29 the 911 commission report p 397 30 national commission on terrorist attacks

the other hand the conferees might opt to maintain the current focus of the majority of dhs homeland security assistance programs on terrorism threats the inclusion of natural and technical disaster factors in funding formula might result in states and localities being better prepared for all hazards not just terrorism an allhazards funding approach could allow states and localities to train conduct exercises and purchase equipment that is suited equally to natural and technical disasters and terrorist attacks this allhazards approach however might arguably result in funding formula that provides disproportionate amount of funding to states and localities that have low threat of terrorism but high threat of natural and technical disasters if congress were to include natural and technical disaster risks in the funding formula it might consider prioritizing state and local recipients based on risks natural and terrorist that threaten highly populated states and cities economic sectors and critical infrastructure of national importance the objective of this prioritization would be to ensure that homeland security funding considers not only natural and terrorism risks but also the national consequences of the risks evaluating potential risk factors in considering risk factors however congress is faced with question of what criteria to use when assessing potential riskbased formula variables risk factors include threats the entity threatened and the consequences of the threat to the specified entity the assessment of potential risk factors is appropriately considered against the following criteria 32 1 validity do the factors serve as measures or indicators of threats the vulnerability of the potential target or potential consequence if catastrophe strikes the target for example does higher population density indicate greater vulnerability to an attack involving weapon of mass destruction what attributes associated with densely populated areas such as numbers of law enforcement personnel on duty the presence of sensors cameras and other technology would reduce the validity of the factor 2 relevance what is the relationship between the factors and the identified items or characteristics is the relationship straightforward or is it murky for example the total number of vehicles traveling through midcity tunnel would probably not be especially pertinent to consideration of the risk of hazardous material accident the number of commercial trucks carrying hazardous material however would be more relevant 32 for discussion of criteria for evaluating the suitability of quantitative indicators see for example raymond bauer social indicators cambridge ma mit press 1966 see also anona armstrong difficulties of developing and using social indicators to evaluate government programs critical review paper presented at the 2002 australasian evaluation society conference nov 2002 wollongong australia crs16 3 reliability the quality of the source of the information used in risk assessment process requires consideration for example population data from the us census bureau are generally regarded as reliable and are used in variety of formulas for allocating aid grants 4 timeliness the currency of the data affects the quality of the discussion on potential risks for example daily intelligence reports that provide information on current terrorist threats would be considered more timely than monthly or quarterly report 5 availability data necessary for the risk factors use as formula variable should arguably be readily and publicly available intelligence information that has been classified by the federal government and not shared with state and local officials would fail to satisfy this criterion authority to select risk factors who should identify the risk factors that will determine funding is another fundamental policy question housepassed hr 3199 proposes risk factors that dhs is to consider but it proposes to give large degree of discretion to dhs even though the house version of hr 3199 proposes list of risk factors for the first responders grants board to evaluate and prioritize it proposes that the dhs secretary use discretion in the final determination of riskbased funding allocations to states and localities pl 10990 does not identify any risk factors for dhs consider thus providing dhs with complete discretion in determining what factors to use in allocating homeland security assistance one might argue that this discretion could result in dhs using population as the only risk factor in determining shsgp and letpp state allocations given the importance of data availability and timeliness as criteria congress may not be in position to accurately determine specific risk factors however because of its oversight responsibilities congress might opt to review dhss risk based methodology and riskbased distribution formula the oversight could address the weight given to risk factors specific threats to key assets and critical infrastructure and plausible consequences to identified threats on the other hand by allowing large degree of discretion to dhs in allocating federal homeland security assistance congress may not be able to determine at least in open hearings the reasoning behind the distribution of funding to states and localities crs17 appendix potential risk factors discussion examples of possible risk factors include perceived threats homeland security capabilities population size critical infrastructure assets and transportation assets in order to accurately assess risk one would need to determine the threat to the population critical infrastructure assets and transportation assets among other factors and determine the consequences of such threat additionally the homeland security capabilities needed to prevent respond to and recover from terrorist attacks and natural and technical disasters would need to be assessed threats homeland security threats facing the nation can be divided into terrorist attacks and natural and technical such as an accidental chemical spill disasters for terrorist threat to be valid intelligence or other indicators would have to show the plausibility of the threat the riskassessment criterion of availability of data may be crucial here restricted access to data due to for example security classification of intelligence information may cause some to question the validity of the threat additionally dhs is responsible for preparing for responding to and recovering from natural and technical disasters one could argue that recent history has shown the nation is threatened more by natural and technical disasters than by terrorist attacks the 67 major disaster declarations in 2004 and hurricanes katrina and rita lend credibility to this argument33 potential terrorist threats include the following biological and chemical agents wmd incidents sniper and shooting incidents and car and suicide bombers potential natural and technical disaster threats include the following hurricanes flooding earthquakes landslides and accidental hazardous material incidents homeland security capability homeland security capabilities are the abilities plans training personnel and equipment of federal state and local government officials first responders and other entities to prevent respond to and recover from terrorist attacks and natural and 33 see federal emergency management agency 2004 major disaster declarations available at httpwwwfemagovnewsdisastersfemayear2004 visited sept 28 2005 crs18 technical disasters in order to assess federal state and local homeland security capabilities one would need to identify perceived threats key assets and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and the consequences of terrorist attacks and natural and technical disasters once the assessments are completed government officials first responders and other key stakeholders can determine the necessary capabilities potential homeland security capabilities might include emergency management plans homeland security plans identified essential tasks needed for responding to terrorist attacks and disasters counterterrorism training natural and technical disaster training identified personnel with assigned prevention response and recovery tasks personnel protective equipment interoperable communications equipment and plans emergency medical response plans and equipment and hospital mass casualty plans and equipment population population population referring here to the number of people in each state relative to the nation as whole is arguably suitable factor since relatively larger number of people can be considered greater risk population density population density here the average number of persons per square mile in each state can be considered viable factor since weapon of mass destruction wmd attack in an area with high population density could result in greater number of casualties than in an area with low population density critical infrastructure nuclear power plants and nonpower reactors nuclear power plants have been identified by number of observers as potential terrorist targets these include decommissioned nuclear power plants and nonpower reactors which are typically used in research and training facilities34 seaports given the possibility of wmd smuggling and the consequent potential for disrupting the national economy many observers have identified seaports as type of critical infrastructure that should be risk factor chemical facilities given the probable consequences of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities or the theft of toxic chemical agents 34 see nuclear regulatory commission website httpwwwnrcgovreactorshtm visited may 18 2005 crs19 chemical facilities could be risk factor especially due to the location of some chemical facilities in high population density areas military facilities pointing to the september 2001 terrorist attack on the pentagon in arlington virginia some observers suggest that military facilities should be included in riskbased distribution formula such facilities may contain large numbers of military personnel highvalue equipment and volatile chemicals and explosives such as ammunition federal facilities some observers cite the 1995 bombing of the alfred p murrah building in oklahoma city as evidence that civilian federal facilities are potential terrorist targets the consequences of terrorist attacks on federal facilities would worsen if the attacks disrupted the federal response to attacks or led to the disruption of vital federal government operations dams dams could be included in riskbased distribution formula since terroristcaused explosion could potentially release high volume of water into populous areas destroy any electrical energy production at the dam and cause significant economic damage electrical power plants nonnuclear the likely economic and psychological consequences of terrorist attacks on electrical power plants might be consideration in designating power plants as risk factor food and agricultural centers terrorist attacks on the nations food supply and agricultural production might be risk considering the possible economic and psychological effects of the attacks oil and natural gas refineries and pipelines even though the majority of oil and natural gas refineries and pipeline distribution systems are located in low population density areas terrorist attacks on them could have severe economic and environmental consequences financial centers one could point to the elevation of the homeland security advisory system to high in august 2004 when financial institutions were identified as possible targets of terrorist attacks as reason to consider the centers risk factors additionally an interruption of operations in the nations financial centers could have possible economic consequences transportation assets rail and mass transit systems arguably the 2004 and 2005 terrorist bombings of trains in madrid and london could cause some to identify rail and mass transit systems as risk factor bridges and tunnels given the nations vast number of bridges and tunnels considering every one of them risk factor is not feasible major bridges and tunnels such as the brooklyn and golden gate bridges and the holland tunnel might be considered risk factors due to their cultural significance additionally bridges and tunnels that are important links in transportation routes for large numbers of persons might qualify as risk factors crs20 airports one could point to the september 2001 terrorist attacks and the use of commercial aircraft as weapon as valid argument for considering airports risk factor not only are airports at risk of terrorists boarding aircraft and using them as weapons but also some may argue an attack on crowded airport or the shooting down of an aircraft while it is landing or taking off further increases the risk and the consequences of an attack other factors stadiums and arenas because they conentrate large number of persons in relatively small location stadiums and arenas especially during significant events such as sports championship games could be considered risk factor educational institutions arguably the psychological consequences of terrorist attacks would be greatly increased if terrorists were to target educational institutions at the elementary secondary or college level given the sense of vulnerability parents would experience following any such attack educational institutions might be considered risk factor however like bridges and tunnels the vast number of educational institutions in the nation might hamper the assessment of risk to these institutions skyscrapers and large commercial buildings as with the attack on the pentagon in september 2001 the attack on the world trade center towers with its economic and psychological consequences arguably identifies skyscrapers and large commercial buildings as valid risk factors international borders and coastlines it can be argued that states with international borders and coastlines face greater risk of terrorist attacks because terrorists may have greater access to such states tourism due to the potential for mass casualty incidents and economic damage from terrorist attacks tourist locations are possible risk factor in addition to the location of tourist destinations the tourist population could possibly be considered risk factor
