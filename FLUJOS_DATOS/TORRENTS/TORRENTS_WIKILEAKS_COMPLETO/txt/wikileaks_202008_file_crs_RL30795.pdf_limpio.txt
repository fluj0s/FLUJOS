105th and 106th congresses respectively this compendium stands on the shoulders of these efforts 4 the listed functions are not necessarily the only way to categorize the reports entries into sections which could have been aggregat ed differently or further broken down 5 for more discussion of functional structur and perspectives within management context see john r schermerhorn jr core concepts of management hoboken nj john wiley sons 2004 pp 119120 and peter f drucker management new york harper row 1974 pp 558563 this usage of the term function differs from usages found in title 5 of the

for major functions and operations of the agency transfer of functions 5 usc 3503 and re ductions in force 5 usc 3502 title 5 does not define the term but the implementing regulations for transfer of functions and reductions in force define function as all or clearly identifiable segment of an agencys mission including all integral parts of that mission regardless of how it is performed 5 cfr 351203 with regard to budgetary accounting the term function refers to categories of federal spending organized acco rding to the purpose or mission of government eg income security energy and

the entries are organized into the following seven functional categories4 information and regu latory management strategic planning performance measurement and program evaluation financial management budget and accounting organization procurement and real property management intergovernmental rela tions management and human resources mana gement and ethics within the management field functions typically refer to business areas that require related bundles of skill or groups of people with similar skills and performing similar tasks5 in the private sector by way of comparison functions often include marketing finance production and human re sources this f unctional orientation is major theme that the companion report addresses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs3 6 crs report rl32388 general management laws major themes and management policy options by clinton t brass most of the compendiums entries discuss specific law or in some cases several related laws the human res ources management and ethics section however presents most civil service laws according to their codification in title 5 of the united states code the way that practitioners and specialists typically discuss these laws for each entry in this compendium one or more crs analysts present brief history of the general management law in section entitled statutory intent and history describe the law itself in section entitled major provisions and close with summary of key velopments and issues in discussion section finally for readers interested in more detail each entry cites selected source reading all the entries in the compendium conform to the overall structure described above but because the laws have different audiences levels of complexity and histories the entries sometimes differ in extent level of detail or emphasis companion report in turn as complement to this compendium the companion report identifies potential ma nagement policy options for congress6 first the companion report provides histori cal context on the roles that congress and the president play in managing the executive branch next the companion report briefly discusses the extent to which mana gement in the public and private sectors can be compared finally the largest share of the companion report analyzes major themes that run through the general management laws and identifies potential management policy options for c ongress the themes include discretion for the executive branch congress frequently faces the issue of how much discretion to give the executive branch congress has several management policy op tions to address delegation situations and help balance agency flexibility with accountability standardization vs customization should the management laws under which agencies operate be sta ndardized with rules that apply uniformly to many different agencies or should some agencies have agencyspecific laws that are customized to each agencys internal and external environments or should there be mix of the two approaches the report discusses advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches and analyzes two options for congress when making these decisions functional silos vs integr ated general management functional perspective eg looking at agency operations from the perspective of budget officer or human resources officer is important because it can boost effici ency through specialization and ensure centralized control over strategic decisions however if functional orient ations become inwardlooking various functions can operate as silos in isolation from one another resultinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs4 in coordination problems or ssed opportunities the report analyzes policy options for congress to bring an integrated general management perspective to solv agency management problems making and measuring progress for over two decades many executive branch agencies have suffered from persistent major management problems often thes problems relate to areas the general management laws were in tended to address the report analyzes potential options for measuring and motivating agency progress in improving management practices agency chief officers and interagency councils statutorily created chief officers eg chief financial officers and chief acquisition officers have increas ed in number and importance in federal agencies as in the private sector congress also established interagency councils of these offi cers the report analyzes options for congress in considering whet her additional chief officers and councils should be established nd how congress might make the councils more accountable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs5 7 commercially produced electronic versions of the federal

origina lly legislated in 1935 49 stat 500 to establish accountability and publication arra ngements for presidential proclamations and executive orders and for federal agency rules and regulations the centerpiece of the resulting system is the federal register an executive gazette produced by the office of the federal register of the national archives and records administration it is printed by the government printing office and lately has been available as well in electronic formats online and via cdrom7 in many respects the federal regist er act of 1935 was response to the increasing number of regulations rules and related administrative actions of the new deal era and the fugitive status of these instruments the expansion of the federal government during world war i had resulted in the presidential and agency issuance of growing quantity of administrative requirements brief experience with gazette the official bulletin had been beneficial but of temporary wartime duration8 its disappearance made difficult situation worse contemporary observer characterized the operative s ituation in 1920 as one of confusion9 and another described the deteriora ting conditions in 1934 as chaos10 during the early days of the new deal administrative law pronouncements were in such disarray that on one occasion government attorneys argu ing lawsuit before the supreme court were embarrassed to find their case was based upon nonexistent regulation11 and on another occasion discovered they were pursuing litiga tion under revoked executive order the response was the mandating of the federal register p r d u c d i n magazine format it is now published each business day soon after enacting the federal register act congress in 1937 amended it and inaugurated the code of federal regulations useful supplement to the register 50 stat 304 this cumulation of the instruments and authorities appearing in the gazette contains almost all operative agency regula tions and is now updated annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs6 12 the federal register act states that every document or order which prescribes penalty has general applicability and legal effect 44 usc 1505later

most major federal administrative law instruments such as executive orders presidential pr oclamations and agency rules and regulations are published in the federal register and code of federal regulations not all such authorities are so produced during the past few years concern has been expressed from time to time in congress about certain national security directives of the president not being subject to accountability or publication under the federal register act they have been variously denominated as national security decision memoranda during the nixonford administrations as presidential directives during the carter administration as national security decision directives during the reagan administration as national security directives during the george h w bush administration and as presidential decision directives by the clinton administration in 1988 house subcommittee held hearings on proposal to amend the federal register act to pr ovide accountability in the use of these presidential directives complication in so legislating is that these instruments are usually all security cla ssified another type homeland security presidential directives was launched by presid ent george w bush in late october 2002 this development sparked renewe d congressional concern bout accountability for these presidential

reliance were placed upon the federal government for the achie vement of certain political and social objectives this required the developmen t of both an expanded administrative law process and new regulatory agencies unlike number of european states at that time the united states did not have in place sophisticated administrative system and had to build one the first step was the passage of the federal register act described elsewhere in this compe ndium in 1935 which required all federal agencies to publish notice of their rules pr oposed rules and legal notices in single readily available source later to be known as the federal register although substantial pr ogress was made in uniform public notice and publication processes for re gulation making by the agencies single general management law covering all the agencies was not passed until after world war ii the administrative procedure act apa 60 stat 237 5 usc 551 et seq enacted in 1946 is considered the seminal federal administrative legislation of the modern era the major contribution of the act was to establish for the first time minimum procedural requirements for certa in types of agency decision making processes its general pur poses were to 1 require agencies to keep the public currently informed of agency organization procedures and rules 2 provide for public participation in the rulemaking pro cess 3 prescribe uniform standards for the conduct of formal rulemaking and ad judicatory proceedings ie proceedings required by statute to be made on the reco rd after opportunity for agency hearing and 4 restate the law of judicial review of agency action the act imposes on agencies certain requirements for two modes of agency decision making rulemaking and adj udication in general the term agency refers to any authority of the government of the ited states whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency c ongress the courts and the governments of territories possessions and the dist rict of columbia are excluded major provisions the apa has two major subdivisions sections 551559 dealing with general agency procedures and sections 701706 dea ling with judicial review in addition several sections dealing with administrative law judges are scattered throughout title 5 sections 1305 3105 3344 5372 and 7521 the structure of the apa is shaped around the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication with differe nt schemes of procedural requirements prescribed for each rulemaking is agency action that formulat the future conduct of persons through the development and issuance of an agency statement designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy it is essentially legislative in nature because of its future general applicability and its concern for policy considerations adjudication on the other hand is concerned with determination of past and present rights and liabilities the result of an ad judicative proceeding is the issuance of an orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs10 13 3 cfr 1993 comp pp 638649beyond the distinction between rule making and adjudication the apa subdivides each of these categories of ag ency action into formal and informal proceedings whether particular rulemaking or adjudicatory proceeding is considered to be formal depends on whet her the proceeding is required by statute to be on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing 5 usc 553c 554a the act prescribes elaborate pr ocedures for both formal rulemaking and formal adjudication and relatively minimal procedures for informal rulemaking virtually procedures are prescribed by the apa for the remaining category of informal adjudication which is by far th most prevalent form of governmental action rulemaking section 553 sets the requirements for informal rulemaking also known as notice and comment rulemaking an agency must publish notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register afford interested persons an opportunity to participate in the pro ceeding through the submission of written comments or at the discretion of the agency by oral presentation and when consideration of the matter is completed incorporate in the rules adopted concise general statement of their basis and purpose 5 usc 553c final rule must be published in the federal register not less than 30 days be fore its effective date 5 usc 553d interested persons have right to petition for the issuance amendment or repeal of rule 5 u sc 553e although the apa does not specify minimum period for public comment at least 30 days have been traditionally allotted more recently executive order 1286613 has prescribed that covered agencies allow at least 60 days agencies are free to grant additional procedural rights and congress has at times particularized requirements for certain agencies or programs the apa also provides for formal rulemaking procedure employed when rules are required by statute to be made on the record after an opportunity for agency hearing essentially this procedure requires that the agency issue its rule after the kind of trialtype hearings procedures normally reserved for adjudicatory orders discussed

congress since 1946 it has maintained its v itality in the face of vast and fundamental changes in the natu re and scope of federal government responsibilities in great measure this accommodation has come about because of judicial rulings that have effected impor tant transformations of the meaning and scope of its otherwise neutral and spare terminology the hallmark of our modern administrative state agency rulemaking through the process of informal rulemaking is creative judicial cu ltivation with the encouragement of the courts rulemaking replaced adjudication as the dominant formal decision making process administrative lawmaking was democratized in series of decisions between 1965 and 1983 that expanded both the obligations of agencies and the role of reviewing courts the result has b een the transformati on wit hout bene fit of legislative amendment of informal rulemaking into new ontherecord proceeding that has fostered widespread pub lic participation in the process to be sure congress has not simply s ilently acquiesced in this revolutionary transformation although c ongress has never undertaken comprehensive revision of the apa it has always recognized that it could do so and with increasing frequency it has supplanted the apas requirements with more explicit directives for particular agencies and programs mirroring the aboved escribed judicial innovations often this legi slation has been aimed at formalizing the procedural protections ensuring effective and mean ingful public participation in agency policymaking thus certain health envir onmental and consumer protection statutes for example contain detaile d hybridrulemaking requi rements and procedural as well as substantive changes14 moreover the deregulation movement of the 1970s and 1980s successfully focused attention on the economic conseque nces of regulation and the need for broader analytic approach to regulatory decision making that assessed the impacts of costs and new technologies the executiv branch took the lead by adding new layers of clearances for rules by executive order that included requirements for consideration and evaluation of their co sts and benefits see executive orders 12291 12498 and 1286615 proposed regulatory reform legislation in recent congresses has included bills that not only would have codified the judicially created procedural requirements of the last two decades but also would have required allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs14 agencies engaged in rulemaking to u tilize methodologies requi ring detailed risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for major regulations which would have been subjected to intense judicial review while these particular reform efforts have been unsuccessful congress has pa ssed several

an agencys costbenefit analysis of proposed or final rule when requested by chair or ranking member of committee of jurisdiction process designed to restrict regulations imposing unfunded costs on state and local governments and the private sector and process designed to ensure that federal agencies use and disseminate accurate information there is also an em erging and controvers ial trend on the part of agencies to attempt to enhance public participation in the administrative process by accepting electronically submitted comments while the apas basic rulemaking model is relatively straightforward it has been argued that the additional requireme nts that have been imposed by congress the executive branch and the courts have made the rulemaking process rigid and burdensome upon agencies in turn this has d to the argument that rulemaking has become ossified with agencies either undertaking resource and time intensive steps to ensure that rule will withstand increased scrutiny or simply circumventing the traditional rulemaking process by issuing policy statements and interpretive rules to effectuate compliance with regulatory agenda ultimately however it would appear that the current apa scheme is likely to continue to be the key vehicle for formulating and implementing agency policy directives selected source reading aman alfred c jr and william t mayton

delegated authority creat ed constitutional tension however this tension has been manifested over the years by variety of legislative attempts to develop review mechanism that would allow congress to exercise its oversight responsibility to assure agency accountability in the exercise of delegated authority initially congress increasingly relied on the legislative veto device that allowed it to delegate power conditionally and to retrieve it or block agency exercise of its delegated authority by the action of both houses one house committee or at times by committee chairman alone in 1983 in

heavily on its traditional mechanisms of control of administrative action such as the aut horization and appr opriations process committee oversight and investigations and the confirmation process as means of restraining perceived regulato ry excesses in addition regulatory reform proposals throughout the 1980s and 1990s consistently contained requirements that agencies perform costbenefit

commissions fccs rule relating to broadcast media ownership was disa pproved by the senate on september 16 2003 but was not acted upon by the house after eight years the limited use to which the rulemaking review mechanism has been put does not appear to be attributable to lack of familiarity with the law but rather to number of other factors some have argued that agencies are more carefully assessing their regulations to avoid possible cong ressional disapproval resolutions others maintain that the current review process discourages utilization of the act these critics point to number of interpretive issues concerning the scope of the laws coverage the judicial enfor ceability of its key requi rements and whether disapproval resolution may be directed at part of rule as factors which introduce uncertainties into the use of th disapproval resolution process specific problems identified by critics of the current process include 1 the lack of screening mechanism to identify rules that require congressional review 2 the absence of an expedited review procedure in the house of representatives 3 the deterrent effect of the ultimate need for supermajority of both houses to veto rule 4 the reluctance to disapprove an omnibus rule where only part of the rule raises objections 5 the uncertainty of which rules are covered by the act 6 the uncertainty whether the failure to report covered rule to congress can be reviewed and sanctioned by court and 7 the scope of the limitation that precludes an agency from promulgating substantially similar rule after the disapproval of rule perceived agency failures to report rules covered by the cra for review and the lack of any basis to timely challenge the substantiality of agency costbenefit analyses were the subject of oversight h earings in both houses during the 106th congress product of those inquiries was th passage of the truth in regulating act of 2000 which required the comptrolle r general to conduct an i

the cgs evaluati ons were to be completed within 180 days of the request although the cgs eval uations were not integrated to coincide with time requirements of the cra they could have provided basis

introduction of new intrusive technologies have contributed to more disparate understandings of the concept of privacy and infringements upon it congress made an initial effort at legislating new kind of privacy protection in 1970 when enacting the fair credit reportin g act regulating the collection and dissemination of personal in formation by consumer re porting entities 84 stat 1128 15 usc 1681

handling of recorded personal information by federal agencies40 major provisions the privacy act provides privacy protecti on in several ways first it sustains some traditional major privacy principles for example an agency shall maintain record describing how any individual ex ercises rights guaranteed by the first amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinen t to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity 5 usc 552e7 second similar to the fair credit repor ting act the privacy act provides an individual who is citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence with access and emendation arrangements for records maintained on him or her by most but not all federal agencies general exemptions in this regard are provided for systems of records maintained by the central intelligence agency and federal criminal law enforcement agencies third the statute embodies number of principles of fair information practice for example it sets certain conditions concerning the disclosure of personally identifiable information prescribes requirements for the accounting of certain disclosures of such information requires agencies to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse deter minations about an individua ls rights benefits and privileges under federal progra ms requires agencies to specify their authority and purposes for collecting personally identif iable information from an individual requires agencies to maintain all records which are used by the agency in making any determination about an individual with such accu racy relevance timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination and provides civil and criminal enforcement arrangements discussion since its enactment the privacy act has been amended on five occasions in 1982 the debt collection act added new exception to the disclosure prohibition for disclosures made to c onsumer credit reporting agencies 96 stat 1749 adding 5 usc 552ab12 that same year the congressional re ports elimination act changed the annual report requi rement of the privacy act and modified the provision for publication of agency systems of records 96 stat 1819 at 18211822 modifying 5 usc 552ae4 and p in 1984 th central intelligence agency information act resolved longstanding controversy by specifying that the privacy act is not authority to withhold from an individual any record which is otherwise accessible to the individual under the provisions of th freedom of information act 96 stat 2209 at 22112212 adding 5 usc

procedures and data protection boards to ensure privacy integrity and verification of data disc losed for computer matching perhaps the facet of the privacy act that has been the most successful is its access procedure the volume of access re quests by record subjects has grown steadily for the most part since the privacy act was first implemented it is however about third of the access request volume of the freedom of information act moreover it appears that the tota l denial caseload is small in proportion to request volume similarly the volume of requests to amend personal records is also steadily growing though it is not nearly so great as the volume of access requests and the total denial caseload is small in pr oportion to the amendment request volume in june 2003 re port the general accounting office urged improved leadership and guidance by the office of management and budget to improve agency compliance with the privacy act around th is same time as pub lic revelations

act faca in 1972 5 usc appendix 86 stat 700 the legislative history pertaining to fa ca reveals that congress had two major concerns about advisory committees before 1972 the first concern was that the public perceived many advisory committees as duplicative and inefficient and otherwise lacking adequate controls or oversight the second concern was the widespread belief that advisory committees did not adequately represent the public interest and that committee meetings we re too often closed to the public congressional enactment of faca established the first requirements for the management and oversight of federal advisory committees to ensure impartial and relevant expertise as required by faca the general services administration gsa administers and provides management guidelines for

federal communications commissi on v itt world communications 466 us 463 1984agencies used notation voting which permitted members to vote sequentially on paper on the basis of circulated written materials thereby making formal meetings unnecessary48 the implementation of the sunshine act has been characterized by difficulties in finding the proper balance between the value of unfettered public access on one hand and candid agency deliberations on the other49 the resulting tension is evident in the disagreements over two issues 1 the definition of what constitutes meeting for purposes of the act and 2 whether the act has diminished the collegial nature of decision making thereby affecting the quality of agency decisions under the act meeting is defined as the delibera tions of at least the number of individual agency members required to ta ke action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business50 deciding when deliberation determines or results in agency action however has proven to be difficult two opposing views have dominated the discussion regarding the definition of meeting adherents of broad definition hol d that meeting encompasses every stage of the decision making process in cluding the early collective inquiry stage when members hold informal discussions and explore various positions supporters of narrower view in contrast hold th at meeting encompasses only the more advanced stage of the decision making process when members focus on specific proposal or proposals51 the supreme court supported the narrowe r definition in 1984 when it held that under the act meeting did not include preliminary discussions among agency officials52 the court ruled that consultative process sessions need not be public because the statutory language contemplates discussions that effectively predetermine official actions it held that in order to fall under the meeting definition such discussions must be fficiently focused on discrete proposals or issues as to cause or be likely to cause the individual participating members to form reasonably firm positions

discussions and thereby reduced collegiality in organizations subject to the acts provisions study of this issue involving multimember agency officials revealed that many are reluctant to discuss substantive issues at open meetings53 those seeking to amend the act believe that colle gial decisions should lead to better more informed decision making this goal they argue is defeated by the need to open most meetings to the public which they believe prevents the type of extensive and consequential interac tion among members that should be the end product of collegial decision making to support this view they cite data consisting of members recollections of how decisions were made before the act was implemented their proposed solution is to amend the act to pr ovide for limited pilot project that would give agencies greater leeway to close meeting provided that within five days of the meeting detailed summary would be made available to the public if such project proved successful c ongress could then make permanent changes in the statute54 several arguments against amending the act have also been advanced some researchers question the view that co llegial decision making prior to the implementation of the act was more deliberative and meaningful than it has been since then they assert that the earlier collegial decision making model was only partially realized they maintain that decisions from this era frequently reflected more the influence of staff or of chairpersons in association with staff than true amalgamation of member views informed by staff expertise55 furthermore the evidence suggests that members are inclined to prepare more thoroughly for open meetings than for closed ones56 consequently it could be argued that members are better informed in their decision making than they were prior to the act finally opponents of amending the sunshine ac t have sometimes suggested that it is incumbent upon members of the multimember agencies to shed their reluctance to deliberate more meaningfully in public meetings57httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs41 selected source reading barrett david facilitating government decision making distinguishing

for the executive agencies realizing that the provisions of the federal reports act were inadequate to control the prolif eration of required paperwork congress had tablished the commission on federal paperwork temporary national study panel in 1974 88 stat 1789 the 1980 statute implemented many of the commissions recommendations and reflected congressional desire to define more clearly the oversight responsibilities of omb regarding federal information collection nd reporting requirements to assist the omb director the statute established the office of information and regulatory affairs oira within omb and author ized its administrator to develop and administer uniform information policies in order to ensure the availability and accuracy of agency data collection although oiras original authorizati on expired in 1983 the office was funded on an annual basis from ombs general appropriations until passage of the paperwork reduction reauthor ization act in 1986 100 stat 3341

the act defines as including small businesses small governmental jurisdictions and cer tain small notforprofit organizations under the rfa federal agencies must prepare regulatory flexibility analysis at the time that either proposed or certain fina l rules are issued the act requires the analysis to describe 1 the reasons why the regulatory action is being considered 2 the small entities to which the proposed rule will apply and where feasible an estimate of their number 3 the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule and 4 any significant alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the stat utory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities regulatory flexibility analysis is not however required if the head of the agency issuing the rule certifies that it will not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities the rfa does not define the terms significant economic impact or substantial number of small entities thereby giving federal agencies substantial discreti on regarding when the acts analytical requirements are triggered also the rfa s analytical requirements do not apply to any final

usc 561570a seeks to overcome what some observers describe as an adversarial relationship between agencies and affected interest groups that often accompanies the fe deral rulemaking process the concept of negotiated rulemaking sometimes referred to as regulatory negotiation or reg neg emerged in the 1980s as supplement to the traditional procedure for developing regulations the act largely codified the practices of those agencies that had previously used the negotiated rulema king procedure and in corporated relevant recommendations of the now defunct administrative conference of the united states acus the act encourages but does not require agencies to consider convening negotiated rulemaking committee before developing and issuing proposed regulation under the administrative proce dure act apa described elsewhere in this compendium the committee composed of representatives of the agency and the various interest groups that would be affected by the proposed regulation addresses areas of concern in the hope that it can reach agreement on proposed regulation the agency can but again is not required to then issue the agreedupon proposal as proposed rule and if appropr iate after public comme nt as final rule under the apa since committee agreement is normally by unanimous consent the expectation is that any rule drafted thr ough negotiated rulemaki ng would be easier to implement and less likely to be the subject of subsequent litigation in establishing negotiating committees agencies must comply with the federal advi sory committee act described elsewhere in this compendium agency actions related to establishing ending or supporting the co mmittees are not judicially reviewable following passage of the negotiated rulemaking act acus served as clearinghouse on regulatory negotiation matters and assisted agencies in establishing procedures for the conduct of regulatory negotiations and the tr aining of personnel when acus was abolished in

proposed rule within fixed period of time the act also allows agencies to pay reasonable travel and per diem expenses and reasonable compensation to committee members under certain conditions discussion negotiated rulemaking is possible s upplement to but not replacement of the normal rulemaking procedures that agencies are required to follow under the apa for any proposal agreed to by negotiated rulemaking committee to take effect the agency must still develop and issue it as regulation under the provisions of the apa the use of negotiated rule making by federal agencies is strictly voluntary also negotiated ru lemaking does not impair any rights otherwise retained by agencies or private parties even if agreement is reached on proposal by negotiated rulemaking committee neither the agency nor the other members of the committee are bound by the agreement an agency need not issue the proposed regulation drafted by the committee if an agreedupon proposal is issued by the agency as regulation under the apa it may still be challenged in court by parties who previously agreed to it in committee agencies are encouraged to convene and use negotiated rulemaking committee only when certain conditions are expected to produce successful or favorable result eg easy identification of those likely to be affected by the rule and where differences exist the parties willingness to consider each others points of view since agreement by the parties generally must be by unanimous consent it is essential that the partie s involved be willing to compromise in order to reach agreement the fact that participants may change their minds and later challenge regulation they initially supported can increas their willingness to participate in the process these factors can however also serve to limit the instances when agencies see negotiated rulemaking as viable option in addition agency experience with the technique indicates that nego tiated rulemaking can be more costly than conventional rulemaking methods particularly at the fr ont end of the process finally research indicates that negotiated rulemaking does not appear to reduce the overall time taken to issue rule or to make rules more likely to avoid litigation these findings are particularly notable given that agencies are instructed to use negotiated rulemaking only when they expect success other research however indicates that negotiated rulemaking can increase satisfaction with the substance of the final rule and with the overall process selected source reading coglianese cary assessing

policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environm ent to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the nation and to establish council on environmental quality its actionforcing directives are meant to ensure that environmental values are given appropriate consideration in all pr ograms of the federal government its policy declaration and its procedures for nvironmental impact assessment have been adopted in many similar state ws and also by other nations the preparation of environmental impact statements eiss has heightened awareness of and attention to the envir onmental effects of actions by federal agencies while also increasing public partic ipation the requireme nts of the law have played limited role in what decisions are ultimately made because the law is procedural and does not blish environmental standa rds it has spawned an enormous amount of informationgathering and analysis activities which have been criticized by supporters as substantively or scientifically inad equate and by critics as too burdensome the national environmental policy ac t should be distinguished from the substantive body of environmental prot ection laws which attempt to correct pollution and resource problems ranging from air and water quality and noise and toxic substances control to the various stat utes related to resource development such as surface mining regulation coastal zone and offshore management or various public land programs in cont rast nepa is relatively short policy declaration and impact assessment law designed to avoid or prevent such

acts effect on ultimate decisions is limited by the agencys other mandates while there now seems to be agreement about the u tility of assessing the environmental consequences of major federal actions the longterm compliance trends depend on whether individual agencies will continue to adapt their practices to the streamlined but rigorous process in ceq regulations for more fully integrating the impact analyses with agency plans and programs otherwise lessened compliance could evolve and l ead to new legal challenges enforcing requirements for preparation of environmental impact statements is partially achieved through public participation and judicial reviews the role of the courts in interpreting and enforcing compliance has been perhaps the most controversial aspect of nepas previous implementation so nepa compliance issues have been raised anew in court challenges especially during period when program changes affect federal resource ma nagement of public lands typical of the effects on nepa compliance are the eis categorical exclusions issued by federal agencies which permit additional activi ties on public lands that would now be excluded from the nepa process unless c

further ruled that the alternativ and environmental consequences must be given full consideration in decision making and subject to administrative procedure act compliance affirmed the longstanding pr actice of preparing regional or programmatic impact statements for related federal actions ie comprehensive impact statements supplemented the public particip ation afforded through eis comment

through the freedom of information act the council on environmental qualitys authority to issue its implementing regulations binding upon the federal agenci has been broadly endorsed by the supreme court whose reviews of lowe r court opinions have held procedural compliance with nepa to be sufficient discussion continuing issue for future nepa implementation is its effect on the policy level of decision making given its ear ly application and some say its overemphasis on procedural matters at the project level this level of assessment issue and its potential for trivialization of the acts basic policy purposes seems to be of less concern as greater experience is gained in applying the law since sitespecific project level asse ssments generally serve real purposes in the governments decision making processes ie public accountab ility for agency actions framework for citizen participation in resolving controversies and more systematic approach for generating nvironmental information furthermore numerous but properly scoped impact statements that are prepared efficiently can conceivably minimize on the ground imp acts at the present time given the limitations in the met hodologies for assessing the br oader scope and longerterm environmental effects another recurring question is whet her nepas clear requirement for environmental assessments of agencies legislative proposals is being adequately implemented or enforced under the regula tions new flexible criteria to address environmental concerns at the earliest stages of program initiatives originating in the executive branch while the impact assessm ent and interagency review process hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs56 increasingly been used as an integral framework for structuring some decision making activities ie relating the nepa analysis to project feasibility or federal or state coordination activities the longerterm question is whether these advantages outweigh the procedural uncertainties that would be associated with analyzing environmental impacts of more fundamental policy choices for example in the 1990s the presidents authority to negotiate new in ternational trade agreements without the mo st formal level of nepa compliance was upheld the most basic policy issue regarding the viability of the overall nepa process is in maintaining sufficiently neutral and flexible environmental information assessment and review procedure to acco mmodate actions and decisions of the utmost variety complexity and controvers to which the law applies without the mechanics of the procedures themselves becoming part of the controversy in part this is matter of efficiency of how usefully the process serves public decision making by holding agencies accountable without undue regulatorytype burdens and partly matter of equity so that all reasonable alternatives points of view and parties to decision can over time benefit from inform ed debate

all federal executive branch agencies must comply with omb guidance to ensure imple mentation of egovernment major provisions the egovernment act is organized in five titles containing sections which amend various titles of the united states code title i of the statute denominated office of management and budget electronic government services amends title 44 united states code with new chapter 36 on ma nagement and promotion of electronic government services in addition to defining key terms title i establishes an office of electronic g overnment within omb headed by an administrator who is appointed by the pr esident without senate confirmation the administrator assists the director of omb with all functions assigned in chapter 36 as well as those assigned to the director by title ii of the statute and other electronic government initiatives the administrator is also responsible for assisting the omb director deputy director for manageme nt and administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs in setting strategic direction for implementing electronic government relevant to certain specified statutory authorities title i of the statute also establis hes chief information officers council chaired by the omb deputy director fo r management and composed largely of department and agency chief information fficers the council plays an advisory and coordination role other features of title i are creation of the egovernment fund to support egovernment projects establis hment of governmentwide program to encourage contractor innovation and excelle nce in facilitating the development and enhancement of electronic government rvices and processe s and mandating an annual egovernment stat us report by the omb director to congress title ii of the statute pertaining to federal management and promotion of electronic government serv ices specifies the respons ibilities of agency heads regarding electronic government mandates interoperable implementation of electronic signatures for appropriately secure electronic transactions with government prescribes criteria for maintaining and promoting an integrated federal internet portal

distribution and app lication of geographic information title iii of the statute denominated the federal information security management act of 2002 discussed else where in this compendium amends chapter 35 of title 44 united states code with new subchapter iii on information security it supersedes similar provisions found in subtitle c of title ii of the homeland security act of 2002 116 stat

program and practices title iv authorizes generally unless otherwise specified elsewhere in the act such sums as are necessary to ca rry out titles i and ii for fy2003fy2007 title v of the statute denominated the confidential information protection and statistical efficiency act of 2002 vests the omb director with responsibility for coordinating and overseeing the confidentiality and disclosure policies established by the title subtitle prescribes limitations on the use and disclosure of statistical data or information and sets fines and penalties for viol ations of these limitations subtitle b after identifying the bureau of the census bureau of economic analysis and bureau of labor statistics as designa ted statistical agencies prescribes the responsibilities as well as the business data sharing ground ru and limitations of these agencies discussion building upon the clingercohen act described elsewhere in this compendium the egovernment act serves as the primary legislative vehicle to guide evolving federal information technol ogy management practi ces and to promote initiatives to make government information and services available online in doing so it also represents continuation of fforts to realize greater efficiencies and reduce redundanc ies through improved intergovernmental coordination and by aligning information technology inves tments in

the drive to implement initiatives in timely manner have raised number of implementation issues that may arise during congressional oversight one of these issues involves the recru itment and retention of it managers at both the chief information officer cio and project manager levels as it projects have become more integrated into the function of department or agency the role of cios has evolved as well cios are repor tedly being called upon not only for their technological expertise but so to provide strategic leadership in the areas of policy budget and contract oversight65 the cios relationship with toplevel department decision makers can also be critical to successfully implementing egovernment initiatives this suggests that in selecting departmentlevel cio one needs to consider the strengths and weaknesses of choosing car eer employee who may have deeper contextual understanding of the mission and functions of an organization and recruiting candidate from the private sector who may bring wider range of experiences and perspectives to the position66 similarly the increased size and complexity of it projects has further underscored the need for strong project managers to carry out these initiatives while it is not uncommon for it project management to be just one of several duties assigned to an individual some observers have suggested that it project s with budgets of 5 million or larger should have dedicated fulltime managers the possibility of requiring federal it project managers to obtain some form of profe ssional certification has also been raised67 another issue is information security in series of evaluations published since 1997 the general accounting office gao has repeatedly reported that the largest federal agencies have made only limited progress in addressing computer security vulnerabilities citing information security as governmentwide high risk issue specifically gao has identified six areas of weaknesses lack of senior management attention to information security inad equate accountability for job and program performance related to it security limited security training for general users it professionals and

also represents significant challenge as the federal government implements crossagency initiatives such as the epayroll and govbenefitsgov projects to eliminate redundant systems and fac ilitate onestop service delivery approach to egovernment69 one means being used to address this issue is the development of federal enterprise architecture at the website httpwwwfeapmogov an enterp rise architecture serv as blueprint of the business functions of an organiza tion and the technology used to carry out these functions while this blueprint is still in its early stages federal agencies are being required to justify their it investments based partly on their ability to make strong business case to support each request and based on how closely the project aligns with the federal

to an annual indepe ndent review and requirement that the director of the office of management and budget omb shall report the results of these reviews to congress congress has long been concerned with securing federal information systems this concern has grown as the federal government has increased the amount of information it collects and maintains and as the information systems upon which that information is kept become increas ingly interconnected and vulnerable to unauthorized access both gisra and fisma build upon the computer security act of 1987 pl100235 and the paperw ork reduction act of 1995 pl 10413 the computer security act required agencies to inventory their computer systems and to develop computer security plan s for each the paperwork reduction act authorized

and awareness failure to fully fund and integrate security into capital planning failure to ensure contractors are secure and lack of detec ting reporting and sharing information on vulnerabilities gaos evaluation of the fy2002 results75 was more critical of the progress made for example while omb noted that 11 of 24 agencies had assessed risk for 90 to 100 of their systems gao noted that 8

rams and help with funding decisions other issues relate to the plausibility of achieving the intent of the statute and to its fundamental assumptions and purpos some say that gpra is wasteful paperwork exercise since typically executive and legislative decisions about funding priorities and program continuation are based more on political debate and objectives and less on the kind of

major provisions the clingercohen act contains extens ive procedural technical and policy revisions of federal information t echnology acquisition and procurement management these provisions can be

creation of chief information officers cios in federal agencies to provide advice to heads of agencies on policies to develop mainta in and facilitate in formation systems as well as help evaluate assess and report on these policies 3 creation of simplified clear and understandable process of inform ation technology acqui sition by federal agencies and 4 initiation of two specific pilot programs which authorize federal agencies to enter into competitive contracts with the private sector the provisions creating the cios and tablishing the pilot programs have received much attention the creation of cios in federal agencies was based on perceived need to decentralize federal pr ocurement application and evaluation of information technologies benefit overall g overnment performance and bring expertise to the federal agencies the two pilot programs are intended to reward cost savings and performance the first type of program is the shareinsavings pilot program this program provides acquisition and procurement incentives to the private sector in which federal agency can pay private sector contractors an amount equal to portion of savings the shareinsavings achieved by the government the second pilot program was the solutionsbased contracting pilot program under this program executive branch acquisition of information technology must include criteria that incorporate objectives defined by the federal government as well as streamlined contractor process the privat sector is allowed to provide solutions to effectively achieve agency objectives the law also requires that simple and clear selection factors communication proposals evaluation and system implementation be used by the executive branch httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs90 116 some

following its passage and the departure of its sponsors from congress was relatively limited116 however as congress has become increasingly interested in internet information technology and

qualified cios and regula r turnover of personnel compounded by salary and compensation disparities betw een government and privat sector opportunities have raised concerns about the governments ability to maintain the momentum and continuity of major egovernment and it initiatives117 as it projects have become more integrated into the function of depa rtment or agency the role of cios has evolved as well cios are being ca lled upon not only for their technological expertise but also to provide strategic l eadership in certain areas of policy budget and contract oversight118 the cios relationship with toplevel department decisionmakers can also be critical to successfully implementing egovernment initiatives this suggests that in selecting departmentlevel cio one needs to consider the strengths and weaknesses of choosing car eer employee who may have deeper contextual understanding of the mission and functions of an organization and recruiting candidate from the private sector who may bring wider range of experiences and perspectives to the position119 concerns have also been raised bout organizational and budgetary obstacles possibly hindering cio performance the clingercohen act requires that the cio report directly to the agency head and ve information resource management as primary function however in many cases these requirements have not been met results from gao studies of government ci within the first few years of the enactment of the clingercohen act showed that it was not uncommon for cios to report to the deputy secretary or other agen cy head subordinates rather than directly to the secretary in addition cios fre quently wore several hats within their agencies120 due to the apparent lack of more current studies it is unclear how this

cited in the conference report hrept 107772 was that the legislative authority for the program has never been used and is not likely to be needed similar concerns have been raised regarding the relative lack of use of the shareinsavings pilot program121 in january 2003 report gao observe d that there are few documented examples of sis contracting in the federal government122 one such example is the department of educations office of student financial assistance ofsa which has entered into series of shareinsavi ngs contracts with accenture to modernize its computer systems123 while shareinsavingsprog rams are considered by many to be forwardthinking policies with the potential to reduce spending and improve the quality of services some experts contend that there are number of obstacles to successfully instituting such programs these include being able to determine baseline costs and an agencys willingness to give the contractor more control over the details so the contractor will feel it has chance to achieve the cost savings some observers have asserted that agencies believe congress will reduce their appropriations once the costsavings is ve rified which while saving the federal government money will not provide any direct benefits to them ie reward hence they believe the agencies have limited incentive to actively pursue such contracts to help addre ss some of these issues s ection 210 of the egovernment act signed into law in december 2002 in cludes provisions that temporarily allow an expanded use of shareinsavings contracts the provision also provides incentives for agencies such as the ability to retain portion of the savings realized from the contract however at the time of this writing implementing guidance from omb is still forthcoming and the provision expires in 2005 while the clingercohen act remains in effect and its provisions are still relevant to current agency it management issues the passage of the egovernment act discussed elsewhere in this compendium represents shift in the primary legislative vehicle being used to guide evolving federal in formation technology management practices and to promote initiatives to make government information and services available online in doing so it also represents continuation of efforts to realize greater effi ciencies and reduce redunda ncies through improved intergovernmental

management budget and accounting antideficiency act statutory intent and history the socalled antideficie ncy act 33 stat 1214 and 34 stat 27 31 usc 134142 actually consists of series of provisions and revisions incorporated into appropriations laws over the years relating to matters such as prohibited activities the apportionment system and budgetary re serves these provisions now codified in two locations in title 31 of the united states code continue to play pivotal role in the execution phase of the federal budg et process when the agencies actually spend the funds provided in appropriations laws the origins of the antideficiency act date back to the 19th century the initial portion enacted in 1870 as section 7 of th general appropriations act for fiscal year 1871 16 stat 251 provided that it shall not be lawful for any department of the government to expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriations made by congress for that fiscal year or to involve the go vernment in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations the intent was to prevent expenditures in excess of appropriations section 5 of the 1870 law also addressed the issue of c ongressional controls over budget execution though not the question of preventing ficiencies instead it provided that unexpended balances of ppropriations accounts could onl be applied to payment of expenses or contracts incurred during that year major legislative provisions often referred to as the antideficiency acts of 1905 and 1906 sought to strengthen the prohibitions of the 1870 law by expanding its provisions adding restrictions on vol untary services for the government and imposing criminal penalties for violations most importantly the laws established new administrative process for budget ex ecution this process which remains in use today is termed apportionment and results in the distribution of the budget authority provided in appropriations law to the agencies in installments rather than all at once in order to provide against disproportiona spending rates by agencies the 1905 legislation mandated that ppropriations be so apporti oned by monthly or other allotments as to prevent undue expenditures in one portion of the year that may require deficiency or additi onal appropriations to complete the service of the fiscal year however the fiscal discipline of this provision was weakened by language allowing apportionments to be waived or modified in specific cases by the written order of the head of the executive depar tment or other govern ment establishment having control of the expe nditure 33 stat 12571258 this exemption from apportionments by written order provided broad loophole widely used by department heads the 1906 revision sought to tighten the waiver language by stipula ting that apportionments could not be waived or modifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs94 124 dating to the budget and accounting ac t of 1921 the bureau of the budget was originally located within the department of th treasury the law authorized the president to appoint the director and ssistant director of the bureau however

happening of some ex traordinary emergency or unusual circumstance which could not be anticipated at the time of making such apportionment 34 stat 4849 more over any waiver or modification of apportionment was to be justified in writing and communicated to congress in connection with estimates for any add itional appropriations required on account thereof in 1933 w ith executive order 6166 issued pursuant to the economy act of 1933 48 stat 16 authority for making waiving and modifying apportionments of appropriations was transferred from agency heads to the director of the bureau of the budget bob124 however bob had earlier exerted control by administrative means such as circular directing each agency to estima an indispensable level of funding to carry out its activities followi ng review by the bureau and approval by the president the remainder of the appr opriation or estimated savings was to be designated general reserve so th apportionment process came to have two objectives to prevent deficiencies and to effect savings the continuing growth and complexity of the federal budget strained the existing system of administrative controls over funds eventually another substantial revision of antideficiency act provisions occurred in 1950 64 stat 595 largely based on recommendations in report to congress from the bureau of the budget and the general accounting office gao125 the bobgao report suggested that changi ng conditions during the fiscal year would always require some readjustments but such changes could be expected to result in surpluses as well as deficienci the 1950 amendments incorporated this view and for the first time provided st atutory basis for budgetary reserves the amendments also expanded upon the provisions of earlier regulations by stipulating four justifications for establishing reserv 1 to provide for contingencies and to effect savings whenever savings are made possible by or through 2 changes in requirements 3 greater efficiency of operations or 4 other developments subsequent to the date on which such ppropriation was made available the 1950 amendments further spelled out more detailed instructions for the operations of the apportionment process beyond the establishm ent of reserves and for subdivision of apportionments at the agency levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs95 in the mid1950s congress enacted provision relating to the administration of the apportionment system by the ag encies this 1956 amendment simplified agency systems for subdividing funds by eliminating multiple pockets of funding authority known as allowances so that administrative controls in the apportionment system would consist solely of allotments pl 84863 70 stat 782 the following year provisions relating to the apportionment system were further revised the effect of the changes was to prohibit the request for apportionments or reapportionments necessitating deficien cy or supplemental estimate unless the agency head determined that such action fell within the exceptions expressly set out in the law 71 stat 440 major provisions four main types of prohibitions are c ontained in the antideficiency act as amended 1 making expenditures in excess of the appropriation 2 making expenditures in advance of the appropriation 3 accepting voluntary service for the united states except in cases of emergency and 4 making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or reapportionment or in excess of the amount permitted by agency regulation the limitations on expending and obligating amounts 31

an officer or employee of the united states government or of the district of columbia government from accepting voluntary services for the united states or employing personal services in excess of those authorized by law except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property an entire subchapter 31 usc 15111519 deals with the apportionment system it contains provisions for defin itions and application for apportionment and establishment of reserves for offici als controlling apportionments for the administrative division of apportionmen ts and for authorized apportionments necessitating deficiency or supplemental appropriations the subchapter further provides for exemptions prohibited oblig ations and expenditu res and sanctions entailing

an effort to tigh ten control over executive branch discretion the 1974 legislation served to delete th other developments justification contained in the 1950 amendments hencefor th reserves were to be established solely to provide for contingencies or to effect savings whenever savings are made possible by or through changes in requireme nts or greater effici ency of operations 88 stat 332 under the 1974 law reserves were to be considered as type of deferral or temporary post ponement of spending in c ontrast to rescission or permanent cancellation126 the prohibitions in the antideficiency ac t against spending monies in advance or in excess of appropriati ons sometimes lead to funding gap situations when action on appropriations measures is not comp leted before the start of the new fiscal year and interim continuing resolutions lapse or are th emselves delayed for many years agency officials generally mainta ined operations during periods of expired funding while attempting to cut or post pone all nonesse ntial obligations such action while in technical violation of th antideficiency act prohibition on incurring obligations from congress was usually redr essed by passing

press 1971 p 40b budget and accounting act of 1921 statutory intent and history the budget and accounting act of 1921 42 stat 20 grew out of progressive era views that saw legislatures as inherently corrupt and sought to place more trust and more authority in executive and administrative institutions the most important of several studies made on budgeting was that of president tafts commission on economy and efficiency 19101912 th commissions report however was virtually silent on the role of the legi slature in the executive budget system it recommended and its proposal languished in congress in spite of this it remained on the national agenda strong ly supported by the institute for government research later the brookings institution and s upport for an executive budget was included in presidential platforms by both republicans and democrats129 during world war i the administrative machinery of the federal government was severely taxed giving new impetus to administrative reform in its aftermath in 1919 congress took up the issue of nationa l budget system establishing select committees in both the house and senate to hold hearings and make recommendations the house select committee held 11 days of hearings in september and october 1919 the senate committee held four additional days of hearings in december 1919 and january 1920 legislation embodying these recommendations was passed overwhelmingly in both chambers in 1920 but was vetoed by president wilson who questi oned the constitutionality of provision involving his removal power over the proposed office of comptroller general after the election of warren g harding to the presidency in 1920 the bill was passed with only minor changes in the removal power provision and signed into law as the budget and accounting act of 1921 characterized as probably the greatest landmark of our administrative history except for the constitution itself130 the budget and accounting act established in law the duty of the president to submit each year single consolidated budget proposal for congressional cons ideration the act stands as the foundation of the modern presidency because it made the president the administrative as well as political head of the executive branch it meant that the president alone was responsible for making budget requests so that each department and agency would longer be able to act independently of presidential direction the act also established the bureau of the budget predecessor of the current office of management and budget to provide the pr esident with the resources necessary to produce such proposal and the general accounting office to provide congress with the resources to ensure accountabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs99 131 for

authority of the president as the head of the executive branch there has been fundamental change in this part of the act although there have been numerous modifications and add itions for example the requirement in section 201 that the presidents budget be submitted on the first day of each regular session was amended by the budget and accounting procedures act of 1950 64 stat 2317 to read during the first fifteen days of each regular session this was subsequently amended to on or before the first monday after january 3 of each year or on or before february 5 in 1986 by th balanced budget and

1990 104 stat 1388 likewise the requirements of section 201 concerning contents of the budget submission have been amended on several ccasions most notably by the budget and accounting procedures act of 1950 the gislative reorganization act of 1970 the congressional budget and impoundment c ontrol act of 1974 and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 these are currently

centralization of the budget process in th executive branch it strengthened the authority of the president to determine the methods for preparing budget estimates and the way the budget would be presented to congress the principal goal was to allow for the development of performance type budgets as had been recommended by the commission on organization of the ex ecutive branch of the government the first hoover commission however the gislation probably had greater effect in furthering the development of budgets th at are vehicles for expressing policy priorities and infl uencing the economy the accounting and auditing act also increased centralization in the executive branch by directing that the results of agency accounting systems be integrated with consolidated system within the department of the treasury perhaps more important the act also required agency accounting systems to use standards that served broader ends than simply trackin g expenditures such as providing better information to congress and the president further step was taken in this direction in 1956 with the requirement that agenci maintain their accounts on an accrual basis the most important legacy of th act may have been congressional encouragement that the governments top three financial managers the comptroller general the secretary of the treasury and the director of omb work together in continually improving government accounting systems cooperative steps toward acc ounting reform eventually led to enactment of the federal managers financia l integrity act of 1982

gramm warren rudman and ernest hollings the 1985 balanced budget act was the fi rst of several majo r laws intended to ensure that the deficit is reduced and spe nding is controlled even if congress and the president fail to achieve these goals through the regular legislative process see the entry on the budget enforcement acts of 1990 and 1997 elsewhere in this compendium the act established new pr ocedures involving deficit targets and sequestration to further these purposes under sequestration acrosstheboard spending cuts would be made automatically early in the fiscal year if needed to

strong incentive for congress and the president to reach agreement through the regular process of legislation meeting the established budgetary goals specifically the 1985 balanced budget ac t

over the execution of the laws chadha makes clear is constitutionally impermissible it is clear that congress has consistently viewed the comptroller general as an officer of the legislative branch

resolution process and therefore were made part of the 1974 congressional budget actreconciliation act of 1987 101 stat 1330 made several t echnical changes in the 1985 balanced budget act and the financ ial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 103 stat 183 exem pted certain federa l financial entities from sequestration major provisions deficit targets and sequestration procedures in order to accomplish the goal of balancing the budget the act established series of declining deficit targets referred to in the act as maximum deficit amounts141 the series began with deficit target of 1719 billion for fy1986 which declined after the first year by increments of 36 billion until reaching zero in fy1991 the deficit targets were enforced by new set of procedures referred to as sequestration as orig inally framed sequestration involved the issuance of presidential order to permanently cancel annual appropriations and other budgetary resources except for special funds and tr ust funds for the purpose of achieving required amount of outlay savings in orde r to reduce the deficit any required sequestration reductions would occur toward the beginning of the fiscal year based upon budget estimates made at that time as mentioned above the comptroller general was charge d with responsibility under the act for determining whether seque ster was necessary each year and if so the amount of reductions that would have to be made in individual accounts and programs his findings regarding the estima ted deficit the amount of any required sequester the base levels for accounts from which reduc tions would be made and the reduction amounts to be presented in annual sequestration re ports issued twice each year an interval of less than two months between the issuance of the two reports in late august and early oct ober provided congress and the president an opportunity to enact legislation preventing or min imizing sequester the comptroller general was required to take into consideration sequestration reports issued jointly in august and october by the omb and cbo directors if the comptroller general found quester necessary the president was required to issue sequestration order putting into effect the reductions determined by the comptroller general in his sequest ration report the president did not have discretion under the act to alter the co mptroller general s determinations in any year in which deficit sequester occurred the entire amount of the deficit excess the amount by which the estimated deficit exceeded the applicable deficit target would have to be eliminated sequestration could occur for fy1987fy1990 only if the deficit excess for the year we re greater than 10 billion the 10 billion marginoferror amount did not apply to fy1986 in which seque stration was capped at 117 billion nor to fy1991 when the budg et was required to be balancedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs112 formula set forth in the act mandated that half the requi red outlay reductions be made in defense progra ms programs in the nationa l defense 050 functional category and half in nondefense progra ms in general sequestration reductions were made uniformly across the range of accounts covered by the process and were applied uniformly to programs project s and activities within these accounts many accounts involving roughly twoth irds of federal outlays were exempt from sequestration for certain programs the reductions were made under special rules medicare for example could not be cut more than 2 the act provided that the sequestration procedures would not apply during time of war and set forth means to suspend them in the event of recession finally the act included procedures by which the pr esident could propose or congress could initiate modifications in sequestration order the 1987 balanced budget reaffirma tion act extended the timetable for achieving balanced budget by two fis cal years to fy1993 restored the automatic triggering mechanism for sequestration and made numerous adjustments to the sequestration procedures the deficit targets as revised in 1987 maintained the 36 billion yeartoyear decrease except for fy1989 when the ta rget was reduced by 8 billion from the prior year and fy1993 when the target was reduced by 28 billion from the prior year the 10 billion marginoferror amount was retained for this period except that sequestration reducti ons were capped at 23 billion for fy1988 and 36 billion for fy1989 marginoferror amount was allowed for fy1993 when the budget was expected to be balanced the automatic procedure for triggering sequestration was restored by placing it in the hands of the omb director however the directors authority to estimate and calculate sequestration amount s was carefully circumscri bed by various provisions in the act in particular the procedures for making baseline estimates were delineated in the act the new baselineconstruction rules approximated more closely the concepts used by omb in making current services estimates and by cbo in making baseline budget projections the new rules had the effect of minimizing differences in the estimates and projections of the two agencies compared to earlier years under the restored automatic procedure an initial or final sequestration order would be triggered by an initial or revised sequestration report from the omb director the omb director was required to give due regard in his report to an advisory sequestration report issued earlier by the cbo director the comptroller general was not assigned role in the triggering process the 1987 balanced budget reaffirmation act retained the basic formula for determining sequestration reductions but modified the procedures for crediting reductions in programs covered by special ru such as student loans foster care and specified health programs additionally the act authorized the president to exempt all or some military personnel accounts from sequestra tion provided timelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs113 notice was given to congress this authority previously had been given to the president only for fy1986 with regard to the modification of sequestration order the 1987 balanced budget reaffirmation act established tw new mechanisms involving the enactment of joint resolution under expe dited procedures under the first the president was authorized to submit to congress repo rt proposing changes in the reductions in defense programs so that some programs could be spared cu ts if others were cut more deeply in order to retain the overall vel of required reduc tions second the majority leaders of the house or senate could initiate legislation that would modify sequestration order even effectively cance ling it both mechanisms would require the enactment of legislation in order to be effective other budget process changes in addition to establishing the sequestration procedures the 1985 balanced budget act made other changes in the federal budget process these other chan ges mainly involved modifications of the congressional budget process under the 1974 congressional budget act discussed more fully elsewhere in this compendium first the timetable for congressional budget actions was accelerated most notably the deadline for adoption of the annual budget resolution was advanced one month to april 15 second certain practices used by congress for several years were formally incorporated into the 1974 c ongressional budget act including the expansion of budget resolutions to cover th ree fiscal years and authority to initiate reconciliation procedures in the april budget resolution third enforcement procedures were tightened including ne w restrictions on legislation linked to committee spending allocations under the budg et resolution and requirement that the recommended deficit in the budget reso lution not exceed the applicable deficit target fourth the reconciliation process was modified in several ways including ban against using reconciliation to make changes in the social security program and requirements in the house and senate that amendments to reconciliation measures be deficit neutral in addition to these and many other changes in congressional budgeting made by the act it also required the president to submit an annual budget consistent with the deficit targets placed existing off budget entities on the budget and placed the social security program off budget excep t for calculating the deficit for purposes of sequestration the law which contained the 1987 balan ced budget reaffirmation act 101 stat 754 also included related provisions i n title ii that affected the congressional budget process the impoundment control pro cess and other matters with respect to the congressional budget process the 1974 congressional budget act was amended to clarify the application of time limits for the consideration of conference reports on budget resolutions and reconciliation measures to require the house and senate to use common economic and tec hnical assumptions to extend cbo duties under the state and local government cost estimate act of 1981 indefinitely and for other purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs114 the impoundment control act of 1974 was amended to codify the appeals court decision in city of new haven v united states regarding restrictions on the presidents deferral authority and to prohibit the resub mittal of rescission proposals that had been previously rejected by congress finally the 1987 balanced budget rea ffirmation act encouraged congress to experiment with biennial budgeting and required cbo to prepare report on federal credit programs discussion the 1985 balanced budget act as amende d was critically viewed by some for its failure to achieve its principal objective deficit reduction during the period covering fy1986 through fy1990 the actual defi cit exceeded the deficit target every year the overage ranged from about 5 billion to 205 billion and was greatest in the later years despite the revision of the targets in 1987 further the manner in which the sequestration process operated nd the stringency of the goals generally were perceived as fostering budgetary g immickry and disruption in the legislative process as result of these concerns the sequestration process was

gov manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick 1998e budget enforcement acts of 1990 and 1997 statutory intent and history the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 made numerous and significant changes in the federal budget process by amending several laws primarily the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 described elsewhere in this compendium142 the bea of 1990 also amended the 1974 congressional budget act changes in the 1974 act are discussed in another section of this compendium the chief focus of these changes was to revise fundamentally the sequestration process establis hed by the 1985 act but other important facets of the budget pr ocess were affected as well with respect to sequestration the bea changed the focus from deficit targets to limits on discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual ppropriations process and payasyou go paygo requirement on new legisla tive initiatives aff ecting revenues and direct spending ie spending controlled outside the annual appr opriations process the main purpose of these changes was to ensure that the substantial deficit savings of several measures enacted in 1990 partic ularly the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1990 were maintained ov er the fiveyear time frame of the legislation covering fy1991fy1995 the bea was enacted as title x iii of obra of 1990 104 stat 1388 1630 although the bea was formally developed as part of the 1990 reconciliation law it can be traced to the budget summit ne gotiations between congressional and administration negotiators that began in early may of 1990 and concluded on september 30 of that year on june 26 1990 president george hw bush issued statement that he and congressional ne gotiators concurred that any bipartisan budget agreement should include budget pr ocess reform to assure that any bipartisan agreement is enforceable and that the deficit problem is brought under responsible control the sequestration procedures establishe d under the 1985 act as modified by the bea of 1990 have been further modified nd extended by severa l other laws mainly to preserve budget savings made under ag reements reached by congress and the president in 1993 and 1997 and to establish new program categories for enforcement in 1993 congress and the president extended the procedures for three more fiscal years through fy1998 the extension was included as title xiv of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 107 stat 312 in 1994 sepa rate sequestration procedures for programs funded by th violent crime reduc tion trust fund were added to the 1985 act by title xxxi of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 108 stat 3009 significant modifications to the sequest ration process were made by the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 which was included as title x of one of two reconciliation measures enacted into law th at year the balanced budget act of 1997httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs116 143 for more detailed information on these modifications see crs report rl31155 techniques for preventing budget sequester by robert keith111 stat 251 the bea of 1997 exte nded the discretionary spending li mits and payasyougo requirement through fy2002 modified their pplication and made various housekeeping and t echnical changes in 1998 the discretionary spending limits and associated sequestration procedures were changed again in this instance by the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 in order to establish separate discretionary spending limits for highway and mass transit programs in 2000 the interior appr opriations act for fy2001 pl 106291 established separate discretionary spending limits for conservation spending finally in the last few years under the bea congress and the president modified the enforcement mechanisms in order to avoid sequestration143 in 2000 and 2001 the foreign operations appr opriations act for fy2001 pl 106429 raised the fy2001 discretionary spending limits and the defense appropriations act for fy2002 pl 107117 raised the fy2002 di scretionary spending limits in 1999 2000 2001 and 2002 legislation enacted into law required the omb director to change the balance on the paygo scorecard for certain years to zero in particular in 2002 the paygo scorecard was set at ze ro for fy2003 and each year thereafter through fy2006 thereby preventing an future paygo sequestration due to legislation enacted before october 1 2002 in the absence of any action by congress and the president to extend the discretionary spending limits and the p aygo requirement by the end of fy2002 budget legislation is longer s ubject to these budget mechanisms major provisions revised sequestration procedures the bea of 1990 and later laws changed the sequestration process substa ntially while the bea of 1990 extended the deficit targets in the 1985 balanced budget act through fy1995 although the budget was not expected to be in balance by this time it made them adjustable rather than fixed more importantly the bea of 1990 effectively replaced the deficit targets with two new budget enforcement pr ocedures first adjustable limits were established for separate cat egories of discretionary sp ending second payasyou go paygo procedures were created to re quire that increases in direct spending or decreases in revenues due to legislative action be offset so that there would be net increase in the deficit or reduction of the surplus further the bea of 1990 retained the exemption of social security from cuts under sequestration but removed the trust fund surpluses from the deficit estimates and other cal culations as well the revised deficit targets as initially set by the bea of 1990 were substantially larger than earlier targets because they excluded the surpluses of the social security trust funds and reflected revised economic and technical assumptions for example the deficit target for fy 1991 was set at 327 billion and the deficit target for fy1995 was set at 83 billion th president was required to adjust the deficit targets for fy1991fy1995 to re flect updated economic and technical assumptions and changes in budgetary concepts and definitions as applicable in hishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs117 annual budget for fy1992 and fy 1993 further he was authorized to adjust the deficit targets for fy1994 and fy1995 to reflect updated economic and technical assumptions when he submitted his budget for these fiscal years president clinton chose to use this authority and made such adjustments in the deficit targets the bea kept the procedures for ficit sequester as under the earlier procedures half of the requi red outlays savings would be from defense programs and half from nondefense programs the marg inoferror amount was set at zero for fy1992 and fy1993 and at 15 billion for fy1994 and fy1995 sequestration tied to enforcement of the deficit targets woul d have occurred only if deficit excess had remained after the other two types of questration had been imp lemented however the operation of the other two types of questration together with the adjustability of the deficit targets effectively made deficit quester impossible the bea of 1990 retained sequestration as the means of enforcing the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement like the earlier deficit sequestration procedures the new sequestration procedures were automatic and were triggered by report from the omb direct or for sequestrati on purposes generally only one triggering report was issued each year just after the end of the congressional session howeve r omb reports triggering sequester in one or more categories of discretionary spending might have been issued during the following session if legislative deve lopments so warranted ie the enactment of supplemental appropriations measure that violated the limit for one or more discretionary spending categories th cbo director was required to provide advisory sequestration reports several days before the omb directors reports were due the discretionary spending limits establis hed by the bea of 1990 varied in type over the period covered for fy1991 thr ough fy1993 separate limits were set for new budget authority and outlays for three different categories defense international and domestic fo r fy1994fy1995 the limits on new budget authority and outlays were established for single cat egory total discretionary spending the omnibus budget reconc iliation act of 1993 retained the existing limits for fy1994 and fy1995 without change and added new limits on total discretionary spending for fy1996fy1998 in 1994 the violent crime control act established separate sequestration procedures for spending from the violent crime reduction trust fund through fy2000 the bea of 1997 revised the discretiona ry spending limits again and extended them through fy2002 new categories were established for defense and nondefense spending for fy1998 and fy1999 for fy 2000fy2002 all discre tionary spending was merged into single general purpose category except for the separate violent crime reduction category in effect thr ough fy2000 in 1998 tea21 established separate outlay limits for two new categories highways and mass transit through fy2003 finally in 2000 section 801a of the interior appropriations act for fy2001 established separate discretionary spending limits for fy 2002fy2006 under new category for conservation spe nding and six related subcategories the discretionary spending limits were adjusted periodically when the president submitted his annual budget and when omb issued sequestration reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs118 for various factors including changes in budgetary concepts and definitions emergency requirements nd special allowances factors upon which adjustments were based changed from time to time fo r example the bea of 1990 provided for an adjustment due to changes in inflation but this adjustment was removed by the bea of 1997 sequester under the discretionary spe nding limits would occur only within the category in which breach occurred except that breach of the highway or mass transit limits would trigger sequester in the nondefense or total discretionary spending category as appropriate if sequester under this pr ocess was required at the end of session it was required to ccur on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the paygo procedures during the following session the enactment of legislation causing breach in the spending limits would trigger sequestration after 15 days however any such enactment occurring during the last quarter of the fiscal year ie between july 1 and september 30 would instead cause the appropriate discretionary spending limits for the next fiscal year to be reduced by the amount of the breach under the paygo process created by the bea of 1990 the multiyear budget effects of legislation proposing new dir ect spending or legislation decreasing revenues were recorded on rolling p aygo scorecard after the end of each congressional session any balance on the paygo scorecard for the new fiscal year was required to be eliminated through special sequestration procedure if sequester under this process was required it was required to occur within 15 calendar days after congress adjourned at the end of session and on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits or in earlier years the deficit targets emergency di rect spending and re venue legislation so designated by the president and in statute was not covered by the paygo sequestration process the enforcement procedures for the paygo requirement on the one hand and the discretionary spending limits on the other were separated by firewall savings made on one side of the firewall could not be used to the advantage of programs on the other side for example th cost of taxcut legislation could not be offset by reductions in annual appropr iations acts in order to avoid paygo sequester omb and cbo were each required to prep are annually three different types of sequestration reports as disc ussed below the cbo reports which are advisory only preceded the omb reports by several days as was the case under prior sequestration procedures in all three types of reports omb was required to explain any differences between its estimates and those of cbo if the president was required to issue sequestration order in any year the order was to be issued on the same day that the final omb sequestra tion report was issued and the order was required to implement without change all of the reductions identified in the omb report there was initial order unlike under earlier procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs119 early in the session omb and cbo issued sequestration prev iew reports the reports provided estimates of the discretionary spending limits with the adjustments prescribed by law also the reports provided estimates of any net change in the balances on the paygo scorecard caused by the enactment of direct spending or revenue legislation subject to the p aygo process the omb preview report contained the same information as the cbo preview report and explained any differences between its estimates and those of cbo in august omb and cbo issued sequest ration update reports to reflect the impact of legislation enacted in the interim finally omb and cbo issued final sequestration reports shortly after cong ress adjourned to end the session both reports were required to reflect any per tinent legislation enacted since the update reports were issued the final reports were required to indicate the baseline amount of budgetary resources and the amount nd percentage of the reduction for each account subject to sequestration in preparing its update nd final sequestration reports omb was required to use the economic and technical assumptions that were used in the earlier preview report previously omb could determine in late summer the economic and technical assumptions that it would use for sequestration in october during the course of the session omb was required to pr ovide congress with cost estimates of budgetary legislation within seven days of its enactment so that compliance with the discretionary spe nding limits and paygo requirements could be monitored the cost estimates were required to be based on the ec onomic and technical assumptions used in th presidents most recent budget several other special repor ts were associated with the sequestration process other budget process changes the bea of 1990 and 1997 made other changes in the federal budget process including 1 moving the deadline for submission of the presidents annual budget from the first monda after january 3 to the first monday in february 2 excluding social security trust funds from deficit calculations made under the 1985 balanced b udget act and reaffirming of their off budget status coupled with establishing separate house and nate procedures to protect the trust fund balances 3 enac ting the federal credit reform act of 1990 as new title v in the 1974 congressional budget act and 4 requiring that budget resolutions cover and be enforced for at least five fiscal years additionally the bea included provisions requiring st udies and legislative recommendations regarding governmentsponsored enterprise s revising the senates byrd rule prohibiting extraneous matter in reconcilia tion legislation and incorporating it into the 1974 congressional budget act as sec tion 313 and dealing with various other issues

changed from the largest deficit recorded in history 290 billion in fy1992 to unprecedented surpluses 237 billion in fy 2000 although this dramatic change was due to many factors the procedures under the bea were regarded by many as important contributing factors to this accomplishment during the 106th congress criticisms of the be procedures began to mount while the threat of sequestration was viewed initially as giving the president and congress strong incentive to reach agr eement on their budgetary goals thereby avoiding the legislative deadlock that characterized the early 1980s some members began to regard the bea procedures as an impediment to implementing desired budget policy in an era of large surpluses these members argued that the bea procedures should be eliminated or at leas t substantially modified so that congress and the president could use part of the surplus for tax cuts and other actions that otherwise would have been prohibited further some members asserted that discretionary spending limits for fy2000fy 2002 were unrealistically low thereby promoting the use of budget gimmicks such as the excessive designation of emergency spending to evade their constraints more recently during the 107th congress the procedures under the bea we re set aside to respond to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the 2001 recession subsequently as noted above the bea procedures were llowed to expire on september 30 2002 for the foreseeable future congress faces an unfavorable budget outlook exacerbated by an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment according to omb and cbo current budget projecti ons under existing law without any legislative changes show nnual deficits in the unified budget ie including federal funds and trust funds in each of the next few fiscal years144 when various proposed spending increases and tax cuts are ta ken into account the projections indicate annual deficits for the foreseeable futu re for example omb projects that if president bushs fy2004 budget policy proposals are enacted into law annual unified budget deficits ranging from 178 billion to 307 billion will continue through fy2008 in addition the economy continues to put damper on federal revenues also the spending for the war on terrorism nd homeland security and for military and reconstruction operations in iraq and afghanistan could increase the scarcity of current and future federal government resources such factors potentially could worsen the already unfavorable budget outlook145 accordingly the 108th congress is faced with the issue of whether the ex pired bea procedures should be restoredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs121 new budget constraints should be enact ed or the existing budget procedures associated with the

the basic framework which is used today for congre ssional consideration of budget and fiscal policy the concu rrent resolution on the budget the house and senate budget committees and the congressional budget office are all provided for in this legislation in addition the pr esidents impoundment authority was codified for the first time in title x also known as the impoundment control act the congressional budget act built upon the knowledge gained in earlier attempts to create legislative budget but it chiefly grew out of the combination of several separate m ovements for congressional reform in the 1960s and 1970s and series of confrontations with the presid ent over the budget there were various calls for structural reforms within congress nd concurrently desi re to make congress as whole better able to assert its budget priorities more eff ectively visàvis the presidents the issue of federal spending approach ed crisis in the late 1960s and early 1970s increased spending for programs initiated or expande d under the banner of president lyndon johnsons great society combined with that to support military efforts in vietnam accelerated concern over budget deficits series of spending ceilings were enacted by congress be tween 1967 and 1970 but these proved to be largely ineffective even so president richard nixon kept the controversy over such ceilings alive during the 1972 presidentia l campaign by asking for authority to cut federal spending at his own discretion to stay under proposed 250 billion ceiling in fy1973 congress declined to approve ch an openended grant of authority and while further spending ceilings were enacted the crisis over presidential authority to withhold funds escalated in response to this battle with presid ent nixon congress established joint study committee on budget control in 1973 which recommended legislative process to improve the opportunity for the congress to examine the budget from an overall point of view together with congressional system of deciding priorities these recommendations were reviewed by committees with legislative jurisdiction in the house and senate146 and eventually enacted as the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 88 stat 302 the intent behind the 1974 budget act is still subject for debate the act made number of changes in the way c ongress operated but one thing it did not do was to centralize budget decision making the budget resolution was mechanism for deciding the broad outlines of budget ary decision making but the details about the composition of revenue and spending re mained within the jurisdiction of the same committees that had exercised jurisd iction prior to the act the new budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs123 process built on existing congressional procedures but did not supersede them to some this indicated that the purpose of the budget act was merely to create mechanism for coordinating congressiona l decision making and for providing budgetary information others however feel that the budget act was created to deal with the problem of structural deficits that arose in the 1970s one result was that the budget act has been the focus of num erous reform proposals over the years number of which have been enacted th most extensive changes occurred as consequence of the balanced budget nd emergency deficit control act of 1985 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 d iscussed elsewhere in this compendium major provisions titles i through ix of the budget act are collectively known as the congressional budget act of 1974 and title x is known as the impoundment control act of 1974 title v as ame nded in 1990 is now known as the federal credit reform act of 1990 the most salient aspect of the congressional budget act is that it established congressional budget process as origin ally enacted the budget act provided for two budget resolutions the first to provide pl anning levels and to be adopted by may 15 and sec ond to provide binding levels that is subjecting legislation that breached these totals to points of orde r to be adopted by september 15 this division proved to be impracticable nd for fiscal years 19831986 congress did not adopt second budget reso lution instead the first budget resolution for each of these years included provision that made the spending and revenue totals in the first resolution binding as of the beginning of the fiscal year october 1 in 1985 congress amended the budget act to pr ovide that beginning with fy1987 the spending and revenue totals in single budget resolution to be adopted by april 15 would be immediately binding as enacted the budget act also required that committees report all authorizing legislation prior to may 15 this requi rement tended to create bottleneck of legislation that made it difficult to complete floor action on authorizing measures prior to consideration of appropriation bills nd was eliminated in 1985 currently title iii requires that congress approve concurrent resolution on the budget by april 15 section 300 that mu st be adopted before other budgetary legislation can be considered although the house may

the congressional budget office cbo was ch arged with providing information to congress this basic function has not ch anged but the nature of the information required by congress has expanded over time these duties are further sp ecified in section 308 of the budget act which requires that reports for bills providi ng new spending authority new budget authority new credit authority or changing revenues or tax ex penditures include cost estimate prepared after consultation with the director of the congressional budget office in addition section 403 of the act requires the director of the congressional budget office to the extent practicable to prepare cost estimate for each bill or resolution of public character reported by any committee section 424 added by the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 placed additional responsibilities on cbo by requiring that it prepare and submit an estimate of the direct cost of all federal intergovernmental mandates contained in each bill reported in the h ouse and senate title x the impoundment control act codifies presidential authority to withhold federal funds which have been appropriated th act defines such authority as rescissions and deferrals rescission authority estab lished under the impoundment control act allows the president to propose cancellation of funds and to withhold those funds for 45 day period pending congressional action if congress does not approve the rescission request or takes action th funds must be released at the end of that period section 207 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit r eaffirmation act of 1987 further codified this au thority to allow the president to submit rescission request only once deferral authority allows the presid ent to withhold funds temporarily but deferrals may not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year the impoundment control act originally provided for one house veto of any proposed deferral but this power was negated by the supreme court in ins v chadha 103 sct 715 1983 subsequently the us court of appeals ruled in city of new haven conn v united states 809 f2d 900 dc cir 1987 that the onehouse veto provision was not severable from the presidents ex panded authority in the 1974 law for policy based deferrals language clarifying this narrowed base for deferrals was incorporated into the impoundment control act by the balanced budget and emergency deficit rea ffirmation act of 1987httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs126 148 defined as any revenuelosing provision th at provides federal tax deduction credit exclusion or preference to 100 or fewer be neficiaries and any federal tax provision to provide temporary or permanent transitional relief for 10 or fewer beneficiariesin 1996 congress enacted provisions to gr ant the president enhanced rescission authority known as the line item ve to act of 1996 110 stat 1200 sections 1021 1027 of the impoundment control act 2 usc 621 these provisions inverted the existing relationship between congress nd the president regarding proposals for rescissions rather than requiring c ongressional support for resolution approving the presidents proposal the new law required the enactment of bill or joint resolution of disapproval to prevent pr oposed rescission from becoming effective resolution of disapproval w ould be subject to presidential veto so twothirds vote in each house would be necessary to override and prevent rescission the line item veto act also expanded the scope of rescission authority the act provided that in addition to discretionary spending whenever the president signs bill into law he may cancel any item of new direct spending ie entitlements or certain limited tax benefits148 in 1998 the supreme court struck down the act as unconstitutional clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 it ruled that the item veto act effectively allowed the president to repeal parts of statute in violation of article i of the constitution discussion the congressional budget act has been judged harshly by its critics despite achieving significant measure of success its enactment resulted in greater control of impoundments led to resurgence of c ongresss role in tting budget priorities and increased the attention of congress to the whole budget it has not however resulted in the orderly process that some had hoped for deadlines for adopting budget resolutions and for enacting spending legislation have r outinely been missed the budget committees have sometimes been the source of conflict in part because authority was not significantly redistributed by the act there is also perceived redundancy in debating the outlines of budget priorities on the budget resolution and then later debating the details in authorizations nd appropriations perhaps because of these shortcomings congress has continued to debate the budget process and possible reforms virtually since the budget act was signed into law reform proposals have generally focused on one of two areas 1 spending or deficit control mechanisms as in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and the budget enfor cement act of 1990 and 2 streamlining the decision making process usually by eliminating one gr oup of decision makers from the process or reducing the frequency of decisions as with biennial budgeting selected

from the requirement to prepare an annual audited fi nancial statement in fiscal year under certain circumstances omb discretion is possible when the agency budget does not exceed 25 million and the omb director dete rmines the exercise is unwarranted due to the absence of risks associated with the agencys operations the agencys demonstrated performance or other rele vant factors if omb grants such exemptions the director is to notify the house committee on government reform and the senate committee on governmental affairs annually of the agencies involved and the reasons for each exem

an official from the federal elections commission suggested agency operations and the types of progra ms administered by an agency should be more important than the size of budg et in determining the need for audited financial statements for example an agency with budget less than 25 million that has fiduciary responsibility for trust fund administers grant program or operates revenuegenerating programs may be the type of agency that should prepare audited financial statements 182 as enacted the atda allows the omb director to exempt agencies with budgets under 25 million from the audited stat ements requirement under certain circumstances but the exem ption is not automatic with respect to agencies subject to the new law it is interesting to note that 49 agencies were included as coming under the expanded requirements before any possible omb exemptions in the senate report accompanying s 2644183 month later after the bill was signed into law memorandum from the omb director

progra ms it emerged in the early 1980s and is often seen as the opening to other attempts along this line including the chief financial officers act of 1990 the federal financial ma nagement improvement act of 1996 and the accountability of tax dollars act of 2002193 adoption of fmfia followed the conclusions of number of studies from congressional committees the general accounting office gao inspectors general and the executive agencies themselves that documented significant weaknesses in internal financial and management controls including inadequa and inaccurate accounting systems and financial reports these wea knesses in turn were seen as contributing to wasteful spending poor management ineffective programs fraud and billions of dollars in losses fmfia recognized that strong internal controls and accounting systems would help to ensure the proper use of funds nd resources compliance with statutes and regulations and preparati on of reliable financial re ports for oversight and policymaking the enactment consequently provides for ongoing evaluations of the internal control and accounting systems that protect federal programs against fraud waste abuse and mismanagement fm fia further mandates that the heads of federal agencies report annually to the president and congress on the condition of these systems and on their actions to correct any material

specifically include those designed to ensure the prompt resolution of all audit findings guidelines to meet these requirements fmfia instructed the director of omb in consultation with the comptroller general to establish guidelines that the head of each agency must follow in evalua ting the internal accounting and administrative control system of the agency the omb director however is authorized to change guideline when considered necessary required statements and reports by december 31 of each year beginning in 1983 the head of each ex ecutive agency based on such evaluations prepares statement on whether or not the systems of the agency comply with the criteria cited above if the systems do not comply then the head issues report identifying any material weaknesses in the systems and describing the plans and schedule for correcting the weaknesses sec tion 4 of the act provides that separate report state whether the accounting system of the agency conforms to the principles standards and requirements of the comptroller general the reports and statements are signed by the head of the agency and submitted to the president and congress these products in their

of the same concerns that had prompted enactment of the inspector general act four years before fmfia was boosted at the time by its incorporation as top priority in reform 88 these were the reagan

internal control and accounting systems as well as for reportin g on relevant findings and corrective action these developments paved the way fo r high expectations for ferreting out the root causes of waste fra ud and mismanagement providi ng federal managers with specifics about what is wrong and how to correct it and informing congress and the public about the underlying pr oblems and their remedies fmfia has received mixed reviews over th years initially it was seen as not reaching its high expectations according to some commentators who asserted that the law had been ignored or improperl and too narrowly implemented this occurred critics contended because of an overconcern with the process rather than focus on the objectives of the legisla tion confusion or understanding over the laws terminology and restrictive interpreta tions of some of its provisions fmfias failure to produce the results intended by c ongress in part led to the later passage of other laws

history in march 1967 the presidents commission on budget concepts was created and instructed to make thorough and objective review of budgetary concepts210 in october 1967 the commission produced comprehensive report with detailed recommendations on implementing unified budget in its report the commission stated that the two basic functions of th federal budget are resource allocation and macroeconomic stabilization for resour ce allocation the commission believed that the budget should provide the integrated framework for information and analyses from which the best possible choices can be made in allocating the publics money among competing claims211 this function of res ource allocation should include comparisons among government programs and between the public and private sectors for macroeconomic stabiliza tion the commission maintained that the budget should contain detailed and accurate information in order to evaluate the effects of federal fiscal activities furthermore the budget should include data necessary to undertake discretionary count ercyclical fiscal policy thus the commission recommended unified budget that would include ll federal activities in the fy1969 budget the johnson administration adopted the unified budget concept but with some structural diffe rences from the proposal of the commission from fy1969 until the implementation of credit reform in fy1992 the federal budget recorded federal credit activity on cash flow basis federal credit consists of federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees in given fiscal year the budgetary cost of particular loan prog ram was net cash flow which equaled new loans made plus any administrative expens associated with these loans rarely recognized in the loan accounts less any an fees repayments of principal and payments of interest th federal acceptance of contingent liability when loan guarantee was provided was not included in the federal budget because cash flow occurred some guarantee programs charge f ees to the recipient and these fees were considered offsetting collections federal outlays were necessary to compensate lenders for any federal guaranteed loan faults but these outlays were not shown in the budget until they were actually paid on november 5 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 88 stat 304 was signed into law it added new title title v to the congressional budget act title v is also called the federal credit reform act of 1990 fcra 101 stat 1388 2 usc 621 note beginning with fy1992 october 1 1991 fcra changed the budgetary treatment of federa l direct loans and federal loan guarantees by requiring that the budgetary cost of credit program be the subsidy cost at the time the credit is providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs157 212 the derivation of the discount rate was re vised by the balanced budget act of 1997major provisions the four stated purposes of fcra are to measure more accurately the costs of federal programs place the cost of credit programs on budgetary basis equivalent to other federal spending encourage the delivery of benefits in the form most appropriate to the needs of beneficiaries and improve the allocation of resources among credit programs and other spending section 501 of fcra fcra never uses the word subsidy nevertheless the true budgetary and economic cost of federal credit program is the subsidy value at the time the credit is provided fcra defines the subsidy cost as the estimated longterm cost to the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays section 5025a the discount rate used to calculate subsidy costs in terms of present value is the average interest rate on marketable treasury securities of similar maturity section 5025e212 hence the subsidy cost of program is determined by the amount of credit provide d and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of this credit any government action that changes the estimated present value of an outstanding federal credit prog ram is counted in the budget in the year in which the change occurs as change in the subsidy cost of this program section 5025d for example the federal government could par tially forgive the repayment of principal for low income borrowers from particular credit program which would increase the subsidy cost of the program the director of the office of management and budget omb is responsible for coordinating the estimation of subsidy costs the director may delegate to agencies authority to make estimates of costs section 503a bu t these agencies must use written guidelines from the director which are developed after consultation with the director of the congressional budget offi ce cbo the director of omb and the director of cbo are responsible for developing more accurate historical

interest rate on two year treasury note etc under the prior approach the interest rate of 10year treasury note would have been used as the discount rate this prior method proved to be inferior because

identify those which are susceptible to significant erroneous payments defined as annual erroneous payments in the program exceeding both 25 percent of the prog ram payments and 10 million second agencies shall determine an annual estima ted amount of errone ous payments made in those programs and activities found sceptible to significant errors this calculation is based on st atistical random sample sufficiently large to yield an estimate with 90 percent confidence interv within 5 precision the third step is to determine why the particular programs are at risk and then put in place plan to reduce the erroneous payments the last step in implementation for the agency is reporting to the president via omb nd congress on the estimates of the annual amount of erroneous payments in its programs and activities and on progress in reducing themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs183 251 us congress house committee on government reform subcommittee on government efficiency and financial

simply required agencies to report all programs generating estimated improper payments of more than 10 million because of the 25 percent threshold some programs wasting more than 10 million could slip

cash reserves at the expense of the other passage of the act was preceded by seve n years of joint study by federal and state management officials of how federa lly funded programs were being managed

that each state establish procedures for minimizing the elapsed time between transfer of funds from the united states treasury and state expenditure of these funds for the intende d federal purpose 2

thereby causing the state to lose the interest income it could have earned had it been able to hold on to its own cash the state perceives that the federal governments delay in making the cash payment

congress senate committee on expenditures in the executive departments fees continueds user fee act of 1951 statutory intent and history user fees charges to recipients of goods and services provided

first fees in the contemporary era there are several hundred such charges at the fede ral level amassing nearly 158 billion in revenue in fy2002 alone264 these are authorized under general user fee statute or in most cases agencyspecifi c legislation such fees ar usually defended as serving one or more purposes 1 to help make rvice or good selfsustaining 2 to shift the burden of payment from the general taxpayer to an identifiable beneficiary 3 to enhance revenue for the government and 4 to regulate access to or determine availability of good or service265 congressional action despite the

which was slightly modified in its 1982 codification grants federal agencies the authority to levy charges on identifiable beneficiaries for government provided goods and services the law also establishes criteria to be followed in its implementation prior to this an agency could impose fees only if it had specific statutory authority to do so in the early 1950s several congressional panels advanced user fees on broad scale in 1950 the senate committee on ex penditures in the executive departments endorsed user charges for agencies under its jurisdiction and called for the equitable

the question as to whether or not there should be charges nd fees made by regulatory agencies of the government for many of the services which they render to those who come within their jurisdiction268 the subcommittee emphasized that regulatory agencies such as the interstate commerce commission icc and the federal communications commission fcc must meet the expense of hearings inspections and other activities related to granting franchises construction and other permits and licenses continuing representative yates stated the taxpayers pay every dollar of the charge s and costs that go into that hearing the companies pay nothing other than taxes and i think it is only fair that in exchange for the franchise that the go vernment gives the broadcasting company and the protection which the government affords to such broadcasting company to assure its freedom from interference in the operation of its broadcasting facilities that it should pay some of the costs of the hearings269 the subcommittee agreed and extended the doctrine to all federal agencies not just the ones under its jurisdiction to do th is the panel added an amendment to the appropriations bill that would permit each federal agency to appraise its own operations to see whether or not it would be possible to recapture for the government some of the costs that the government incurs in connection with this regulation through the establishment of schedule of fees270 in addition to this goal representative yates noted that one agency official expressed the viewpoint that such practice would not only be feas ible but would deter and do away with superfluous applications271 executive guidance in 1959 the bureau of the budget predecessor to the office of management and budget omb issued guidelines for implementing the user fee statute272 circular a25 emphasized that such charges should be assessed only for special benef its provided to identifiable r ecipients the circular has been

interpretation federal courts have b een involved in interpreting user fee legislation both the general user fee statute as well as agencyspecific authorizations274 the supreme court has determined that such charges are constitutional when they impose true fee which must meet certain criteria and standards for fairness and equity among other things and when they are an appropriate legislative delega tion of authority to the executive ie levying fee for services rendered rather than imposing tax according to several s upreme court decisions275 user fees are allowable under the 1951 ioaa if they recoup appropriate co sts for goods or services rendered to individual beneficiaries the charges must be based only on the costs of services or goods provided to the individual recipient as opposed to being based on all costs of goods or services that also benefit the general public ioaaauthorized user fees must also meet the standards of fairne ss and equity under the law and must not be arbitrary finally such charges are acceptable if they are consistent with congressional policy and if the agency has not exceeded its authority and has not disregarded the statutes guidelines major provisions purposes current general user fee legislation directs that each service or thing of value provided by an agency shall be selfsustaining to the extent possible by comparison the original 1951 version had provided an elaborate list of goods and services for which charge s could be levied any work service publication document benefit privilege authority use franchise license permit certificate registration or similar th ing of value or utility wh ile the 1982 codification reduced it to the generic concept of each service or thing of value also the original enactment called for such services to be selfsustaining to the full extent possible while the codified version omitted the word full otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs192 purpose such as redirecting costs away from the general taxpayer and to the beneficiary is specified in the legislation eligible agencies the original 1951 enactment when granting user fee authority to federal agencies specifically included wholly owned government corporations as defined in the governme nt corporation cont rol act of 1945 by comparison the 1982 codification struck th is language and instead specifically excluded mixedownership government corpor ations from federal agencies having authority to impose user fees authority the general user fee statute grants powers to both the head of the agency as well as to the president with re gard to executive agencies the head of each eligible agency is authorized to issu regulations establishing the charge for service or thing of value the law adds that regulations issued by the heads of executive agencies are subject to policies pr escribed by the president and shall be as uniform as practicable criteria and standards the law requires user fees to meet certain criteria and standards each charge importantly is to be fair the original language read fair and equitable but equitable was omitted in the codified version as being redundant and otherwise included in fair in addition to this requirement the charges are to be based on the costs to the government with the original version specifying direct and indirect costs the value of the service or thing to the recipient public policy or interest served and other relevant facts with the original version reading pertinent facts disposition of the revenue revenue collected under the general user fee statute is paid into the us treasury as miscellaneous receipts this is in contrast to some agencyspecific user fee statut in which the re venue is deposited in dedicated accounts and earmarked to reim burse the collecting agency for certain expenses and activities effect on other statutes the 1951 general user f ee statute and its codified current version leave intact ot her legislation that either proscribes or prescribes user charges the law insists that nothing contai ned in it repeals or m odifies other statutes prohibiting the collection or fixing of any fee charge or price the enactment also states that the user fee legislation does not affect any law prescribing bases for determining charges but charge may be redetermined under this section consistent with its prescribed

fees that it had commi ssioned in 1987 acus recommended general principles to guide the setting and implementation of user fees276 the general user fee statute however has failed to standardize user fees and most of these charges result from specialized grants of authority to particular agencies several reasons explain this situation one is that the language of the general user fee law is vague and its provisions have been viewed as inconsistent most openended for instance is the allowance that other relevant facts be considered when establishing charge in addition charges that are set to make service selfsustaining may not be fair to the parties who must pay furthermore the requirement to consider public policy or other interests might result in costs that differ from the actual costs of providing good or service regulating or reducing the volume of tr affic at congested national parks if that were public policy goal fo r instance might require higher prices for parking and admission than would otherwise be justified in terms of the actual costs to the government and the value of the service to the recipient other reasons help to explain reluctance to use the acrosstheboard authority and instead rely on specific legislation to establish particular charges for goods or services operating under the general user f ee statute requires an agency to act alone without the immediate support of congress fo r the specific charge this means that the agency incurs the objections directly and solely from adversely affected parties that is the individuals and industries who must pay new or higher price for good or service that they had received previously for free or at lower price this development may result in public criticism of the agencys planned charges intense opposition to them before congress as well as other parts of the executive or in potentially costly court challenges to the fees277httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs194 besides these disincentives to using the general user fee statute agencies lack financial or budgetary incentive to impos fees under the ioaa its revenue is deposited in the general treasur and is not dedicated for use by the agency itself in short the agency would have to do the work eg argue on behalf of charge establish the proper fee amount and collect the revenue but receive direct budget benefit in contrast some agencyspecifi c user fee statutes tablish special accounts in the treasury and earmark the revenue fo r the agencys own use for instance to reimburse it for collection expenses ndor to support certain operations and activities in addition to determining the disposition of the revenue specialized user fee statutes by comparison to the gene ral authority allow congress to control virtually all other aspects of such charges legislation can be used to erect fee structure set the fees themselves identify and charge particular beneficiaries or recipients of service and provide for

the supreme court decided that while congress can dete rmine amtraks governmental status for purposes within congresss control eg whethe r it is subject to general management laws such as the administrative procedure act congress cannot make the final determination of amtraks status as governmental entity for purposes of determining constitutional rights of citizens affected by its actions to do so in the courts view would mean that the government could evade its most solemn constitutional obligations by simply resorting to the corporate form of organization michael lebron v national

states code 286 the authority to reorganize federal agencies has been delegated by congress to the president from time to time since 1932 in 1949 the president submitted to cong ress the reorganization bill that would form the basis of reorganization author ity through 1977 the reorganization act of 1949 provided that the president could sub mit reorganization plan involving any agency this plan would go into effect as law after 60 days unless resolution of disapproval was passed by majority in either house onehouse veto over time congress periodically renewed the presidents reorganization authority although the length of extensions varied and on occasion the authority was allowed to lapse as renewals were sought and debated amendments we re adopted altering the original law for the most part these amendments limited the presidents authority in most instances specific incidents led to the limitations on presidential authority for example after failing to obtain department of housing and urban development through legislation presiden t kennedy employed the reorganization plan process the plan was approved nd the department established congress however found fault with the reorganiza tion authority and when it came up for renewal in 1963 congress let the authority lapse in 1965 when president johnson once more requested the authority cong ress granted it but inserted provision prohibiting the use of the reorganization authority to create new executive departments one of president carters first legisla tive proposals was request that congress renew the presidents authority to submit reorganization plans the reorganization act of 1977 as finally enacted represented procedural compromise the approval process remained the same as in th 1949 reorganization act except that resolution of disapproval subject to certa in expedited procedures was automatically introduced in both chambers this sured congressional upordown vote in addition the president was permitted to amend plan within 30 days after its submission thus allowing for modifications in response to congressional concerns major blow was struck against the reorganization plan procedure in 1983 when the supreme court ruled in ins v chadha that the legislative veto process was unconstitutional287 the court held that exercises of legislative power must fulfill the constitutional requirement of consideration by bot h houses of congress and presentment to the president inasmuch as legislative vetoes frequently provided for consideration by only one house and by definition did not involve the president the mechanism was found to be constitutionally deficient one consequence of the chadha ruling was that congress passed legisl ation in 1984 that had the effect of ratifying reorganization plans previous ly approved pl 98532 98 stat 2705 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs201 288 certain agency heads are statutorily ve sted with the author ity to conduct limited reorganizations within their own organizations for example such authority is vested in the secretary of defense in title 10 section 125 of the united states code 289 pl 100527 102 stat 2635 290 pl 107296 116 stat 2135 291 5 usc 903a2 292 5 usc 905a the stat ute includes several other limitations on what can be achieved by reorganization plan 293 the quotation is taken from the statute which has not been updated to reflect the new century congress approved the reorganizati on act amendments of 1984 which extended the reorganization plan aut hority from november 1984 to december 31 1984 although it was never used and has ex pired this version of reorganization authority remains on the books and mayb found in chapter 9 of title 5 of the united states code the 1984 amendments an effort to address the constitutional issues raised by the chadha decision required that join t rather than concurrent resolution be introduced in both the house and senate upon receipt of reorganization plan another significan t innovation in the 1984 amendments was the requirement that an implementation section be included in the presidents message accompanying the reorganization plan in the absence of presidential reorganization authority reorganizations of federal agencies are accomplished through the regular legislative process288 prominent examples of such reorganizations include the creation of the partment of veterans affairs289 in 1988 and the creation of the partment of home land security in 2002290 major provisions under provisions of the reorganizati on act of 1977 as amended through 1984 the president could submit to congress reorganization plan providing for the transfer in whole or in part of an agency or its functions to another agency except that enforcement or statutory prog ram shall be abolis hed by the plan291 plan could not create new depar tment continue an agen cy or function beyond the period authorized by law or authorize an agency to perform function not expressly provided in law292 once the president submitted reorganization plan congress had 90 days to act upon the following joint resolution that the congress approves the reorganization plan numbered ______ transmitted to the congress by the president on _____ 19___293 the president had to provide an implementation plan meeting the requirements of the law when submitting pl an as joint resolution this vehicle had to be approved by the presid ent to have the force of law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs202 discussion the original rationale for delegating to the president broad authority to propose executive reorganization plans was the widely held view that the president as chief manager of the executive branch ought to have powers to make organizational and management changes without having them subject to socalled political pressures from congress reorganization was viewed in large measure as technical exercise best left to the experts in the executive branch reorganization is now not usually regard ed as merely technical exercise reorganizations may lead to increased organizational efficiency economy and effectiveness but they also often have significant institutional and political consequences from the early 1960s on stions were raised in congressional deliberations as to both the constitutional bases for reorganization authority and processes and the political wisdom of assi gning this broad authority to the white house the successive reorganizati on acts were founded upon the concept of permitting the president to bmit to congress what were in fact laws that would go into effect unless either house prev ented activation by passing motion of disapproval despite modifi cations of the process this legislative veto was increasingly criticized as the years passed the reorganization process began to be questioned in terms of both its utility and its potential for increasing conflict and distrust between the branches congress in successive reorganization acts gave th president authority to circumvent the regular legislative process yet when presidents invoked the authority they opened themselves to the accusation of violating the established system plans were sometimes submitted that proba bly would not have been accepted using the regular legislative process thus increasing tension between the branches after each presidential misuse congress responded by adding restrictions and exemptions gradually circumscribing the power until the reorganization plan process provided in the 1977 act as amended was mere sh adow of the original reorganization act of 1949 with the 1983 chadha decision striking down the legislative veto the utility and desirability of using the reorganization act compared to following the regular legislative process came into question nonetheless the drawbacks of reorga nization authority might be outweighed for some by the perceived difficulty of reforming government organization through the conventional legislative process it could be argued that the need for modernization of the federal bureaucracy warrants the renewal of the presidents reorganization authority w ith

of the office unless the president designated someone else who was occupying position for which he or she had been confirmed by the senate whoever assumed the duties of the position could do so for

specific position or 2 the president makes recess appointment the section specifically nullifies the pr eviously held position of the justice department that the statutor vesting of general agency authority in the head of an agency and allowing this authority to be delegated provides an alternative way to fill vacant advice and consent positions section 3348 vacant office provides that vacant advice and consent position may not be filled temporarily except in conformity with the vacancies reform act and that an action taken by any person who is not acting under the provisions of the act

of the act the vacancies reform act became effective on november 20 1998 and applies to any vacancy occurring after that date the 210 day limitation applies to any office that was vacant on the effective day as if the vacancy had occurred on that date discussion the vacancies reform act was largely in spired by evidence that by early 1998 as many as 25 of the 320 advice and c onsent positions in executive departments were being filled by tempor ary designees most of whom had served beyond the 120 day limitation period of the old act and had not been nominated by the president in addition it was found that this evasion of the senates cons titutional confirmation prerogative was being supported by the department of justice doj the department had devel oped legal construction of the enabling legislation of the 14 departments that effectively superceded the requirements of the old act the attorney general was interpreting gene ral housekeeping provisions found in the enabling

have force or effect and may not be ratified the vacancies reform act also addresses some of the presidents concerns particularly regarding the amount of time taken to fill positions through the

the procedures involving federal contrac ting were based on formal advertising or competitive negotiation after passage of cica competitive procedures became defined as procedures under which an executive agency enters into contract pursuant to full and open competition322 the office of federal procurement policy act states that full and open competition means that all responsible sources ar permitted to submit sealed bids or competitive proposals323 the two most important competitive procedures set forth in cica are sealed bids corresponding to the former compe titive procedure of formal advertising and competitive proposals324 corresponding to the former competitive procedure of negotiation cica also states that comp etitive procedures means procedures under which an executive agency enters into contract pursuant to full and open competition and defines what the term includes325 when selecting competitive procedure the major question concerns whether to use sealed bids or competitive proposal s before cica all contracts over 10000 required formal advertising unless one of the exemptions allowed negotiation and advertising was not feasible and practicable under cica

and history through the early decades of the 20th century federal proc urement law required the government to accept the lowest responsib bid for federal contract work since contracts normally specified the type styl and quality of the construction or goods to be purchased economies we re often achieved through re duced labor costs as firms engaged in competitive bidding the result many policymakers believed was system that undercut the local market to the disadvantage of contractors and workers alike it was argued that the system also disadvantaged the government lowwage workers often lacked firstrate skills and allegedly produced substandard work which resulted in increased cost to the taxp ayer over the long term and it made government at least indirectly party to adverse and often sweatshop working conditions after several tentative proposals during the late 1920s congress adopted the davisbacon act 40 usc 31413148 in 1931 enacted at the urging of the hoover administration in part as an effo rt to bring stability to the construction industry and to cope with the collapsin g national economy the act required that persons employed on federal contract work must be paid not less than the locally prevailing wage for compar able work in the locality of the project in 1935 the scope of the act was broade ned to include both public buildings and public works together with painting and decorating in 1964 congress expanded the concept of prevailing wage to include the value of fringe benefits other than those mandated by law paid to workers employed in comparable work in the locality through the years davisbacon provisions have been added to more than 50 federal program statutes in 1936 following roughly the pattern t by the davisbacon act congress adopted the walshhealey act 41 usc 3545 which set basic standards with respect to goods produced under contract fo r the federal government nearly three decades later in 1965 congress adopted the mcnamaraohara service contract act 41 usc 351358 s imilarly setting basic labor standards for services provided under contract to the federal government th three primary federal contract labor

walshhealey in practice they are the same national rates as those of the flsa discussion of the contract labor standards statutes the davisbacon act has been the most visible and the most controversial so view the act as vital protection for contractors workers and the public alik as important now as when it was originally enacted they assert that the act ensures fairness and equity for workers that it encourages higher standards in c onstruction saving the government money in the long run and that it encourages the tr aining of constructi on industry professionals through recognized apprenticeship programs others argue that the act inflates the cost of public construction that it is diffi cult and cumbersome to enforce and perhaps impossible equitably to enforce and that its complexity works to the disadvantage of small contractors the davisbacon literature appears to be inconclusive with respect to the acts impact concerning the mcnamaraohara act proponents hold that it protects workers from what would otherwise be cycle of wagebenefit reductions as one service provider after another sought government contracts ba sed upon the lowest possible labor costs it also provides stability for industry and for government as consumer it is argued preventing revolvi ng movement of contractors as an award is made first to low bidder and then to still lower bidder each competing upon the basis of ever lower wages and ofte n with nonunion labor conversely critics argue that the market unrestrained would produce less expensive service bill for government the statute is they argue difficult to administer cumbersome and needlessly inflates wages above market vels the walshhealey act perhaps because its standards are largely the same as those of the national flsa has been at least through recent decades less subject to controversy historically each of these statutes was adopted as means of dealing with specific abuses that had arisen in the workplace and in federal procurement there is nothing to suggest some argue that these abuses would not reappear were the statutes substantially modifi ed or repealed conversely others question whether at minimum

management intergovernmental cooperation act statutory intent and history congress approved the intergovernme ntal cooperation act of 1968 ica333 to improve administrative relationships among federal state and local governments particularly with regard to the grantina id system the legislation as enacted was composite of government reform proposal s that had been considered over number of years recommendations from vari ety of organizations including the kestnbaum commission of 1955 the advi sory commission on intergovernmental relations acir334 as well as public interest groups representative of state and local governments were incorpor ated in the legislation proponents argued for the legislation out of concern with the duplication of effort and lack of coordination in the federal domestic assistance system in part because of the rapid expansion of categor ical grantinaid programs in the 1960s335 while few if any spoke against the intent of the legislation some debate occurred over the proposed inclusion of uniform relocation assistance provision in the legislation the language was ultimate ly deleted from th bill and the pr oposed sunset language also ultimately not included336 major provisions as originally enacted the intergovernme ntal cooperation act consisted of six titles title i set out definitions title ii established administrative requirements for grantsinaid and title iii authorized federal agency heads to provide technical assistance to state or local governments title iv required that the president issue program regulations to help state and

state officials to obtain information on the purpos and amount of grants received in the states340 concerning fund transfers and associ ated requirements the act requires that federal officials make funds available to the states in an expedited fashion establishes requirements concerning intere st payments received on deposited federal funds and requires state official s to make reports on the funds341 provisions have been retained from the original statute that authorize federal agency heads to waive statutory requirements concerning signation of single state contact342 and to make

development objectives remain in force344 as do those concerning quadrennial congressional committee review345 discussion intergovernmental relations have undergone considerable change in recent years some of these changes resulted from actions required by the ica for example the authority of federal agency heads to waiv federal requirements concerning single state contact at the request of state officials first appeared in the ica in recent years such waivers have been used in number of policy areas to improve intergovernmental relations as well as the administration of federal grantinaid

mandates reform act pl 1044 109 stat 4871 2 usc 1501 1571 was enacted early in the 104th congress generally unfunded intergovernmental ma ndates include respons ibilities or duties that federal programs standards or requirements impose on governments at other levels without providing for the payment of the costs of carrying out these responsibilities or duties the intent of the mandate legislation was to limit the ability of the federal government to impose costs on state and local gove rnments through unfunded mandates legislation to restrain unfunded ma ndates was proposed regularly from 1984 through 1990 98th101st congresses but none of the proposals received action during the 102nd and 103rd congresses 19911994 incr eased pressure developed as state and local interest groups united in an effort to bring about mandate reform although some of this effort was concentr ated on specific laws considered to impose mandates eg safe drinking water motorcycle helmet

mandate reform gislation was introduced as s 1 and hr 5 on january 4 1995 and the funded mandates refo rm act was signed into law on march 22 1995 major provisions the unfunded mandates reform act has three components revised congressional procedures regarding future mandates new requi rements for federal agency regulatory actions and authorization for study of existing mandates to evaluate their current usefulness the primary objective was to create procedures that would retard and spotlight if not stop congressional au thorization of new unfunded mandates on state and local governments point of order in congress the act amended title iv of the congressional budget and impoundment cont rol act of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 297339 as amended to require the cong ressional budget office cbo to estimate the costs to state local and tribal govern ments and the private sector of the unfunded intergovernmental mandate s established by each reported bill exceeding 58 million in calendar year 2002 the latest year ava ilable the threshold is adjusted for inflation the act requires that the cost information be printe d and available before vote is taken if the information is not available or if the bill does not provide that all mandates it blishes will be funded point of order may be raised against considering the bill for this purpose mandate is consider ed unfunded unless thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs235 bill establishes mechanism to ensure that if in any year funding is not provided the mandate will be reviewed or abolished an affirmative vote by majority of those present is necessary to overri the point of order these requirements do not apply to provi sions that are condition of federal assistance or duty arising from voluntary pa rticipation in federal program except that certain large entitlement programs are subject to the special procedures other provisions exempt from the requirements are provisions affecting constitutional rights of individuals statutory rights that prohibit discrimination accounting and auditing requirements attached to federal assistance and emergency assistance national secu rity and emergency legislation federal agency regulations the second component affects federal agencies the act requires agencies to develop process through which state local and tribal governments and the private sect or can participate in the development of regulations in addition agencies must id entify the federal law that authorizes the regulation estimate the costs and benefits including whether federal assistance is available to pay the costs and describe consultation with state local or tribal officials finally the agencies must blish plans to involve local governments in the development of regulations affecting them as well as pilot programs on local government flexibility study of existing mandates while the first two components of the act address proposed new mandates the third relates to thos that existed before its enactment the act required the dvisory commission on intergovernmental relations acir to study number of things including existing unfunded mandates acir was directed to make recommendations reflecting flexibility in compliance reconciling conflicting mandates termin ating duplicative obsolete or impractical mandates suspending certai n mandates not vital to public health and safety consolidating and simplifying reporting and planning requirement s and establishing common federal defin itions and standards discussion origins the term unfunded federal mandates refers to host of flaws in the operation of the federal syst em perceived by some obser vers from the late 1970s into the 1990s it summarized the concerns of those who asserted that there was excessive federal intrusion in to state and local affairs too much regulation too many direct orders too little respect for the role of state and local governments and too little control by states and localities of their own affairs federal demands on state and local resources were sometimes established as c onditions of federal aid but increasingly took the form of direct re quirements although federal funds were made available to help carry out these directives all of this came at time when federal funds to state and local governments were being cut back httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs236 the unfunded mandates refo rm act represented re sponse to coordinated campaign by state and local officials and th eir supporters who had protested for years against these perceived federal demands at time when federal assistance was diminishing the exact magnitude of the costs to state and local governments of complying with federal mandates is not clear various estimates were made during debate on the legislation ranging from high of 500 billion to low of 89 billion use of congressional procedures to some extent the focus on unfunded mandates diminished af ter the legislation was enacted many of the individual grievances and criticisms that had fueled the mandate issue were separately addr essed by the 104th congress which enacted the unfunded mandates reform act many members of the new majorities had been elected with an agenda paralleling that of the ma ndate opponents cons equently number of issues were addressed directly nd in some cases favorably for example the national highway system designation act of 1995 pl 104 59 109 stat 568634 repealed several items that regularly appeared on mandate reform agendas including the national speed limit the requirement that motorcyclists wear helmets and requirements that crumb rubber be used in highway construction since the pointoforder procedures took effect the record on their usefulness as an antimandate tool c ould be described as mixed on the one hand state and local organizations used the process succe ssfully to promote or secure changes in telecommunications legislation mandates but on the other the new procedures were

governments receiving federal financial assistance it generally requires entitywide audits instead of the previous programbyprogram audits that had been criticized as an inefficient use of audit resources and an ineffective means of assuring accountability for federal funds the single audit act amendments of 1996 110 stat 1391 extended the acts coverage to nonprofit agencies353 the amendments

received rather than expended 100000 or more of federal assistance year entities that r eceived 25000 or more but less than 100000 could choose to have either single audit or the fina ncial and

which include costreimburse ment contracts as well as financial assistance entities subject to the act generally must conduct annual audits although in some cases biennial audits are allowed audits must be c onducted by independent auditors in accord with gene rally accepted government aud iting standards except that performance audits need not be included unl ess authorized by the director of omb prior to the 1996 amendments perform ance audits were expressly excluded auditors must determine whether the financial statements are fairly presented in all material aspects in conformity with ge nerally accepted accounting principles and whether the schedule of expenditures for fede ral awards is fairly presented in all material respects in relation to these statements354 for each major program the act requires auditors to obtain an understanding of internal controls relating to compliance requirements assess control risk and perform tests of controls unless they are deemed ineffective the auditors must also determine whether the entity has complied with provisions of laws regulations and other requirements that have direct and materi effect on the program selection of major pr ograms is based upon riskbased selection criteria developed by the director of omb prior to the 1996 amendments the act defined major programs simply by dollar thresholds the number of programs selected for audit testing using riskbased criteria is generally limited to the number of programs that exceed certain dollar thresholds for the nonfederal entity however auditors must test programs that represent at least 50 of the entitys federal expenditures or whatever lower percentage the director determines the single audit act specifies various responsibilities for the director of omb including 1 designating clearinghouse to receive copies of audit reports identifying recipients that failed to have audits required by the act and undertaking analyses that assist the director 2 developing criteria to determine appropriate charges to federal awards for audit cost s 3 developing implementation guidancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs240 and 4 developing criteria to determine

financial risk not only those with the largest expenditures but also those with illdefined objectives complicated administrative procedures and minimal political review and oversight as is true of any

federal workforce management in the administration of president george w bush have been influenced significantly by the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the world trade cent er and the pentagon

proposal is currently pending in the 108th congress it seems likely that congress will need to reconsider title 5 and the accompanying title 5 code of federal regulations that compiles the

current amendment process that establishes separate chapters in title 5 or other titles of the united states code for individual departments granted separate authority issues that could be considered include which approach would provi for the administration of policies on government organi zation and employees in an efficient understandable coordinated and fair manner which approach would

chapter 51 in part iii subpart d pay and allowances statutory intent and history the current system for classifying and grading most positions in the federal civil service was established under the classi fication act of 1923 42 stat 1488 this statute was the initial systematic attempt to achieve uniform alignment of jobs and salaries among various fede ral departments and agencies the act established the following principles positions covered by the act were to be classified and graded according to their duties and responsibilities the same pay scale was to apply to all positions falling into the same class and grade regardless of agency the different pay scales and the vari ous classes and grades were to be logically associated so that pay was properly related to work and one agency would be responsible for equalizing and coordinating the classification and grading of positions for all agencies the classification act of 1949 63 stat 954 maintained the principles set out in 1923 adding that there should be equal pay for equal work and that the positions be grouped or classified in such way th at the position classifi cation system could be used in all phases of personnel

several years critics point out the problems of managing an enormous system which is both rigid and cumbersome on the other hand if the system is administe red consistently the uniformity of position classification occupational definition and grading provide framework within which staff and positions can transfer from one agency to another the controversy led to the enactment of statutes allowing the department of homeland security department of defense nd internal revenue service to design classification systems outside of chapter 51 potentially ffecting approximately 30 of the federal civilian workforce even before the office of personnel management opm was dramatically downsized in 1994 there was an effort to vest the responsibility for position classification in the agencies among the favorable arguments was that each agency has its own culture and that human resources managers should be allowed to classify and grade positions according to these cultu res the national academy of public administration was proponent of this ph ilosophy soon after the academy issued report to this effect the director of op m held extensive disc ussions with several leading personnel

compendiums usual format for profiling title 5 chapters rather than present each systems statutory intent summary of major provisions and discussion under separate headings this prof ile combines these topics under one heading for each pay system among the pay systems discussed are the pay comparability system the general schedule the senior executive service the executive schedule and the prevailing rate blue collar system systems covered in other titles of the united states code but related to the genera l schedule such as those in the foreign service and veterans hospitals are not

act for fy2004 pl 108136 117 stat 1621 allow the internal revenue service irs department of homeland security dhs and department of defense dod respectively to establish classification and pay systems independent of chapter 53 see the discussions of the 5 usc chapter 95 chapter 97 and chapter 99 provisions respectively in this compendium the dhs and dod systems are currently being designed and it remains to be seen how the pay comparability system and the prevailing rate system will be changed for these agencies pay comparability system 5 usc 53015307 prior to 1962 the system of classification of jobs followed the principle of equal pay for equal work within pay system but there was thod of equating pay for equal work among the various systems pl 87793 76 stat 832 at 841 provided that federal salary schedules be based on equal pay for substantially equal work and on comparability of federal salary rates with those in private industry for the same levels of work while the comparability principle was in pl ace congress continued to legislate the rates of adjustment perpetuating salary lag between federal nd private sector pay the pay comparability act of 1970 84 stat 1946 was considered to be the most important pay legislation s ubsequent to the 1962 statute the act established mechanism under which the bureau of labor statistics conducted survey of private sector salaries and the president his agen t and two advisory groups determined the appropriate rate of adjustment for the ge neral schedule this rate of adjustment went into effect automatically unless congress acted to disapprove it or the president determined that another ra or schedule of implement ation was appropriate the system established under this statute was utilized for almost 20 years by the time it was amended the gap between private and federal white collar salaries had widened to over 30 during the conference on the treasury postal service and general government appr opriations act for fy1991 new pay setting mechanism was crafted the federa l employees pay comparability act fepca 104 stat 1429 currently governs the pay policy for most of the federal civilian workforce fepca continued with some changes the mechanism under which rates are to be adjusted for the general schedule and re lated systems the key difference is that the rate of adjustment is to be equal to onehalf percent less than the rate of changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs306 in the private sector wages and salaries element of the employment cost index for given period of time the second princi pal innovation under fepca was the establishment of system of localitybased payments recognizing that the incomparabilities in salaries ranged from large gap between private and federal salaries in some localities to gap at all in other localities congress determined that there would be an identification of localities and that the rate of adjustment in addition to the annual nati onal general schedule adjus tment would be based on salary surveys conducted within these loca lities the plan was to bring federal salaries across the country to within 5 of the private sector sa laries for comparable occupations in each locality at the end of 10 years because of wide range of circumstan ces the pay setting provisions of fepca have never been fully implemented the mechanisms have been utilized but policymakers in the executive and legislative branches have determined that the rates of adjustment should be reduced the resu lt is that there has not been systematic reduction in the gap between fede ral and private sector salari in tight job market and while the government is downsizing th is gap may not have negative effect on the potential for the government to recru it and retain the personnel needed to reach mission goals on the other hand selectiv ely within certain occupations hiring crisis could result the locality pay provisions in fepca are written in manner which requires that if in any given year localitybased payments were allowed the salary of the individual would fall back to the base rate of the general schedule if congress or the president determined that localitybased payment were not appropriate it is assumed that savedpay provision would be enacted to protect the current payable rates general schedule 5 usc 53315338 these sections provide the

positions such as general counsels and assistant administrat ors in independent agencies generally when congress establishes an agency or realigns agency responsibilities these sections of title 5 will be amended to reflect the change in salary level for specific positions the salary levels are applied to seve ral positions that do not appear on the executive schedule for example several gislative branch agency officials such as the comptroller general and the librarian of congress are paid at rates equal to specified levels of the executive schedule the executive schedule was established under the provisions of the government employees salary reform act of 1964 pl 88426 78 stat 400 previously congress had been setting salari for positions as they were created the statute brought salaries into alignment for the various officers of the executive branch congress continued to legislate salary increases for these positions from 1975 until 1990 salaries were adjusted under the executive cost of living adjustment act of 1975 89 stat 419 salaries for members of congress and judges were also adjusted under the same provisions although the salaries were to be adjusted at the same rate and time as the general schedule congress usually voted to deny the increases under the ethics reform act of 1989 103 stat 1716 as amended there is to be an annual ad justment based on the increase in private sector wages and salaries minus onehalf percent the adjustment cannot be more than 5 and it cannot exceed the rate of adjustment for the base pay of general schedule salaries

administratively possible to maintain consistent and equitabl salary relationships between the federal and private sector skilled labor forces however since 1978 cong ress has limited fede ral bluecollar salaries to maximum adjustment rate equal to the general schedule rate of adjustment thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs308 result is that while federal wages in some areas have kept pace with those in the private sector federal wages in high cost areas have not done so one of the reasons congress found it necessary to place caps on these wages is that many of the supervisors are general sche dule employees allowing bluecollar wages to advance while whitecollar salaries were limited would result in line employees being paid more than supervisory staff most inte rested parties

and the eeoc the first line of defense against federal workplace discriminati on is an internal administr ative process established by each federal agency to receive investigate and adjudicate employee complaints of unlawful discrimination these internal agen cy rules have been much criticized both for perpetuating an inherent conflict of in terest by making the agency the judge of its own actions and for encouraging large numbers of baseless complaints due to lack of substantive standards the csra gave the eeoc exclusive jurisdiction to review agency decisions involving federal employees where only discrimination issues are alleged or appeal rights to mspb exist complicating the relationship between the mpsb and the eeoc is an election of remedies requirement in the csra

congre ss passed the federal employees health benefits act of 1959 pl 86382 73 stat 708 authorizing the federal employees health benefit program fehbp the program went into operation on july 1 1960 the act and its subsequent amendments established eligibility for benefits and election of coverage by participants the types of health benefit plans that may be offered the types of benefits that may

creation of an advisory committee and provisions for studies reports and audits while the law was periodically amended to extend eligibility for coverage to additional employee groups the basic stru cture of fehbp has undergone relatively few changes since the program began ope ration however the health benefits insurance federal contribution act pl 91418 84 stat 869 completely altered the way the government contribution toward employees health plan premiums was determined in an effort to provide automatic indexing of the government contribution to reflect increas in medical price inflation beginning in 1971 the act established the formula for computing the governments premium share as the average premium of the six largest plans subsequently the governments contribution increased from 40 to 50 of the average of the big six plan premiums in 1974 and to 60 in 1975 and th ereafter in 1997 the balanced budget act pl 10533 111 stat 251 replaced the big six formula with formula setting the governments share of premiums at 72 of the weighted average premium of all plans in the program not to exceed 75 of any given plans premium the new formula was effective in 1999 the homeland

for catastrophic health care costs plans must include certain cost containmen t provisions such as offering preferred provider organization ppos networks as component of the ffs plans and hospital

or coverage of chiropractors and the catastrophic cost protections opm interprets the health insurance laws writes regulations and administers fehbp it approves qualified plans for pa rticipation in the program negotiates yearly with plans to determine benefits and premiums for the following year manages premium payments and publishes information concerning plan options discussion fehbp is the largest employersponsored health insurance program in the united states total annual cost of the program in fy2002 was about 227 billion including 112 billion in enrollee and us postal service payments an issue sometimes raised regarding the design of the program is that the plans are not selected through competitive bidding and except for hmos most of the ffs plans in the program today have participated in the program for many years some plans have participated continuously since the start of the program one concern about design of the programs is that enrollees must choose among several plans which may be confusing others say choice helps ensure competition among plans thus keeping premiums down still others say choice has effect on costs either to increase or decrease them in recent years fewer that 3 of enrollees changed plans during the annual open season another concern is that fehbp plans compete for enrollees who are good risks ie those who are less likely to experience health care costs in excess of the plans premium potentially causing some plans to enroll larger proportion of highcost enrollees howeve r opm monitors enrollment trends and seeks to minimize adverse risk selectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs351 selected source reading crs report rl31231 health insurance for federal employees and retirees by carolyn l merck crs report rs20818

employees must complete the more extensive underwriting the federal employee longterm care insu rance program has several objectives the first is to encourage federal workers to consider purchasing longterm care insurance by making them aware of the cost of nursing home and communitybased services and the limited assistance that most families can expect from medicare medicaid and private health insurance second the program is designed to help participants choose coverage th at is suitable for their need s and interests longterm care insurance is complicated product for wh ich it is useful to have an intermediary select an insurance carrier choose reasonable range of policy options and prepare and distribute educational mate rial finally the federal pr ogram is intended to serve as model

the same in subsequent years unless the policyholder later elects to purchase inflation protection however this is not guaranteed opm has authority to prescribe necessary regulations for the program in consultation with the carriers it is to provide periodic coordinated enrollment promotion and education effort s in addition opm is to ensure that applicants are furnished information needed to

other matters discussion longterm insurance can help protect th income and assets of people who need daily assistance due to frailty or chronic dical conditions coverage can also help people gain access to betterqua lity or additional services either in nursing homes or in the community or at home while there has been steady increase in the number of longterm care policies sold over the st decade only small proportion of the generation nearing retirement has obtained c overage one reason is cost typically longterm care insurance is purchased by pe ople in their 50s or 60s when the annual cost is higher than if bought earlier nother reason is complexity longterm care insurance is difficult even for financially astute people to understand in addition some people are concerned that premiums will increase at some point in the future and that they will be forced to drop their policies393 the federal longterm care insurance progra m is designed to avoid some of these problems by offering coverage to all federal employees and their families not just those approaching retirement the program attempts to enroll participants when annual costs are lower there are also cost savings from reduced administrative costs though these might be partially offset by cost increases from different underwriting standards the programs educati onal material and clear information about costs are aimed at helping people ma ke prudent choices bout benefits while there is guarantee that premiums will not be raised in the future opm oversight and the possibility of congressional review may make this less likely than for insurance sold in the private market as of the end of 2003 little over 200000 policies had been obtained through the program selected source reading american academy

bush appointed the presidents commission on federal ethics law reform many of its 27 recommendations including uniformity in ethics regulations in the three branches of government found their way into

officials and employees government work although the provisions applied to all officers and employees in the three branches of government the initial target was members of congress they were criticized because earning honoraria was vi ewed as diverting members attention from official duties and was perceived as way for special interests to gain access to members the automatic annual pay adjustments provided in the act for members of congress and other senior officials in the th ree branches of government were seen as means for members to avoid what was considered to be the painful act of having to vote on their own salaries however congress has denied itself the annual pay adjustments five times since 1993 denials that also placed cap on top executive branch officials

effect because of uncertainty about the law and justi ce department interpretations due to conflicting statutes the ge neral accounting office gao has at times hesitated to find violation of agency activity former comptroller general elmer b staats once explained the reason for this is that ag encies are authorized and in some cases specifically directed to keep the public informed concerning their programs where such authorized activities involve incide ntally reference to legislation pending before congress it is extremely difficu lt to draw dividing line between the permissible and the prohibited403 since section 1913 is crimin statute gao regards its enforcement as the responsibility of the departme nt of justice and the courts therefore gao will not decide whether given action constitu tes violation gao will however determine whether appropriate d funds were used in given instance and refer matters to the justice department in appropriate cases404 because violation of section 1913 constitutes an improper use of appropriated funds such violation could form the basis of gao exception or disallowance however gao can take action unless the justice department or the courts first determine that there has been violation405 although the justice department has ne ver prosecuted anyone for violating section 1913 it has indicated the type of executive activity that would be impermissible memorandum in 1977 stated that campaign to contact large group of citizens by means of form letter prepared and signed by federal official would be improper406 in 1989 the justice departme nt restricted section 1913 to significant expenditure of appropriated funds to solic it pressure on congress and substantial grassr oots lobbying campaign407 judging from the few judicial decisi ons that have been handed down it is apparent that the courts are reluctant to adjudicate in the ar ea of executive lobbyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs381 408 grassley v legal

tort claims act ftca was enacted in 1946409 person who suffered personal injury or property damage as the resu lt of federal employees negligence or misconduct had judicial re medy such persons only remedy was to seek to have private claim bill introdu ced in congress this situation existed because of the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity under which the united states may not be sued without its consen t congress alone has the power to give this consent and by enacting the ftca congress waived sovereign immunity for some tort suits with exceptions it made the united states liable for the torts of its employees committed in the scope of employment just as private employers are liable for the torts of their employees committed in the scope of employment the ftca makes the united states liable for the torts of its employees but not of government contractors in accordance with the law of the state where the employees act or omission occurred thus for example state laws placing caps on noneconomic damages apply in cases br ought under the ftca however the ftca contains exceptions under which the ited states may not be held liable even though private employer could be he ld liable under state law and punitive damages are not permitted under the ftca regardless of state law one of these exceptions is known as the intentional tort exception it prohibits suits arising out of assault battery false imprisonment false arrest malicious prosecution abuse of process libel slander misrepresentation deceit or interference with contract rights in 1974 in res ponse to controversia l noknock raids by federal narcotics agents congress amended the ftca to allow suits against the united states for the first six torts on the lis t of intentional torts just quoted if they are committed by an investigative or law enforcement officer of the united states government in 1950 in feres v united states 340 us 135 the supreme court held that military personnel may not sue under the ftca for injuries sustained incident to service federal civilian employees also may not sue under the ftca for onthejob injuries because they are covered by the federal employees compensation act in 1988 the ftca was amended to make federal employees acting within the scope of their employment immune from suit under state tort law even in cases in which the united states may not be sued either 28 usc 2679b1 the most recent amendments to the ft ca provide that person convicted of felony who is incarcerated may sue the united states for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without prior showing of physical injury pl 104134 806 1996 and that suits may be brought under the ftca to recover damages to property seized under federal fo rfeiture statute if the claimant is not convicted and is entitled to return of the property pl 106185 3 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs383 major provisions united states district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united statesfor inju ry or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongfu l act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment under circumstances where the united states if private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred 28 usc 1346 prior to filing suit under the ftca cl aimant must present his claim to the federal agency out of whose activities the cl aim arises 28 usc 2675 this must be done within two years after the claim accrues 28 usc 2401 if within six months after receiving claim the agency mails denial of the claim to the claimant then the claimant has six months to file suit in federal district court 28 usc 2401 2675 period of limitati ons applies to plaintiff if the agency fails to act within six months after receiving hi s claim suits under the ftca are tried without jury 28 usc 2402 attorneys may not charge more than 20 of settlement agreed to by federal agency or more than 25 of the amount of court judgment or settlement agreed to by the attorney general 28 usc 2678 the united states shall not be liable under the ftca regardless of state law f or interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages 28 usc 2673 the united states may not be held liable under the ftca solely because the statute or regulation under which federa l employee acted was invalid the united states may not be held liable under the ft ca even if federal employee engaged in negligent or wrongful act or omission in the scope of employment if the act or omission involved discretionary functi on which means essentially the exercise of policy judgment the united states may not be held liable under the ftca for claims that arise in foreign country th united states also may not be held liable for claims arising out of among other thin gs the loss miscarriage or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty the fiscal operations of the treasury or the regulation of the monetary system or combatant activities of the military or naval forces or the coast guard during time of war all th exceptions to the ftca noted in this paragraph appear at 28 usc 2680 discussion one aspect of the ftca that has been controversial is the application of the feres doctrine prohibiting military personnel from suing for injuries sustained incident to service to medical malpractice cases one reason for the feres doctrine is to prevent civilian courts from secondguessing military decisions and some have argued that this rationale does not apply in medical malpractice cases as when military doctor is negligent in delivering servicewomans baby the supreme court held however in united states v johnson 481 us 681 1987 that the feres doctrine applies even to suits br ought by military personnel for injuries caused by employees of civilian federal agencies this suggests that the secondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30795crs384 guessing rationale is not crucial more significant may be the potential effects of suits by military personnel on military discipline and the alternative compensation system available to military personnel ne vertheless four di ssenting justices in united states v johnson favored overturning feres altogether as not mandated by congress in the ftca as noted the ftca since 1988 has ma federal employees immune from suits under state law for torts committed within the scope of their employment they may be sued for violating the constitution or for violating federal statute that authorizes suit against an individual this immunity has been extended to various volunteers in federal programs more than fifty statutes including those establishing vista and the peace corps provide that volunteers in programs the statutes establish shall be consid ered federal employees for
