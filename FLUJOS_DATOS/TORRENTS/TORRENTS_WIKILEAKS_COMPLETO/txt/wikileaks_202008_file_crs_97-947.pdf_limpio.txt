controlled by laws other than appropriations acts alt hough the budgetary resources for some direct spending programs may be pr ovided in appropriations actsthe appropriations process and the congressional budget act1 introduction the constitution provides that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appr opriations made by law2 however it does not establish any specific procedures for consid eration of spending legislation instead the house and senate have veloped rules and practices that govern consideration of appropriations and othe r budgetary legislation pursuant to the constitutional authority of each chamber to determine the rules of its proceedings3 it is under this authority that the procedures outlin ed in the congressional budget act of 1974 were established the congressional budget act created the basic framework that is used today for congressional considera tion of budget and fiscal policy the budget act provided for the adoption of concurrent resolution on the budget as mechanism for coordinating congressional budgetary decision making this process supplements other house and senate procedures for considering spending revenue and debt legislation by allowing congress to establish and enforce parameters with which those separate pieces of budget ary legislation must be c onsistent for discretionary spending4 which is provided in ppropriations acts these parameters are enforced in part through procedures contained in title iii of the budget act these procedures consist of 1 timetable for budg etary action 2 requirement that the overall totals agreed to in the budget re solution be allocated in each chamber amonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97947crs2 committees with jurisdiction over spending and 3 points of order to prohibit consideration of measures that would violate these parameters timing of appropriations consideration and the congressional budget act the congressional budget act establishes timetable for the consideration of budgetary legislation this timetable in s ection 300 provides various deadlines the following ones pertain to the appropriations process may 1 5 nnual appropriation b ills may be considered in the house ju n 1 0 house p p ro p riatio n s c om m ittee reports last annual appropriation bill ju n 3 0 house completes action on annual appropriation bills cto b er 1 fiscal ear beg ins all ap p ro p riations actions to be completed these deadlines reflect the pace at wh ich the appropriations process typically occurs because the conventi onal pattern for considerati on of appropriations is for the house to originate the measures the deadlines focus on the house in order to promote timely considera tion and allow sufficient time for senate and conference consideration june 10 and june 30 serve as target da tes and are not enforced by points of order however section 309 does prohi bit consideration of an adjournment resolution of longer than three calendar days during july until the house has approved all regular appropriations bills by prohibiting any extended adjournment period this point of order is clearly intende d to reinforce the target dates indirectly the may 15 date is likewise not formal deadline rather it is an enabling date for house appropriations actions and serves as spur for the completion of congressional action on the budget resoluti on secti on 303a of th budget act prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority prior to agreement on the budget resolution however under an exception provided in section 303b this prohibition does not apply to regular appropriations bills considered in the house after may 15 th ere is similar exception that applies to senate consideration more general timing issues are enforced directly through points of order the intent of section 303a is to prohibit the consideration of legislation that would implement budget priorities til those priorities are estab lished in the form of the budget resolution similarly section 302c prohibits the consideration of appropriations measures by the house or senate until the appropriations committee of that chamber has made the suballoca tions required under section 302b the intent is to prohibit consideration of measures implementing part of discretionary spending priorities until the house or senate has had chance to see how the various parts are expected to fit togetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97947crs3 5the fiscal year was changed to october 1 to september 30 under section 501 of the congressional budget act as it was originally enacted this section was later replaced by provisions of the federal credit reform act of 1990 but is now codified at 31 usc 1102 6amounts provided through the appropriations process for direct spending programs generally are not enforceable at this stage 7budget authority represents the level of new budgetary resources provided in spending legislation whereas outlays represent the projected level of expenditures due to either current or previous actionthe start of the fiscal year is also part of the timetable established in section 300 of the budget act and serves as dead line for completion of appropriations actions5 enforcement of this date is provided not th rough point of order but rather through the threat of government shutdown if there is funding lapse because appropriations measures typi cally provide funding for the period of single fiscal year all appropriations measur must be enacted prior to october 1 or funding must be provided on an interim basis in the form of continuing resolution previously the congressional budget act provided deadline for reporting authorizing legislation this deadline wa s intended to supplement the requirements in house and senate rules that assume the enactment of authorizing legislation prior to the consideration of ppropriations the result how ever was that rather than promote the timely consideration of authorizations the deadline tended to create bottleneck of legislation making it difficu lt to complete floor action on authorizing measures prior to consideration of appropriations bills the deadline was repealed in 1985 as part of the balanced budget and emergency defic it control act of 1985 allocations and enforcement allocations under section 302a one of the features of the process established under the congressional budget act is that the budget resolution is not in tended to implement th details of spending or revenue policy instead it is left to the committees with jurisdiction over various spending and revenue laws to report the legislation necessary for implementation they are expected to report this legisla tion in accordance with the priorities agreed to in the budget resolution the budget re solution establishes sp ending priorities in terms of functional categories rather than in terms of spending for specific agencies or programs the amounts for these func tional categories are not binding but they do provide guide for how spending shoul d be allocated to each committee based on its jurisdictions the amounts are then allocated or crosswalked and become binding and enforceable6 these allocations of new budg et authority ba and outlays o7 are made under section 302a of the budg et act and appear in the conference report on the budget resolution the allo cations to the appropriations committees reflect their jurisdiction over all discreti onary spending programs section 302f1 prohibits the house from considering legislation that would cause committees allocation of budget authority under 302a to be exceeded the senate operates under slightly different limitation sec tion 302f2a prohibits the

gov washington 1997considering legislation that would caus committees allocation of either budget authority or outlays under 302a to be exceeded because section 303a allows for the c onsideration of appropriations bills in the house even when congress has not agreed to budget resolution section 302a5 provides guidelines for making llocations in those cases as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1997 this s ection provides that if budget resolution is not adopted by april 15 an alloca tion for the house appropriations committee shall be submitted that is consistent with the discretionary spending levels in the previous years budget resolution previous ly such allocations in the absence of an agreement on budget resolution were ba sed on the presidents budget submission appropriations and dis cretionary spending limits the allocations made unde r section 302a must be consistent with the discretionary spending limits established in section 251c of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control ac t of 1985 as amended table 18 allocations under 302a may not provide for spending that would exceed the statutory limits on discretionary spending enforcement of these discretionary spending limits occurs on two levels first section 312b of the budget act prohibits the senate from cons idering legislation that would cause any of the spending limits to be exceeded9 the house has equivalent point of order this prohibition however is not necessarily absolute points of order are not selfenf orcing and they may be waived10 therefore the spending limits are also enforced through the sequestration process section 251a of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act provides that any time one of the spendi ng limits is breached the president must order an acrosstheboard cut of all non exempt programs within that categoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97947crs5 11these amounts are to be periodically adjusted in accordance with the parameters established in

total spending the congressional budget act also provides that the total level of spending for fiscal year as provided fo r in budget resolution may be enforced by point of order section 311a in the house and 311b in the senate prohibit the consideration of legislation that w ould cause the total amount of new budget authority or outlays set forth in the budget resolution from being exceeded however this point of order does not apply in the house if the legislation in question does not also cause committees alloca tion under 302a to be exceeded this exception under section 311c known as th fazio exception means that it is necessary for committees to control the level of spending that will result from legislation they report but not require them to offset increases in spending due to factors outside of their direct control such as the economy appropriations bills and suba llocations under section 302b section 302b of the budget act requi res the house and nate appropriations committees to subdivide their allocations of budget authority and outlays under section 302a among their subcommittees th suballocations are to be made as soon as practicable after concurrent reso lution on the budget is agreed to this requirement is reinforced by section 302 c which prohibits the consideration of appropriations measures in the house or senate until the suballocations are made

congressional record daily edition vol 141 1 jan 4 1995 and 2 jan 5 1995 continuation of proceedings of jan 4 1995 p h89reporting single general appropriations bill the process of making suballocations effectively determines the spending level for each of the 13 regular appropriations bills one of the changes made to the congressional budget act by the balanced budget and emergency deficit contro l act of 1985 was to establish the enforceability of suballocations by points of order under section 302f1 in the house and section 302f2b in the sena legislation that would cause the suballocations made under 302 b to be exceeded is prohibited as with total allocations to committee under section 302 the house enforces the level of budget authority while the senate enforces both the levels of budget authority and outlays because the 302b subdivisions are with in the purview of the appropriations committees the committees can and do issu revised subdivisions over the course of appropriations actions to reflect change s in spending priorities effected during floor consideration or in conference each revision then supplants all previous suballocations and becomes enforceable through points of order one way in which making 302b suballo cations enforceable has had an impact has been to reduce the number of floor amendments to appropriations measures because the appropriations committees typica lly report measures that spend at the level of the appropr iate suballocation any amendmen t that would increase spending would be likely to cause that suballocation to be breached and thus subject to point of order12 this rule in combination with other rules of procedure frequently makes it difficult to rearrange spending priorities within an appropriations bill through amendments on the floor separate amendment or amendments to reduce spending would need to be agreed to prior to consideration of one that would increase spending for an agency or program in orde r to offset that increase the spending reduction needed to be agreed to first in order to insure that agreeing to the increase would not cause the 302b suballocati on to be exceeded but because the amendments had to be offere d separately there was certainty as to what spending if any the reduction would be used to offs et in order to alleviate this perceived difficulty the house adopted new provision to rule xxi at the beginning of the 104th congress13 house rule xxi clause 2f provides that it shall be in order to consider bloc amendments proposing only to transfer appropriations among objects in the bill w ithout increasing the levels of budget authority or outlays in the bill when considered bloc pursuant to this paragraph such amendments may amend portions of the bill not yet read forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97947crs7 amendment and shall not be subject to demand for division of the question this provision allows greater latitude in amending appropriations bills in the house while preserving the section 302f point of order as method for enforcing the level of appropriations suballocations
