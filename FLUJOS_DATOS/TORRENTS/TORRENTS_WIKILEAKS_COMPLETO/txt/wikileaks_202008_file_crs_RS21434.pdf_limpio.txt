rl31750 victims rights amendment proposal to amend the united states constitution in the 108th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21434crs2 introduction victims rights amendment to the united states constitution has been introduced in three essentially identica lly worded resolutions in the 108th congress sjres 1 sens kyl and feinstein hj res 10 rep royce and hjres 48 rep chabot the senate judiciary committee s reported the measure without amendment srept 108191 2003 the amendment is likew ise identical to one which the president endorsed during the 107th congress but is substantially di fferent in word if not in spirit from proposals offered as back as the 104th congress consequently the committee hearings and reports on its antecedents help to provide context for the amendment in its current form pro and arguments put forward in support of an amendment include 1 the criminal justice system is badly tilted in favor of criminal defendants and against victims interests and more appropria balance should be restored 2 existing statutory and state constitutional provisions are wildly disparate in their coverage resulting in uneven treatment and harmful confusion throughout the criminal ju stice system 3 the drafters of the constitution did not include victims rights provision because at the time victims enjoyed greater rights to participate in the prosecution of offenders than is now the case and some restoration is in orde r and 4 existing state and federal laws are inadequate and likely to remain inadequate critics argue to the contrary that 1 the criminal justice system is not out of balance misguided interjection of vic tim participation threatens to render the process inaccurate and unfair 2 unless it preempts all existin g state provisions th proposed amendment would simply exchange one patch work of victims rights law for another 3 the extent of victim particip ation in public prosecutions at the time the constitution was ratified has been overstated 4 the proposed amendment is inconsistent with the principles of federalism preemptive and amendment impact the united states constitution is the supreme law of the land when it is said that nothing in victims rights edicts created by statute or state constitution imperils fendants rights under the united states constitution that is correct nothing could but an amendment to the united states constitution stands on different footing it amends the constitution its very purpose is to make constitutional that which would otherwise not have been it may subordinate defendants rights to victims ri ghts or subordinate victims to defendants rights it may subordinate either both or ne ither to prosecutorial discretion it may require any conflicting law or c onstitutional precept state or federal to yield even in the absence of conflict it may preempt the field sweeping away all laws ordinances precedents and decisions compatible and incompatib alike on any matter touching upon the same subject whether it does so or to what extent it does so is matter of interpretation that is what is its intent what does it say what is its purpose what does its history tell us the questions are most vexing when an apparent conflict exists between state and federal law or among the rights and prerogatives of victims defendants and prosecutors the interpretative principles of preemption tri ggered by an apparent conflict between state and federal law are fairly well developed preemption of state law may occur either by express provision by implication or by c onflict between federal and state law and yet despite the variety of these opportunitie s for federal preeminen ce the court hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21434crs3 never assumed lightly that c ongress does intends to supplant state law indeed in cases where federal law is said to bar state ac tion in fields of traditional state regulation the court has worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unle ss that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress conversely by virtue of the supremacy clause wher the subject matter is one which the constitution relegates to the federal domain the vitality of state law is dependent upon the largess of congress and the constitution victims rights amendment to the united states constitution that relegates the area to the federal domain confines state authority to that which the amendment permits or allows congress to permit few advocates have explicitly called for kingofthehill victims rights amendment but the thought s eems imbedded in the complaint that existing law lacks uniformity how else can uni versal symmetry be accomplished but by implementation of single standard that fills in where preexisting law comes up short and shaves off where its generosity exceeds the standard yet the recent history of the amendment indicates that advocates intended to establish minimum rather than uniform standard questions of the amendments impact on the rights afforded the accused may be even more difficult to discern the principles of construction called into play in the case of conflict between victims rights amendment and rights established elsewhere in the constitution are similar to those used to resolve federalstate conflicts intent of the drafters is considered mount but the courts will make every effort to reconcile apparent conflicts between constitutional provisions in the case of unavoidable conflict between provisions of equal dignity the latest in time prevails if there is an unavoidable conflict between ri ght granted by an adopted victims rights amendment and some other portion of th constitution the most recently adopted provision will prevail proposals in the 106th congress came to naught over the issue of defendants versus victims rights victims rights v defendants rights defendants rights and prosecutors prerogatives have been the tw in achilles heels of past vi ctims rights proposals the challenge has been to strike balance between the rights of victims and defendants without impinging on defendants rights or hamstring law enforcement efforts to deny defendants rights trump status without denyin g the defendants their rights or jeopardizing prosecutorial prerogatives victims of crime the amendment creates rights for the victims of violent crime its scope turns on the definition of victim on the definition of violent crime and on the jurisdiction whose proceedings and decisions the amendment governs the amendments authors apparently anticipated application at minimum to individuals or legal entities victimized by crimes of physical force used or threatened against their person or property on its face the amendment would appear to apply with respect to proceedings involving crime federal state territorial or triba l civilian or military but probably not with respect to juvenile proceedings under any of those authorities right to notice notice in the world of victims rights takes three forms notice to the victim 1 of his or her rights 2 of the status of the criminal investigation and prosecution as well as the time place and outco of related judicial proceedings andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21434crs4 3 of the release or escape of the accused or convicted offender notice allows victims to assert their rights facilitate s their participation assures them that justice is being done and affords them the opportunity to take protective measures the amendment does not include right to notification of the amendm ents benefits its pr ovision for notification of release or escape applie s only prior to conviction ie only with respect to the release or escape of the accused it does however entitle victims to reasonable and timely notice of all public proceedings involving the crime right not to be excluded the amendment assures victims of the right not to be excluded from any public proceedings invol ving the crime it is one area where balancing the interests of victim defendant and government may be most challenging the right brings with it auxiliary right to transportation to such proceedings companion that might accompany right to atte nd it applies to only those functions that qualify as official proceedings and it operates only with respect to those proceedings that are public right to be heard the right to be heard is right to participate the amendment describes the proceedings at which it may be invoked with greater particularity although victim impact statemen ts are common sentencing feature victim participation elsewhere varies considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and according to the stage of the process at issue the amendment affords victims the right to be heard at pub lic release plea sentencing reprieve and par don proceedings subject to rule of reason it does not on its face give them the right to be heard in closed proceedings or to be heard on other pre trial motions at trial perhaps on appeal or with respect to related forfeiture or habeas proceedings the history of past more narrowly drawn provisions indicates that the right may embrace all of these and more due consideration for victim safety the amendment identifies three victims interests that adjudicative decision makers must take into consideration victim safety avoiding unreasonable delay and just restitution pursued in timely manner the legislative history to date ma be read to indicate that th drafters understood the right to attach to decisions made by judicial and administrative decision makers in any adversarial setting victims interests mu st be considered but are not necessarily controlling in the case of victim safety the decision whether to release an accused on bail and the conditions to be imposed upon release represent perhaps the obvious example of decisions where victims safety must be considered the right does not attach if the decision to release the offender is simply matter of administrative discretion exercised without the necessity of an dversarial proceeding thus the right only attaches with respect to release of an offender following full service of his or her sentence or on furlough or work release or assignment to halfway house or from civil commitment forum if the jurisdiction provides for release pursuant to an adversarial proceeding the right does not attach for instan ce to release pursuant to pr esidential pardon that features such proceedings the range of proceedings where the right applies may be broader than past proposals envi sioned since those were limited to decisions concerning conditional releasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21434crs5 speedy trial the second of the victims interest s that must be considered by at least some decision makers is consideration of the victims interest in avoiding unreasonable delay some have expressed the concern that this vests victims with the right to be heard on scheduling decisions and consequently the right to notification and appearance at proceedings where such matters are raised the concern may be unfounded in light of the amendments specific references to points of attachment of victims right to notice not to be excluded and to be heard the legislative history suggests that perhaps the standards used to judge the defendants constitutional right to speedy trial govern here as well restitution the third victim interest titled to consideration under some circumstances involves consideration of re stitution claims the amendment is very different from past proposals it does not blish right to restitution in so many words it does not explicitly convey right to have proceedings reopened for failure to accommodate victims right to restitution inst ead for the first time it speaks of just and timely claims to restituti on two concepts which coul d be subject to several interpretations legislative authority section 4 vests congress with the power to enforce the amendment through appropriate legislation although the legislative history suggests broader authority subject to congress pre emptive legislative prerogatives the state legislatures share with congress the authority within their own domains to restrict victims rights in the name of substantial interest in public safety or the administration of criminal justice or in response to compelling necessity enforcement section 4 of the amendmen t empowers congress to enact legislation to facilitate its enforcement section 3 insists that only victims and their representatives may seek to enforce righ ts under the amendment those accused of the crime may not the relief available may not include claim for damages or the right to have completed trials reopened to vindicate victims rights other sections color the relief available by circumscribing th amendments right to notice and to be heard with rule of reason and by allowing fede ral and state executive legislative and judicial branches to restrict victims rights in the face of subs tantial interests in public safety or the administration of criminal justice or when f aced with compelling necessity the history of the amendment raises some question of the extent to which indigent victims would be entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel to assert their rights effective date the amendment goes into effect 180 days after ratification by the states there is some question whether the amendment applies to all proceedings and decisions occurring after the effective date or only to those involving crimes occurring after the effective date
