with wages paid by firms in the private sector congress has linked colas for social security and federal retirement benefits to the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services in order to protect retirement income from losing purchasing power through the effects of inflation in general wage increases reflect both improvements in the productivity of labor and increases in the general level of prices in the economy consequently when measured over long periods of time wages tend to rise faster than prices because colas for retirees do not reflect increases in the productivity of people who are still in the work force colas do not make retirees financially better off colas merely protect retirees from becoming financially worseoff as prices rise over time increases in retirement benefits for retired federal employees were first linked to the cpi by law in 1962 increases in social security benefits have been linked by law to changes in the cpi since 1973 before then congress periodically adjusted social security benefits through legislation congress chose to tie increases in these benefits to the cpi in order to make the process less subject to political influences at yearend 2008 the overall price level as measured by the cpi was 473 higher than it was in 1969 as of january 2009 social security benefits have risen by 626 since 1969 while federal civil service retirement benefits have risen by 496 average wages among all workers in the economy have risen by 643 since 1969 salaries for civilian federal employees have increased by 418 since 1969

whereas colas for retirees are based on increases the general level of prices in the national economy the objective of federal pay policy is to keep pay in the federal government competitive with pay in the private sector increases in pay for federal civil service workers therefore are indexed to increases in the wages and salaries of privatesector employees over time wage increases reflect increases in the nations output of goods and services as well as price increases because wage increases in the private sector reflect growth in the productivity of labor wages tend to increase faster than prices when measured over long periods of time social security benefits and federal retirement annuities are indexed to increases in the cpi which measures changes in the price of market basket

from losing purchasing power through the effects of price inflat ion colas ensure that retirees income will purchase the same amount of goods and services after years of retirement that it purchased at the start of retirement colas do not reflect increases in the productivity of people who are still in the work force and thus they do not increase the real purchasing power of retirement income colas do not make retirees better off financia lly they merely protect them from becoming financially worseoff over time as prices rise 1 the incometested programs of supplemental security income ssi

the percentage increase in federal pay and retirement benefits for each year since 1969 and an index relative to the base year the index shows the cumulative increase in pay or benefits compounded annually with base of 1000 in 1969 for example congress increased social security benefits by 150 in 1970 making benefits 1150 of what they were in 1969 another social security benefit increase of 100 was granted in 1971 making benefits 1265 of what they had been in 1969 115 x 110 1265 federal civilian retirees received 56 increase in their annuities in 1970 raising those benefits to 1056 of the 1969 level the next increase in federal civilian retirement benefits was 45 adjustment in 1971 bringing the average federal pension to 1104 of its 1969 amount 1056 x 1045 1104 the bottom row of the index column shows how much federal pay and retirement benefits have grown since 1969 for example with the cola that was paid in social security checks issued in january 2009 these benefits had increased to 726 of their 1969 level an increase of 626 2 this means that benefit initially paid in 1969 would be 726 times as large in 2009 if it were still being paid this year benefit increases can be compared across programs by looking at the index column for any given year for example as of 1985 federal civilian pay had increased by 134 over what it had been in 1969 and congressional pay had increased by 77 in comparison average wages and salaries for all workers in the us economy in 1985 were 185 greater than they had been in 1969 the column displaying the cpi shows that by 1985 the price level had increased by 190 since 1969 g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g146g151g144g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g156g561

service retirement benefits are adjusted to offset the effect of inflation in the cost of living as measured by price index3 costofliving adjustments enable retirees to maintain the purchasing power of their retireme nt income automatic adjustments to offset erosion in the value of retirement benefits caused by inflation were first applied to civil service retirement benefits by pl 87783 enacted in 1962 in 1972 pl 92336 provided for automatic inflationrelated increases in social security benefits4 benefit increases in social security preceding 1975 were not automatic colas linked to inflation but were special adjustments legislated by congress for example congress granted the 1970 1971 and 1972 social security 2 an index of 726 means that the number is 726 of the base which is an increase of 626 just as 200 is 200 of 100 and represents an increase of 100 from base of 100 3 the two retirement systems for federal civil service work ers use different adjustment systems the civil service retirement system csrs which applies to workers first hired into federal service before 1984 provides full cola for all retirees and survivors the federal employees retirement system fers covers workers hired on or after january 1 1984 and others who voluntarily switched from csrs to fers in order to constrain retirement costs congress placed restrictions on colas to fers retirees fers provides colas to retirees under age 62 only if they are disabled or are survivor annuitants fers retirees age 62 or over receive full cola only if the cpi increases by 20 or less fers retirees receive 20 cola if the cpi increase is between 20 and 30 if the cpi increases by 30 or more the fers cola is 1 percentage point less than the cpi 4 this law was amended in 1973 by pl 9366 and pl 93233 before the 1972 law went into effect httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94971g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g142g142g156g497g561g18g138g162g561 g138g151g141g561g18

the number of elderly americans living in poverty these increase s were intended not just to offset inflation in those years but to raise the real level of benefits the 80 social security increase effective in june 1975 was the first automatic inflationrelated cola the large increases in social security benefits that congress provided periodically before the program was indexed to inflation have had substantial effect on the cumulative index for social security shown in table 1 because the table uses 1969 as the base year for the index this may create somewhat misleading impression if social security benefit increases are compared with the civil service retirement program which was indexed to inflation in the early 1960s for example if 1975 were used as the base year for the index instead of 1969 the cumulative social security increase through january 2009 would be 299 this is almost the same as the 284 cumulative increase in civil service retirement benefits during that period 5 the benefit adjustments in these programs are made by computing the average monthly cpi for the third quarter of the current calendar year july august and september and comparing it with the cpi for the third quarter of the previous year for example the 58 social security cola paid in january 2009 represents the increase in the average monthly cpi for july august and september of 2008 over the average monthly cp i for july august and september of 2007 the benefit increases are first included in checks issued in the month of january and take place automatically unless legislation is enacted to change them in fy1986 the grammrudman hollings act canceled civil service retiree colas in 1994 1995 and 1996 pl 10366 the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1993 delayed civil service

post1969 uniform nationwide pay raises and locality pay increases applicable to the governments overall pay scales for workers in gs positions from gs1 step 1 through the highest grade of gs15 step 10 as noted above the government increases the federal gs pay scale periodically usually once year to be competitive with wages and salaries paid by other employers the pay increases in table 1 do not portray the total pay increases that any individual or group of individuals might have received as federal employees move through their careers they receive pay raises when they are granted withingrade step increase or when they receive promotion to higher pay grade both step increases and promotions to higher grades are merit increases that are based on an individuals performance in his or her job if worker were to receive all withingrade step increases at the first point of eligibility without being promoted to higher pay grade it would take 18 years to move from step 1 of pay grade to step 10 the pay increases between steps range from 25 to 33 thus although table 1 indicates that gs pay scales increased by 258 between 1975 and 2009 the pay in 2009 of an indivi dual who had been continuously employed in federal gs job between 1975 and 2009 would have risen by more than 258 due to the combined effects of increases in the overall pay scales withingrade step increases and promotions to higher grades some workers receive step increases but few promotions others 7 pay raises for members of the senior executive service are not prescribed by law they are established by the president through an executive order thus they may be the same as or different from other civil service pay raises

promotions and spend many years at high pay grades thus it is not possible to characterize in general terms how the actual pay of longterm federal workers increases over time consequently table 1 should not be construed as characterizing the salary history of typical federal employee g18g138g162g561g143g152g155g561g15g142g150g139g142g155g156g561g152g143g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 the procedures for raising the pay of civilian federal employees were applied to members of congress and other highlevel federal officials by pl 9482 enacted on august 9 1975 in the government ethics reform act of 1989 pl 101194 congress approved different pay increases for the house and the senate for 1990 and 1991 subsequent legislation passed by congress once again made senators pay equal to that of representatives effective in august 1991 pl 101194 also established new procedure for setting members pay pay increases for members and top level federal officials are now based on two paysetting systems one annual and one quadrennial beginning in 1991 members annual pay raises were based on changes in the eci reduced by 05 percentage point and capped at 50 in addition approximately every four years special commission is to review members pay in comparison with that of private sector executives and recommend adjustments that they deem appropriate on several occasions congress has voted to cancel the pay raises it was authorized to receive under pl 101194 congress declined the pay raises that it otherwise would have received in 1994 1995 1996 1997 1999 and 2007 8 the annual pay increase for members of congress is computed by comparing the eci for the fourth quarter of the previous calendar year with the eci in the fourth quarter of the year before that thus there is 12month lag between the measuring period and implementation of the pay raise based on the 33 increase in the eci from december 2006 to december 2007 members received pay increase of 28 in january 2009

annual increases in wages and salaries earned by all workers in the united states as reported by the social security administration board of trustees like the data on civil service pay this column does not reflect the pay raises an individual worker might receive from year to year because as workers gain skills and experience they usually receive both pay raises and promotions the data in table 1 reflect average wage growth for the entire workforce which is influenced by the retirement of older higherpaid workers and the entrance of younger lowerpaid workers it also reflects shifts in the structure of wages caused by declining employment in certain sectors of the economy and increasing employment in other sectors because of the combined effects of pay raises and promotions typical worker with permanent attachment to the labor force would have experienced wage growth greater than that shown in table 1 8 for more information see crs report 971011 salaries of members of congress

final column of table 1 shows the annual percentage change in consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index for urban wage earners cpiw the cpi represents the average change nationwide in typical market basket of goods and services purchased by consumers the cpi is constructed from several component indexes the goods and services that consumers purchase are classified into 211 strata of items and the urban areas in the united states are divided into 38 areas each with its own index thus there are 8018 211 times 38 basic cpi components into which expenditures are classified the items included in the index change as new products or brands are introduced and old products are modified improved or dropped using the price level of 1969 as the base for the index the cpi had risen to 5727 by 2008 meaning that consumer prices had risen by 472 over 39year period this represents an average annual increase in consumer prices of 46 over the period from 1969 to 2008 over the same period wages and salaries rose at an average annual rate of 53 or 07 faster than prices the 2008 index for social security benefits was higher than the price index 686 compared to 573 but this largely reflects the ad hoc increases granted by congress in the early 1970s between 1975 and 2008 the social security index rose by 277 and the cpiw rose by 290 9 federal civilian retirement benefits grew at nearly the same rate as consumer prices from 1969 to 2008 with the only differences accounted for by the lagtime between price measurement and the implementation date of the colas for these benefits increases in pay for civilian federal employees grew more slowly than cons umer prices over the period shown in table 1 standing at an index value of 498 in 2008 compared to cpi of 573 9 social security and civil service retirement are indexed to the consumer price index for urban wage earners cpi w httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94971
