reasonable and nondiscriminatory access to and the use of public basic telecommunications networks and services basic telecommunications was one of several issue areas upon which only partial agreemen t was reached in time for the final act further negotiations were to be completed by april 30 1996 while some progress was made it was deemed insufficient by some c ountry participants but promising enough to justify extending the negotiations the agreement was reached february 15 1997 and went into effect february 5 1998 sixty nine countries orig inally endorsed the agreement since then the number of member governme nts with scheduled telecommunications commitments has risen to 86 member governments started new round of wto negotiations in 2000 but th proposals from these negotiations were tabled members began ne w negotiations in 2002 the statutory and institutional arena also has seen widespread trend for countries to liberalize andor at least partly privatize their telecommunications markets number of countries have complete d or begun process of converting statecontrolled organizations to privately owned marketo riented firms through private investment liberalization has incl uded allowing more than one s upplier of particular type or category of product or service andor within particular geographic areas technological economic and structural developments the above described factors have interacted with or have been at least partly driven by technological economic and structural changes in telecomm unications and in rela ted industries for example digital technologies make it possibl to distribute voice data and video on the same communications channel and thus to transmit more information per cable and portion of spectrum wireless transmissi on improvements and hi gher productivity in installing undersea fiberoptic cable have lowered the cost per circuit such developments enable telecommunications pr oviders such as telephone nd cable television companies to expand their capabilities to become generi c multifaceted information providers and compete in many markets once considered to be monopolistic inte rnational call back and refile services enable telephone callers from highcos t countries to effectively originate calls from lowercost countries and be billed at the lower ra tes this has tended to hold down international rate s the technological advan ces moreover are very rapidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20319crs3 structurally telecommunications has become globalized and increasingly linked across international borders many telecommunications firms are joining forces through mergers acquisitions equity shar ing marketing arrangements and other combinations to position themselves better for future market growth by offering range of services and increasingly functiona lly integrated international service this globalized merger and acqui sition trend has involved number of telecommunications firms of different countries and c ontinues to do so at rapid pace both major cause and major conseque nce of the above developments has been rapid growth in world telecommunications services including international trade in such services data compiled by the international telecommunication union itu show that world revenue from telecommuni cation services of all type s more than doubled between 1990 and 2000 and expected to increase 21 between 2000 and 2002 see table 1 revenue in 2000 from mobile service was over 23 times its 1990 level 2000 revenue from

socalled va lue added services in which suppliers enhance the form content or retrievability of customers information were not formally covered by the negotiations however few participants chose to include these services in their offers enha nced services include online data processing data base storage and retrieval and electr onic data interchange4 three basic elements the agreement which will be enforceable internationally through the wtos procedures for dispute resolution andor thr ough individual country actions as specified by the agreement has three basic elements first the agreement provides for companies of signatory count ry access to the telecommunications markets local long distance and international of other signatory countries companies may have market access through any means of ne twork technology by installing and using their own facilities through purchase andor resale of existing network capacity and through interconnections because countries agreed to cover basic telecommunication services provided over network infrastructur and through resale over private leased circuits market access commitments will c over services provided through the establishment of foreign firms or commercial presence this includes the ability to own and operate independent telecommunications ne twork infrastructure second the agreement provides that comp anies of one country can acquire andor hold significant ownership or control of lecommunications services andor facilities in other participating countries this is partly implied in market access commitments that permit the establishment of foreign firms and the ownership and operation of telecommunications ne twork infrastructure third participants agreed to establish framework of fair competition comprised of set of regulatory principles in reference paper based upon the us telecommunications act of 1996 the regulato ry principles define and prohibit anti competitive practices such as discrimination and nontransparen cy especially with respect to interconnections licensing criteria and unive rsal service each country is required to have an independent and impartial regulatory body overarching aspects in general the results of the basic telecom agreement are extended to all wto members on nondiscriminatory basis through the mostfavored nation mfn principle5 however at the end of the negotiations many participants exercised their right to file mfn exemptions for certain telecom services6 general descriptions of the elements of the basic telecommunications agreement mask the wide differences in

that the gap between emerging nations and developed nations in total telephone penetration dropped by more than half between 1991 and 2001 however while the growth rate in least developed countries ldcs telephone networks has been accelerating the gap in telephone penetration between developed count ries and ldcs increased between 1991 and 2001agreement and in the scopes of such co mmitments some countri albeit minority made commitments whatsoever with respect to some individual aspects of the agreement details of individual country commitments can be found at the internet web sites of the wto and of the office of the us trade representative httpwwwwtoorg and httpwwwustrgov respectively implementation translation of the agreement into actual increased openness of telecom markets and lower rates for services faces variety of hurdles one is the difficult institutional and legal transition to competitive environment by many countries that now have single supplier of teleco m services and inde pendent regulatory body called for in the wto agreements regulatory principles two other hurdles are the large amounts of capital relative to domestic resources that some countries will require to put modern telecommunications infrastru ctures in place and b the corresponding technical assistance and support that some count ries will require it may well be number of years before the agreements terms are fully implemented and the goals realized congressional oversight as rule trade agreements have not needed congressional action unless cong ress mandated they be approve d in legislation or they required changes in us law legislation approving or implementing the agreement is necessary in those cases congress acknowledged that the united states would participate in extended telecommunicati ons negotiations in the uruguay round implementing legislation where it set forth the us negotia ting objective for these talks congress did not expressly require that any resulting agreement be legislatively approved however and most observers believe that the basic lecommunications services agreement does not require implementing legislation the agr eement has entered into force essentially without objection as an executive agreement some members of congress initially were apprehensive about foreign investment in us telecommunications particularly re garding broadcasting the agreement does not cover broadcasting however and congressional concern seem s to have eased in this respect and others impact the wto basic telecommunications services agreement is expected to increase world trade in tel ecommunications services and facilitate econo mic growth in general freer trade should result in imp roved products and services lower prices additional investment and better allocation of productive resources in the world economy inasmuch as the countries committing to full competition by 2005 accounted for 89 of world telecommuni cation service revenues in 1995 itu data liberalization is to be applied to ve ry broad base of activity data suggest that the potential benefits of telecommunications trade liberalization may be greater in relative terms for em erging economies than for developed ones7 however the us telecommunications indus try and us economy with one of the mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20319crs6 8 see the world bank group

absolute terms this country accounted for 28 of world lecommunications services revenues in 1995 the highly competitive us telecommunicati ons services industry should be able to greatly increase its presence in other countri telecommunications markets similarly the competitive us telecommunications quipment manufacturers should be able to boost sales considerably with the expected gr owth in world telecommunications services increased competition resulting from telecom trade liberalization is driving down settlement rates charged by fo reign telephone carriers to co mplete intern ational calls lowering the prices of such calls to consumers and businesses foreign settlement rates have tended to be much higher than us rates and many more calls originate in the united states than abroad accounting for mu ch of the us trade deficit in telecom services during the 1990s table 2 probabl indicative of the abovenoted effects of greater competition revenue fro m international telephone service increased 13 between 1995 and 2002 while total interna tional tele phone traffic nutes rose 114 table 1 table 2 shows that the us trade defic it in telecom services decreased steadily between 1996 nd 2000 nd that in 2001 the united states had surplus of 498 million services trade has been one of the fastest growing components in total world trade in recent years and the us telecomm unications services industry appears to have benefitted from this trend tw possible reasons for the incr ease in services trade are recent technological progress in telecommuni cations and information technology and worldwide trends in trade liberalization and regulatory reform8 table 2 us trade in services millions of dollars yeartelecommunications services total private services exports imports
