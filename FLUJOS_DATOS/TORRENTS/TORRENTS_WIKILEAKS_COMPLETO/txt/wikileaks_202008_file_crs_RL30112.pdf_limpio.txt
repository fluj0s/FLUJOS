economic system is an objective of us foreign policy facilitated by the foreign aid program funded under the new independent states nis account of the foreign operations appropriations since 1992 an timated 23 b illion has been obligated to assist this transition the history of the aid program has been characterized by declining amount of resources multiple objectives implementation problems and mixed results some programs have had little positive impact and others have been affirmatively appraised by many observers most assistance activities have exposed many russians to previously inaccessible us ideas and information in 1997 and 1998 there were veral important developm ents in russia the 89 regions of russia became increasingly d ecentralized and adopted reforms at their own pace small and micro businesse s grew rapidly and nongovernment organizations also grew and began to ta ke on greater advocacy roles in response the state departments s coordinator introduced the partnership for freedom pff and the regional investment initiative rii the former stressed support for grassroots partnerships between us and russian business and ngos while the latter selected three regions for focused us assistance to improve the business and investment environment in 1999 congress may consider several issues first what is the impact of the august 1998 financial crisis on the aid program and how might the program change to meet new demands second what ar the lessons of the pff and the rii experiences that may be continued or app lied more widely in the russia aid program third what legislative conditions on assi stance might affect continuation of the transition aid program the august crisis has caused the state department to reexamine the program more funds are being targeted on helpin g nongovernmental organizations survive this difficult period the pff and rii were both active in novgorod and this experience suggests number of lessons pplicable to the whole russia program these include that assistance should be desi gned to meet local needs and to focus on reformers to create models of success that aid for economic growth and civil society complement each other that exposing russians to the united states is positive force for reform and that change at the federal level is necessary to make reform work at the local level it should also be noted that some legislative conditions on assistance for instance that russia s hould end the sale of nuclear reactor technology to iran would cut or rminate the aid program in any formhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112contents introduction 1 background 2 availability of resources 2 multiple objectives and targets 3 d i f f i c u l t i m p l m n t t i n 3 m i x d r s u l t s 5

introduction the economic and political future of russia priority concern of us policymakers since its emergence from the ashes of the former soviet union at the end of 1991 has been placed in sharp relief as result of the august 1998 financial crisis currently threatening its national stability the belief remains widespread among experts and politicians that the doption in some form by russia of democratic political system and free ma rket economic system would be the best possible outcome for the united states and the world community to that end the united states has supported an array of programs under th new independent states nis account of the annual foreign ope rations foreign ai d appropriations providing financial and technical ssistance an estimated 23 billion worth obligated for russia programs to date the current crisis suggests to some that this1 work has been unsuccessful and to others that there is much more work to do from the beginning the united states g overnment recognized that the resources it was willing to provide on bilateral ba sis alone would be unequal to the task when the 1992 freedom support act legisla tion which authorizes the bilateral aid program was first announced the bush administration presented it in the context of larger multilateral effort the division of labor has remained the same since the united states as with other bilaterals provides mostly grant technical and humanitarian assistance like other bilate ral donors it also issues commercial export credits and guarantees through the exportimport bank the overseas private investment corporation nd the department of agriculture to serve the dual purpose of supporting us jobs and russian economic development the international financia l institutions led by the inte rnational monetary fund imf provide largerscale financial aid to encourage significant structural and fiscal economic policy reform 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs2 previous analyses of the aid pr

this report based partly on extensive interviews conducted in russia in 1998 looks at the status of the aid program and discusses issues relevant to ongoing congressional discussions on th consequences of the financial crisis and the efficacy of the assistance program background significant changes in the us aid program during the past two years can best be understood in terms of its prior evolution key aspects of the programs history3 might be characterized in broad terms as follows availability of resources responding to arguments that the russi program was underfunded in its first two years the clinton administration proposed significant boost in funding for fy1994 competing for the sa pool of funds as other nis countries and subject to congressional disapproval of its govern ments behavior ru ssias allocation then declined in fy1998 with the administration arguing strongly for an increase congress approved sufficient regional am ounts to make modest russia increases possible nevertheless since fy1996 each year russia has received less than the administration requested 53 of the fy1996 request 55 of the fy1997 request and 53 of the fy1998 request in fy1999 however 77 of the fy1999 request for russia programs was met the fy2000 administration request would4 maintain the transition program at roughly current levels5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs3 looking at all us programs in russia the funding priority given democracy and free6 market reform has diminished greatly relative to security issues in the period fy92 to fy98 transition objectives represented 35 of all us activ ities in russia in fy98 they account for only 20 and are projected at even less in following yearsthe large fy1994 pool of funds spent out over several years is now depleted and the number of indivi dual activities conducte d has been reduced substantially in the past two years usaid has phased out or closed 40 projects as result many argue the amount of assistance provided to support transition programs in russia remains insufficient for country of such signal importance to the united states how much is enough is question annually faced by members of congress who must weigh competing foreign polic requirements against domestic budget constraints 6 multiple objectives and targets although there is general agreement among policymakers that the chief overarching purposes of the nis account pr ogram are to facilita democracy and free market economy the program has been highly atomistic supporting numerous objectives from health to energy effici ency to nuclear nonproliferation the freedom support act specifically authorizes activ ities in some 13 broad sectors further legislation and c ongressional report language has supported or earmarked dozens of projects in diverse sectors nd both the bush and clinton administrations have introduced projects that meet shortterm political ends sometimes as showpieces or just to get something on the ground further the program has sought to ffect vast nation of 148 million people at the federal regional and local levels in government as well as grassroots non governmental sectors although budget cuts have focused the program to some extent in recent years with health and environment more prominent agriculture cut etc it remains diffuse in add ition pressures to expa nd programs continue to exert themselves table 2 provides an indication of the breadth of sectors covered under the nis account program most of the usaid pr ograms listed were composed of numerous projects implemented by hundreds of contr actors and grantees today the usaid private sector project with vastly redu ced resources from few years ago consists of over 30 subactivities run by more than two dozen organizations difficult implementation the assistance program has been an ex periment with long odds and obstacles constraining successful accomplishments initially government aid implementors had little understanding of russia only few contractors had experience in the country and one had proven formula for ccessful transitions from communism many pilot demonstrations never led to or merited follow up activities there were few connections between projects and little sharing of information and lessons learned among implementing c ontractors and grantees there was considerable squabbling among the more th an 18 us government agencies involvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs4 in the program aid was supposed to f ollow reform but while waiting

and regulatory environment in which the private sector functions see for example janine wedel the rvard boys do russia how the best and the8 brightest helped destroy the russian economy the nation

n and paul siegelbaum privatization and corruption in transition economies journal of international affairs vol 5 2 1997and usaid the chief us government implementing agency in particular it is worth noting that diverse efforts have been made including the designation of coordinators in several re gions to bring the various programs together for information exchange and collaborative activity the duplication of many different exchange programs has been somewhat ame liorated by housing most in usia inter agency disagreements seem to be resolved with less rancor due in part to the nis coordinator the decline in funding lthough too precipitous for some may have had the effect of weeding out unsuccessf ul and poorly designed programs although the initial lack of experience in russia has partly been addressed by time the russification of the program has also aided implementati on this has involved the widespread hiring of russian professional staff by usaid and usaid funded contractors and grantees in add ition there are increasing numbers of russian indigenous organizations that have the cap acity to manage us funded programs in ways that meet us standards of account ability and openness for example in 1995 corps of russian professionals who wo rked on urban institutemanaged housing policy projects left to create their own in stitute for urban ec onomics which is now expected to become prime contractor for usaid mixed results the multiplicity of goals difficulties in implementing them and shortage of resources have affected the results of th assistance program amidst scattershot and multisector approach the programs impact was significant in some areas and marginal in others it was instrumental in encouraging change but also came up against barriers to change in russia itself in judging program results many observers caution that such programs at best can only hope to influence the course of change that is primarily domesticdriven there are many examples to illustrate possible successes and failures of the assistance program but such characterizations are subjective and prone to critical interpretation for example privatiza tion of the state controlled economy was one area of reportedly substantial us influence the united states provided extensive technical advice equipment and other help to the russian privatization center that organized the privatization of more than 15000 medium to large stateowned enterprises from 1992 to 1996 howeve r number of observers have cr iticized the7 way in which the russian government chose to privatize using voucher system that ultimately may have allowed national assets to pass into the hands of few oligarches8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs6 the usrussia investment fund tusrif one of many enterprise funds set up in central europe and the former soviet union since 1990 is another example of project suggesting both positive and nega tive features like the other funds tusrif private sector entity whose operational and working capital comes from the us government provides loans quity capital and technical assistance to businesses of all sizes it emerged in 1995 from the ruins of two earlier regional russia enterprise funds that had been plagued by manageme nt difficulties and poor investments tusrif itself has d its own management problems and high operational costs it was slow in fulfilling its original primary mission of making equity investments mission some argued made irrelevant because of the more than 60 private sector equity funds in russia with which it competed prior to the august 1998 financial crisis in add ition the us government originally promised tusrif 440 million high proportion of the total aid program preventing other perhaps more worthy programs from receivi ng funds on the positive side however tusrif has with the encouragement of usaid shifted its emphasis from making equity investments to lending capital to small businesses and helping pioneer home mortgage and auto lending in russia more affirmatively appraised progra m is the eurasia foundation which helps grassroots organizations and individua ls build democratic and free market institutions the foundation whose russia activities received 135 million in fy1997 conducts competitive small grants program in which an average of 17000 is provided to help recipients conduct specific activities these activities encompass the purchase of textbooks by an education business training ins titute the conduct of seminars on legal issues for news paper representatives voter education project support for small business newspa per to expand its coverage to include business legislation and help to set up website on russian agriculture that includes current crop prices for the benefit of cal farmers in ddition several other programs funded separately target sp ecific geographic region andor sector crime and corruption ngos nongovernme ntal organizations in the novgorod region nd small agriculture loans in the saratov region from its washington office eurasia runs partnership program through which us institutions provide expertise harvard university for example helped the moscow city administration develop mortgage law and procedur women law and development international washington based ngo conducted year l ong training program for russian lawyers who defe nd womens legal rights in addition to facilitating specific proj ects one of the foundations main aims is to build local institutions through the grantmaking process it works to show organizations how to achieve their goals meet financial reporting requirements and assess their own progress even for thos who dont receive grants efforts are made to explain how they could improve their chances of receiving future awards as result the foundation almost entirely staffe d by russians is very much in touch with grassroots activities throughout the country its support of innovative activ ities generates much goodwill toward the united st ates further it provides grants too small for usaid to manage cost effectively itself and it leverages 2 from private donors and grant recipients for every 1 from usaid review of the entire assistance pr ogram would show numerous discrete examples of assistance like those of the eurasia foundation that many would arguehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs7 these projects were implemented by irex the center for citizens initiatives and the9 usrussia enterprise fund respectively help to generate private sector activity nd facilitate the growth of civil society these include an association of women providing business training and support in staraye russia business incubator in st petersburg where clients can learn the ropes of fashion design find startup wo rk space and lease necessary equipment and loan to help start up one of the count rys first car wash businesses in moscow9 while these activities may not have an impact wider than few dozen families they may be building blocks of something much larger some question the value of these activities in meeting us foreign policy goals they argue that only activities that help change government policies or introduce new institutions have widespread systemic effect others however suggest that even small activities have the potential to be disseminated throughout the country if they are successful and as one usaid fficial has suggested the cumulative impact of facilitating the growth of hundreds of businesses and ngos may be to create demand for change at the grassroots leve l that cannot be ignored by the top at the very least it can be said that most assistance activities even the failures provided exposure to new ways of thinking for people long isolated from information and ideas behind the iron cu rtain they have exposed government decision makers to how things are done th roughout the advanced industrial countries in energy health and economic policy farmers to coops and credit unions and bankers to consumer lending practices they have also connected hundreds of ngos to each other through the internet and seminars trained hundreds of print and television journalists and introduced t housands of young people to free market concepts through junior achievement trends in russias transition and us initiatives 19971998 russias economic political and social life has experienced dramatic change since the countrys rebirth six years ago while the us aid program has sought to influence the course of these developments several recent important trends in russia have stimulated significant changes in the content of us assistance trends in russia importance of the regions there may be tendency to see russia as monolith but it is set of 89 regional governments like us states each region is quite different from the next some with great natural resources human resources or prime geographical locations regions have become increasingly decentralized both as an intentional result of the nati onal reform process and unintentionally where the central government has been stymied by lack of reform regional governments are adopting free market and democratic reforms at varying pace regions have been given new taxation pow ers and some have been allowed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs8 experiment with land sales that are still re stricted under federal legislation these trends have all accelerated after the augu st 1998 crisis price regulation has been introduced in 87 of the 89 regions some re gions refuse to contribute taxes to the federal budget and some have suspended federal law development of small and micro business the development of small and micro business is important to russias longterm economic growth as well as for the emergence of politically stab ilizing middle class both grew exponentially after the collapse of the soviet union one can say how many microenterprises exist but small business is estimated to have leveled off at about one million in recent years compared to 23 million in the united states while there is considerable visual and anecdotal evidence of new small bus inesses fashion design car washes bakeries fast food restaurants many barriers have prevented business from reaching its full potential these include onerous taxes payoffs of mafia for protection license requirements it is said that russians need more than 50 signatures to open business lack of access to credit lack of accounting and other business skills and lack of support from government growth of ngos since 1991 there has been an explosion in the numbers of nongovernmental organizations ngos to more than 150000 legally registered an estimated 65000 of which are civi coriented they represent mostly the interests of business veterans environm entalists the disabled and women most are quite weak and poorly organized with small memberships and little financing number however are growing stronger taking on advocacy roles adopting fundraising techniques and dealing dir ectly with government while most local governments view them with suspicion some such as petersburg and novgorod are bringing them into the process of governance by lis tening to their concerns prior to making law novgorod has begun to open the pr ovision of its social services to ngo contractors us initiatives over the years the us aid program has contributed to the development of regional and local government small nd micro business and ngos while the highest proportion of aid spending went to policy reform in the central government in the early years funds have shifted in creasingly away from moscow by fy1998 more than 72 of usaid funds went to areas outside moscow efforts were made to introduce land reform health

growth activities such as loan programs business training investment funds busin essoriented exchanges and anticrime activities it also stresses linkages to support civil society including support for ngos professional exchanges and coope rative linkages between us and russian community organizations such as hospital pa rtnerships and charitable organizations the proportion of usaid assistance

announced in february 1997 by the gorechernomyrdin commission the regi onal investment initiative is more narrowly focused than the pff under th rii three regions novgorod samara and the far east were selected to recei ve special infusion of funds for programs designed to improve their private investment climate the initiative was designed to address individually the concerns of target regions while emphasizing programs in wh ich the united states has comparative advantage the novgorod rii for exam ple includes support for the development of land registration availability of cred it for small and micr obusiness consulting services for small business and the estab lishment of an agency to promote novgorod to foreign investors the russian far east rii provides among other things an investment and finance advisor to khabar ovsk training to government financial managers and grants to help establish pr ivate business associations and to assist environmentally focused economic projects in samara the rii includes provision of seed grants and business training to help emerging high technology enterprises training to assist business in adopting international accounting

and how might the assistance program change to meet new demands until the financial crisis of august 1998 there appeared in russia to be semblance of economic stability and movement toward greater

january 26 1999 p 1311environment to many observers th primakov governments proposed plan of action to overcome the cris is appears inadequate the first us response to the crisis is described by offici als as humanitarian one the offer of 885 million in food grants and loans this assistance is coming from the department of agriculture pr ogram budget not the nis account and is partly motivated by us domestic farm price stabilization objectives to the extent that it goes directly to vulnerable gr oups within russia it may do some good however some believe that it may cause harm to transiti on objectives if sale of food products provides profits to co rrupt government officials or prevents private farmers from getting good price for their domestic goods us agriculture officials insist that the program will be carefully monitored to avoid corruption or misuse of food aid the first food shipments arrived in midmarch 1999 the nis assistance program which is designed to deal with specific identifiable problems in the transition process may have to change its strategy to deal with new problems emerging from the crisis in an october 2 speech secretary of state albright said that the united states was reexamining the program and retargeting money where it can be used effectiv ely to support econo mic and democratic reform 10 the crisis has seriously affected the efficacy of some existing programs and damaged us efforts to promote change in certain spheres of activity for instance in the current environment it appears likely that the russian federal government is serious about the kinds of policy reform currently promoted by the aid program or that efforts to attract foreign investors under the rii are likely to be productive as result the nis coordinator is planning on reducing further policy reform assistance on tax reform and securities markets and is downplaying the investment aspect of the regional investment initiative the crisis has had other immediate impacts the freezing of bank funds prevented ngos and independent media from drawing on accounts established with donor f unds reportedly forcing some reductions in ngo staff and programs advertising revenue for inde pendent tv radio and newspa pers long targets of us support has also declined by as much as 80 percent according to one source in response usaid grantees have sought new banking arrangements for supplying funds to ngos the national press institute nd internews which implement the independent media projects are focusing on helping the media survive the crisis by directing training at cutting budgets and maintaining services in this difficult economic environment ne w program is being designed by usaid that will funnel funds to the best stations in order to help them survive in the short term on january 25 1999 secretary of stat albright announced 10 million increase in assistance to russias independent media the us contribution to an international effort implemented by the soros open society institute11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs11 reportedly some sectors nd programs have not been affected as much as might be expected the hardest hit banks were those in moscow mediumsized banks in the regions are still functioning and continue to make loans using us government funds mortgage lending at the regional vel continues to be developed and demand for training in this activity has reporte dly gone up dramatically since august 1998 whether small and micro businesses remain viable and can repay their loans in difficult economic environment remains to be seen but russians have often demonstrated their ability to adapt to such situations and an expanded market for locally produced goods might stimulate new business growth demand for such loans reportedly remains strong and usaid intends to seek alternatives to commercial banks for microlending alt hough the equity investment efforts of tusrif may be restricted now by lessened opportunities of finding solid investments some argue that these fforts may be eased by the absence of competition from us and other foreign private sector funds that have departed the country as result of the crisis number of alterations to the existing aid program appear likely as noted the nis coordinator expects to accelerate the decline of assistance to the federal government wh ile accelerating increases in the proportion of aid going to the regions however c onsideration is being given by state and usaid to provide technical assistance in the area of bank restructuring and regulation the sector that directly triggered the crisis and may become focus of serious attention by the russian govern ment support is also being given to alternative russian think tanks that can in the long run provide economic analysis to the government more assistance will be given in the form of exchanges both academic and professional i ndependent media bringing the internet to libraries civil society activities like those of eura sia foundation and small business credit and training under consideration are responses to th humanitarian and social impact of the economic crisis including programs targeting tuberculosis assistance in pharmaceutical supplies and orphans usaid is also planning on providing technical assistance to local governments to formulate systems that will help them direct their limited resources provision of basic services such as heating transport and school supplies to the neediest familie s following model of means testing developed earlier that has helped municipalities dete rmine who receives housing subsidies these changes most of which were pr esaged by the pff in 1997 suggest the administration is taking longer term view of the russian transition and us objectives the current crisis is viewed by most in the us government as step backward in long process of bringing about transition to free market economy but many observers paint dire picture of events in russia making the us aid program in approach and magnit ude appear feeble response httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs12 see blair ruble and nancy popson the westernization of russian province the12 case of novgorod in postsoviet geography and economics p 433446 vol 39 8 1998what are the lessons of the part nership for freedom and regional investment initiative the aid strategies embodied by the pa rtnership for freedom and the regional investment initiative have been employed for more than year and it may now be possible for congress to address their usef ulness in meeting us transition objectives in russia already the nis coordinator has begun to reevalua and refine these approaches in light of current experience the pff the broader of the two initiatives now represents the dominant approach to us assistance in russia it is response to the failure of the russian central government to act on reforms and to trends in congress limiting amounts of aid and aid to the government specifically by emphasizing grassroots and peopleto people assistance it may have modest impact on key objectives if one purpose of the pff is to estab lish longterm relationships between the people of the united states and russia then these are the types of programs most likely to accomplish that end they create concrete linkages and are more visible to russian and american publics than policy reform efforts they are often less expensive than programs requiring provisi on of expert technical advisers from the banking tax and investment sectors under many of these programs little seed money is provided to local organizations volunteer experts give business advice and relationships are created that may late r be extended at government cost the drawback of pff activities is their likely small shortrun systemic impact were it possible however to blanket the country with these activities their effect might be more dramatic number of ex perts report that the demand in russia for such grassroots activities far outweighs the ability of the current aid program to fund them the rii on the other hand significantly increases its potential impact by focusing numerous activities on single regions it has risked faltering following the financial crisis because its original i nvestmentfocus objective is too dependent on circumstances outside the control of the united states and perhaps more than the pff depends on the success of policy reforms at the national level in recent months the nis coordinator appears to ve favored broadening the riis narrow focus to include civil society activities while emphasizing its regional aspect and continuing efforts to create an environment favorable at least to indigenous business although its middle i may in effect have been removed the term rii apparently is still operative strong evidence of the potential effectiveness of the pff and rii approaches can be found in novgor od which served both as pff pilot and the first of the three riis novgorod is considered by many observe rs to be success story it has pro reform reputation as place that has us ed us assistance well political and12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs13 the westernization of russian province the case of novgorod p43813economic conditions throughout the country and in each rii region are quite different but as implemented to date number of lessons can be learned from the novgorod experience that might be app lied throughout the assistance program in russia designing assistance to meet local needs too often assistance programs have been adopted with cookie cutter approach if it worked in poland it must work in russia the rii and pilot p ff models in novgorod by contrast were characterized by flexibility and designed to meet local needs in novgorod and other riis local government officials were cons ulted at the beginning asked what their needs were and provided services that met both their and us interests the positive thing about the rii is that it is flexible works closely with local government and uses coordinator to respond to needs as they change further most novgorod officials and private citizens who directly benefitted from us programs repeatedly expressed satisfaction that th us programs particularly the exchanges were well tailored to meet their specific needs focusing assistance on reformers to create models of success us strategy implemented unevenly since the beginning of the aid program has been that assistance focused on reformers would create models of success that would then be replicated elsewhere this strategy has worked in novgorod where reformers predating the pff and rii emerged in both the city and oblast governments their agenda was strengthened by us programs and the programs themselves were made more effective by the support they receive d from the local governments the success of novgorod as center of change and investment in 1997 it was ranked the top region for capital investment per capita has not gone unnoticed in russia officials of regional governments throug hout the country come to learn from the novgorod experience thereby multiplying th impact of us assistance efforts and its transition objectives13 reformist attitudes are not th sole criterion for choosing an rii however the far east did not have reputation for eith er economic or democratic reform samara is economically reformist but reportedly has shown signs of resistance to civil society their selection was based par tly on other criteria potential investment interest or presence of foreign including us business and us political interests both locales were more likely objects of us foreign investment than novgorod with considerable industry in samara and natural resources in the far east the far east was also favored by the gorec hernomyrdin commission and is focus of congressional interest assistance has pos itive role to play in places that are not reformoriented both samara and the far ea st programs include efforts to promote publicprivate dialogue among government business and ngos but the novgorod experience suggests that the program should be ready to jump in wherever promising signs of reform and local government support for us objectives are identified complementary economic grow th and democracy building the rii was originally intended to focus entirely on growth and investment but the case of novgorod which by circumstance also included pff activ ities provides evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs14 of the efficacy of combining civil society democracy and related programs with the more intensive business focus for one listening to the people has not been the practice of government in the soviet uni on or its successors some would argue that governments open to public views and accepting the advocacy role of ngos may also be inclined to listen and respond to business associations and business people in novgorod officials have introduced tw ice monthly public discussions led by an ngo representative secondl novgorod business officials are not working in isolation from their colleagues in educa tion and other nonbusiness fields the synergy of one infects the other finally wealth of ussponsored activities may enhance overall us influence especially in the minds of local government officials it may be of some concern to us fficials that both samara and the far east have been reportedly less open to the role of ngos and programs supportive of civil society than novgorod but as the rea lization has grown that cooperative and democracy building activities help establish positive environment for reform the state department coordinators office has noted that other riis may broaden their scope exposure to the united states as force for reform through partnerships linking us organizations with local ones and exchanges that bring russians to the united states the pff and rii emphasize the positive impact of exposure to new ideas novgorod local government officials returned from study trips to san diego california and hartford connecticut enthused with new ideas about how government can facilitate development of small business and improve city management an educational exchange be tween officials to boston has generated ideas and goodwill that may spill over into other novgorod government programs numerous small business owne rs brought to the united states on usia business for russia programs have characterized the ex change as life changing experience which in addition to practical knowledge of business taught them that through hard work they could change their lives although training and advice provided within russia may be more cost effective and of ten more appropriate wellprepared and tailored opportunities for russians to travel to the united states may be powerful ways to convey the message of reform assignment of rii coordinators to strengthen impact although responsible for implementing an assistance strategy the nis coordinator has had limited presence on the gr ound in 1994 an assistant to the ambassador was designated to report to the nis coordinator on all us agency activities in the riis however the state department has created more direct presence appointing non career state departmentcontr acted coordinators to represent the nis coordinator to the regional and city governments and us agencies and to convey the views of the local governments to the nis coordinator while coordinators have little direct authority over implementing agencies and their contractors overall they appear to be performing vital service in facilitating the program in novgorod the coordinator was person to whom both government and private sector turned for help th rough the intercession or advice of the coordinator existing programs were utilized to meet needs or where there was potential funding new progra ms were suggested to st ate usaid or others candidates for exchanges were also reco mmended the coordinator helped connecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs15 us businessmen to appropriate local gove rnment officials the rii coordinators office enhanced the image of the us program because it gave russians sense of the multiplicity and size of the program previously somewhat invisible because of its disparate nature the nis coordinator currently anticipates that regional coordinators at the beginning american citizens will eventually be replaced with russians this has already occurred in novgorod one question that arises is whether the much higher cost of american personnel is not worth the benefits that might accrue from having an american represent the state depa rtment to regiona l governments limitations of regional and grassroots focus ultimately the purpose of the rii and pff approaches is to meet objectives of the freedom support act by assisting the transition of russia to fr ee market economy and democratic system where change has been slow from above the aid program may have been more effective at helping to induce change from below but there are limits to both regional autonomy and the impact of smalls cale grassroots activities as the august 1998 financial crisis has am ply demonstrated both are deeply affected by po litical and economic environment determined at the national level until policy is changed at the top long term economic growth nd civil society will not meet their full potential one example of this is in novgorod wh ere officials have used us support to prepare themselves for the benefits of re form at the federal level geographical mapping system assisted by the university of massachusetts for example is readying them to take advantage of an federal land law but local officials point out that they need at minimum the right from the federal level to sell land stock market law and mortgage financing before real changes can take place at the local level sustainability and longevity of support two recurring questions for observers of the russia program and fo r which the rii and pff provide clear answer are the extent to which programs are created that will remain active and financially selfsustaining after us assistance ends and the degree to which the united states is willing to stick with programs and see them through to some productive closure whether b ecause of budget cuts or change in contractor or strategy the united states often is involve d in funding particular organization or partnership for only one to two years this may be insufficient time for new ngos and business organizations to make their mark or to gain sufficient paying customers or private sector support to sure financial selfsufficiency if that is even realistic possibility in the current economic environment although usaid has put increasing em phasis on sustainability of project activities they recognize that the issue is complex and there is agreement on how to ensure sustainability sustainable or not lack of us funding works to cut programs that in the uncertain and novel environment of trans ition countries might require more nurturing to succeed some usaid efforts do address these concerns as noted earlier additional funds are being provided to independent media organizations to help them over the financ ial crisis efforts have been made to russify thinktank and business support organizations that can carry on usaid types of assistance although the rii in novgorod is winding down some followonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs16 for details on us concerns and evidence to support them see crs report 9829914 russian missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers to iranactivities are being considered that may extend us involvement in the region but it may be useful for us aid implementors to assess each and every grantee and aid beneficiary with view to ensuring that those which are making positive contributions to the russia transition are not neglected what legislative conditions affect continuation of the transition assistance program congress influences policy directions of aid recipient countries through legislative and report language the fr eedom support act for example provides aid to entice behavior in various sectors lays out broad economic and political criteria on which to judge how much aid should be provided and specifies conditions for removal of aid if certa in behaviors are pursued use of aid as carrot to bring about specific result has been highly successful on occasion assistance used to constr uct housing for russian officers has been credited with encouraging the russian milita ry to withdraw from the baltic countries sooner rather than later use of aid as stick however is more complicated and more controversial it has been criticized by some analysts and the administration as inappropriate first they argue that the level of aid being provided is insufficient to provoke change in policy us assistance is not cash gift to the government of russia but arrives largely in the form of technical expertise and training mostly for the private sector and second they argue that the aid progra m benefits the united states by moving us objectives forward notably the manifest us interest in having russia make the transition to free market and democratic systems nevertheless congress s sometimes given precedence to seeking specific change in russias behavior as price for u s aid rather than to the support of broad transition efforts under the fy1999 fo reign operations appr opriations russia is subject to three specific conditions that carry with them the threat of aid sanctions with farreaching consequences for us economic and political transition objectives iran nuclear reactor each year since fy1996 congress has threatened to end or limit assistance if the government of russia continues to transfer nuclear reactor or related technology to iran in 1998 an fy1997 provision triggered cut14 off of 3 million in fy1997appropriated aid to russia under fy1998 legislation half of all aid allocated specifically for the government of russia had to be cut in effect what this meant was that of total 48 million 24 million was taken from programs aimed at the government and transferred to other private sector activities in russia and to other countries the fy 1999 provision also withholds half of all fy1999appropriated aid to the govern ment of russia unless the president determines that providing such aid is in the us national interest and that russia is taking steps to curtail the tr ansfer of nuclear technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs17 available usaid data suggest drama tic decline in assistance to the russian15 government from 44 of most usaid fy 1997 program obligations to 9 of fy1998 totals despite the rii effort funding for regional governments fell from 26 to 4 of the usaid programfy1998 cuts to the central government affected technical advice on how to reform the central bank support for tax re form and other economic policy reforms considered essential for meeting imf loan requirements health reform judicial reform and crime and corruption assistance were also cut efforts to prevent weaponsrelated scientists fro m seeking alternative employment in places like iran and nuclear safety programs st funding also affected were usia exchanges to the united states targeting political leaders the impact of this restriction on us transition assistance objectives was intensified when state department lawyer s defined the term government of russia as including regional and local governments as well as the central government many believed it was unlikely that members originally intended the language to affect regional and local governments which ve control over the iran sale and in some cases have been more effective for ce for reform than the central government as result of the expanded definition at least 8 million intended for regional and local governments was counte d meaning that an additional 4 million of cuts was needed the cuts did not have to come from all programs equally so the impact on local government was softened somewhat but at least 40 of such programs were cut nevertheless the cuts likely have blunted rii efforts and exchange policy reform training assistance and relate d programs throughout russia that target municipal local and regional government15 for fy1999 congress well aware of the broadened definiti on of government approved identical language as the previ ous year however in report language conferees excluded usrussia partnerships between hospitals universities and environmental institutions regional and local governments would continue to be affected religious minorities legislation since fy1998 appropriations legislation has conditioned aid on whether the gove rnment of the russian federation implements legislation that would discriminate against religious groups law that might do this was approved in 1997 but on may 26 1998 the president determined that russia had not yet implemented it in discriminatory fashion although the iran condition cuts fy1999 aid to government by half the religion condition again adopted in the fy1999 act would cut ll fy1999appropriated aid to the central government of russia on april 15 1999 s ecretary albright issued determination that the russian federation had not implemented any law that would discriminate against religious groups in violation of international human rights agreements thereby allowing fy1999 aid to continue customs and taxes recurrent problem ce the beginning of the aid program has been the treatment of usf unded organizations and equipment for tax and customs purposes by russian officials while an early agreement was reached between the russian and us government s which the united states believes to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30112crs18 in force it was never approved by the du ma and was never fully respected by the russian government an interim agreem ent approved several years ago has been subject to arbitrary treatment by customs and tax officials ngos and contractors for example have been charged customs duties for aidfunded equipment and their employees taxed the department of energys nuclear safety program was threatened with severe impairment when vital time sensitive equipment was held up at the border and was only released with the ambassadors intervention in response to these longstanding issu congress approved language in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill that eliminates all assistance to the government of the russian federation not local or regional government if by april 21 1999 agreement was not reached that ensures fy 1999 funds will be excluded from customs duties or that legislation was not enacted and in force that exempts assistance from duties the president however could waive this provision if he found that significant progress had been ma toward resolving the customs issue on april 15 secretary albright issued determination that significant progress has been made on reaching an agreement on this issue thereby allowing aid to continue negotiations on new draft agreement that would clearly exempt almost all us assistance from customs and taxes the ex ceptions were certain luxury goods were completed on march 29 1999 and await final russian government signature although congress has not dopted sanctions legislation with reference to the similar bureaucratic problem of visas in its fy 1999 bill report the senate foreign operations subcommittee took note of situ ation that has seri ously affected peace corps operations in russia and could ra ise the issue in legislation in 1999 beginning in 1997 it became impossible for volunteers to renew their visas annually instead visas had to be renewed ever three months requiring travel over considerable distances and wasting volunteer time as result the june 1998 class of 44 volunteers was cancelled following intervention by the us embassy the russian government has told the state department that they would make provisions to insure the volunteers got visas but the real test of this assertion will not occur until july and august 1999 when two new classe s of volunteers are scheduled to arrive
