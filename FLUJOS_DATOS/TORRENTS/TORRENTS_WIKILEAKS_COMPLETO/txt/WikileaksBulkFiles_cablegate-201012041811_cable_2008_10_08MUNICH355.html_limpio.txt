eo 12958 na tags pgov einv inrb gm subject germanybavaria csu hopes for fresh start with new and younger faces in cabinetand dynamic secretary general 1 sbu newlyelected bavarian ministerpresident horst seehofer christian social union csu elevated youthful female and fresh faces in the presentation of his surprising cabinet choices on october 30 in canny move he also chose 36yearold bundestag member karltheodor zu guttenberg as csu secretary general this makes zu guttenberg effectively the spokesman television personality and advisor to the csu leadership he is also berlin player serving as the csus main foreign policy expert and member of the bundestag foreign affairs committee note while zu guttenberg likely will choose to retain his bundestag seat his office at csu headquarters in munich told us said it is not clear whether he will remain on the foreign affairs committee or switch to committee oriented toward domestic affairs end note seehofers choice underlines the csus claim to be more than just regional party particularly in view of the 2009 european parliament and federal elections the group 4 below needs to appeal to skeptical citizenry if the csu hopes to do better in european and bundestag elections in 2009 2 sbu complicating seehofers and the new cabinets task is the new presence of three members of the coalition member free democratic party fdp one is state secretary who will make their own attempts to strike favorable profile in all seehofer replaced sixteen of the eighteen cabinet positions with eight newcomers he could be accused of ageism since he dismissed all csu cabinet members over 60 years old thus drastically reducing the governments age average below 50 five cabinet members are women notably the landtag also elected its first female president the 64yearold barbara stamm 3 sbu the new bavarian cabinet will consist of the following members all csu unless otherwise noted as fdp minister president horst seehofer 59 upper bavaria

biographies on german political figures at xxxxx and then search for germany biographies 4 sbu comment seehofers cabinet is mainly remarkable for its youthful representation we view the surprise nomination of karltheodor zu guttenberg as secretary general as clever move particularly in view of the csus claim of being more than just regional bavarian party zu guttenberg is foreign policy expert transatlanticist and close and wellknown friend to the united states and mission germany 5 u consulate general munich coordinated this report with embassy berlin 6 u track munich reporting at
