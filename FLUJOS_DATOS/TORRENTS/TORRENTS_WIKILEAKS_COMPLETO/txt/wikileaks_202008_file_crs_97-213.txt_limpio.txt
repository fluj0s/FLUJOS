plan provided for federal contribution set at 140 million for fy1998 but left at an undetermined amount for future fiscal years the specific dollar amount of 140 million reflected the sum of the

the president submitted to congress on august 14 1997 request to consider amendments to his february 1997 appropriations requests the revised version eliminated the prior law request for the 660 million federal payment and the 52070 million annual contribution to dc retirement funds instead the revised budget requested an appropriation of 160 million as contribution from the federal

contained in title iv subtitle h section 4725 of pl 10533 the balanced budget act of 1997 although the federal government assumed the responsibility for financing the pensions already earned by dc

party discovers the injury but in case after the expiration of the 5year period that begins on the date the alleged injury occurred among other changes the bill would have made to dc medical malpractice and medical products liability law would be to impose cap of 250000 on noneconomic damages eliminate joint and several liability for noneconomic damages limit punitive damages to the greater of three times the amount of economic damages or 250000 prohibit punitive damages with exceptions in products liability suits where defective drug or medical device had been approved by the fda and modify the collateral source rule which currently allows an injured 16 the subcommittee chairman charles taylor had also considered calling for an end to rent control but this provision was not included in the subcommittee bill party to sue for damages due from collateral sources such as health insurance which then may have right of subrogation to recover what they paid17 none of title ii on medical liability reform was included in the final act title iii the dc education reform act of 1997 included in subtitle b of title iii was the school scholarship provision based on hr 1797 companion bill to s 847 introduced by house majority leader dick armey on june 4 199718 the housepassed version of hr 2607 would have authorized the provision of scholarships to district of columbia resident students in grades k12 from lowincome families to attend public or private schools in the district or nearby suburbs tuition scholarships or to pay the costs of supplementary academic programs outside regular school hours for students attending district of columbia public schools dcps enhanced achievement scholarships the bill also would have provided an appropriation for this program of 7 million for fy1998 this program would be administered by non governmental district of columbia scholarship corporation all board members would have to be dc residents and none could be dc or federal government employees unless they are on leave students in grades k12 who are residents of the district of columbia with family income below 185 of the standard federal poverty income threshold for families of the relevant size would be eligible for scholarships during the initial years of the program 199799 first priority in the awarding of scholarships would go to students who have been attending dcps schools or are about to enter kindergarten in dcps schools in all years priority would also be given to previous scholarship recipients there would be two types of scholarships tuition scholarships could be used to pay the costs of tuition and fees at public or private including religiouslyaffiliated school in dc or the inner ring of suburban jurisdictions19 and b enhanced achievement scholarships could pay the costs of tuition fees and transportation for program of instruction which enhances student achievement of the core curriculum and is operated outside of regular school hours to supplement the regular school program section 343d2 the amount of tuition scholarships would be the lesser of 3200 or 100 of tuition fees and transportation costs if family income is below the poverty level and the lesser of 2400 or 75 of tuition fees and transportation costs if family income is between 100 and 185 of poverty the amount of enhanced achievement scholarships would be the lesser of tuition fees and transportation or 500 for all students with family income below 185 of poverty the bill stated that in all cases scholarships would be considered to be aid to the student not the institution it was estimated that out of the total of 78000 district students up to 2000 students or 26 could have received tuition scholarships and another 2000 could have received 17 see crs report 97640 medicare budget reconciliation action in the 105th congress by jennifer osullivan et p 94 18 there was an effort on the house side to include school vouchers in

montgomery and prince georges counties in maryland plus arlington and fairfax counties and the cities of alexandria fairfax and falls church in virginia enhanced achievement scholarships out of the 7 million in federal funds proposed for appropriation for fy 1998 in order for its students to be eligible for either tuition or an enhanced achievement scholarship an educational institution generally must have been in operation for at least 3 years with at least 25 students alternatively institutions could obtain provisional 1year certification after providing variety of information to the corporation eg business plan course of study list of the institutions board of directors etc certification of eligibility could be revoked for good cause such as failure to meet program requirements or if 25 or more of the scholarship recipients at the school fail to make appropriate progress institutions would have to file annual reports on their budgets participating schools shall not engage in any practice that discriminates on the basis of race color national origin or sex section 346a and the bill stated that nothing in this act shall affect the rights of students or the obligations of the district of columbia public schools under the individuals with disabilities education act however the bill also provided that nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent parent from choosing or an eligible institution from offering singlesex school class or activity in addition religiouslyaffiliated participating schools would have been allowed to give preferences based on religion in making hiring and enrollment decisions participating educational institutions would be required to make annual reports to the corporation containing variety of data on student achievement disciplinary actions academic program parental involvement etc the corporation would also be required to submit an annual report to congress including information on how program funds have been expended and the initial achievement levels of scholarship recipients the us general accounting office would be required to contract for an evaluation of the scholarship program within 4 years of the bills enactment the evaluation would include comparisons of scholarship recipients and similar but nonparticipating students in the dcps with respect to test scores graduation rates parental satisfaction and impact of the program on the dcps20 the final act does not contain the authorizing provisions for publicprivate school scholarships or vouchers nor the 7 million appropriation of federal funding for the project for fy 1998 that had been included in hr 2607 as initially passed by the house the senate passed the authorizing provisions for the scholarship provision in separate bill s 1502 on the same day that the final dc appropriations bill was passed november 9 the house is expected to consider this bill in the second session of the 105th congress21 several of the provisions from title iii related to establishing public charter schools in the district were included as general provisions sections 167172 of the final act these are discussed in the last section of this report major funding trends district of columbia budget public education system also retained in the final act was the house title iii provision repealing the dc property tax exemption for the national education association sec 158 previously provided by congress 20 for further discussion of the dc school scholarship bills hr 1797 and s 847 see crs report 95344 federal support of school choice background and

riddle and james b stedman updated nov 13 1997 p 811 other policy issues among the other general provisions that were included in the original house bill but dropped from the final act were raise in the pay of certified classroom teachers by 10 and reduction in nonclassroom school personnel by 200 instead of the 400 recommended in the subcommittee bill closing the dc school of law if it was not unconditionally certified by the american bar association by january 31 1998 and providing scholarships for students to pursue their studies in other law schools reopening pennsylvania avenue in front of the white house authority for the inspector general not the control board to hire the auditor for the districts yearly audit and to audit the activities of the control board detailed instructions

as expenditures of that entity restricting the providers from whom employees may receive disability compensation to physicians and hmos approved by the mayor sec 150 requiring that the inspector general hotline number be placed on permit and license application forms and that quarterly reports be submitted to the congress on the number and nature of calls received and on the waste fraud and abuse detected as result of such calls sec 155 requiring that any payment made by the district to any person be made by direct deposit or check delivered by mail sec 156 requiring that the annual federal contribution to the district be deposited into an escrow account held by the control board sec 157a objections by the house authorizing committee the house authorizing committee on the district of columbia indicated its objection to the inclusion in the house appropriations committee bill of general legislation that intrudes on the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee on september 29 chairman tom davis and ranking member eleanor holmes norton of the house committee on government reform and oversight district of columbia subcommittee wrote letter to appropriations committee chairman robert livingston enumerating 16 provisions in the subcommittee version of the dc appropriation bill that they requested be deleted or in few cases amended two of these provisions were dropped or altered by the managers amendment introduced on september 29 the residency requirement for dc employees and the limitation on ftes full time equivalent positions the authorizing committees objections were not addressed on the house floor however twelve of the sixteen provisions singled out by the authorizing committee were eventually excluded from the final legislation retained in the original house bill but not the final act were provisions involving the powers of the districts chief financial officer cfo and inspector general ig and their independence from the control board and efforts to repeal provisions enacted in august 1997 by the balanced budget act regarding the districts ability to borrow to finance the accumulated general fund deficit four of the controversial provisions were revised and included in the final act restrictions on driving official vehicles home sec 150a modification of reductioninforce rif procedures the credit for dc residency was dropped sec 150d requiring reporting to the control board on the expenditure of nonappropriated funds instead of prohibiting certain nonappropriated expenditures sec 138c requiring annual evaluation of the level of welfare benefits to be comparable to nearby maryland and virginia counties rather than capping benefits at prior dc level sec 153 housesenate leadership compromise bill during october action on the dc appropriations bill was stalled in the senate by the controversy over the school scholarship provision there were also substantial differences in the policy provisions general provisions contained in the housepassed versus senate committee bills to expedite the passage and enactment of the dc appropriations bill the house and senate leadership embarked upon an alternative legislative strategy representative tom davis chairman of the house dc authorizing subcommittee and senator lauch faircloth chairman of the senate dc appropriations subcommittee were directed to develop compromise bill on october 28 the house and senate leadership appointees began work on compromise bill based largely on the senate bill the bill underwent several revisions that were not formally released early versions contained some of the policy provisions approved by the house notably slightly revised version of the house school scholarship title and an accompanying appropriation of 7 million in federal funds for fy1998 but they excluded other earmarked federal funding that had been provided in the house but not the senate bill and several of the houses general provisions related to the districts governance the early compromise bill also contained few new provisions not previously included in either the house or senate version including proposal to transfer of lorton prison property to fairfax county virginia neither the school scholarship nor the lorton property transfer proposal are in the final act veto threatened for school scholarship provision the topic of school scholarships or vouchers is highly controversial22 enacting even limited program for the district might be viewed as the precursor for an expanded district program or national program president clinton threatened to veto the dc appropriations bill if it contained scholarship provision the early version of the housesenate leadership compromise bill was reportedly drafted so that the president could lineitem veto the scholarship provision 22 for discussion of the legal standards governing the voucher issue see crs report 9750 education vouchers the constitutional standards by david m ackerman house bill hr 2607 amended by the senate the senate acted on november 9 the leadership compromise bill was introduced as senate substitute amendment to the house bill the senate deleted the language of the entire house bill after the enacting clause and inserted the language of the compromise bill the dc appropriations bill included second title providing special immigration procedures for certain central american cuban and eastern european groups the senate split off the school scholarship provision from the earlier housesenate leadership compromise bill and passed it as separate bill s 1502 the dc appropriations bill was approved by voice vote as part of larger amendment to hr 2607 that included two other appropriations bills foreign operations export financing and related programs and the departments of commerce justice and state the judiciary and related agencies when the omnibus appropriations bill hr 2607 as amended went back to the house floor the three appropriations bills were again separated the house approved the dc bill with few of its own amendments on november 12 the senate approved the houses amendments on november 13 using this procedure the amended house bill could go directly to the president without the need for conference between the house and senate on november 19 president clinton signed the bill into public law 105100 explanatory statement but conference report as consequence of the expedited congressional procedure conference was held and conference report was produced on the bill the senate committee on appropriations did issue an explanatory statement to accompany the bill which was published in the congressional record23 the explanatory statement directs that the language and allocations set forth in senate report 10575 the senate appropriations committee report to accompany s 1156 should be complied with unless specifically addressed to the contrary in the enacted appropriations bill and the explanatory statement24 according to the house appropriations committee however the explanatory statement from the senate appropriations committee does not have the official standing that conference report or joint statement of the managers would have continuing resolutions from october 1 until the enactment of hr 2607 on november 19 interim funding for the district of columbia was covered under the six successive continuing resolutions cr on appropriations designed to serve as funding bridge for the fy1998 appropriations bills not yet enacted the first cr hjres 94 pl 10546 expired october 23 1997

year 1998 continuing resolution by sandy streeter section 115 of the continuing resolution provided for the district to receive funding for the programs authorized under the revitalization act this included the federal contribution to the operations of the nations capital the base fullyear amount for each budget category enumerated in the bill was the higher of the amount in the budget request or in the house or senate dc appropriations act 1998 if passed as of october 1 1997 under section 101c of the cr the governing amount was either the presidents budget request or the senatereported version of the bill s 1156 as reported out by the senate appropriations committee on september 9 whichever was higher the money was to be distributed on prorata basis that is the fraction that the number of days covered by the continuing resolution is to 365 the district had counted upon receiving the full authorized federal contribution of 190 million on or near october 1 in order to help repay the outstanding treasury advances of approximately 223 million for fy1997 that were to come due on october 1 1997 to accommodate the cashflow problem that the partial payment of the federal contribution would cause the district section 119 of the continuing resolution provided that the district government could delay repayment of the 1997 treasury advances beyond october 1 1997 until it received the fullyear federal contribution while awaiting the full contribution amount the district borrowed from the treasury to cover its beginningoffiscalyear cash flow needs thereby incurring additional unbudgeted interest costs major funding trends federal funds there are two different measures of appropriations for the district of columbia one is the appropriation of federal dollars for the benefit of the district tables 2 and 3 the other is the appropriation of the districts own local funds table 4 the relationship between these two is explained in the section major funding trends summary and table 5 table 2 presents historical information on federal funds only for fiscal years 199397 tables 3 and 4 report the dollar amounts enacted for fy1997 and the amounts recommended for fiscal year 1998 by the president for federal funds and the dc control board for local funds in the version of the district of columbia appropriations bill as initially passed by the house on october 9 1997 hr 2607 in the version approved by the senate appropriations committee on september 9 1997 s 1156 along with amendments added thereto on the senate floor and in the version finally enacted alternatively referred to as the housesenate leadership compromise bill hr 2607 as amended or pl 100105 the following discussion of federal funds is divided into two parts the first covers the categories of expenditures that were authorized by the revitalization act the second covers the categories that were added during the fy1998 appropriations process either by the dc appropriations subcommittees or in the final housesenate leadership bill effect of revitalization act on federal funds for the district the 1997 revitalization act26 made substantial changes in the financial relationship between the federal government and the district of columbia these changes make it more difficult to compare budget information for fiscal years 1998 and beyond with information for fy1997 and prior years this is particularly true for all federal funds and for the local funds expenditure category of public safety and justice table 3 illustrates how the traditional categories of federal funding for the district have been replaced with new ones beginning with fy1998 federal contribution the revitalization act changed the traditional way of accounting for the appropriation of federal funds to the district of columbia it eliminated the annual federal payment to the district and annual federal contribution to certain dc retirement funds that had been present through fy1997 see tables 2 and 3 in partial replacement of the federal payment the act introduced federal contribution to the operations of the nations capital and authorized contribution of 190 million for fy1998 the senate appropriations committee recommended federal contribution to the district of 190 million the amount authorized by the revitalization act but 30 million higher than the presidents 160 million request however s 1156 required that the extra 30 million be used to help pay down the districts accumulated general fund deficit which was projected to be approximately 527 million by the end of fy1997 the house bill recommended federal contribution of 180 million but put conditions on its use the final appropriations act follows the senate bill and provides the full 190 million authorized not less than 30 million of this is to be used to repay the accumulated general fund deficit the federal contribution may be used to repay advances from the us treasury made to the district under provisions of the revitalization act management reform subtitle b of the revitalization act is known as the district of columbia management reform act of 199727 the senate appropriations bill included an 8 million appropriation of federal funds payable to an escrow account with the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance authority the dc financial control board to help pay consultants to develop reform plans for specified dc government departments neither the president nor the house bill requested any special federal funding for this purpose the district proposed using 30 million and the house 5 million in local funds for management and productivity improvement the final appropriation includes the senates recommendation of 8 million in federal funds for management reform to remain available for two fiscal years until september 30 199928 according to the explanatory statement of the senate committee on appropriations this appropriation also funds the position of chief management officer cmo who is to oversee the responsibilities assigned to the control board by the management reform act on december 22 1997 the control board announced the appointment of mrs camille cates barnett to the position of cmo for fiveyear term she began her duties on january 15 1998 26 the national capital revitalization and selfgovernment improvement act of 1997 title xi of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 enacted august 5 1997 27 sections 11101 to 11106 of pl 10533 28 funds are typically appropriated for only one fiscal year until september 30 1998 in the case of the fy1998 act corrections and courts under the revitalization act the largest shift in responsibility from the district of columbia to the federal government occurred in the areas of corrections and courts in the case of corrections the federal government will take over financial responsibility immediately and take over functional responsibility within few years in the case of the courts the federal government is taking over financial responsibility only the district will continue to operate its own court system the shift in financial responsibility from the district to the federal government is reflected in the changes in appropriations for fy1998 compared with fy1997 under both federal and local funds tables 3 and 4 the revitalization act provides that during the transition of responsibility for sentenced dc felons from the dc department of corrections to the us bureau of prisons appropriations for corrections are to be made directly to the dc corrections trustee newly created appointed independent position within the district government for fy1998 the president the senate appropriations committee the house and the final act all agreed on the request for federal funds of 169 million for operations and 302 million for construction and repair for dc correctional facilities of which 295 million is available for transfer to the federal prison system29 the revitalization act provided for the federal government to assume the financing of the dc court system the president senate appropriations committee and house all recommended the same total funding but there were differences in which federal and district agencies would be designated as the conduits for the funding and in the breakdown of the funding among specific functions see table 3 the final act made further alterations and refinements under the revitalization act the federal monies to fund the dc courts were to be funneled through federal agency known as the state justice institute the original house dc appropriations bill recommended that the funds be payable through the office of management and budget the senate appropriations committee bill recommended payment through the administrative office of the us courts an amendment on the senate floor recommended payment through the dc financial control board the final dc appropriations act provides that federal funding for the dc courts will be paid quarterly by the us treasury based on apportionments approved by the office of management and budget directly to the courts with payroll and financial services to be provided on contractual basis with the general services administration gsa the gsa is to submit monthly reports to the president and the committees on appropriations of the senate and house of representatives the committee on governmental affairs of the senate and the committee on government reform and oversight of the house of representatives all versions of the appropriations bill agreed that the payments for operation of the district of columbia courts would be made to the joint committee on judicial administration in the district of columbia an entity of the dc courts separate from the dc government by providing for the federal payment to be made directly to the joint committee notwithstanding any other provision of law the final dc appropriations act in effect eliminates the role of the state justice institute previously provided for in the revitalization act as passthrough funding agency for the courts the final combined funding for courts and corrections was 151 million of which 108 million is for operation of the dc courts including judges pensions and 43 million for 29 the final act did not include the house request that the remaining 7 million be set aside specifically for security improvements and repairs at the lorton correctional complex payment to the newly established offender supervision trustee30 within the courts funding 750000 is appropriated for new temporary truth in sentencing commission31 within the offender supervision trustees funding the final act further specifies appropriations of 26855 million for parole adult probation and offender supervision 90 million for the public defender service 6345 million for the pretrial services agency and 800000 to be transferred to the us parole commission the revitalization act provided for the federal government to take over the financial responsibility for pensions that had been earned as of september 30 1997 under three pension funds for district of columbia employees the fund for judges was treated differently32 from the police officers and firefighters fund and the teachers fund3334 the final 1998 dc appropriations act specifies that the federal appropriation for the courts includes pension costs for the judges according to the office of management and budget omb operationally for fy1998 onetime discretionary appropriation of 5 million was returned to the us treasury35 that represents one years worth of normal cost pre payment plus an amortization payment for the unfunded liability added provisions for federal funds in addition to the requirements made by the revitalization act the final appropriations act provided 120 million appropriation of federal funds to the national park service for the operations of us park police in the district of columbia general provision section 141 the senate committee bill had recommended 50 million and the house bill 125 million the final act also appropriated 30 million in federal funds for medicare coordinated care demonstration project in the district of columbia sec 16036 the project was authorized under section 4016b2c of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 but its funding was left to be determined by the dc appropriations act the balanced budget act had left it unclear whether the funding for the district project would be federal or local the house bill recommended five additional categories of federal funding for the district none of which was included in the final act 70 million for federal contribution 30 john carver iii former chief of the dc pretrial services agency was appointed by us

retirement funds 34 for the judges pension plan the administration of the plan was left with the district but federal funds were authorized to finance the plan for the police and firefighters fund and

million in appropriation for the criminal justice system total and the courts subtotal in the final enacted version compared with the senate version of the bill see table 3 36 the demonstration project will be implemented at georgetown university medical center for parental choice in education the school scholarship program 54 million for 5 pay raise for police 26 million for 5 pay raise for

program sec 162 this is technical amendment to the child health care block grant established by subtitle j of title iv of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 the funds will be spent nationwide

increased several times during the fy1998 appropriations process as of november 8 the revised 302b allocations for fy1998 provided the district with 835 million in budget authority and 537 million in outlays40 this equals the amount of budget authority called for in the final appropriations act for the district before the 20 million for the nationwide medicaid child health program general provision sec 162 is added major funding trends district of columbia budget the fy1998 dc appropriations act continued the effort of the fy1996 and fy1997 acts to reduce spending by many offices of the district government41 absent from the final fy1998 act however are numbers specifying the limit on the number of fulltime equivalent fte positions by budget function fte limits had appeared in the fy1996 and fy1997 dc appropriations acts and in the initial version of hr 2607 for fy1998 passed by the house in future fiscal years the budgets of agencies under courtappointed receivership or other courtappointed official must be submitted to the mayor for inclusion in the annual budget of the district sec 140 for fy1988 however the budget amounts for agencies under receivership are not included in the appropriation of district of columbia local funds42 effect of revitalization act on the appropriation of local funds the changes in federaldistrict financial relations following the revitalization act also complicate the comparison of the appropriation of the district of columbias local funds for fiscal year 1998 relative to fy 1997 and other prior years two of the largest changes are the 512 million decrease in local funding for public safety and justice functions and the 201 million appropriation for deficit reduction and revitalization public safety and justice as result of the shift in responsibility from the district to the federal government for financing the districts courts and corrections functions as well as the retirement plans for police and fire fighters and for judges the appropriation out of dc local funds for the category of public safety and justice was cut in half the appropriation for public safety and justice for fy1998 of 529739 million is 512 million or 49 lower than the appropriation for fy1997 of 1041281 million the house bill had proposed federal payment of 54 million to fund police pay raise and 26 million for fire fighters pay raise instead the final act designates that 26 million in local funds be set aside to cover pay increase for uniformed fire fighters sec 165 40 us senate committee on appropriations

government are currently under receivership the entire department of public and assisted housing the department of corrections medical and mental health services at the dc jail the department of human development child welfare services and the department of human development commission on mental health services deficit reduction and revitalization the 1997 revitalization act required that the districts budget be in balance beginning in fy1998 year earlier than had been required under the 1995 control board act pl 1048 the dcfrma act the two budgets originally presented by the district and the control board on june 15 1997 were in balance the single consensus budget they submitted together on september 8 revised to reflect the revitalization act was in surplus the district estimated that the swap brought about by the revitalization act of smaller federal payment in exchange for the federal assumption of certain dc functions or expenses would bring the district of columbia budget surplus for fy1998 of 2359 million the district planned to spend the surplus as follows 2023 million to reduce the accumulated general fund deficit43 36 million for interest on 50 million in additional borrowing for capital improvements and 30 million to establish management improvement fund to be spent on suggestions made by outside consultants for longterm savings training city workers and upgrading office systems the final act followed the senates request compared with the districts budget request the senate committee bill allocated 348 million more to expenditures for public safety and justice and the same amount less to the projected surplus see table 4 of the 201090 million surplus to be deposited in an escrow account held by the control board the senate committee directed that 160 million be spent on deficit reduction and the remaining 40 million on management improvements and financing capital improvements44 the original house bill provided for the creation of district of columbia deficit reduction fund with deposit of 200 million derived from the projected surplus from the exchange the house bill also provided 5 million for the management and productivity improvement fund and 30 million in payasyougo capital outlays for school and street repairs thereby spending the other 35 million of the revitalization acts projected total savings of 235 million in local funds in addition the house bill would have created district of columbia taxpayers relief fund to receive the revenues collected in excess of those projected in the appropriations act none of these provisions was included in the final act public education system most of the decrease in appropriations for the public education system for fy1998 compared with fy1997 is explained by the transfer of responsibility for the teachers pre fy1998 retirement program to the federal government pl 105100 contains number of substantive provisions intended to encourage the establishment of public charter schools in the district both under the appropriations for the public education system and the general provisions sections 16717245 the public charter 43 at the time of the budget

authorized by the district of columbia school reform act of 1995 title ii of the fy1996 dc appropriations act contained within pl 104134 two charter schools are in operation in the district of columbia during the continued schools are fiscally autonomous from the district of columbia public schools dcps the charter schools received separate appropriation of 3376 million46 400000 of which is reserved for administrative expenses of the public charter school board any funds reserved for charter schools that are not expended by may 1 1998 plus certain other funds that may become available will be placed into new charter school fund revolving loan fund to help charter schools meet startup costs sec 172 the emergency transitional education board of trustees is directed to report to the congress within 120 days of enactment on the capital needs of each charter school in the meantime the board is to provide to charter schools financial assistance to meet capital needs equivalent to that provided to schools in the dcps this includes giving priority to charter schools in the disposition of surplus public school property and reporting back to congress by november 1 1998 on the implementation of that policy pl 105100 also increases the number of charters that may be granted from 5 to 10 schools per chartering authority each year and establishes an annual deadline of april 1 by which chartering authorities must decide on the approval of new charter applications sec 167 accounting uncertainties regarding the final act sec 138a1b of pl 105100 as enacted provides for ceiling on total operating expenses of 4811906 million 118269 million is from intradistrict funds leaving net amount of 4963637 million for operating expenses this include 4047388 million for general fund operating expenses and 646249 million for enterprise fund operating expenses in addition 269330 million was appropriated for general fund capital expenditures the total appropriation of district of columbia funds was 4962967 million see table 4 the ceiling on operating expenses as specified in sec 138a1b was not increased to reflect three appropriations from local dc funds added in the final version of the bill these include the 26 million appropriation for pay increase for uniformed firefighters sec 165 the 70 million appropriation for homeless services sec 142 and the increase in appropriations for charter schools by 2141 million from 1235 million to 3376 million under the appropriations for the public education system it remains unclear whether congress intended to increase the overall appropriations ceiling to accommodate these or whether congress expected the needed funds to be reprogrammed from related budget categories the accounting published in the congressional record includes the additional appropriations for the fire fighters pay increase and homeless services in 96 million higher totals for operating expenses of the general fund and total district of columbia funds but it does not include the increase in appropriations for charter schools47 the numbers in tables 45 continued 199798 school year several additional schools have received charters to

senate floor amendment and included in the final bill during 1997 the districts department of human services was divided into two separate departments the department of human development and the department of health the budgetary treatment of these two new departments was not formalized in time for the fy1998 appropriations cycle so the appropriation was once again made for the aggregate functional category of human support services f six line items were appropriated as group under financing and other in the fy1998 senate appropriations committee bill and final act but enumerated individually in the house bill g unlike the senate appropriations committee bill the original house bill did not include the surplus from the revitalization act exchange or the houses proposed 200 million deposit into deficit reduction fund as expenditures for the sake of comparability the accounting for the house bill has been revised to show the provision for deficit reduction and revitalization as positive appropriation of 200 million rather than zero correspondingly the totals for operating expenses of the general fund and the total for district of columbia funds were

improvements to the districts infrastructure finally an amount will be used for management and productivity improvements the explanatory statement of the senate committee on appropriations congressional record nov 13 1997 p s12659 reiterates that the bill directs that not less than 160 million be used for reduction of the accumulated general fund deficit i in the senate appropriations committee bill and the final act 8 million in federal funds was provided for management reform j five line items were appropriated as group under enterprise and other uses in the senate appropriations committee bill and final act but enumerated individually in the house bill four of the offices are listed for the first time in the fy1998 appropriation of the group only the cable television enterprise fund appeared in the fy1997 appropriation major funding trends summary the amounts for total federal funds to the district table 3 and total district of columbia funds table 4 should not simply be added together to reach grand total of funds appropriated on behalf of the district this is because some federal payments to the district are counted twice once as part of federal funds to dc on the federal expenditure side and again as part of district of columbia funds on the district revenue side in fy1997 all of the federal funds appropriated on behalf of dc were paid over to the district to help cover expenditures also accounted for under the districts own local funds in fy1998 the districts local funds will include the federal contribution to the nations capital and one of the special federal payments appropriated the federal payment for management reform however the other federal payments provided in the fy1998 appropriations are for activities outside those included in the districts budget of local funds this includes the payments for corrections and criminal justice the national park service and the medicare demonstration project48 the calculations in table 5 adjust for this double counting total district of columbia funds appropriated for fy1998 are 4962967000 this is 58341 million less than the total amount of local funds appropriated for fy1997 5021308000 total federal funds appropriated for the district are 835 million for fy1988 this is 116 million more than the 719 million appropriated for fy1997 simply adding these two lines together suggests that the combined total funds appropriated for the district increased by 57887 million between fy1997 and fy1998 however when these numbers are corrected for the double counting explained above there is net increase of 578659 million in combined federal and local funds available to the district for fy1998 compared with fy1997 this is largely explained by the fact that the new federal payments for dc corrections and criminal justice are not counted again within the districts own budget while the prior federal payment was counted twice table 5 total funds appropriated for the

4 future issue the federal contribution major unresolved issue from the revitalization act affecting dc appropriations is how the federal contribution to the district of columbia will be determined for future fiscal years the revitalization act officially repealed the federal payment to the district of columbia but in its stead authorized federal contribution towards the costs of the operations of the government of the nations capital subtitle g section 11601 of pl 105 33 the act authorized specific dollar amount for the federal contribution for fy1998 only 190 million for future years the act left the dollar amount of the federal contribution to be determined according to the act after fy1998 for each subsequent fiscal year such amount as may be necessary for such contribution in determining the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization under this paragraph congress shall take into account the findings described in paragraph 1 the four elements cited as findings in paragraph 1 may be paraphrased as follows the congressionally imposed height limit on buildings and other limitations relating to the federal presence in the district that may tend to reduce tax revenues the congressional prohibition against levying an income tax on nonresident commuters which limits the districts ability to tax income earned in the district of columbia the unreimbursed public service costs imposed by the federal governments presence and the resulting high tax burden on district residents relative to residents of other jurisdictions in the washington dc metropolitan area and other cities of comparable size as with previous legislation authorizing the federal payment the revitalization act does not present formula or methodology for translating the generalized notion of compensating the district for the federal governments presence into predictable dollar amount49 49 all of these four factors have been cited at some time in previous legislation authorizing
