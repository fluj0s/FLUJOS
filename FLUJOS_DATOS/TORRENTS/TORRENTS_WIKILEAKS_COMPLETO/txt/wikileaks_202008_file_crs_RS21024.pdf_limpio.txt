society the almost flawless transition to the year 2000 of course re ndered such an action unnecessary more recently at least one newspaper errone ously reported that the september 14 2001 declaration of national emerge ncy by president george w bush in response to terrorist attacks in new york city and washingt on dc activated some 500 dormant legal provisions including those allowing him to impose censorship and martial law1 in accordance with the requirements of the national emergencies act the presidents declaration actually activated nine selective pr ovisions of statutory law identified in his proclamation pertaining to military and coast guard personnel2 such comments nonetheless suggest cons ideration of what martial law constitutes as well as when and how it might be invoked according to one finition martial law exists when military authorities carry on government or exercise various degrees of control over civilians or civilian authorities in domestic territory

problems under lincoln revised edition urbana il university of illinois press 1964 p 170become ineffective3 constitutional scholar edward s corwin agrees with this understanding but also offers important qualifications regime of martial law may be compendiously if not altogether accurately defined as one in which the ordinary law as administered by the ordinary courts is superseded for the time being by the will of military commander it follows that when martial law is instituted under nationa l authority it rests ultimately on the will of the president of the united states in hi s capacity as commanderinchief it should be added at once nevertheless that the subject is one in which the record of actual practice fails often to support the niceties of theory thus the employment of the military arm in the enforcement of the civ il law does not invariably or even usually involve martial law in the strict sense for soldiers are often placed simply at the disposal and direction of th civil authorities as kind of supplementary police or posse comitatus on the other hand by reason of the discretion that the civil authorities themselves are apt to vest in the military in any emergency requiring its assistance the line between such an employment of the military and regime of martial law is frequently any but hard and fast one4 the record of practice probably utilized by the federal gove rnment for the first time in 1814 when proclaimed by the victorious general andrew jackson martia l law was not part of the experience of great many amer icans in the period prior to the civil war and therefore its potentially arbitrary and authoritarian nature was not especially fearsome to the populace in this regard an observation by historian james g ra ndall might be recalled that martial law was not always consider ed oppressive is shown by the fact that citizens sometimes petitioned for it some ph iladelphians for instance requested the president to declare martial law in their city at the time of confederate general robert lees invasion to enable them to put the city in proper state of defense nor should we suppose that the existence of martial law necessarily involved condition of extensive or continuous military restraint beginning with september 1863 the district of columbia was subjected to martial law and this state of affairs continued throughout the war but it s hould not be s upposed that residents of the capital city were usually conscious of seri ous curtailment of their liberties the condition of martial law was here used as means of military security that martial law should be declared in areas of actual military operations was of course not remarkable5 as territory of the confederacy was ov ertaken by union forces it was governed under military authority and martial law this state of ffairs in the south with regard to martial law conti nued into the reconstruction period since the civil war era notes joseph kallenbach there have

during the railroad strike crisis of 1887 there have been conditions of limited martial law established with the explicit or implicit approval of the president by officer s in the field however he adds6 these occasional invocations of martia l law during the postcivil war period occurred most often in labor disputes but as one chronicler recount s other disturbances of the public order we re involved as well qualified martial law was twice declared by federal military officers in the period after the first world war when presiden tial control of troop activities was so greatly relaxed according to the report of the cretary of war as result of the race riot in omaha nebraska general leonard wood took personal charge of the situation and on october 1 1919 proclaimed the city under qualified martial law five days later because of the danger of violence in gary indiana during the steel strike general wood after conferring with the m unicipal authorities placed that city also under qualified martial law there have been other instances where th modified form of martial law existed in fact though undeclared general merriam placed restrictions on travel into and out of the mining camps of idahos coeur d alene in 1899 in the colorado disturbance of 1914 saloons were closed common prac tice the sale of arms was forbidden arms and ammunition were seized and the opening of mines was forbidden as was also the importation of strikebreakers public assemblies were forbidden and arms were taken in the west virginia strike zone in 19217 the military has been utilized on number of occasions since world war i when presidents have sought to ma intain public order but have not invoked martial law such examples include the routing of the bonus army in 1932 in the district of columbia maintaining public order durin g desegregation efforts at little rock ar in 1957 the university of mississippi in 1962 and the univ ersity of alabama the following year and quelling civil

orders he then with the aid of the troops under his command and the war relocation authority established by another executive order on march 18 1942 proceeded to remove all persons of japanese ancestry from these two areas11 this action did not involve martial law althoug h martial law was established within at least one of the internment camps12 roosevelt issued the order as president and commander in chief in fulfillment of his st atutory responsibilities to protect national defense material premises and utilities from espionage and sabotage13 since the conclusion of world war ii ma rtial law has not been presidentially directed or approved for any area of the united states federal troops have been dispatched to domestic locales experiencing unrest or riot but in these situations the military has remained subordi nate to federal civilian management technological corrections and adjustments averted the need to invoke martial w due to y2k failures and resulting public disorder the septembe r 11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city clearly demonstrated that civilian law enforcement authorities were adequate to managing the situation without resort to

americans who cherish their liberties expect civilian law enforcement to prev ail and support civ ilian control of military authority as long ago as 1962 sensitivity to these values was apparent when the kennedy administration repor tedly instructed highlevel emergency planning committee that nationwide martial law is not an acceptable planning assumption in preparing for the survival of the nation following nuclear attack18 veteran news correspondent walter cronkite stated the case few years later when he wrote that we must not merely prepare for the survival of individuals but also for
