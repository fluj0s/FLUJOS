floodwalls updated january 26 2006 nicole t carter analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress protecting new orleans from hurricane barriers to floodwalls summary breached floodwalls in downtown new orleans during hurricane katrina caused significant flooding unlike most of the flooding in coastal louisiana which resulted from water flowing over levees and floodwalls as the storms surge exceeded the structures height preliminary evidence suggests that three downtown new orleans breaches occurred before their design was exceeded that is these downtown breaches resulted not from structures weakened by overtopping but from the failure of the floodwalls and their foundations findings of ongoing investigations into the causes of the floodwall failures have implications for analyzing both the reliability of the existing system of levees and floodwalls and its repairs and options for greater structural protection of new orleans moreover these findings may shape plans for rebuilding sections of the city and perspectives on the federal role and responsibility in the citys rebuilding efforts one possible cause of the failure is poor or inadequate design following hurricane betsy in 1965 congress authorized the corps to construct with local levee districts the lake pontchartrain and vicinity hurricane protection project to protect the city from the rough equivalent of category 3 storm the projects original design was to control storm surge flowing into water bodies near downtown by building inlet barriers and canal floodgates during the projects construction which was ongoing when hurricane katrina made landfall numerous factors eg including local environmental concerns changing cost estimates local flood protection preferences and litigation contributed to changing how the city was to be protected the final design attempted to reduce hurricanerelated flooding in the city by increasing the height of levees and floodwalls in lieu of the inlet barriers and canal floodgates this report documents the evolution in the design of the lake pontchartrain project with specific reference to how and by whom design decisions were made the focus is on two major design developments relevant to the current investigations into floodwall failures in downtown new orleans 1 the shift from barriers at lake pontchartrains inlets to higher levees along the lakeshore and 2 the shift from floodgates at the mouth of the citys stormwater outfall canals that drain into lake pontchartrain to higher floodwalls along the length of the canals the corps decision in the mid1980s to recommend higher levees instead of the inlet barriers it had recommended in 1965 was shaped by multiple factors including environmental litigation project economics and local preferences the corps preferred floodgates to floodwalls along the orleans avenue and london avenue canals the decision to not build floodgates and instead build floodwalls along the canals was made by local project sponsors the original design and the final design were intended to provide the same level of protection ie

orleans location on the gulf coast with water on three sides and below sealevel terrain makes this densely populated section of louisiana highly susceptible to flooding from hurricane storm surges new orleans flooding threats are not only from the coast but also from the mississippi river and rainfall that gets trapped in the city known as stormwater the system of levees and floodwalls around the city is designed to provide specified level of protection from riverine and coastal flooding where as massive pumps and drainage canals that flow into lake pontchartrain manage the citys stormwater1 local levee districts maintain the hurricane levees and floodwalls that were built largely by the us army corps of engineers as part of its lake pontchartrain and vicinity hurricane protection project to protect new orleans and the surrounding parishes from category 3 hurricane the sewerage and water board of new orleans is responsible for the citys stormwater management infrastructure breaches of the floodwalls protecting new orleans during hurricane katrina were the major contributor to significant flooding in many areas of downtown although most of the levee breaches in coastal louisiana were the result of the storms surge flowing over levees preliminary evidence suggests that three major breaches in downtown new orleans occurred prior to the floodwalls being overtopped that is the floodwalls failed before their design was exceeded the failure of these floodwalls to reliably perform has many stakeholders speculating about the causes of the failures question central to many of the investigations into katrinarelated damage and of concern in rebuilding efforts is were the levees and floodwalls breached because their design was exceeded or did they fail due to faulty design construction or maintenance to answer these questions evidence has and continues to be collected on numerous fronts including evidence of the height of the storm surge in various locations and how the levees and floodwalls performed technical experts from universities professional engineering organizations and the corps are using this evidence to model and explain the performance of new orleans hurricane protection system the findings are likely to shape not only the future design of the hurricane protection system but also plans for rebuilding sections of the city and perspectives on the federal role and responsibility in the citys rebuilding efforts moreover the 1 levees are broad earthen structures while floodwalls are concrete and steel walls built atop levee or in lieu of levee floodwalls are often used in urban areas because they require less land than levees crs2 findings may improve understanding and change perceptions of the level of flood protection and risk in other us cities understanding why new orleans hurricane protection system failed is essential for moving beyond simply making repairs to damaged levees and floodwalls knowing why the floodwalls failed is central to assessing the citys vulnerability to storm surge flooding and deciding on how to most effectively combine approaches for managing flood risk during rebuilding efforts eg investing in coastal wetlands loss and hurricane protection infrastructure requiring floodproofing in certain areas and mapping areas for the federal flood insurance program nonetheless in order to be prepared for the 2006 hurricane season the corps is having to proceed with immediate repairs of damaged levees and floodwalls using available information and integrating new information as it is available one of the causes of failure being discussed is poor or inadequate design for protecting the city from category 3 hurricane the original project design was to control storm surge flowing into water bodies near downtown by building inlet barriers and canal floodgates during the projects construction which began with authorization in 1965 and was ongoing when hurricane katrina made landfall numerous factors contributed to changing the design of how to protect the city eg including local environmental concerns changing cost estimates local flood protection preferences and litigation the final design attempted to reduce hurricane related flooding in the city by increasing the height of levees and floodwalls in lieu of the barriers and floodgates the corps decision in the mid1980s to recommend higher levees instead of the inlet barriers it had recommended in 1965 was shaped by multiple factors including environmental litigation project economics and local preferences the corps preferred floodgates to floodwalls along the orleans avenue and london avenue canals the decision to not build floodgates and instead build floodwalls along the canals was made by the local project sponsors the original design and the final design were intended to provide the same level of protection ie protection from the rough equivalent of category 3 storm surge this report discusses the evolution in the projects design with specific reference to how and by whom design decisions were made the focus is on two major design developments relevant to the current investigations into the floodwall failures in downtown new orleans during hurricane katrina 1 the shift from the barriers at the inlets to lake pontchartrain to higher levees along the lake and 2 the shift from floodgates at the mouth of the citys stormwater outfall canals that drain into lake pontchartrain to higher floodwalls along the length of the canals the report includes an appendix summarizing the federal funding history for the lake pontchartrain project the analysis contained herein is based on currently available information and is limited in scope2 2 many of the documents referenced in this report are

factors continued crs3 new orleans hurricane protection hurricane katrinas floodwall breaches primer although there were more than dozen breaches and many other segments of damaged levees and floodwalls in the greater new orleans area and numerous in other coastal louisiana parishes the four breaches see figure 1 of the lake pontchartrain project that have received the greatest attention due to their impact on downtown new orleans were the following breach of the 17th street canal floodwall two breaches of the london avenue canal floodwall and breach of the western flank of the inner harbor navigation canal ihnc also known as the industrial canal floodwall flooding due to overtopping of citys levees and floodwalls was predicted for storm surges from storm stronger than category 3 hurricane passing close to the new orleans region3 extensive overtopping may cause levee or floodwall breach breaching in urban areas often produces catastrophic damage hurricane katrina had weakened from category 5 storm to category 4 storm by the time passed east of new orleans overtopping was the cause of much of the flooding and most of the breaches and damage to the hurricane protection infrastructure in coastal louisiana however overtopping does not appear to have caused much of the flooding and some of the breaches in downtown new orleans november 2005 preliminary analysis of the performance of new orleans hurricane protection system by technical expert teams from the university of california at berkeley and the american society of civil engineers indicate the method of failures at the breaches in downtown new orleans4 the teams preliminary evidence suggests that breaches along the 17th street and london avenue canals occurred before the floodwalls were overtopped that is these floodwalls failed before their design was exceeded the immediate and underlying causes of these breaches ie what led to the failures are the subject of conjecture hypotheses 2 continued that are often debated in the discussions of the performance during hurricane katrina of the lake pontchartrain project and other levees in coastal louisiana eg levee maintenance operation of the mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo deepdraft navigation channel loss of coastal wetlands and increasing sea surface temperature are not discussed in this report the many other breaches of the lake pontchartrain project such as the breaches on the eastern flank of the ihnc that contributed to the flooding of the lower ninth ward and levees constructed as elements of other us army corps of

by the congressional cartography program geography and map division library of congress 2005 lake pontchartrain project congress authorized the corps to protect new orleans from the rough equivalent of category 3 storm when it authorized the lake pontchartrain and vicinity hurricane protection project in october19655 the project consists of levees and floodwalls most of which were constructed by the 5 the lake pontchartrain project included structures in st charles located west of jefferson parish not shown in figure 1 jefferson orleans and st bernard parishes in 1999 the house committee on transportation and infrastructure authorized via committee resolution hurricane protection louisiana study to investigate providing hurricane protection from category 4 or 5 storm crs5 corps and costshared by the federal government and local levee districts6 the orleans parish segments of the lake pontchartrain project which encompass downtown new orleans were 90 complete as of may 2005 the total cost for the lake pontchartrain and vicinity project is 738 million with the federal responsibility 528 million7 federal allocations totaled 457 million through fy2005 leaving around 70 million to complete federal funding the original design of the lake pontchartrain project was sent to congress in july 1965 the project was designed to protect the city from standard hurricane for the region which was roughly equivalent to category 3 hurricane on the saffir simpson scale the standard hurricane was defined as high sustained wind speeds reasonably characteristic for specified coastal location reasonably characteristic was defined as only few hurricanes on record over the general region had been recorded to have more extreme wind and other meteorological characteristics the standard hurricane was determined by the us weather service two months later in september 1965 hurricane betsy category 3 hurricane struck louisianas coast causing damage in new orleans congress authorized construction of the lake pontchartrain project in the flood control act of 1965 enacted in october 1965 modifications to the authorization have been made in subsequent legislation since that original design there have been two major developments in the project relevant to current investigations into the floodwall failures 1 the shift from the barriers at the inlets to lake pontchartrain to higher levees along the lake and 2 the shift from floodgates at the mouth of the citys stormwater outfall canals that drain into lake pontchartrain to higher floodwalls along the length of the canals these two decisions are discussed below choosing higher levees over inlet barriers the original july 1965 lake pontchartrain project design consisted of the barrier plan for constructing inlet barriers at lake pontchartrains three main tidal entrances as well as levees and floodwalls for surge protection the barriers generally would remain open and allow for navigation and would close during coastal storms to reduce storm surges from entering the lake8 based on updated weather data and experience learned during the citys flooding in september 1965 by hurricane betsy changes in the project were sought before construction began for almost 2 decades technical issues 6 the corps was responsible for most but not all of the construction of the lake pontchartrain project the lake pontchartrain project often was built atop existing levees constructed by locals or as part of earlier federal projects 7 most corps storm damage reduction construction projects are costshared 65 federal and 35 nonfederal operation and maintenance of these projects generally is 100 non federal responsibility 8 us congress house lake pontchartrain and vicinity louisiana h doc 231 gpo july 6 1965 the three barriers in the barrier plan were the seabrook lock for navigation and flood protection menteur pass gates for navigation and flood protection and rigolets floodgates and navigation lock the barrier plan also would have included higher levees along the northwestern edge of lake borgne as part of the inlet controls to lake pontchartrain crs6 environmental concerns legal challenges and local opposition to various components slowed construction the design that the corps eventually chose was the highlevel plan which consists of higher levees and floodwalls instead of the originally planned inlet barriers and lower levees and floodwalls figure 2 shows the existing hurricane protection infrastructure as well as the elements of the barrier plan that were rejected in favor of higher levees and floodwalls the change from the barrier plan to the highlevel plan was approved by the corps chief of engineers in february 1985 both the barrier and the highlevel plans were designed to protect from the rough equivalent of fastmoving category 3 hurricane9 the chiefs decision to adopt the highlevel plan was based on 1984 project reevaluation study conducted by the agency in response to 1977 court injunction on the construction of inlet barriers until an adequate environmental impact statement pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 pl 91190 was completed10 the reevaluation study recommended the change because the high level plan has greater net benefits is less damaging to the environment and is more acceptable to the public than the barrier plan11 9 corps lake pontchartrain louisiana and vicinity hurricane protection project reevlauation study new orleans july 1984 hereafter cited as corps lake pontchartrain louisiana and vicinity hurricane protection project according to the 1984 reevaluation study the design storm for protection bordering lake pontchartrain had return frequency of approximately 300 years the return frequency of the design critical to other project areas such as inner harbor and new orleans east bank levees was approximately 200 years 10 for more information on the injunction see crs report rl33104 nepa

floodgates source national oceanic and atmospheric administration federal emergency management agency us army corps of engineers prepared by the congressional cartography program geography and map division library of congress 2005 choosing improved canal levees and floodwalls over floodgates to drain the city of stormwater ie accumulated rainfall the city pumps water into three outfall canals the 17th street canal the orleans avenue canal and the london avenue canal that flow into lake pontchartrain the pumps are located at the southern ends of the canals away from the lake to protect the city from rising water in lake pontchartrain during hurricanes levees were built along the length of the canals the levees along the outfall canals were considered adequate when the corps developed the original design for the lake pontchartrain project that was sent to congress in july 1965 subsequent to the us weather bureaus adoption of more severe standard hurricane for the region the corps determined that the levees along the outfall canals were inadequate in their height and stability to protect the city from the standard hurricane the corps eventually integrated hurricane storm protection for the canals into its lake pontchartrain project the corps considered improved canal protection necessary regardless of the selection of the barrier or highlevel plan the two basic canal options evaluated were butterfly floodgates at the mouths of the outfall canals that would close when water levels in lake pontchartrain exceeded levels in the canals known as fronting protection and crs8 higher and stronger levees and floodwalls along the canals known as parallel protection the orleans levee district and the sewerage and water board of new orleans favored parallel protection over floodgates they were concerned that the operation of the butterfly floodgates would reduce the ability to pump stormwater out of the city during storms the corps analyzed the options and recommended parallel protection for the 17th street canal12 in contrast the corps recommended butterfly floodgates for the orleans and london avenue canals the corps concluded that the butterfly floodgate plan for the london avenue canal fully satisfies the projects mandate to provide protection against the hurricane generated tidal surges and yet provides the maximum latitude for operation of local interest interior drainage ie stormwater removal the butterfly control valve plan has been shown to be the least costly fully responsive plan when compared to the parallel protection plan it is approximately three times less costly13 the conclusion for the orleans avenue canal was similar the corps found the butterfly gates to fully satisfy the project purpose of hurricane storm surge protection and to be onefifth the cost of parallel protection14 rather than having the corps proceed with construction of the butterfly floodgates the orleans levee district decided to construct on its own most elements of the parallel protection on the orleans and london avenue canals this local construction was designed in accordance with corps criteria so that the parallel protection would be incorporated into the larger lake pontchartrain project figure 2 shows the existing hurricane protection infrastructure as well as the canal floodgates that were rejected in favor of higher canal levees and flood walls the corps recommended that the federal costshare contribution for the parallel protection of the two canals be capped at 70 of the lesscostly butterfly floodgates design the lake pontchartrain project was authorized in 1965 based on construction cost share of 70 federal 30 nonfederal see the appendix for 40 year history of the federal construction funding in hrept 101966 the conference report for the water resources development act wrda of 1990 pl 101640 congress directed the corps to consider favorably parallel protection for the two canals and for the federal government to bear part of the costs but did not specify 12 corps lake pontchartrain high level plan design memorandum 20 17th st outfall canal new orleans march 1990 13 corps lake pontchartrain high

authorized and directed to provide parallel hurricane protection along the entire lengths of the outfall canals and other pertinent work necessary to complete an entire parallel protection system to be cost shared as an authorized project feature the federal cost participation in which shall be 70 percent of the total cost of the entire parallel protection system and the local cost participation in which shall be 30 percent of the total cost of such entire parallel protection system current issues and conclusion in summary the original project design aimed to control storm surge flowing into water bodies around downtown new orleans using inlet barriers and canal floodgates in combination with levees the constructed project however attempted to reduce the citys flooding from water bodies affected by hurricane storm surge and wind through higher levees and floodwalls the corps decision to recommend higher levees instead of inlet barriers was shaped by multiple factors including environmental litigation project economics and local preferences the corps preferred floodgates to floodwalls along the orleans avenue and london avenue canals the decision to not build floodgates and instead build floodwalls along the canals was made by the local project sponsors the original design and the final design were intended to provide the same level of protection ie protection from the rough equivalent of category 3 storm surge hurricane katrinas storm surge overtopped and breached new orleans hurricane protection system in addition to causing extensive flood in downtown new orleans the floodwall failures decreased confidence in the reliability of the existing hurricane infrastructure to protect the city from category 3 and lesssevere hurricanes confidence in both the reliability of hurricane infrastructure and the level of protection provided by natural and constructed hurricane protection is factor shaping nearterm and longterm investment decisions as residents and businesses decide whether and how to rebuild for an analysis of wetlands restoration opportunities see crs report rs22276 hurricanes katrina and rita and the coastal louisiana ecosystem restoration by jeffrey zinn in the nearterm many are concerned with the level of protection that will be available at the start of the 2006 hurricane season by june 2006 the corps expects to have completed its repairs of the existing infrastructure however the findings from the corps investigation into the causes of the floodwall failures are not anticipated until june 2006 raising the question of whether the agency will be able to respond to the findings and 15 the report directed the corps to treat the outfall canals as part of the overall hurricane protection project and to favorably consider plan that raises the levees along the entire lengths of the london avenue and orleans avenue canals to grades sufficient to confine standard project hurricane with costs borne by both federal and local assuring authorities crs10 improve the floodwalls reliability when repairing the damaged levees and floodwalls for the 2006 hurricane season in june 200616 concerns about levee and floodwall reliability are compounded by concerns about the level of protection provided by the existing infrastructure given new orleans increasing vulnerability to hurricane storm surge land in the city has subsided barrier islands and wetlands have been disappearing17 and sea levels have risen these factors have raised concerns about the ability of the citys infrastructure to provide category 3 protection according to the project justification sheet included in the administrations corps fy2006 budget request the project was initially designed in the 1960s and reanalysis was performed for part of the project in the mid1980s continuing coastal land loss and settlement of land in the project may have impacted the ability of the project to withstand the design storm18 the challenge of protecting new orleans could become even greater according to some scientists higher sea surface temperatures may result in increased hurricane intensity19 climate change concerns and other factors have raised questions about whether both estimates of the likelihood of hurricanes of various strengths and past infrastructure investment decisions based on these estimates need to be reevaluated hurricane katrina has resulted in some questioning why category 4 or 5 hurricane protection system was not in place for new orleans and whether it should be part of the rebuilding effort the corps currently only has congressional authorization for category 3 system additional congressional authorization would be necessary to build more protective system discussions of category 4 or 5 protection for the city often include the extent to which coastal wetlands restoration may play role in reducing the citys vulnerability to storm surge and whether some of the regional navigation improvements may increase storm surge vulnerability these discussions raise broader policy issues related to the appropriate level of investment to protect against low probabilityhigh consequences events to protect against loss of life and economic disruption and whether structural storm and flood control measures provide false sense of security in vulnerable areas like new orleans the corps cost estimates are 16 billion to return coastal louisianas federal levees and floodwalls to prekatrina conditions by june 2006 and an 16 the corps has indicated that the agencys team working on the investigation will be communicating interim results to the repair team 17 for information on coastal wetlands loss see crs report rl32673 coastal louisiana attempting to restore an ecosystem by

estimated the cost of category 5 protection and wetlands restoration for all of coastal louisiana as high as 32 billion most local stakeholders argue for the inclusion of coastal wetlands restoration in any plan to improve hurricane protection neither consensus nor proposed plans on how to improve hurricane protection for new orleans or costal louisiana in the aftermath of hurricane katrina have emerged discussions continue about the advantages and disadvantages of additional infrastructure compared to other policy options such as protection and restoration of wetlands that attenuate storm surges buyouts of structures on the most floodprone lands floodproofing structures and improvements to the flood insurance program for discussion of managing flood risks see crs report rl33129 flood risk management federal role in infrastructure by nicole t carter understanding why the hurricane protection system failed in new orleans is essential to moving beyond simply making repairs to identifying and reducing vulnerabilities in the system addressing coastal wetlands loss and rebuilding the city nonetheless the corps is having to proceed with available information in order to perform repairs to the failed floodwalls and other breaches to meet the june 2006 deadline which marks the start of the hurricane season consequently congressional oversight of new orleans hurricane protection is likely to continue as the nation grapples with decisions on what type and level of hurricane protection to provide new orleans and other coastal areas around the nation and who should bear responsibility and costs for protection in coastal floodplain and other hazardprone areas crs12 appendix lake pontchartrain project federal funding 19652006 table 1 provides the federal funding history for the constructions of the lake pontchartrain project this information was provided to crs by the army corps of engineers table 1 does not include project funding by nonfederal project sponsors which are responsible for 30 of construction expenses and 100 of maintenance costs the initial work allowance column represents the final enacted amount this amount differs from the amount shown for the lake pontchartrain line item in appropriations conference reports due to rescissions and other reductions made by congress the corps has some authority to reprogram funds across construction projects during the fiscal year the year end work allowance represents the initial work allowance and any reprogrammings that occurred which are shown in the transferred funds column negative in the transferred funds column indicates funds were reprogrammed away from the lake pontchartrain project during the fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year 1994 budget justification the corps stopped scheduling the orleans avenue and london avenue components of the lake pontchartrain project as part of its annual budget request as shown in table 1 congress provided more than requested for the lake pontchartrain project by the administration some of these funds may have been used to construct parallel protection for orleans avenue and london avenue canals however crs was not able to determine the federal funding level for the orleans avenue and london avenue parallel protection based on currently available information when hurricane katrina hit the floodwalls along all three canals were complete the canal work that remained to be built was the floodproofing of bridges that is the extension of floodwall across bridge to connect with floodwall on the other side and the extension of floodwalls across the front of pumping stations crs13 table 1 lake pontchartrain and vicinity project federal construction funding history in thousands nominal dollars presidents
