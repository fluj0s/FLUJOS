since the possibility of second major war with iraq became apparent in mid 2002 interest and concern about return to the draft have manifested themselves for the first time since the 1991 persian gulf war as was the case in 1991 review of military manpower levels and potential war scenarios suggests that only prolonged war with major military reverses for us forces or new international developments creating the need for substantially larger armed forces would result in military requirement to reins titute the draft virtually all proposed scenarios for war with iraq assume that it would not last long enough result in high enough american casualties or require enough additional forces to necessitate draft the military rationale for resuming the draft to meet the needs of the armed forces for manpower during an iraqi war therefor does not seem to be compelling however there are possible scenarios that might tax the ability of the armed forces to recruit sufficient number of vol unteers one such scenario could combine an iraqi conflict with othe r confrontations eg north korea other scenarios could involve the need for very large peace time deployments of us forces eg the possible occupation of defeated iraq or major demands for domestic deployments based on threatened or actual terrorist activity some of the sociological arguments in favor of c onscription involve different interpretations of the same data others are more ph ilosophical and not related to quantitative analysis or inte rpretation while african americans are present in the enlisted ranks to considerably greater ex tent than their proportion of the american population the hispanic proportion is less ra ther than more than their presence in the american population if uppermiddle cl ass youth appear to be underrepresented in the enlisted ranks they are present in the officer corps throughout american history there has been debate about wh ether compulsory military service is 1 civic responsibility and displa of patriotism not subject to individual whim as to whether it is performed or not or 2 violation of individual liberties that if implemented at all should only be used in times of grave emergency legal authority for the involuntary i nduction of men into the armed forces expired on july 1 1973 new legislation w ould be required to reinstate an active draft currently the selective service sy stem operates on standby status young men are required to register with the system within 30 days before or after their 18th birthday if the draft were to be reac tivated young men age 18

16 2001 11the military draft and possible war with iraq introduction since the possibility of usled military action against iraq began increasing in late 2001 there has been inte rest and concern about whet her such conflict would require the united states to resume conscription1 this concern has been heightened since roughly mid2002 as president bush has repeatedly stated that if iraq did not comply with various united nations resolutions and inspection activities dealing with its weapons of mass destruc tion and other activities deemed to be threat to international peace and security and us national inte rests military action would be required to ssure that compliance2 there have been indications that the bush administration has any intention of deviating from the national policy of volunteer recruiting which has been in effect since the end of 1972 furthermore alt hough there have been occasional calls by analysts commentators and members of congress for resumption of conscription largely on grounds of per ceived social equity3 there does not appear to be broad based public support for the enactment of legislation that woul d reinstitute draft authority public opinion polls indicate that in relation to the war against terrorism americans would be very supportive of c onscription but that draft for other purposes or other wars would f ace more opposition for instance an investors business dailychristian science monitor poll taken in midoctober 2002 asked if the united states finds itself at war and needing many more activeduty personnel for the armed forces would you preferthe rees tablishment of the draft or only voluntary recruitment for the military only 26 of respondents preferre d draft while 69 preferred to stick with volunteer recru iting

resuming the draft that have been cited independent of military requirements and itemiz the current status of the draft and action required for its reinstatement possible military rationales for resuming draft most scenarios for war with iraq assu that it would not last long enough result in high enough american casualties or require appreciab additional forces so as to require draft despite these assessments there has been some concern in some quarters about the possible military need to resume conscription from military manpower perspective dr aft could be required for one or both of the following reasons 1 an inability to secure sufficient voluntary enlistments to replace casualties sustained in future military operations andor 2 need to increase the size of the armed forces be yond that which could be achieved through voluntary recruiting most experts currently believe that it is unlikely that either of these eventualities will come to pass as the direct result of any war with iraq sources of casualty replacements almost all casualties in nonnuclear wa r involving all military services are likely to occur in the ground combat components of the army and marine corps casualties can be replaced from several sources before possible return to draft these sources include the ongoing output of army and ma rine volunteer male enlistees from recruit training centers the ground combat arms of the army and marine corps remain allmale organizations personnel from army and marine units still in the united states both active force units and reserve units called to active duty and members of the individual read reserve irr of the army and marine corps these sources would appear ample to meet the needs of any future war with iraq for replacements ongoing recruiting of volunteers regular recruitin g activities of the services would of course continue to operate during the period immediately preceding and during war the prospect of war or its actual existence would dissuade some potential recruits from enlisting and bring others forth in greater numbers recent experience illustrates these conflicted views during the period septembernovember 1990 which were the firs t three complete months of operation desert shieldthe military buildup in the persian gulf which preceded the actual hostilities of early 1991recru iting suffered considerab ly enlistments

became progressively more likely the actual number and quality of recruits including those who had enlisted earlier under the militarys delayed entry program but actually reported for service later was actually higher than anticipated5 the nations most recent experiences with the effects of war on recruiting therefore is mixed at best and arguably more positive than negative manpower in nondeployed army and marine combat units casualty replacements can be transferred from combat units not deployed to the theater of operations the utility of this depends on how many combat units would remain in the united states during war such stripping of nondeployed units naturally severely degrades their combat readiness until their ranks are filled with new personnel and the unit trai ned once more to operate as unit it has generally been done only in extreme situations the armys combat force structure is much smaller than it was during the persian gulf war although that of the ma rine corps has remained fairly stable the army deployed seven divisions plus smalle r units equal to twothirds of division and the marine corps two divisions to the 19901991 war6 six army divisions and one marine division remained in the tinental united states alaska hawaii and okinawa two divisions were kept in eur ope to cope with possible soviet threat which in 19901991 was rapidly declining but still extant and one remained in korea which was judged to face more likely threat than europe7 it is not known of course how many divi sions would be deployed to fight iraq in any future operation or how long such conflict could take many more specific estimates were offered in dvance of the 1991 gulf war however some estimates are possible virtually all agree that smaller force than that of

nine ma rine infantry battalions see polmar norman the naval institute guide to the ships and aircraft of the us fleet seventeenth edition annapolis md naval institute press 2001 45be needed one reason cited is the unrep aired damage done to the iraqi military by the earlier war the second reason commonly cited is the increase in the combat capability of us forces due to new technologically advanced weapon systems improved command and control methods nd doctrine and over decade of us deployments exercises and improvements in base structure in the persian gulf area widelyquoted figure is the possibl deployment of 250000 us troops in the theater of war if this latter number refe rs only to army and marine corps forces actually on the ground in or close to iraq then it might indicate six army and marine divisions8 if on the other hand the 250000 figu re applies to personnel of all services including naval personnel afloat then it implies about four army and marine divisions9 the us active duty ground force structure currently consists of ten active army divisions two in europe one in korea and seven in the united states10 and three active marine divisions11 commitment of the largest force which has been openly discussedfive army and two marine divisionswould thus leav two divisions remaining in the united states and three in overseas deployments it is possible that part or all of the two divisions in europe given that they are longer deployed there to meet soviet military threat could be deployed to the persian gulf as well on the other hand existing us commitments in bosnia and kosovo and the desire to keep post warsaw pact europe as stable as it has become might prevent such deployment thus in worsecase scenario two activ army divisions would remain in the united states during war with iraq from which individual replacements could be drawn such drawdown would however drastically decrease readiness to meet any other contingencies that might threaten us interests around the world such as more threatening north koreahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31682crs5 12ibid 24143 13related to these issues is the extent to which major reserve ground combat unitsat this time army guard infantry and armored brigad and divisionscan be readied for combat before mobilization and how much postmobilization training is required for them to be combat ready the active army and guard communities have had periods of extraordinarily bitter disagreement over these matters for well over century since the beginning of the modern organizations of the active army nd the national guard the most recent period of such acrimony began in late 1990 in the period leading up to the persian gulf war of early 1991 continued throughout the 1990s and did not really begin to abate until around 1998 see crs report 97719 f the army reserve compone nts strength and force structure issues out of print available only from the author robert l goldich crs report 91763 f the

guard co mbat divisions or brigades to active duty and use their personnel as individual replacements there are currently eight guard divisions and 17 deployable guard brigades division consists of three brigades plus some supporting units12 such an action would meet bitter opposition from the national guard community which remembers when virtually all guard divisions were stripped to provide some individual replacements at the beginning of both world wars and the korean war th actions severely eroded the state affiliation and character of the guard divisions however it could be argued that if in fact there is one army where national guard and army reserve soldiers are considered as capable and usable as activ army soldiers that guard and reserve soldiers should be as subject to i ndividual reassignment as any others13 one way in which some of the problems created by stripping units remaining in the continental united states conuswhether active army or guardmight be mitigated

factors pertaining to the iraqi armed forces which led to the onesided victory of the usled coalition in 1991 and to the casualty rate that was so much lower than what virtually all observers and participants expected still appear operative according to recent indepth analysis of arab countries military eff ectiveness over the past halfcentury most of these reported iraqi deficiencies include poor pe rformance by junior fficers leading small units inattention to maintenance and re pair of weapons and equipment lack of honesty and accuracy in conveying info rmation between different echelons of command poor battlefield intelligence nd difficulties in employing technically sophisticated weapons19 on the other hand it has been postulated that iraqis fighting in their homeland as opposed to recentlyconquered country might be much more effective this could be particularly true in the case of elite military organizations such as the republican guard divisions of which ffered the most resistance to us and coalition forces in the 1991 war these have enjoyed much higher standards of living and governmental favoritism than the majority of iraqis status they would not want to lose their role in domestic repression could also leave them more inclined to fight to the death if they knew they would be facing combination of postwar international and iraqi justice as well as the private settling of scores by their previous victims the most pessimistic estimates of us casualties made before the 1991 war were those of the center for defense info rmation cdi which projected possible 10000 dead and 35000 wounded20 by the time the coalition gro und offensive began the ground combat operations of the gulf war as in all other wars being those in which the most casualties

that iraqi employment of nuclear biologi cal andor chemical weapons could result in massive us and coalition casualties however there appears to be consensus that despite iraqs intensive activities to acquire nuclear weapons one way or another they have not done so regard ing chemical or biological weapons informed analysts suggest that the practical difficultie s involved in weaponizing such agents for practical battlefield use their susceptibility to rapid atmospheric dispersal and the wide range of us protective equipment and tactic s would all combine to prevent their use by iraq from resulting in massive american casua lties although they certainly would be able to inflict some harm to us troops in the thea ter of war for summary of these issues see harris elisa d baghdads weapons

finally it should be noted that all of the categories of personnel listed above would all be immediately or almost immediately available for combat duty in the persian gulf draftees by law 10 us c 671 must receive at least 12 weeks of training before being sent overseas to serve on land all of this would suggest therefore that only catastrophic military reverses on scale involving the destru ction of substantial pr oportion of the us forces deployed against iraq andor prolonged c onflict measured in terms of years rather than several months would generate military requirement to reinstitute the draft to obtain casualty replacements both these scenarios seem unlikely27 increasing the size of the active armed forces under different scenarios war with iraq and possible modest increases in force size requirement to quickly increase the size of the active armed forces like the need to provide casualty replacements could be initia lly met much more quickly with other methods than reinstituting draft even if up to 265000 reservists are activated forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31682crs10 28this figure has frequently been quoted as maximum and crs is not aware of any predictions which have suggested that more than the 19901991 total might be called to active duty see for example the typical st atement in schmitt eric buildup leaves us nearly set to start attack new york times december 8 2002 1 which states that the pentagon has plans to mobilize as many as 265000 members of the national guard and reserves roughly as many as for the persia n gulf war in 1991 there is of course military rationale for making possible 2003 mobilization the same size as that which took place in 1991 29estimates derived from data in defense manpower data center military manpower training report for fy2002 march 2002 1721 3337a war with iraq the total number called up for the 1991 war28 the overwhelming majority of the combat forces of the army reserve components and perhaps some of the marine corps reserve would probably not be initially ordered to active duty requirement for major increases in active duty strength could be met much more quickly by activating more reserves than by instituting draft draft would not provide the trained officer s and noncommissioned officers to man units effectively it would only turn out freshlytrained junior enlisted recruits furthermore even the latter would not become available until they had finished their recruit and initial occupational skill training process which could take roughly three to five months for junior enlisted ground combat soldiers and marines29 it seems unlikely that actual hostilities in war with iraq would st that long given the 42day long 1991 war and the fourday ground war at its very nd if therefore the draft were resumed during hostilities or even good many w eeks before hostilities began it is unlikely that drafted recruits would reach the theater of war before the war ended there are scenarios in which even short war with iraq could lead to long term requirement for larger armed forces such increases in the active armed forces might for instance be required for the range of postwar occupational tasks the united states might undertake after presuma bly victorious conflict with iraq in regard to warrelated continge ncies as noted above it w ould appear that only major military reverses or major contingency elsewhere in the world simultaneous with an ongoing war in the persian gulf could generate such requirement there is every indication that such rger forces could up to considerably larger manpower total than at present be maintained by voluntary recruiting alone the active armed forces have since fy 1999 maintained strength of slightly under 14 million personnel however thr oughout the mid and late 1980s force of almost 22 million volunteers was maintained and recruit quality measured by high school graduate status and scores on standardized aptitude test sustained at unprecedented highs were quality standards to be relaxed slightly andor recruiting and compensation budgets increased as neede d it appears possible that force of 23 or 24 million could be maintained as well although some prospective recruits would be disinclined to volunteer during hostilities due to reluctance to be involved in combat others might be more inclined to do so due to the greater degree of excitement patriotism and popular pr estige resulting from involvement in presumably successful war httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31682crs11 30most if not almost all defense manpower

more manpower with whic h to expand the active duty forcewould probably be absent in regard to war with iraq alone without other actual or potential conflict elsewhere however if an iraq war were followed by the need to deploy substantial occupation force in that country and such requirement were combined with the need to deploy substantial additional forces elsewhere the services might have trouble recruiting suffi cient volunteers to establish and maintain the required higher force levels also at some point the costs of recruiting sufficient volunteers might become prohibitive and would counterbalance the increased training and personnel manage ment costs that return to the draft could produce30 official pronouncements are firm in stating that the united states could cope with simultaneous wars with iraq and north koreasecretary of defense rumsfeld stated on december 23 2002 that he had r eason to believe that north korea feels emboldened because of the worlds interest in iraq if they do it would be mistake we are perfectly capable of doing that which is necessary31 nonetheless some analysts believe that us forces are currently either too small to win two such conflicts without prolonged period of in itial stalemate or possibly the threat of defeat which could lower the thres hold for the use of nuclear weapons32 it should be noted that historically many wars have tended to last much longer than predicted either by national political leadership or the military leaders whose job it is to plan for and conduct the war few americans believed when us ground combat forces landed in then south vi etnam in february1965 that the war would not end for the united states until march 1973 many predicted in the decade or so preceding the outbreak of world war i in august 1914 that recent technological and organizational advances in warfare would make the conflict short sharp and decisive rather than the four and onehalf year grinding struggle that it became more recently it is doubtful that saddam hu ssein or his generalslet alone the population of iraqthought that when the ir aqis invaded iran in september 1980 that fighting would continue until

declaration of war always remember however sure you are that you can easily win that there would not be war if the other man did not think he also had chance33 social rationales for and against resuming draft variety of social and philosophical rati onales have been adva nced in favor of or opposed to resuming the draft many of these apply in peacetime as well as war and many because they involve value j udgments are not subject to proof or refutation two basic social arguments in favor of resuming draft for the current war are generally advanced 1 draft would insure equitable term itself subject to broad range of interpretations soci oeconomic racial and ethnic representation in the armed forces and 2 it would reinforce the concept of citizenship as entailing responsibilities as well as rights social representati on arguments in favor of draft in time of war some proponents of re turning to conscription argue it is important that the discriminatedagainst members of american society do not bear more than their fair share of fighting and casualties and that those who have benefitted the most do not bear less than their fair share furthermore they frequently suggest that the mixing of various socioeconomic classes races ethnic groups and nationalities that would occu r with broadlybased draft would contribute to the social cohesion of the nation those concerned with social representa tion have tended to concentrate on two specific factors the first is the greater proportional representation of african americans in the military compared to their proportion in the overall american population as of fy2000 blacks comprised 20 of nonprior service enlistees and 22 of the active duty enlisted force as compared to 1214 of the civilians of comparable ages34 the second is perceived sser representation of children of affluent uppermiddleclass nd upper class households in the enlisted ranks of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31682crs13 35office of the

socioeconomic status questions were not included in the fy2000 survey 36ibid viii 37population representation fy2000 b36 in fy1989 these percentages were 4 and 8 respectively indicating that the presence of hispanics in the armed forces had become more representative when compared with the total population over the ensuing 11 years see office of the assistant secretary of defense force management policy population representation in the military servicesfy1989 july 199066 38population representation fy2000 v 39women of course would also suffer far fewer casualties because they are not allowed to serve in ground combat units and certain specia l operations units but these restrictions are separate issue armed forces dod statistics also appear to bear out this assertion although the difference is arguably not dramatic in fy1999 about 24 of the employed fathers of new enlisted recruits were likely to be in executive managerial administrative or professional occupations but almost 34 of all civilian youth ages 1421 had fathers in those occupations the figures for mothers of new recruits were almost 29 in the four highstatus occupational cat egories compared to 33 of the mothers of the 1421 civilian youth cohorta much smaller difference than for fathers35 more elaborate and technical index of socioeconomic status indicates that enlisted accessions come from all socioeconomic leve ls however there is tendency for accessions to come from families in the lower threequarters of the status distribution these differenc are expressed in the occupations of parents of accessions as well as discrepancies in education and home ownership36 social representation arguments in opposition to draft those who oppose returning to draft simply cite other arguments and statistics they note for instance that those demographic groups most often cited in analyses of social representation are not uniformly overrepresented in the armed forces as compared to their presen ce in the overall populationand thus are not threatened with disproportionately high casualties in time of war for instance hispanics are represented in the military to lesser extent than their proportion in the total population constituting only 9 of enlisted personnel in fy2000 compared to 13 of the total american population in the comparable age group 184437 women are much less represented cons tituting 50 of the population and about 15 of enlisted personnel38 hispanics and women therefore by being underrepresented in the armed forces rath er than overrepresented would therefore arguably benefit by their differing pr oportions as presumably they would suffer casualties below their percenta ge in the overall population39 another example of how todays vol unteer force may be more broadly representative of the american populati on than some volunteer force opponents suggest involves the inclusion of officers in an analysis of the issue members of the middle and upper socioeconomic classe s whose military functions are morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31682crs14 40the dod population representation series does not contain socioeconomic status data on officers

numbers of americ ans not including any ground combat troops continuedanalogous to civilian leadership positions are present in the officer corps40 thus it is argued mitigating against their pr oportional absence from the enlisted force finally some point out that truly socia lly representative force should have fewer blacks and more whites and many more lessqualified individuals than the armed forces currently accept others have suggest ed that logical outcome of this latter belief could be the imposition of racial quotas penalizing capable minority youth who may enlist due to lack of perceive d civilian opportunities or forcing the military to turn away highquality recruits to make room for less capable ones another statistic cited to rebut the ch arge of minority overrepresentation deals with the proportion of minorities in combat units contrary to many impressions held by the general population the proportion of africanamericans in enlisted combat occupational specialties is ss than that of whites in fy2000 18 of white service members served in infantry gun crews and seamanship specialties but only 12 of africanamericans served in these specialties41 within the officer corps in fy2000 39 of white officers served in tactical operationsie command and staff in combat branches and unitswhile 25 of black officers served in tactical operations42 all of these discussions clearly rais the issue about what if any kinds of representativeness are more significant than others and why citizenship rights and responsibilities there has also been since colonial time s debate about whether on the one hand military service is res ponsibility of citizenship not subject to individual whim as to whether it is performed or not or on the other if compelling people to perform military service if they do not wish to is in fact is violation of individual liberties which strikes at the heart of american democratic principles there are of course various middle grounds between thes two extremes one which arguably represents the national consensus today as it has evolved since the founding of the republic is that compulsory service may be acceptable in time of major war if sufficient military manpower cannot be obtai ned through voluntary recruiting but it is not acceptable in peacetime american hi story contains only 12 years in which true peacetime draft operatedbetween 1953 when the korean war ended and 1965 when the vietnam war escalated into major conflict involving large numbers of american ground troops however the fi

were engaged from 1961 on 44the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of maleonly registration and by inference conscription in rostker v goldberg 453 us 57 1981 however central to the courts decision was the assumption that the primar purpose of draft would be to produce combat troops and because women are ex cluded from combat by statute or military policy men and women are simply not sim ilarly situated for purposes of draft or registration for draft however since th courts decision statut barring women from service in combat naval vessels or aircraft have been repealed and women are currently barredand by administrative regulation not statuteonly from certain ground combat and special operations forces units and occupational specialties and from submarines it might be then that allmale registration and drafting would be viewed as some as more vulnerable to constitutional challenge 4550 usc app 453 requires only men to register with the system and 50 usc app 454 makes certain registrants after appropriate classification liable for military service these are only sampling of some of the main sociological arguments made for and against return to conscription in anticipation of or during possible war against iraq there are host of other argu ments such as who should serve if there were draft that would follow if the fundamental decision for conscription was made the debate involves fundamental values and assu mptions and what aspects of human existence one considers important and morally significant as such they are virtually impossible to bridge if held strongly it remains only to note that if the draft were resumed shortly before or after an outbreak of actual hostilities it seems unlikely that any draftees would actually be committed to battle before war against iraq ended current status of the draft and action required for its reinstatement legal authority for the involuntary i nduction of men into the armed forces expired on july 1 1973

draft be reinstated by the congress the selective service system is currently required to begin delivering inductees to the armed fo rces within 193 daysover six monthsafter draft begins operating46 this is major change from the systems stated capability as it existed during the persian gulf war of 1991 at that time the system could fully mobilize and begin inducting men in th ree days deliver the first draftees to dod within 13 days and deliver 100000 draftees within 30 days after receiving the authority to do so47 as most of the structure that existed in 1991 is still extant it is possible that the system could deliver inductees much more quickly than the 193 day requirement indicates if draft were activated indeed the speed with which the world war i and world war ii draft mechanisms were created suggests that even without standby selective service system an actual draft c ould be operating long before 193 days had passed48 on the other hand it may be that the current system could in fact deliver i nductees well before the 193rd day but that dod has stated it simply has military requirements for an earlier delivery if the existing standby mechanism were to be reactivated young men age 18 through 26 would be subject to induction up to age 35 if deferred when initially called current plans call for those men rning 20 in the current year to be called first
