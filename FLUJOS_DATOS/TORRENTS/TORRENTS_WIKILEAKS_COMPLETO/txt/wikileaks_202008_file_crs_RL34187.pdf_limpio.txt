introduction and overview this report provides congress with offi cial unclassified background data from us government sources on transfers of c onventional arms to veloping nations by major suppliers for the period 1999 throug h 2006 it also includes some data on worldwide supplier transactions it updates and revise s crs report rl33696 conventional arms transfers to developing nations 19982005 the data in this report provide means for congress to identify existing supplierpurchaser relationshi ps in conventional weapons acquisitions use of these data can assist congress in its oversight ro of assessing whether the current nature of the international weapons trade affects us national in terests for most of recent american history maintaining regional stability and ensuring the security of us allies and friendly nations th roughout the world have been important elements of us foreign policy knowing the degree to which individual arms suppliers are making arms transfers to individual nations or regions provides congress with context for evaluating policy questions it ma confront such policy questions may include for example whethe r or not to support specific us arms sales to given countries or regions or to support or oppos such arms transfers by other nations the data in this report may also assist congress in evaluating whether multilateral arms control arrangements or other us foreign policy initiatives are being supported or undermined by the actions of arms suppliers the principal focus of this report is the level of arms transf ers by major weapons suppliers to nations in the developing wo rld where most of the potential for the outbreak of regional military c onflicts currently exists for decades during the height of the cold war providing conventiona l weapons to friendly states was an instrument of foreign policy utilized by the united states and its allies this was equally true for the soviet union and its allies the underlying rationale for us arms transfer policy then was to help ensure that friendly states were not placed at risk through military disadvantage created by arms transfers by the soviet union or its allies the data in this report illustrate how global patte rns of conventional arms transfers have changed in the postcold war and postpersian gulf war years relationships between arms s uppliers and recipients conti nue to evolve in response to changing political military and economic circumstances where before the principal motivation for arms sales by fore ign suppliers might have been to support foreign policy objective today that mo tivation may be base d as much on economic considerations as those of fore ign or national security policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs2 in this context the developing worl d continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons supp liers during the period of this report 19992006 conventional arms tr ansfer agreements which represent orders for future delivery to developing nations comprised 664 of the value of all international arms transfer agreements the portion of agreements with developing countries constitute d 657 of all agreements globally from 20032006 in 2006 arms transfer agreements with developing countries accounted for 715 of the value of all such agreements globally deliveries of conventional ar ms to developing nations from 20032006 constituted 733 of all internationa l arms deliveries in 2006 arms deliveries to devel oping nations constituted 736 of the value of all such arms deliveries worldwide the data in this new report supersede all data published in previous editions since these new data for 19992006 reflect potentially significant updates to and revisions in the underlying data bases utilized for this report only the data in this most recent edition should be used the data are expressed in us dollars for the calendar years indicated and adjusted for infl ation see box notes on page 3 us commercially licensed arms export delivery values are excluded see box note on page 20 also excluded are arms transf ers by any supplier to subnational groups the definition of developing nations as used in this report and the specific classes of items included in its values totals ar found in box notes on page 3 the reports table of contents provides detailed listing and description of the various data tables and summaries which can guide the reader to specific items of interest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs3 calendar year data used all arms transfer and arms delivery data in this report are for the calendar year or calendar year period given this applies to us and foreign data alike united states government departments and agencies publish data on us arms transfers and deliveries but ge nerally use the united states fiscal year as the computational time period for these data as consequence there are likely to be distinct differences noted in those publishe d totals using fiscal year basis and those provided in this report wh ich use calendar year basis details on data used are outlined in footnotes at the bottom of tables 1 2 8 and 9 arms transfer values the values of arms transfer agreements or deliveries in this report refer to the total values of conventi onal arms orders or deliv eries as the case may be which include all categories of wea pons and ammunition military spare parts military construction military assistance and training programs and all associated services definition of developing nations and regions as used in this report the developi ng nations category includes all countries except the united states russia european nations canada ja pan australia and new zealand listing of countries located in the regions defined for the purpose of this analysis asia near east latin america and africa is provided at the end of the report constant 2006 dollars throughout this report values of arms tr ansfer agreements and values of arms deliveries for all suppliers are expressed in us dollars values for any given year generally reflect the exchange rates that prevailed during that specific year the report converts these dollar amounts curre nt dollars into constant 2006 dollars although this helps to eliminate the distor ting effects of us inflation to permit more accurate comparison of various dollar levels over time the effects of fluctuating exchange rate s are not neutralized the deflators used for the constant dollar calculations in this report are those provided by the us department of defense and are set out at the bottom of tables 1a 2a 8a and 9a unless otherwise noted in the report all dollar values are stated in constant terms the exceptions to this rule are all regional data tables that are composed of fouryear aggregate do llar totals 19992002 and 20032006 these tables are expressed in current dollar terms and where tables rank leading arms suppliers to developing nations or leadin g developing nation recipients using four year aggregate dollar totals these values are expressed in current dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs4 major findings general trends in arms transfers worldwide the value of all arms transfer agreem ents worldwide to both developed and developing nations in 2006 was 403 b illion this was decrease in arms agreements values over 2005 decline of nearly 13 chart 1 table 8a in 2006 the united states led in arms transfer agreements worldwide making agreements valued at 169 billion 419 of all such agreementsup from 135 billion in 2005 russia ranked second with 87

billion in 2005 the united states russia and the united kingdom collectively made agreements in 2006 valued at 287 billion 712 of all international arms transfer agreements made by all suppliers figure 1 tables 8a 8b and 8d for the period 20032006 the total value of all internationa l arms transfer agreements 160 billion was higher than the worldwide value during 19992002 1567 billion an increase of 21 during the period 19992002 developing world nations accounted for 671 of the valu of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide during 20032006 developing wo rld nations accounted for 657 of all arms transfer agreements made globally in 2006 developing nations accounted for 715 of all arms transfer ag reements made worldwide figure 1 table 8a in 2006 the united states ranked first in the value of all arms deliveries worldwide making 14 billion in such deliveries or 519 this is the eighth year in row that the united states has led in global arms deliveries russia ranked second in worldwide arms deliveries in 2006 making 58 billion in such deliveries the united kingdom ranked third in 2006 making 33 billion in such deliveries these top three suppliers of arms in 2006 collectively delivered nearly 231 billion 856 of all arms delivered worldwide by all suppliers in that year figure 2 tables 9a 9b and 9d the value of all interna tional arms deliveries in 2006 was 27 billion this is increase in the total value of arms deliveries from the previous year rise from 262 billion but still the second lowest deliveries total for the 19992006 period moreover the total value of such ar ms deliveries worldwide in 20032006 1207 billion was substantially lower in the va lue of arms deliveries by all suppliers worldwide from 19992002 1448 billion decline of over 24 billion figure 2tables 9a and 9b charts 7 and 8 developing nations from 20032006 accounted for 733 of the value of all international arms deliver ies in the earlier peri od 19992002 developing nations accounted for 717 of the value of all arms deliveries worldwide in 2006 developing nations collectively accounted fo r 736 of the value of all international arms deliveries figure 2 tables 2a 9a and 9b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs5 worldwide weapons orders declined in 2006 the total of 403 billion fell from 463 billion in 2005 decline of nearly 13 global arms agreement values for the years other than 2006 ranged from 463 billion in 2005 to 317 billion in 2003 of the major arms orders secured in 2006 most were made by the traditional major suppliers in some instances these orders represented significant new acquisitions by the purchasing country in others they reflected the continuation of longer term weapons acquisition program decline in new weapons sales can also be explained in part by the practical need for some purchasing nations to abso rb and integrate major weapons systems they have already purchased into their for ce structures the need to do this may at the same time increase the number of arms c ontracts related to tr aining and support services even as it reduces the number of large and costly orders for new military equipment an intensely competitive weapons mark etplace continues to lead several producing countries to focus sales effort s on prospective clients in nations and regions where individual suppliers have had competitive advantages resulting from well established military support relationships within eu rope arms sales to new nato member nations to support their military modernizati on programs have created new business for arms suppliers while allowing these nato states to sell some of their older generation military equipment in refurbished form to other less developed countries while there are i nherent limitations on these european sales due to the smaller defense budgets of ma ny of the purchasing countries creative seller financing options as well as th use of coassembly coproduction and countertrade agreements to offset costs to the buyers have continue d to facilitate new arms agreements the united states and european countries or consortia seem likely to compete vigorously for prospective arms contracts within the european region in the foreseeable future such sales seem particularly important to european suppliers as they can potentially compen sate in part for lost weapons deals elsewhere in the developing world that result from reduced demand for new weapons efforts also continue among developed nations to protect important elements of their national military i ndustrial bases by limiting arms purchases from other developed nations neverthe less several key arms supp liers have placed additional emphasis on joint production of various w eapons systems with other developed nations as more effective way to preserve domestic weapons production capability while sharing the costs of new w eapons development the consolidation of certain sectors of the domestic defe nse industries of ke weapons producing nations continues in the face of intense foreign competition at the same time some supplying nations have chosen to manufact ure items for niche weapons categories where their specialized production capabilities gi ve them important advantages in the evolving international arms marketplace some developing nations ve reduced their weapons purchases in recent years primarily due to their limited financial resources to pay for such equipment other prospective arms purchasers in the developing world with significant financial assets have exercised caution in launching new nd costly weapons procurement programs increases in the price of oil while an advantage for major oil producing states in funding their arms purchases has simu ltaneously caused econo mic difficulties forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs6 many oil consuming states contributing to their decisions to defer or curtail new weapons purchases the state of th world economy has induced number of developing nations to choose to upgra existing weapons systems in their inventories while reducing their purchases of new ones this approach may curtail sales of new w eapons systems fo r time but the weapons upgrade market can be very lucrative for some arms producers and partially mitigate the effect of losing major new sales although overall there appear to be fe wer large weapons purchases being made by developing nations in the near east and in asia when contrasted with arms sales activity over decade ago major purchases continue to be made by select few developing nations in these regions thes purchases have been made principally by china and india in asia and saudi arabia in the near east even though these tendencies are subject to abrupt change ba sed on the strength of either the regional or international economies or the threat ssessments of individual states the strength of individual economies of wi range of nations in the developing world continues to be significant factor in the timing of many of their arms purchasing decisions latin america and to much lesser extent africa are regions where some nations continue to express interest in modernizing important sectors of their military forces some large arms orders by regi onal standards have been placed by few states in these two regions within the last decade but in latin america and africa as with most nations in the developing world nations are constrained in their weapons purchases by their existing financia l resources so long as there is limited availability of sellersupplie d credit and financing for weapons purchases and national budgets for military purchases rema in relatively low it seems likely that major arms sales to these two regions of the developing world will remain sporadic in nature general trends in arms transfers to developing nations the value of all arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2006 was nearly 288 billion decrease from the 318 billion total in 2005 chart 1 figure 1table 1a in 2006 the value of all arms deliveries to developing nations 199 billion was lower than the value of 2005 deliveries over 203 billion and the lowest total for the 19992006 period charts 7 and 8 figure 2 table 2a recently from 20032006 the united states and russia have dominated the arms market in the developing world th united states ranked first for 3 out of 4 years during this period while russia ranked second for 3 out of 4 of these years in the value of arms transfer agreements from 20032006 the united states made 341 billion in arms transfer agreements w ith developing nati ons 324 of all such agreements russia the second leadin g supplier during this period made 258 billion in arms transfer agreements or 245 the united kingdom the third leading supplier from 20032006 made 105 billion or 10 of all such agreements with developing nations during these years in the earlier period 19992002 the united states ranked first with 454 billion in arms transfer agreements with developing nations or 431 russia made 254 billion in arms transfer agreements during this period or 241 france made 55 billion in agreements or 52 table 1a httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs7 from 19992006 most arms transfers to developing nations were made by two to three major suppliers in any given year the united states has ranked first among these suppliers for seven of the last eigh t years during this period falling to third place in 2005 russia has been continuing strong competitor for the lead in arms transfer agreements with developing nations ranking second every year from 1999 through 2004 and first in 2005 despite its lack of the larger tr aditional client base for armaments held by the united states and the major west european suppliers russias recent successes in concluding ne w arms orders suggests that russia is likely to continue to be for the short term at least significant leader in arms agreements with developing nations ru ssias most significant high value arms transfer agreements continue to be w ith china and india russia has had some success in concluding arms agreements with clients beyond its pr incipal two russia continues to seek to expand its prospect s in north africa the middle east and southeast asia most recently russia has increased sales efforts in latin america despite having essentially ab andoned major arms sales efforts there following the cold wars end venezuela has become significant ne w arms client gained by russia in this region the russian government has further stated that it has adopted more flexible payment arrangements for its prospectiv customers in the developing world including willingness in specific cases to forgive outstanding debts owed to it by prospective client in order to secure new arms purchases furthermore russia continues its efforts to nhance the quality of its follo won support services to make russian products more attrac tive and competitive and to assure its potential clients that it can effectively provide timely service for weapons systems it exports major west european arms suppliers such as france and the united kingdom have concluded large orders w ith developing countries over the last eight years based on either longterm supply relationships or their having specialized weapons systems they can readily provide germany has been key source of naval systems for developing nations despite increased competition between the united states and the other major arms suppliers the us appears likely to hold its position as the principal supplier to key deve loping world nations especi ally those able to afford major new weapons because the united stat has developed ch wide base of arms equipment clients globally it is able to conclude notable number of agreements annually to provide upgrades ordnance and support services for the large variety of weapons systems it has sold to its clients for decades thus even when the us does not conclude major new arms agreements in given year it can still register significant arms agreement values based on transactions in these other categories the wealthier developing countries conti nue as the focus for new arms sales by the principal supplying nations arms tr ansfers to the less affluent developing nations also continue to be constrained by the scarcity of funds in their defense budgets and the unsettled state of the inte rnational economy the overall decline in the level of the arms agreements with developing nations that began in 2001 and continued until 2004 appears to have halted there was rise in arms agreements with the developing world in 2004 and ag ain in 2005 although there was decline in arms agreements with the developing world in 2006 the overall level of arms agreements with such nations from 20042006 has been on the increase httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34187crs8 china other european and noneuropean suppliers such as sweden and israel appear to have increased their participation in the arms trade with the developing world in recent years albeit at much lower levels and with uneven results than those of the major suppliers neverthe less these nonmajor arms suppliers have proven capable on occasion of making arms deals of consequence most of their annual arms transfer agreement values during 19992006 have been comparatively low although larger when they are aggreg ated together as group in various cases they have been successful in selling older generation equipment even while they procure newer weaponry to update their ow n military forces these arms suppliers also are more likely to be sources of small arms and light weapons and associated ordnance rather than routine sellers of major military equipment most of these arms suppliers are not likely to consistently rank with the traditional major suppliers of advanced weaponry in the value of th eir arms agreements and deliveries tables 1a 1f 1g 2a 2f and 2g united states the total value in real terms of united states arms transfer agreements with developing nations rose from 65 billion in 2005 to 103 billion in 2006 the us share of the valu of all such agr eements was 358 in 2006 up from 204 share in 2005 charts 1 3 and 4 figure 1 tables 1a and 1b in 2006 the total value of us arms transfer agreements with developing nations was attributable to couple of major deals with clients in asia particularly with pakistan and in the near east substantial number of smaller valued purchases by wide number of traditional u s arms clients throughout the near east and asia contributed notably to the overall us agreements total the arms agreement total of the united states in 2006 illustrates the continuing us advantage of having well established defense support arrangements with weapons purchasers worldwide based upon the existing variety of us weapons systems their militaries utilize us agreements with all of its clients in 2006 include not only sales of major weapons systems but also the upgrading of systems previously provided the us totals also include agreements for wide variety of spare parts ammunition ordnance training

in current 2006 dollars table 1f russias status as leading supplier of arms to developing nations stems from an increasingly successful effort to overcome the significant economic and political problems associated with the dissolution of the former soviet union the traditional arms clients of the former soviet union were generally less wealthy developing count ries valued as much for their political support in the cold war as fo r their desire for s oviet weaponry many of these sovietera client states received substantial military aid grants and significant discounts on their arms purchases after 1991 russia consistently placed premium on obtaining hard currency for the weapons it sold faced with stiff competition from western arms suppliers in the 1990s nd the early part of this decade russia gradually adapted its selling practices in an effort to regain and sustain an important share of the developing world arms market russian leaders in recent years have made significant efforts to provide more creative financing and payment options for pr ospective arms clients they have also agreed to engage in countertrade offset s debtswapping and in key cases to make significant licensed production agreements in order to sell its weapons the willingness to license production has been central element in several cases involving russias principal arms clients china and india russias efforts to expand its arms customer base have met with mixed results russias arms sales efforts beyond those with china and india have been primarily focused on southeast asia it has had some success in securing arms agreements with malaysia vietnam and indonesia even though recurring fina ncial problems of so clients in this region have hampered significant growth in russian sales there most recently it has concluded major arms deals with venezuela and with algeria elsewhere in the developing world russian military equipmen t is competitive because it ranges from the most basic to the highly advanced and can be less expensive than similar arms available from other major suppliers sale of military aircraft and missiles continues to be significant portion of russias arms exports yet the absence of major new research and development efforts in this and other military equipment areas may jeopardize longterm russian foreign arms sales prospects while military weapons research and development rd programs exist in russia other major arms suppliers in the west are currently well advanced in the process of devel oping and producing weaponry that is much more advanced than that in existing russian rd programs in spite of these potential difficulties russia continues to have important arms development and sales prog rams involving china and india which should

influence events throughout the region these acquisitions continue to be monitored by us policymakers the us policy interest is among other things ensuring that it provides appropriate military equipment to us allies and friendly states in asia to help offset any prospective threat china may pose to such nations while keeping the us military aware of any threat it may face in any confrontation with china2 in 2006 there were especially large chinese arms agreements with ru ssia possibly because the chinese military is focused on absorbing and integrating previous arms purchases from russia into its force structure among the most significant arms tran sfer deals russia made in 2006 was with algeria this package of agreements included the sale of 28 su30mka fighter aircraft 36 mig29smt fighter aircraft 16 yak130 advanced tr aining aircraft 8 battalions of s300 pmu2 sam systems number of pant sirs1 sa22 air defense missile systems and number of t90s main battle tanks the

venezuela for the production of both ak103 assault rifles and the production of 762mm ammunition at cost in excess of 500 million venezuelas populist president hugo chavez has taken hostile approach to relations with the united states in recent years thus his decision to seek advanced military equipment from russia is matter of us concern chavez appears embarked on effort to make venezuela an important military force in latin america and since he has made clear that he plans to obtain add itional advanced weapons systems from russia there is concern that such purchases could stimulate other states in the region to seek comparable weapons systems as count erweight to chavezs military buildup3 china in the 1980s the iraniraq war provided the opportunity for china to become an important supplier of less ex pensive weapons to certain developing nations during that conflict china demonstrated that it was willing to provide arms to both combatants in the war in qua ntity and

2005 during the period of this re port the value of chinas arms transfer agreements with developing nations p eaked in 1999 at 28 billion chinas sales figures that year and in 2005 generally resulted

few nations with significant financia l resources have sought to purchase chinese military equipment during the eight ear period of this report because most chinese weapons for export are less adva

in the foreseeable future its most likely clients are states in asia and africa seeking quantities of small arms and light wea pons rather than major combat systems at the same time china has been an

the restri ctions on missile tran sfers set out in the missile technology control regime mtcr including its pledge not to assist others in building missiles that could deliv er nuclear weapons since china has some military products par ticularly missiles that some developing countries would like to acquire it can present an obstacle to efforts to stem proliferation of advanced missile systems to some areas of the developing world where political and military tensions are significant and where some nations are seeking to develop asymmetric military capabilities4 china among others has been key sour ce of variety of small arms and light weapons transferred to african states lthough the prospects for significant revenue earnings from these arms sales are limited china views such sales as one means of enhancing its status as an international political power and increasing its ability to obtain access to significant natural resources especially oil controlling the sales of small arms and light weapons to regions of conflict in particular to some african nations has been matter of concern to the united states the united nations also has undertaken an examination of this issu in an effort to achieve consensus on path to address it5 major west european suppliers beyond the united states and russia the four major west european arms suppliers france the united kingdom germany and italy are the nations that can supply wide variety of more highly sophisticated weapons to woul dbe purchasers they can serve as alternative sources of armaments that the united states choos not to supply for policy reasons the united kingdom sold major combat fighter ai rcraft to saudi arabia in the mid1980s when the us chose not to sell comparab aircraft for policy reasons these four nato

over the years throug h strong government marketing support for their foreign arms sales as they all can produce both advanced and basic air ground and naval weapons systems the four major west european suppliers have competed successfully for arms sales contr acts with developing nations against both the united states which has tended to sell to several of the same clients and with russia which has sold to nations not traditional customers of either the west europeans or the united states however the demand for us weapons in the global arms marketplace from large established client base has created more difficult environment for individual west eu ropean suppliers to secure large new contracts with developing nations on sustained basis continuing strong demand for us defe nse equipment as well as concern for maintaining their market share of the arms trade has led european union eu member states to adopt new code of conduct for defense procurement practices this code was agreed to on november 21 2005 at the european defense agencys ea steering board meeting curren tly voluntary the eu hopes it will become mandatory and through its mechanisms foster greater competition within the european defense equipment s ector in the awarding of contracts for defense items larger hope is th at by fostering greater intraeuropean cooperation and collaboration in defense cont racting and the resulting programs that the defense industrial bases of i ndividual eu states will be pres erved and the ability of european defense firms to compete for arms sales in the international arms marketplace will be substantially enhanced some european arms suppliers have begun to phase out production of certain types of weapons systems such supplie rs have increasingly engaged in joint production ventures with ot her key european weapons suppliers or even client countries in an effort to sustain major s ectors of their individual defense industrial bases even if substantial portion of the weapons produced are for their own armed forces the eurofighter project is one example the eurocopter is another other european suppliers have also adopted the strategy of cooperating in defense production ventures with the united states such as the joint strike fighter jsf rather than attempting to compete directly thereby meeting their own requirements for advanced combat aircraft while positioning themselves to share in profits resulting from future sales of this new fighter aircraft7 regional arms transfer agreements the markets for arms in regions of the

helping to maintain stability throughout the regions of the developing world thus the us has made and supported arms sales and tr ansfers it has believed woul d advance that goal while discouraging significant sales by other suppliers to states and regions where military threats to nations in the area are minimal other arms suppliers do not necessarily share the us perspective on what constitutes an appropriate arms sale for in some instances the financial benefit of the sale to the supplier trumps other considerations the regional and country specific arms tr ansfer data in this report provide an indication of where various arms suppliers are focusing their attention and who their principal clients are by reviewing these data policymakers can identify potential developments which may be of concern and use this information to assist their review of options they may choose to consider given the circumstances what follows below is review of data on arms transfer agreement activities in the two regions that lead in arms acquisitions the near east and asia this is followed in turn by review of data regarding the leading arms purchasers in the developing world near east8 the principal catalyst for new weapons procurements in the near east region in the last decade was the pe rsian gulf crisis of august 1990february 1991 this crisis culminating in war to expel iraq from kuwait created new demands by key purchasers such as saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates and other members of the gulf coope ration council gcc for variety of advanced weapons systems egypt and is rael continued their modernization and increased their weapons purchases from th united states the gulf states arms purchase demands were not only response to iraqs aggression against kuwait but reflection of concerns regarding perceived threats from potentially hostile iran since the fall of saddam hussein for many the conventional ground threat from iraq has diminished and the perceived threat from iran has increased this has led the gcc states to emphasize acquisition of air and naval defense capabilities over major ground combat systems9 most recently the position of saudi arabia as principal arms purchaser in the persian gulf region has been reest ablished in the period from 19992002 saudi arabias total arms agreements were valued at 4 billion in current dollars

data on weapons categories deliv ered by suppliers do not provide precise indices of the quality andor quantity of the weaponry delivered the history of recent conventional c onflicts suggests that quality ndor sophistication of weapons can offset quantitative advantage further these data do not provide an indication of the relative capabilities of the recipien t nations to use effectively the
