obable need for an external military presence in bosnia beyond mid1998 if resumption of warfare is to be avoidedspeakers offered different perspectives on the achievements to date but concurred that the peace remained fragile and would need considerably more time to become selfsustaining the dayton framework while flawed was upheld as the onlyremaining basis for future policy many tasks such as refugee return and policereform and restructuring were thought to require urgent attention some speakershighlighted the importance of removing indicted war criminals from their positionsof influence none foresaw an early exit none addressed military options if sfor or its successor were to encounter fierce resistance by the bosnian parties on the future multilateral force particip ants speculated that it would remain nato force and that the united states w ould continue to participate with some forces perspectives on the suitable structure mission and duration of the futureforce were offered one speaker presented an outline for moving from usled toa europeanled force both under nato another emphasized focus onimplementation tasks rather than another rigi d timeframe for the future force on the question of us interests in bosnia and th us role participants presented different viewpoints but cited sufficient interests to render pullout unlikely and engender significant us role in bosnia for so time to come speakers differed on the proper extent and scope of the us role some pointed to the unique deterrentfunction and key military assets that the united states has brought to the natooperations they claimed special us responsibility and commitment to the peace agreement to nato and to stability in eur ope others pointed to other us global commitments and the competing costs in terms of financial resources and militaryreadiness of longterm military comm itment to bosnia this perspective emphasized moving toward greater european role while working within anexisting nato framework and maintaining continued supporting but not leading us role in contrast the european allies emphasized their past and existingcontributions to peace efforts in bosnia and the current balance of responsibilitiespublic opinion polls revealed pressing curre nt urge from the us public to bring home us troops from bosnia but showed certain ambivalence about the us military role

seminar introduction1 following the signing of the dayton peace agreement in december 1995 nato deployed multinational implem entation force ifor of about 55000 troops to carry out the military provisions of the dayton accords for period of oneyear nato decided to deploy smalle r successor mission the stabilization force sfor currently with about 34000 troops to bosnia after ifors mandateexpired for an additional 18month period us military forces have served in bothifor and sfor and currently number bout 8500 troops numerous us civilian agencies personnel and financial resources have also contributed to internationalefforts to implement provisions of the dayton peace agreement us costs formilitary and civilian operations from fis cal year 1996 to 1998 are estimated to be nearly 8 billion 2 in november 1996 president clinton justified the continued us military engagement in nato followon force in bosnia on the grounds that the unitedstates had responsibility to see its comm itment through and an interest in helping to give peace in bosnia chance to beco lasting he stated that sfors mission should be completed and its forces would withdraw by june 1998 in recent months administration officials have said that while the peace process in bosnia has made gains in last two years especially in the most recent months peace is not likely to be selfsustaining if international troops withdraw after the end of sfors mandate in june 1998 therefore an external military presence is likely to be required after june 1998 in order to maintain peace nat has not yet made any final decision on postsfor mission but is expected to do so in early 1998 on december 18 1997 prior to visit to bosnia president clin ton announced that the united states would take part in nato security presence in bosnia when sfor withdraws after june 1998 congress has prohibited funding for the deployment of us forces to bosnia beyond june 1998 unless the president certify that the continued presence of us forces is required in order to meet us national security interests in this context the congressional res earch service and the general accounting office at the request of the senate foreign relations committee cosponsored aseminar on november 6 1997 the topic was bosnia us options after junehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs2 1998 representatives of the us administration and foreign governments as well as nongovernment experts offered diverse perspectives on broad range of relatedsubjects including progress in peace implementation options for postsformilitary operation us and allied interests in bosnia and implications for future policy for list of panelists see appendix 1 this report is intended to be asynthesis of key themes raised by seminar participants and does not include theentire content and sequence of the presenta tions and discussions at the november 6 seminar summary conclusions the intent of the november 6 seminar was to examine issues related to the debate over possible postsfor force not to produce single consensus view or specific policy recommendations nevertheless by the end of the seminar numberof broad themes relevant to the current bosnia debate emerged as part of asummary statement stanley sloan of the congressional research service identifiednumerous areas of convergence as well as divergence within these themes the first theme concerned the situation in bosnia and prospects for durable peace there some speakers examined th question of whether bosnia was somehow predestined to conflict or at least more susceptible to interethnic conflict as resultof its historical legacy some panelis ts acknowledged bosnias recent history of bloody conflict but also pointed to the very soft distinguishing characteristicsbetween the different ethnic groups and the lack of precedent for ethnically based territorial divisions many speakers identif ied numerous flaws and contradictions in the dayton peace agreement for example the successful implementation of the military aspects of the dayton agreement has enforced certain separation betweenthe bosnian parties while the civilian si of implementation which has been less successful has attempted to overcome this paration some of these flaws have led some observers to question the value or wisdom of upholding dayton for theforeseeable future at the seminar speaker supported any specific alternative tothe dayton framework as the basis for future policy firsthand observers to theimplementation process in bosnia identif ied numerous achievements that have been reached especially in recent months but expr essed concerns that most of these gains could be quickly and completely reversed if fighting were to resume second set of issues concerned the stion of continued external military presence in bosnia beyond june 1998 ther was near total convergence among seminar participants that such presence will be required if armed conflict is not to be resumed less agreement was evident bout the possible goals of future military mission or its suitable composition on the question of the possibility of us participation in this military presence most of the speakers portrayed usinvolvement as extremely likely even though formal decision by the clintonadministration had yet been announced at th time of this confer ence views on the proper extent and duration of us participation however varied in part thesedivergences reflected different assessments of the level of us interests at stake in the future of the peace process in bosnia

july 10 1997 one bosnian serb suspect was killed in shootout the second was transferred to the haguesome speakers asserted that the united st ates maintained an interest in seeing the dayton agreement an agreement reached as result of us leadership fully implemented they identified specific key tasks in civil implementation that remained incomplete such as the return of refugees enhancing law and orderthrough reformed police structures building functioning civic institutions andbringing war criminals to justice they contended that the fulfillment of these goals was tantamount to securing sustainable peace in bosnia other speakersemphasized the parties responsibilities for implementing these tasks and predictedlittle further progress in the reintegration of bosnias divided communities thisperspective suggests as outlined in recent news article that the real us interest in bosnia may be limited to securing stability in bosnia not nationbuilding orreconstructing multiethnic bosnia as it was before the war 3 us strategic interests in preventing resumption of war in europe in ensuring the success of the unprecedented nato missions and in providing global leadershipwere also cited some speakers referred to the specific and unique militarycapabilities and status that us forces have brought to the nato operations in bosnia others cited the strain of the ongoing bosnia operation on us militaryreadiness globally from public opinion perspective polls indicated greatpressure to bring us troops home but possibly rather receptive public attitude to an extended us engagement polls did reveal public concerns about whether the us was handling more than its fair share of the operation and whether the operation was succeeding in its mission the question of whether the europeans can or should take on more responsibility for the military presence in bosnia elicited spirited discussion manyus speakers expressed desire to see th europeans take on larger military role european representatives responded that european countries already assume amajority role in bosnia and would like to uphold the current proportionality ofresponsibility speakers agreed that any future external military presence in bosniashould remain nato force which would imply that some us military personnel would remain involved in some capacity the main issue for some of the speakers was whether and how this next nato mission could at least move in the direction of an alleuropean force stanley sloan of crs raised final summary element possible wild card factor related to the situation with war crim inals in bosnia if decisions are made to go after some or all remaining war criminals the results could prove to be turning point in the potential for bosnias peaceful reintegration negative results andpossible casualties could force major reassessment of the military operation inbosnia and of the overall direction of international policy on december 18 sfor launched second snatch operation against two bosnian croat war criminals both of whom were then transferred to the hague war crimes tribunal 4 nato has not revealed if additional operations are being prepared

objective one of the greatest challenges to any peace settlement is to promote cooperation and integration where violence and enmity pr evailed during war the brutality of the war in bosnia its high civilian toll and its focus on ethnic identity in thecommission of war crimes have exacerbated this challenge of peace andreconciliation some observers view the war in bosnia as only the most recentexample of conflict and violence in the former yugoslavia and evidence that thedifferent ethnic groups there cannot live togeth er in peace others contend that the war resulted from deliberate manipulati on by political authorities of latent ethnic antagonisms and that most of the populati on in bosnia today opposes any return to war the peace agreement reached at dayton ohio in november 1995 represented compromise on many different levels it acknowledged the selfproclaimedrepublika srpska the bosnian serb republic but accorded it the status of sub state entity and upheld bosnias external borders and continuation as single state it perpetuated the ceasefire line adjusted to become the interentity boundary line iebl between the parties armed forces but envisioned common civic institutions on the political level that would overcome this division it insisted on the principle of the right of all refugees and displaced persons to return to their prewar homes but provided means of securing their returns to stillhostile territory similarly inthe interest of justice and eventual reconciliation it demanded the surrender of allindicted war criminals to an international criminal court but made furtherspecifications on how to achieve this goa l overall the dayton peace agreement pledged considerable resources and effort on the part of the international communitybut placed primary responsibility for implem entation of the terms of the accord on the signatory parties prospects for daytons ultimate success or failure are difficult to estimate john lampe of the wilson center characterized dayton as prescription for confederalconnections between the two entities in rea lity three entities if one considers the still largely separate croat and bosniak communities in the federation where laborand capital can freely cross boundaries and where ethnic minorities are able toresettle with security he offered the year 2000 as possible milestone for whenbosnia might achieve stable legal fr amework for economic recovery employment and private foreign investment though other speakers predicted that more timewould be needed the concept of confeder links can bridge the gap between the drive by some for separateness and the necessity for some degree of cooperation between the three communities not one of whic h is or historically has ever been the majority population in bosnia mr lampe noted the historical continuity of bosnias existence as single administrative uni t under roughly the same borders through different historical periods 5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs5 6for examples of arguments favoring partition of bosnia see ohanlon michael bosnia better left partitioned the washington post april 10 1997 novak robert d sen hutchisons way out the washington post september 11 1997 and rosenthal am solution for bosnia the new york times september 26 1997former us ambassador to bosnia john menzies placed greater emphasis on the vision of united bosnia according to mr menzies the model for the two bosnian entities is not the formerly divided east and west berlin but theadministratively divided west virginia nd virginia he suggested that under this vision the iebl will become more significant than the borders betweenneighboring us states in his view outside assistance targeted on economic reconstruction democratic institutions and the development of civil society can do great deal to promote cohesion and integration of the bosnian entities at the seminar discussions regarding achievements to date in implementing dayton see following section revealed consensus on daytons longterm viability different speakers pointed to the significant achievements reached since dayton and specially noted some recent milestones in the arrest and surrender of afew war criminals and the return of some refugees across ethnic lines others however expressed concern that these achievements were not irreversible andcould erode if not further consolidated at the same time specific alternatives to the dayton framework were promoted speakers lent little credence to recent proposals to encourage an ethnic partition of bosnia 6 since this course was seen by so to lead to certain renewed fighting in bosnia and would serve as destabilizing model for other ethnicallymixed regions at the same time most speakers acknowledged that ethnic divisions in bosnia have not been overcome consensus was only apparent on the need foradditional time beyond june 1998 for peace to take root some discussants notedthat widespread awareness of the need fo r long period of time for bosnia to heal had existed from the beginning of the dayton process this awareness appeared atodds with natos approach of setting deadlines for both the ifor and sfor missions sfor objectives the dayton peace agreement effectively halted the long war in bosnia also involving croatia and serbia and provided framework for lasting peace theoverarching goal of international efforts to implement all aspects of the dayton peaceagreement is to consolidate the peace to sufficient level to become selfsustaining to that end the international community called upon numerous internationalorganizations to assist in numerous secu rityrelated and civic institutionbuilding processes natos task was to deploy an implementation force ifor to carry out the military provisions outlined in the dayton peace agreement the securitycouncil later authorized the stabilization force to succeed ifor for an additional18month period this

8ibiddepartment of defense emphasized that nato as one contractor to the dayton process maintains the same objectives ou tlined in the dayton agreement the goals of dayton can be summarized as follows7 dayton peace agreement goals c end the war c provide security for the people of bosnia c create unified democratic bosnia with in internationally recognized boundaries c rebuild the bosnian economy c ensure the right of people to return to their homes source department of defense dpa since nato is not responsible for all of these goals the focus of natos operations in bosnia has been more narrowly defined by its military mission upholding the ceasefire organizing the separation of armies and supervising thecollection of heavy weapons though ifor was able to accomplish its mission onor ahead of schedule during 1996 the intern ational community determined that an international military force was still required in bosnia in order to provide secureenvironment for civilian peace efforts to c ontinue and the security council and north atlantic council authorized smalle r sfor to fill this role many observers believe that similar justification w ill be invoked for postsfor force this situation has caused some observers to ask the question what conditions in bosniawould allow nato to terminate its presen ce in bosnia what benchmarks can be identified that would constitute the equivale nt of an exit strategy for nato in his december 18 statement president clint on said that the future nato mission in bosnia should be tied to specific benchmarks and not to timetable nato isexpected to develop these benchmarks in its planning for the postsfor force at the november 6 seminar mr mcconnell re ferred to natos outline for the desired endstate in bosnia 8httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs7 natos desired endstate c the political leaders of bosnias th ree ethnic groups demonstrate sustained commitment to negotiation as the means to resolve political and military differences between and within ethnic communities c bosnias civil structures are sufficien tly mature to assume responsibility for ensuring compliance with the dpa c bosnias three ethnic groups adhere on sustained basis to the military requirements of the dpa including the virt ual absence of violations or unauthorized activities c conditions are established for the safe co ntinuation of ongoing nationbuilding activities source department of defense nato one aspect of the sfor mission that recei ved lot of attention at the seminar was natos apparent broader interpretation of providing support to civilianagencies in recent months on the one hand ifor and sfor ve always provided selected support to civil implementation in addition to their military tasks but havenever taken the lead in these civilian efforts nato and other defense officials denythat this support has been tantamount to mission creep they emphasize thatneither ifor nor sfor has ever taken on any task not explicitly assigned to them by the political authorities the north atla ntic council nac only when the nac has provided additional political guidance such as in the case of special police forces and the broadcast media has sfor expande d its duties to m longstreth of the office of the secretary of defense stressed the importance of upholding cleardistinction between military and civilian missions for sfor and for any successorforce to sfor in particular he predicte d that us military leaders will insist that any future military force not be burdened with larger mission or increased number of tasks as it is being drawn down in size on the other hand other observers cont end that one cannot deny that sfor has assumed more assertive approach in civ il affairs in the past halfyear moreover these activities have had tangible effects on the behavior of the bosnian partiesaccording to some observers the two sfor operations against indicted warcriminals in july and december 1997 s ubstantially enhanced the credibility of international threats against war criminals sfor actions to take over hardline and antisfor bosnian serb media transmitters have had political effect and suchmoves can be viewed as attempts to shap the political environment in the rs one speaker hrair balian of the international crisis group contended that in general it is very difficult entirely to separate military and nonmilitary tasks he noted forexample that the unarmed international po lice task force would be unable to perform its duties in potentially hostile environments without the presence of sfor assessments of progress to date as noted above the consensus view of seminar speakers was that more time was needed for peace to take firmer hold in bosnia panelists perspectives varied somewhat however on assessments of the vel of progress reached thus far thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs8 dayton peace agreement itself establishes few benchmarks with which to measure success in building functioning civil society in bosnia president clinton and other administration officials have emphasized that postsfor mission should be tied to specific benchmarks instead of another deadline mr mcconnell of the defense department acknowledged the difficulty in measuring progress and presented numerous specific examples that would indicate both progress and problems in reaching

from numerous additional observers to the bosnia peace implementation process antonio pedauye former chief of the u n mission in bosnia pointed to the structural challenges to dayton implementation at the beginning of the process thedayton accords presented extremely difficult tasks to european institutions such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs9 the osce and european union compared to the structure mr pedauye noted that there was unity of command on the civilian side and that the highrepresentative was given very weak mandate over the multitude of internationalorganizations involved john hillen of the council on foreign relations contended that the dayton accords were not likely ever to be fully implemented he viewed the accords as anecessarily flawed agreement forged prim arily by the will of the primary negotiator richard holbrooke he could not conclude that events in bosnia were evolving in the direction of stable peace and pointed to the lapsed deadlines for ifor and sfor as evidence of fundamental problem with the accords in contrast former us ambassador to bosnia john menzies contended that dayton was succeedingeven beyond initial expectations progress ach ieved in the past two years according to mr menzies should encourage the inte rnational community to push forward with dayton implementation james gow of kings college in london and advisor to the war crimes tribunal sought to refute the view that progress was made in the first yearfollowing dayton he pointed to the successful achievement of the two primarypriorities of 1996 implemen ting the m ilitary asp ects of dayton with ifor and holding national elections in the second stage beginning as sfor replaced ifor mr gow identified three priorities the fi rst was to continue the constitutional and political integration of the country the s econd task was to try to ensure the freedom of movement which would enable the return of displaced persons and refugees the third priority was to take action on the question of indicted war criminals mr gowemphasized that the last issue has become the first priority since there was little prospect of forward movement on political consolidation or refugee returns without the removal of most of the war criminals for this reason mr gow lent greatsignificance to the july 1997 nato operation against two indictees and thesurrender by croatia of ten indictees to the hague in october the result of intenseinternational diplomatic pressure mr hrair balian of the international crisis group office in sarajevo perceived an enormous positive difference in the past halfyear on the ground in all entities and communities in bosnia the republika srpska the muslimcontrolled areas and thebosnian croatcontrolled areas mr balian ttributed much of the change to sfors more robust engagement in civilian aspect s of peace implementation specifically sfors operation in prijedor against indicted war criminals sfors takeover ofbroadcasting transmission towers and sfors support to local police units loyal tobosnian serb president biljana plavsic ve all had significant impact on the pace of peace implementation across the boar d according to mr balian he also emphasized that his expression of cautious optimism should not obscure theenormous amount of work to be accomplishe d in the next six months before sfor is scheduled to leave and in the postsfor periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs10 9for more information on the train and equip program see us library of congress congressional research service bosnia us led train and equip program by steve woehrel crs report 96 735f updated august 19 1997potential flashpoints many speakers agreed with the prognosis that conflict was likely to resume absent the presence of an international security force how and when conflict wouldresume remains open to speculation according to mr balian of the internationalcrisis group the scenario under which hos tilities may resume in bosnia would not be fullscale military assault by one side or the other two speakers mr balianand mr gow rejected the speculation that the bosnian federation armed forces werepreparing for or even capab of an allout attack on the rs with any reasonable chance of success in the near term even with the aid provided by the usledmilitary assistance program to the federation 9 mr balian found it more likely that hostilities could result from escalation from smallerscale incidents for example in strategically located areas such as sa nski most or brcko tens of thousands of displaced persons still unable to return to their homes might attempt to take mattersinto their own hands or even be encour aged to do so by local political authorities incidents on the iebl or on an intercommun ity divide in the case of the croats and muslims could create counterincidents th at could grow unchecked if there was credible international force on the ground one audience participant questioned whether brcko was the most likely flashpoint this strategic crossroads was left unresolved at dayton and final binding arbitration was pushed off until march 1998 speakers declined to speculate onwhether final resolution will be reached at that time but some noted that theinternational community might consider the degrees to which the parties cooperatewith the international supervisory bodies in brcko as critical as brcko is to lasting peace in bosnia speakers noted that an equally important key is sarajevoespecially in regard to refugee returns primarily ethnic serbs speakers predictedthat progress in returns to sarajevo would directly impact prospects for returns in brcko and elsewhere conversely if there was substantial return of serbs tosarajevo one discussant expected political breakthrough in refugee returns in therest of bosnia postsfor options current us policy on december 18 1997 president clinton announced that the united states would take part in an international security presence in bosnia when the nato forcewithdraws in june 1998 the president outlined the following criteria for hisapproval of the nato force the mission must be achievable and tied to concretebenchmarks not deadline the force

doing more the cost must be manageable and the plan must have the support of congress and the american pub lic president clinton argued that the united states should finish the job we bega n for the sake of bosnias future and in the service of our own interests and values in recent months many administration officials have asserted the premise that some form of international security presence should and is likely to remain inbosnia after june 1998 in or der to maintain stability 10 administration officials have also emphasized the need to press for gr eater progress in peace implementation prior to june 1998 like its earlier position on if or the administration has asserted that sfors mission will end on schedule and not be extended notwithstanding anypossible successor mission this position implies the exclusion of strict status quo option though not functional near equivale nt at meetings at nato defense secretary cohen and secretary of state bright have strongly argued for larger european role ie greater financial and personnel resources in key civilian areassuch as policing military peacekeeping options at its defense ministerial meeting on december 23 1997 nato commissioned its defense planners to draw up options for followon peacekeepingforce to replace sfor nato foreign minist ers meeting two weeks later endorsed the development of these options which are to be presented to the north atlanticcouncil in midjanuary 1998 nato saceur general wesley clark has said that final decision by nato on followon force should come by march 1 1998 the general postsfor options most co mmonly referred to in the media have been the complete withdrawal of sfor at the end of its mandate in june 1998 the withdrawal of nato units to stations outsi of bosnia or over the horizon the replacement of sfor with new force under different structure andor mandate and the continuation of sfor at its current strength for an extended period mostanalysts and media commentary identified the third option unofficially dubbeddfor for deterrence force as the most likely one at the time of the november crsgao seminar nato planning for future options had not officially begun and so actual planning specifics were unavailable at the seminar ivo daalder of theuniversity of maryland presented range of generic options and outlined somepremises and implications of each option mr daalders options derived from his view of the basic policy dilemma before the administration which is that while bosnia will probably require an externalmilitary presence beyond june 1998 neither the allies alone nor the united states aspart of nato force is likely to stay in bosnia long enough for peace to become selfsustaininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs12 11for more information on the european secur ity and defense identity see us library of congress congressional research service nato adapts for new missions the berlin accord and combined joint task forces cjtf by stanley sloan crs report 96561f june 19 1996 mr daalder offered shorthand names to the basic options c nofor leave on schedule by mid1998 c sforever stay for the long haul c efor hand mission over to the europeans each option has its own justification the argument for nofor emphasizes the substantial investment already made in bosnia and declines nato or us responsibility for nationbuilding the sfore ver option derives from the view that the nato commitment to bosnia remains fundamental to us interests and thatsecuring peace and stability in bosnia jus tifies the commitment and costs of us military assets for years to come the efor option assumes that the europeaninterest in bosnia is great er than that of the united states it would hand over primary responsibility to the europeans and test their commitment to develop theeuropean security and defense identity esdi 11 mr daalder argued further however th at option completely gets around the basic policy dilemma outlined above the first nofor would risk the resumptionof war the second sforever would be seen as politically untenable and thethird efor is unacceptable to the allies mr daalder presented refined opti on which he dubbed tfor for transition force tfor would operate under the same mandate as sfor and presumably with similar structure the size of tfor would depend on whether it would serve adeterrent function as originally envisioned for the final stage of sfors deployment or continue in the more assertive manne r in which sfor has begun to conduct itself in the last months us forces would serve in tfor for another specified periodsuch as 18 months after tfor european led force efor would take over with us forces available outside of bosnia to provide emergency assistance strategy for gaining us and europ ean support for this option would involve close consultation with congress during which the administration could offer thisform of exit strategy the concept might gain broader european acceptance mr daalder believes if the operational command of tfor were transferred from anamerican to european by certain date july 1 1998 for example tfor and efor would remain nato missions under nato structures and with full nato support systems it was pointed out in the discussion period that us personnel would still most likely be involved in supporting functions in future european force but that the key difference would be that it would not include us combatunits in bosnia some of the discussion over the options as presented focused on the concept of moving toward greater european military role one european discussant pointed out that the european countries want to bring their troops home at least as stronglyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs13 12for example see oped by senator joseph r bi den jr bosnias police the europeans the washington post december 17 1997 p a25as the united states given that their troops had already served in bosnia with unprofor for three years before the nato missions question was raised whether an alleuropean force would carry the same weight in bosnia or be viewed with the same credibility by the local par ties without the presence of us troops the european countries also continue to object to the usled program to equip andtrain the bosnian federation forces on the grounds that such assistance is onesided and destabilizing and would likely raise these objections as counterargument tothe full withdrawal of us ground troops from bosnia on the us side it was also pointed out that it might be difficult for some in the united states to fathom shift to european command of tfor if us troops were still participating in theoperation some policymakers have called for the europeans to create newpolicesecurity force for bosnia separate from and in addition to postsforforce 12 speakers and discussants also had differe nt perspectives on the possible mission and mandate for postsfor force u nder the tfor option presented by mr daalder the concept of deadline is tied to the command and structure of the force ie moving from us to europeanled force mr mcconnell reiterated the lackof enthusiasm within the administration fo r any date or deadline concept for post sfor force mr gow predicted that the ne w force will have largely the same tasks as sfor and suggested that it might comm it to general 2 to 5year deployment that is focused on implementation tasks ra ther than rigid schedule president clinton in his december 18 announcement admitted that the deadline approach wasa mistake and said that the next bosnia mission should be tied to concretebenchmarks as examples of benchmarks president clinton cited sustainable jointpolitical institutions an independent dia functioning civil police and democratic rule over the military us and allied interests the issue of balance between the us and european roles in bosnia was the focus of the second part of the novemb er 6 seminar this section summarizes different perspectives on us interests at stake in bosnia european viewpoints public opinion findings and perspectives from the media us perspectives john menzies former us ambassador to bosnia stated that us interests have evolved over the years historica lly the former yugoslav lands have always held importance for the united states especially in the 20th century with the experience of both world wars and the cold war during the early months of the war in bosnia in 1992 the us interest was sparked and driven by humanitarianconcern for the victims of the war later the failure of international diplomatic andmilitary measures led some to question the effectiveness of the united nations andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs14 13see also hillen john after sfor planning european led force joint force quarterly spring 1997 p 7579 for nato the question of whether or not the united states would assume leadership in the bosnia case became more pressing as the war continued in 1995 us interests intensified as the us involvement investment and commitment to bosnia grew mr menzies termed the peace process that took shape after the lowpoint of the bosnian serb summer offensives on srebrenica and zepaand the dissolving mission surrounding these events pax americana anamerican peace the leading role in forging peace settlement played by thenassistant secretary of state richard holbr ooke raised the us stake in bosnia and intensified the us investment for the sa ke of us leadership for nato and for bosnia and the balkans mr menzies asserted that the united states maintains vital national interest in seeing the dayton agreement succeed in the postdayton period us interests in peace implementation have mirrored the priorities of the dayton agreement acco rding to mr menzies specifically the united states maintains an interest in seei ng that united bosnia be maintained the return of refugees still potentially warfi ghting issue is priority bringing war criminals to justice by whatever means are found to be most suitable is priorityin his view economic renewal and the restructuring of political and civicinstitutions are also key to peace in bosnia on global level mr menzies asserted that the united states cannot leave the job in bosnia unfinished nor can it walk away from its own agreement and see war break out again because of the us and international investments already made to the peace process and the da mage such failure w ould have on us global leadership similarly mr menzies stresse d that nato cannot afford the failure that bosnia would represent if war resumed b ecause the agreement was not implemented to its full extent an alternative perspective came from john hillen of the council on foreign relations mr hillen focused on the us interest in moving away from lead rolein bosnia to supporting role if the in ternational community ultimately decides on longterm military commitment he viewed the main issue to be the need for the united states to balance its worldwide military commitments but not necessarilychoose between allornothing options eg bring home all us troops or remain in bosnia in the current mission mr hillen offered three primary reasons on why the united states should consider this shift 13 the first was the overall strain on the readiness of us forces all over the world mr hille n cited examples of excessive use of us transport aircraft in europe and the impact of such overuse on the readiness of other units in the armed forces he cited problems with morale retention and even recruitment the current strain on manpower and materiel has also delayed procurementinvestments while the bosnia operation is not the only cause it is contributingfactor according to mr hillen second ly mr hillen pointed to growing divergence in military capabilities between th united states and europe only the united states maintains advanced inte lligence capabilities stealth aircraft longhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs15 14for additional information on cjtf see sloan stanley nato adapts for new missionsrange strategic projection and logistic capabilities that enable the us to quickly assemble major military effort the europeans have also made deep cuts in defensespending and have made greater doctrinal sh ifts in the direction of peacekeeping as such the european allies remain complete ly dependent on the united states for even modest military campaigns third im perative is what mr hillen called divergence of interests mr hillen asserted that the united states has major interests elsewhere in the world and that there s hould be some indication to the us public and the congress that what happens in bosnia is at least little more important to the european allies than to the united states he questioned the fundamentalincongruity between pronouncements on bosn ias importance to the united states if at the same time the european allies do not consider bosnia important enough tostay on their own if the united states leaves mr hillen noted that solution to what he views as the n eed to move toward greater european and lesser us role in bosnia is already in place in the form of natos combined joint task force cjtf 14 which offers in principle degree of structural flexibility previously unknown to nato the overall objective would be to move toward nato force for bosnia that is not totally dependent politicallyand militarily on us leadership for the duration of an extended mission in bosnia the united states may still play critical pa rtnership role but one that is supportive rather than leading the european and experience european perspectives on military options in the balkans are shaped in part by their experience with the protecti on force unprofor during the bosnian war from 1992 to 1995 nato allies such as france britain and the netherlands contributed the bulk of troops to the forces while nato operation including us forces controlled the skies many european officials draw strong contrast between their troops experiences in unprofor and with the nato missions afterdayton among the many differences eur opean officials emphasize the role and impact of us troops on the ground in bosnia since the end of 1995 john sawers of the british embassy empha sized the long struggle borne largely by the europeans during the years prior to the achievement at dayton he said thatwhile the european experience in unprofor was mixed european troopsconstituted the bulk of the force since 1992 by june 1998 british troops will have been deployed in bosnia for six years from 1992 to 1994 various peace proposalsforged by european and diplomacy faile d to end the conflict the international community remained deeply divided leading to tensions that some argue forestalled an earlier settlement mr sawers consider ed that the effectiveness of the common western approach to bosnia established since dayton should not be underestimated ambassador antonio pedauye of the spanish foreign ministry offered additional points of contrast between the postdayton situation in bosnia and theun experience during his tenure as unp rofor and mission in bosnia

nations mission in bosnia and herzegovina unmibhherzegovina unmibh15 chief of mission from 1995 to early 1996 in bosnia the united nations was faced with the fundame ntal contradiction of deploying peace mission in country at war with peace to keep or even ceasefire to monitor unprofor had limited mandate and limited rules of engagement according to mr pedauye the increasing us invol vement in forging peace settlement in 1995 with the awareness of the military risks and responsibilities that went alongwith this leadership role was crucial factor in achieving an end to the warmoreover the europeans welcomed the amer ican assertiveness after years of failed peace efforts and of transatlantic rifts ove r policy in the balkans the europeans had devoted much time effort and military and financial resources to the bosniaconflict but in the end recognized the limitations to their power in the balkans looking toward possible new multinational force in bosnia mr sawers emphasized the fairness in his view of existing burdensharing arrangementseuropean troops constitute over twothirds of the force in contrast to the usparticipation of onequarter of the tota l two of three sfor commands are led by europeans the current british contingent in sfor comprises about 5 of thebritish army substantial commitment of its forces mr sawers also contended that the european share of the civilian effort particularly in rec onstruction aid is even greater nevertheless mr sawers saw even minority us presence on the ground in possible future nato force as essential the united states supplies essentialmilitary assets to the mission us ground forces lend unique deterrence role tothe ground operation continued us ground presence would ensure that theunited states maintains similar interests to other troopcontributing countries andkeep international military and political fforts more closely linked than they were with unprofor for these reasons mr sawers concluded that the current proportionality is the correct one and should be upheld for any future militaryoperation and civilian effort in the discussion period mr sawers challenged theview expressed by other speakers and audience members that bosnia should meanmore to europe than the united states by virt ue of the fact that bosnia is situated in europe mr sawers countered that the ited states has profound security interests and commitments in europe just as some european countries have interests and commitments in the western hemisphere public opinion and the media the seminar heard from representatives from public opinion analysis institute and from the media mr stephen kull of the program on international policyattitudes pipa at the university of ma ryland presented findings from variety of polling sources on different aspects of the us military engagement in bosnia he examined three basic areas of us public sentiment opinion on us troops beingin bosnia on having us troops stay longer than june 1998 and on the likelyreaction to us fatalities in bosnia on the first question mr kull presented data from 1995 to 1996 that showed consistent split in us opinion on sending us troops as part of an internationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs17 figure 1peacekeeping force in bosnia figure 1 the share of those opposed was highest in the months directly preceding the us deployment november and december 1995 reflecting what mr kull called cold feet phenomenon but later dropped to itsearlier levels in mr kulls view the us public was not so much divided asambivalent on this question of us troops participating in bosnia peacekeeping the ambivalence reflects favorable and unfa vorable considerations underlying the umbrella question of sending us troops to bosnia bosnia send troops as part of international peacekeeping force on the favorable side majority of am ericans on the basis of numerous polls has consistently supported us participation in peacekeeping in principle over the past number of years january 1997 poll showed that majority of thosepolled also supported the use of nato for such peacekeeping duties specifically inbosnia figure

troops shouldbe used to provide peacekeeping in countries bordering nato members such as bosnia on the justification for sending us fo rces to bosnia mr kull suggested that the us public is not overly concerned with bosnias direct bearing on us national interests rather majority accepts the linkage of the conflict in bosnia to moredirect us interests and also responds to humanitarian considerations for example in december 1995 shortly before us troops were deployed to bosnia 64 of apolling sample concurred that stopping mo re people from being killed was good enough reason to send us troops to bosnia 63 thought keeping the war fromspreading to other parts of europe was reason enough only 29 agreed with the rationale that the united states should maintain its role as world leader 16 on the negative side mr kull suggested that there is not clarity among the us public that the bosnia operation is in f act multilateral he noted that polling questions that do not specify the multilateral aspect but simply ask whether ustroops should be in bosnia get about 10 less support than questions that do make this specification the difference reflect s opposition to the idea of the united states going into bosnia unilaterally and lack of clarity over whether this is the case or not related downward pull on public suppor t is concern about the united states contributing more than its fair share january 1997 poll showed that 45 of the pool thought incorrectly that the united states was contributing most of the troops in bosnia 17 according to mr kull what am ericans think represents fair share is 20 to 25percent of the total fo rce share that roughly corresponds to the actual share of us forces in sfor th ird negative factor is the strong perceptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs19 18pipa june 1996 19pew september 1997 provided by pipafigure 3 source pew september 1997that emerges from polls that the nato operation in bosnia is not

depended on the continued presence of us troops would you support an extension of the american military mission there or would you oppose it on the last question regarding possible us fatalities poll taken in april 1995 asked for responses to scenario where us forces were deployed in bosnia andexperienced 200 fatalities more than half of the respondents favored forcefuloptions such as striking back or calling in reinforcements and about one quarterfavored withdrawal again mr kull tied the question of casualties to the perceptionof success if the operati on is viewed as generally successful then acceptance of fatalities in the context of more assertive operation is greater in contrast if the operation is perceived as failing fatalities will further diminish support for theoperation finally the seminar heard from ms barbara starr correspondent with janes defense weekly for perspective from the media she first noted that journalist covering this issue would probably consider it news that the united states is likely to remain in bosnia even though formal decision had yet been made instead themedia was likely to focus on the level of candor with which policymakers discussfuture options in bosnia and the potential challenges or policy issues that may layahead in her view the issue of war criminals is likely to remain significant challenge for the current military operation and for possible future one nato has continued to eschew responsibility for apprehending wa r criminals with the exception of the one operation in july 1997 and later the second operation in december 1997 ifthe international community considers the issue of war criminals to be an importantif not key factor in securing peace ms starr wondered how long it can pass offhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs21 responsibility onto the bosnian croatian and yugoslav parties another significant challenge for postsfor force concerns community policing in bosnia and thesecuring of law and order for everyday life the prevalence of road blocks on all sides remains problem throughout bosnia the specific force package for post sfor force is another issue to be watche d closely in her view the experience of ifor and sfor has demonstrated the value of specific pieces of military equipmentms starr noted the success of certain scout reconnaissance aircraft and types ofarmored vehicles that have been effective in heavily mined region on the bosnian side ms starr doubted that anyone could fully assess the final impact of the train andequip program to the federation at this time from broader perspective ms starr raised the ongoing tension with iraq as another example where the united states may be militarily involved for some timeto come although the situations in iraq nd bosnia differ greatly in both situations policymakers must consider what criteria they may use to measure success and what their exit strategy should be us policymak ers also have to consider the possibility of major military contingency somewhere in the world and the implications thatwould have for the us role in bosnia ms starr doubted that the forwarddeployment of approximately 8000 us tr oops would by itself represent too heavy strain on the us military even with major regional conflict at hand however she noted that the united states was likely to retain key tactical role in providing command and control and strategic lift capabilities to any nato mission in bosniaeven if the europeans took on larger role thus it seemed apparent to this speaker that as long as the nato mission is sustaine d us forces were likely to remain in bosnia in some form or another for some time to come httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9823crs22 appendix 1 list of panel participants hrair balian
