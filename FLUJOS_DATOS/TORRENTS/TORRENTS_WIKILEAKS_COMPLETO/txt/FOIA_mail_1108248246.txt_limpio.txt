kbriffaueaacuk tosbornueaacuk sorry text revised yet again more changes until i receive comments from everyone thanks mike at 1203 pm 2112005 phil jones wrote mike keith and tim are here next week but very busy with proposal to the eu so you may have to hassle them bit or hang on for week or two nature dragged in the ipcc angle which annoyed i tried to explain to him how ipcc works ipcc wont be discussing this in beijing in may except as part of chapter 6 hans von storch will likely regret some of the words hes said fyi just as ncar have put up web site to give the whole story re chris landseass resignation from ca in the atmos obs chapter to help kevin trenberth out knmi are doing the same re rob van dorland and that dutch magazine the chief scientist at knmi has got involved as rob didnt say the things attributed to him ill find out more on this in pune as guy from knmi will be there several other cas on our chapter pulled out or just didnt do anything their stories never got run dicks report was good and my bit in nature cam across well say hi to all there and wish steve well cheers phil at 1619 11022005 michael mann wrote philthanks thats great really happy to hear that everyone is on board with this im at symposium honoring steve schneider out at stanford right now lots of folks hereas i talk this over w them and see dick kerrs coverage of this etc i realize its not so badi was afraid this would be spun as bolstering the contrarians but it hasnt in large part due to quotes from you and others pointing out that the study actually reinforces the key conclusions etc and the fact dick kerr showed keith and tims plot showing the scattering of multiple reconstructions etc which takes the focus off mann bit nonetheless i am convinced their methodology is suspect as the analysis i sent shows so i will really appreciate input from keith tim and you to make sure the language and wording are appropriate and fair i will revise as i get input from various people with an aim to having this submissionready in about 10 days so you can have one final look after you return and before you have to head out again looking forward to getting peoples comments feedback etc thanks again mike at 0805 am 2112005 phil jones wrote mike et ive talked to keith and tim here and it seems best if we all come in with you on this response what you have done is basically fine we can discuss specific wording later my problem is that im off tomorrow to pune till feb 20 and email may be sporadic or nonexistent so can you discuss revised drafts with keith and tim but keep on lower down as im away im here on feb 21 then off to chicago to review the vertical temperature report for the nrcnas feb 2225 keep on the emails in case email works well in pune cheers phil at 2335 10022005 michael mann wrote dear caspar gene scott phil i am attaching response ive drafted to the moberg et paper attached for those of you who havent seen it the message is pretty clear and simpletheir method overemphasizes the lowfrequency variability to demonstrate this ive made use of stuff from mann and jones and from the mannrutherfordwahlammann j climate letter on pseudoproxies so i would welcome any of you to be coauthors on thisjust let now if youre interested ive been in touch w keith he and tim are potentially working on their own independent responsewaiting to hear further this is very rough draft so comments much appreciated looking forward to hearing back mike ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of
