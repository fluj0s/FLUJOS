6309c11 shspec306 service facs and gpms hcob 8may63 routine 3 the nature of formation of gpm says the early gpms contacted are implants this does not mean the pcs own gpms do not exist the pcs own gpm has power and velocity over an implant gpm in ratio of 1000 or 100000 to 1 there is great difference in order of magnitude the whole and entire amount of implanted gpms all together are one ri of one of lrhs gpms the oppterm goals which is one of about hundred ris on personal gpm which extends from trillions 30 to trillions 20 on the track and is actually still continuing number of you have some protest on the length of the time track multiple trillions of trillions etc modern times is trillions 13 to now the stuff that is likely to influence the pc in pt what you are doing in r3sc is fooling around with the pcs current ri in his existing pt goal line of his current truncated goal gpm there is an opposition to it clearing up this stuff is clearing dumbbell pair out of the pcs own gpm restimulated in pt out of sequence on the track the pcs goal will fall out of this with thud it is probable that while you are listing for the pcs service fac you will get the pcs goal rocket reading the amount of aberration required to reduce power must be comparable to the power reduced to account for the reduction of power of the thetan we must find some force of equal power that could aberrate him all the implant gpms did was to confuse you as to what was your goal and what was an implanted goal implanted goals were installed backwards from top to bottom an actual gpm is run the way it was lived from bottom to top use r3m2 to run actual gpms r3m2 is apparently variant of r3m r3m is method of running the sequence of actual gpms ri by ri starting either with an ri or with rocketreading goal starting with the goal the first ri is obtained by using goal oppose list also known as source list more or less with the wording who or what would the goal oppose subsequent ris are obtained by ri oppose lists these have to be listed rightwayto there are different rules for finding the item on these two sorts of lists each ri after it is found is packaged by relating it to the goal and to the ri found just before it and when verified is added to the line plot this packaging step also lets you know when you have entered new gpm as the ris will longer relate to the goal previously found when this happens the new goal is found by doing new goals list for new rocket reading goal or the pc may volunteer the new goal you can also start r3m with an ri perhaps one that was obtained from r212 in this case you just keep doing ri oppose lists and getting new ris by the time you have several ris the pc will give you his goal but you continue with the ri oppose lists other references on r3m are to be found on p 382 above dont use an early actual goal as service fac and try to run it as such if you do this you are making the guy look down the goals channel the goal in an actual gpm is the furthest item from pt being the bottom terminal when you get the pc to reach down for that goal he is to some slight degree traveling through time between that goal and pt and he livens up the whole track which is lot of charge it is like looking down between the rows of the helatrobus implants you get tunnel of blackness that is what happens when you reach down gpm the same thing happens with the pcs gpm channel only it is quite different order of magnitude with the helatrobus implant it is not so good to do this but with the pcs own actual gpm channel it is like having your head shot off with sixteen inch cannon the residual charge in an actual gpm is incomparably greater if the goal comes up as you look for service fac put it in the auditors report form clearly marked with red circle and dont do much with it except in r3m2 if you run it you are getting the pc to look down through the gpm to the beginning of some track with at least hundred ris between you and it you will get ta etc if you run it as service fac but the pc running it will scuff up his track the pcs own gpm looks like black island floating it is quite meaty they come in different sizes but each is distinct size you are running the pc back and forth from the bottom of mass maybe three feet thick 75 feet long and 30 feet wide you could well restimulate so much mass that the ta will all of sudden freeze up you would have to remedy this by working out the gym with r3m2 the pcs own gpm has the beauty of disintegrating as you work with it you get rocketreading blowdowns the black islands turn grey then start shaking and fraying like opaque jello that someone left in the sun the power in this early gpm is commensurate with the native power of thetan ie there is lot of charge on it this charge doesnt discharge through the pc or the meter luckily the technology for handling this is all in r3n see pp 414 426 456457 above and r3m2 ris relate to goal but each as its own central postulate with regard to the goal this is true of every ri in the pcs gpm for instance the current ri might have central postulate of to ring bells where the goal is to go to school you might get an oppterm of people who bring their lunches without knowing the goal this would be puzzling thats why it would be an aberrative factor r3sc will land you somewhere in the vicinity of the current oppterm or terminal of the pcs own gpm as it applies to pt or it may land you near some old ri that is in restimulation in pt that will be the source of the pcs pt restimulation with r3sc you can knock that in the head you can pull its central postulate but when you try to make the service fac make sense you may find it impossible to do so until you relate it to his goal by running r3m2 so that is actually what you are auditing when you find the service fac you could find service fac without meter by having the pc write list of solutions until he is easy about it and feels that it is complete then looking on the list for the solution that makes the least sense however when seen as an ri such things can be seen to make sense when you are handling service fac you are handling the central postulate of an ri so running r3sc disintegrates the ri the thinkingness of the ri is sometimes different from its beingness eg you may have the ri lame man but from that you may not know what the significance is that lies within it ie you may not know what the central postulate is you could list for this and find it it may turn out to be lameness things can be audited nicely without being related to the gpm where they occur even though under these circumstances they might not make sense service fac is actually not whole ri but just the central postulate of an ri you are handling the central postulate of an ri when you are handling service fac so you get disintegration being assumes an identity because it has solution in the middle of it for instance in the middle of the identity lame man we may find lameness as solution to something sometimes an ri comes up as its own thinkingness but beingness ri in particular may have an idea at its core an ri always has an idea at its core but sometimes you dont have the central idea when you have the ri given the ri you could list for the central significance which is an automatic solution its safe it solves everything this safe solution would be the service fac that is how an ri is generated the thetan has an idee fixe so he never has to inspect in order to solve so therefore he never asises the mass so therefore he gets caught in the middle of the mass if the thetan does this with goal he gets an accumulation of ris resulting from this goal each of these ris has the goal carried through into it but there is also new idea that makes each ri and that whole mass comes together as gpm so you get this huge mass this huge block of energy with its separate items in it they dont appear separate the whole thing is all squashed together from so much attack and so little inspection the whole thing is dominated by one goal eg to go to school which is common to every ri or identity within it this is what it is accumulates it but that goal all by itself is noinspection it is way to solve all problems totally uninspected in fixed way for instance the goal to solve all problems go to school is totally uninspected solution and now gathers to itself identities who have this idea as well as other characteristics because the goal is uninspected automatic and fixed it generates into itself the second step of identities eg an idiot child that have the goal as central idea but which already have their own characteristics they have the main idea the goal as dominant but the characteristic of the identity after it is longer able to carry out the postulate is something like that of an idiot child the idea of an idiot child is people like unintelligence so the central idea may be unintelligence solves everything but the ri is an idiot child the only way that it could exist in the first place was that the thetan had the idea of the goal to solve all problems go to school so there are three types of ideas in gpms 1 the goal of the gpm this is the first postulate and central idea of the gpm 2 the central idea or postulate of the ri which in itself forbids inspection 3 the identity or individuality or the ri this is the accumulation of mass that results from the fact that 1 and 2 above being fixed uninspected solutions forbid itsa and hence forbid an asisness from occurring that is the anatomy of an ri but it also tells us what service fac is this is what gives us the dwindling spiral of abilities ris substitutions of ideas for thetans the thetans ows all these get piled up on these fixed ideas the biggest fixed idea was goal which then developed into gpm that which is not inspected tends to persist because it is never asised what happens person gets hell knocked out of him the ri and its significance is the constant invitation to attack but it is never the right enemy the constant ow and battling that ensues from this fact accumulates as the mass of an ri it is interesting that an idea is most easily substituted for thetan because it has mass and seems to contain some wisdom i am guard implies i dont have to understand or inspect the thetan has tried to solve screwup with fixed idea or postulate this is sort of sweeping under the rug that permits inspection therefore asisness therefore persistence any idea is liable to become substituted for thetan because he does it himself when one gives up on one goal one gets another for instance say the last three or four mountain ranges the thetan built fell down and fouled up his planet so on the ideal planet never build mountains becomes the solution that holds all the confusion uninspected it is solved instead sooner or later we will find him running society for the prevention of building mountains he is now an identity he is the idea never build mountains substituted for thetan the pc keeps abandoning old solutions as they fail and keeps getting new goals this is covered in r3m basically except for finding the pcs own goal and distinguishing it from implant goals so be alert to anything you find in r3sc that rocket reads but dont run it with service fac tech you cant run gpm with service fac tech but you can run one ri with it but that rocket read is more than just service fac r3sc does handle the ri that is part of the pcs pt environment if you find an ri and your pc is having energy doing odd things to him giving ghastly sensations body distortion sensations etc the pc is liable to disclaim the ri in an effort to get away from it all getting towards the service fac causes qualms and invalidation in pc the service fac is prosurvival so he doesnt want to give it up dont q and with that invalidation to do so will just restimulate it worse if the invalidation occurs pick up everything found as service fac and finish it off standardly with all of the r3sc steps when stable datum is pulled out and not run off completely you leave some of the confusion behind so just get it with r3sc if you take the stable datum half way out of confusion you leave the confusion this is what happens when you leave r3sc on something halfrun the result is that the person will get foggy his memory will deteriorate if you took the stable datum all the way out you would blow the confusion the postulate in the center of the ri is so far downscale that it is twenty ta divisions below hide it is an idea that has turned into mest you run it only as far as cognition but it may enter at any of these levels 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival but real gpm item service fac goes through the steps of 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival 5 domination 6 rightwrong then the next 1 solutions 2 rightwrong 3 domination 4 survival etc again the service fac may enter at any of these stages it starts off reasonably sensible but becomes very weird like cows are kissable as safe solution to how to repair motor cars this service fac will turn out to be intimately related to solution or domination etc in the pcs mind when you try to run it the pc may not be able to fit it in on rightwrong so check it over on the other buttons he may well cognite on it and blow the charge you could then see how it is solution how it would make or has made him right and others wrong around and around on the buttons until the pc is out of answers and the buttons are clean do an 18button prepcheck and it will all cool down the auditor is always in danger of grabbing the gpm accidentally getting the goal instead of the service fac this has advantages too since the pcs goal is hard to sort out from implant goals the pcs own ris are probably what make implant goals read they read off the top of the pcs own ris the service fac doesnt have to rocket read you can accept one that does but be equally prepared to take one that just ticks the pcs service fac is his current solution his current ri monitored by the goal it is very aberrated stable datum it is an unexamined solution that keeps the pc from doing anything it was decent solution when the thetan first got hold of it but then it started running his life therefore it does not even vaguely take care of environmental enturbulation the rule when in doubt communicate is an attempt to overcome the effect of service facs you have to work at it to do r3sc wrong the best way to do it wrong is to be completely unthorough to leave everything unflat the pc will get very confused from having all his stable data pulled away when you handle service fac all the incomplete cycles that the service fac has caused hit the pc at once this generates confusion when the service fac running is not completed the confusion gets even worse so it is good idea from time to time to clean up what you have done get it all finished up some service facs wont run quite in the order given for r3sc see p 509 it may start on later step than rightwrong or earlier at solutions real service fac behaves outrageously in that regard something else that isnt service fac may be far more mannerly while still giving ta action keep your eyes peeled for the pcs goal since this is the best means of finding it that we have developed keep running service facs until the case is in good shape and the pcs goal has shown up you get the best ta on the pcs own gpm channel you can use r3m2 when you get his goal but that is not your immediate purpose r3sc is for destimulating the pt environment factor
