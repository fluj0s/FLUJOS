of the dist rict of columbia public school system 1 passage of legislation by th city council and 2 congre ssional amendment of the home rule act the majority of the reorganization proposal coul d be implemented by the city council acting under its legated authority to reorganize agencies of the district of columbia8 however the education reform act also contemplates that the congress would pass legislation ame nding two provisions of the home rule act 1 the authorizing language for the dc school board9 and 2 restrictions on the budgetary authority of the city council and mayor over the dc schools10 to the extent that congress sought to gislate beyond the two issues contemplated in the proposed education reform act it c ould pass legislation imp lementing any or all other aspects of the
