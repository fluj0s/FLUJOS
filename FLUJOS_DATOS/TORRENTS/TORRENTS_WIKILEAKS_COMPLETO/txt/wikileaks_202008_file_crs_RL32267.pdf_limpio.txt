powers resolution its application since enactment in 1973 providing detailed background on variety of cases where it was utilized or issues of its applicability were raised it will be revised biannually in the postcold war world presidents have continued to commit us armed forces into potential hostilities sometimes without spec ific authorization from congress thus the war powers resolution and its purposes continues to be potential subject of controversy on june 7 1995 the house defeated by vote of 217201 an amendment to repeal the central features of the war powers resolution that have been deemed unconstitutional by every president since the laws enactment in 1973 in 1999 after the president committed us military forces to action in yugoslavia without congressional authorization representative tom campbell used expedited procedures under the resolution to force debate and votes on us military action in ugoslavia and later sought unsuccessfully through federal court suit to enforce presidential compliance with the terms of the war powers resolution the war powers resolution pl 93148was passed over the veto of president nixon on november 7 1973 to provide procedures for congress and the president to participate in decisions to send us armed forces into hostilities section 4a1 requires the president to report to congress any introduction of us forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities when such report is submitted or is required to be submitted section 5b requires that the use of forces must be terminated within 60 to 90 days unless congress authorizes such use or extends the time period section 3 requires that the president in every possible instance shall consult with congress before introducing us armed forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities from 1975 through 2007 presidents have submitted 123 reports as the result of the war powers resolution but only one the 1975 mayaguez seizure cited section 4a1 which triggers the time limit and in this case the military action was completed and us armed forces had disengaged from the area of conflict when the report was made the reports submitted by the president since enactment of the war powers resolution cover range of military activities from embassy evacuations to full scale combat military operations such as the persian gulf conflict and the 2003 war with iraq the intervention in kosovo and the antiterrorism actions in afghanistan in some instances us armed forces have been used in hostile situations without formal reports to congress under the war powers resolution on one occasion congress exercised its authority to determine that the requirements of section 4a1 became operative on august 29 1983 through passage of the multinational force in lebanon resolution pl 98119 in 1991 and 2002 congress authorized by law the use of military force against iraq in several instances neither the president congress nor the courts have been willing to trigger the war powers resolution mechanism httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32267g22g145g142g561g25g138g155g561g18g152g160g142g155g156g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g497g561

constitution the war powers are divide d between congress and the president among other relevant grants congress has the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces article i section 8 while the president is commander in chief article ii section 2 it is generally agreed that the commander in chief role gives the president power to utilize the armed forces to repel attacks against the united states but there has long been controversy over whether he is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without declaration of war or other congressional authorization congressional concern about presidential use of armed forces without congressional authorization intensified after the korean conflict during the vietnam war congress searched for way to assert authority to decide when the united states should become involved in war or the armed forces be utilized in circumstances that might lead to hostilities on november 7 1973 it passed the war powers resolution pl 93148 over the veto of president nixon the main purpose of the resolution was to establish procedures for both branches to share in decisions that might get the united states involved in war the drafters sought to circumscribe the presidents authority to use armed forces abroad in hostilities or potential hostilities without declaration of war or other congressional authorization yet provide enough flexibility to permit him to respond to attack or other emergencies the record of the war powers resolution since its enactment has been mixed and after 30 years it remains controversial some members of congress believe the resolution has on some occasions served as restraint on the use of armed forces by presidents provided mode of communication and given congress vehicle for asserting its war powers others have sought to amend the resolution because they believe it has failed to assure congressional voice in committing us troops to potential conflicts abroad others in congress along with executive branch officials contend that the president needs more flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy and that the time limitation in the war powers resolution is unconstitutional and impractical some have argued for its repeal this report examines the provisions of the war powers resolution actual experience in its use from its enactment in 1973 through december 2007 and proposed amendments to it appendix lists instances which presidents have reported to congress under the war powers resolution and appendix b lists representative instances of the use of us armed forces that were not reported

senate although the latter is not technically correct it does serve to emphasize that the war powers resolution embodied in joint resolution which complies with constitutional requirements for lawmaking is law

collective judgment of both the congress and the president will apply to the introduction of united states armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances and to the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations section 2b points to the necessary and proper clause of the constitution as the basis for legislation on the war powers it provides that under article i section 8 of the constitution it is specifically provided that congress shall have the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution not only its own powers but also all other powers vested by the constitution in the government of the united states section 2c states the policy that the powers of the president as commander in chief to introduce us armed forces into situations of hostilities or imminent hostilities are exercised only pursuant to 1a declaration of war 2specific statutory authorization or 3a national emergency created by attack upon the united states its territories or possessions or its armed forces

with congress before introducing us armed forces into situations of hostilities and imminent hostilities and to continue consultations as long as the armed forces remain in such situations the house report elaborated considerable amount of attention was given to the definition of consultation rejected was the notion that consultation should be synonymous with merely being informed rather consultation in this provision means that decision is pending on problem and that members of congress are being asked by the president for their advice and opinions and in appropriate circumstances th eir approval of action contemplated furthermore for consultation to be meaningful the president himself must participate and all information relevant to the situation must be made available 1 the house version specifically called for consultation between the president and the leadership and appropriate committees this was changed to less specific wording in conference however in order to provide more flexibility 1 us congress hr 287 p 6

in certain situations of key importance is section 4a1 because it triggers the time limit in section 5b section 4a1 requires reporting within 48 hours in the absence of declaration of war or congressional authorization the introduc tion of us armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances some indication of the meaning of hostilities and imminent hostilities is given in the house report on its war powers bill the word hostilities was substituted for the phrase armed conflict during the subcommittee drafting process because it was considered to be somewhat broader in scope in addition to situation in which fighting actually has begun hostilities also encompasses state of confrontation in which shots have been fired but where there is clear and present danger of armed conflict imminent hostilities denotes situation in which there is clear potential either for such state of co nfrontation or for actual armed conflict 2 section 4a2 requires the reporting of the introduction of troops into the territory airspace or waters of foreign nation while equipped for combat except for deployments which relate solely to supply replacement repair or training of such forces according to the house report this was to cover the initial commitment of troops in situations in which there is actual fighting but some risk however small of the forces being involved in hostilities report would be required any time combat military forces were sent to another nation to alter or preserve the existing political status quo or to make the us presence felt thus for example the dispatch of marines to thailand in 1962 and the quarantine of cuba in the same year would have required presidential reports reports would not be required for routine port supply calls emergency aid measures normal training exercises and other noncombat military activities 3 section 4a3 requires the reporting of the introduction of troops in numbers which substantially enlarge united states armed forces equipped for combat already located in foreign nation the house report elaborated while the word substantially designates flexible criterion it is possible to arrive at commonsense understanding of the numbers involved 100 increase in numbers of marine guards at an embassysay from 5 to 10clearly would not be an occasion for report thousand additional men sent to europe under present circumstances does not significantly enlarge the total us troop strength of about 300000 already there however the dispatch of 1000 men to guantanamo bay cuba which now has complement of 4 000 would mean an increase of 25 which is substantial under this circumstance president kennedy would have been required to report to congress in 1962 when he raised the number of us military advisers in vietnam from 700 to 16000 4 2 us congress hr 287 p 7 3 us congress hr 287 p 7 4 us congress hr 287 p 8

provides that if report is transmitted during congressional adjournment the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate when they deem it advisable or if petitioned by at least 30 of the members of their respective houses shall jointly request the president to convene congress in order to consider the report and take appropriate action section 5b was intended to provide teeth for the war powers resolution after report is submitted or is required to be submitted pursuant to section 4a1 whichever is earlier section 5b requires the president to terminate the use of us armed forces after 60 days unless congress 1 has declared war or authorized the action 2 has extended the period by law or 3 is physically unable to meet as result of an armed attack on the united states the 60 days can be extended for 30 days by the president if he certifies that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of united states armed forces requires their continued use in the course of bringing about their removal section 5c requires the president to remove the forces at any time if congress so directs by concurrent resolution the effectiveness of this subsection is

derived from senate measure and was intended to prevent security treaty or military appropri ations act from being used to authorize the introduction of troops it was also aimed against using broad resolution like the tonkin gulf resolution 6 to justify hostilities abroad this resolution had stated that the united states was prepared to take all necessary steps including use of armed force to assist certain nations and it was cited by presidents and many members as congressional authorization for the vietnam war section 8b states that further specific statutory authorization is not required to permit members of united states armed forces to participate jointly with members of the armed forces of one or more foreign countries in the headquarters operations of highlevel military commands which were established prior to the date of enactment of this joint resolution and pursuant to the united nations charter or any treaty ratified by the united states prior to such date this section was added by the senate to make clear that the resolution did not prevent us forces from participating in certain joint military exercises with allied or friendly organizations or countries

command norad and the united nations command in korea section 8c defines the introduction of armed forces to include the assignment of armed forces to accompany regular or irregular military forces of other countries when engaged or potentially engaged in hostilities the conference report on the war powers resolution explained that this was language modified from senate provision requiring specific statutory authorization for assigning members of the armed forces for such purposes the report of the senate foreign relations committee on its bill said the purpose of this provision is to prevent secret unauthorized military support activities and to prevent repetition of many of the most controversial and regrettable actions in indochina the ever deepening ground combat involvement of the united states in south vietnam began with the assignment of us advisers to accompany south vietnamese units on combat patrols and in laos secretly and without congressional authorization us advisers were deeply engaged in the war in northern laos 7 section 8d states that nothing in the resolution is intended to alter the constitutional authority of either the congress or the president it also specifies that nothing is to be construed as granting any authority to introduce troops that would not exist in the absence of the resolution the house report said that this provision was to help insure the constitutionality of the resolution by making it clear that nothing in it could be interpreted as changing the powers delegated by the constitution section 9 is separability clause stating that if any provision or its application is found invalid the remainder of the resolution is not to be affected

operated on the national war powers powers divided by the cons titution in definitive fashion between the president and congress congress adopted the resolution in response to the perception that presidents had assumed more authority to send forces into hostilities than the framers of the constitution had intended for the commanderinchief president nixon in his veto message challenged the constitutionality of the essence of the war powers resolution and particularly two provisions 8 he argued that the legislative veto provision permitting congress to direct the withdrawal of troops by concurrent resolution was unconstitutional he also argued that the provision requiring withdrawal of troops afte r 6090 days unless congress passed legislation authorizing such use was unconstitutional because it checked presidential powers without affirmative congressional action every president since the enactment of the war powers resolution has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the presidents authority as commanderinchief 7 us congress srept 93220 p 24 8 united states president nixon message vetoing house jo int resolution 542 join t

constitutionality of the war powers resolution rests on differing interpretations by the two branches of the resp ective war powers of the president and congress these differing interpretations especially the assertions of presidential authority to send forces into hostile situations without declaration of war or other authorization by congress were the reason for the enactment of the resolution the congressional view was that the framers of the constitution gave congress the power to declare war meaning the ultimate decision whether or not to enter war most members of congress agreed that the president as commander in chief had power to lead the us forces once the decision to wage war had been made to defend the nation against an attack and perhaps in some instances to take other action such as rescuing american citizens but in this view he did not have the power to commit armed forces to war by the early 1970s the congressional majority view was that the constitutional balance of wa r powers had swung too far toward the president and needed to be corrected opponents argued that congress always held the power to forbid or terminate us military action by statute or refusal of appropriations and that without the clear will to act the war powers resolution would be ineffective in his veto message president nixon said the resolution would impose restrictions upon the authority of the president which would be dangerous to the safety of the nation and attempt to take away by mere legislative act authorities which the president has properly exercised under the constitution for almost 200 years the war powers resolution in section 2c recognized the constitutional powers of the president as commanderinchief to introduce forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities as exercised only pursuant to 1 declaration of war 2 spec ific statutory authorization or 3 national emergency created by attack upon the united states its territories or possessions or its armed forces the executive branch has contended that the president has much broader authority to use forces including for such purposes as to rescue american citizens abroad rescue foreign nationals where such action facilitates the rescue of us citizens protect us embassies and legations suppress civil insurrection implement the terms of an armistice or ceasefire involving the united states and carry out the terms of security commitments contained in treaties 9 g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g24g142g157g152g561 on june 23 1983 the supreme court in ins v chadha

law11 that permitted congress to disapprove by concurrent twohouse resolution12 since section 5c requires forces to be removed by the president if congress so directs by concurrent resolution it is constitutionally suspect under the reasoning applied by the court13 concurrent resolution is adopted by both chambers but it does not require presentment to the president for signature or veto some legal analysts contend nevertheless that the war powers resolution is in unique category which differs from statutes containing legislative veto over delegated authorities 14 perhaps more important some observers contend if majority of both houses ever voted to withdraw us forces the pr esident would be unlikely to continue the action for long and congress could withhold appropriations to finance further action because the war powers resolution contains separability clause in section 9 most analysts take the view that the remainder of the joint resolution would not be affected even if section 5c were found unconstitutional 15 congress has taken action to fill the gap left by the possible invalidity of the concurrent resolution mechanism for the withdrawal of troops on october 20 1983 the senate voted to amend the war powers resolution by substituting joint resolution which requires presentment to the president for the concurrent resolution in section 5c and providing that it would be handled under the expedited procedures in section 7 the house and senate conferees agreed not to amend the war powers resolution itself but to adopt free standing measure relating to the withdrawal of troops the measure which became w provided that any joint resolution or bill to require the removal of us armed forces engaged in hostilities outside the united states without declaration of war or specific statutory authorization would be considered in accordance with the expedited procedures of section 601b of the international security and arms export control act of 1976

provision of the war powers resolution section 5b requires the president to withdraw us forces from hostilities within 6090 days after report is submitted or required to be submitted under section 4a1 the triggering of the time limit has been major factor in the reluctance of presidents to report or congress to insist upon report under section 4a1 drafters of the war powers resolution included time limit to provide some teeth for congress in the event president assumed power to act from provisions of resolutions treaties or the constitution which did not constitute an explicit authorization the senate report called the time limit the heart and core of the bill that represents in an historic sense restoration of the constitutional balance which has been distorted by practice in our history and climatically in recent decades 19 the house report emphasized that the resolution did not grant the president any new authority or any freedom of action during the time limits that he did not already have administration officials have objected that the pr ovision would require the withdrawal of us forces simply because of congressional inaction during an arbitrary period since the resolution recognizes that the president has independent authority to use armed forces in certain circumstances they state on what basis can congress seek to terminate such independent authority by the mere passage of time20 in addition they argue the imposition of deadline interferes with successful action signals divided nation and lack of resolve gives the enemy basis for hoping that the president will be forced by domestic opponents to stop an action and increases risk to us forces in the field the issue has not been dealt with by the courts 18 hr 329 november 5 1993 p 2 see below

mayaguez recapture was the only war powers report to date to specifically cite section 4a1 but the question of the time limit was moot because the action was over by the time the report was filed among the problems revealed by these first four cases were differences of opinion between the two branches on the meaning of consultation the ford administration held that it had met the consultation requirement because the president had directed that congressional leaders be notified prior to the actual commencement of the introduction of armed forces the prevailing congressional view was that consultation meant that the president seek congressional opinion and take it into account prior to making decision to commit armed forces 22

one of the first cases to generate substantial controversy because it was never reported under the war powers resolution was the dispatch of us military advisers to salvador at the end of february 1981 the department of state announced the dispatch of 20 additional military advisers to salvador to aid its government against guerilla warfare there were already 19 military advisers in salvador sent by the carter administration the reagan administration said the insurgents were organized and armed by soviet bloc countries particularly cuba by march 14 the administration had authorized total of 54 advisers including experts in combat training the president did not report the situation under the war powers resolution state department memorandum said report was not required because the us personnel were not being introduced into hostilities or situations of imminent hostilities the memorandum asserted that if change in circumstances occurred that raised the prospect of imminent hostilities the resolution would be complied with justification for not reporting under section 4a2 was that the military personnel being introduced were not equipped for combat 24 they would it was maintained carry only personal side arms which they were authorized to use only in their own defense or the defense of other americans the state department held that section 8c of the war powers resolution was not intended to require report when us military personnel might be involved in training foreign military personnel if there were imminent involvement of us personnel in hostilities in the case of salvador the memorandum said us military personnel will not act as combat advisors and will not accompany salvadoran forces in combat on operational patrols or in any other situation where combat is likely on may 1 1981 eleven members of congress challenged the presidents action by filing suit on grounds that he had violated the constitution and the war powers resolution by sending the advisers to salvador eventually there were 29 coplaintiffs but by june 18 1981 an equal number of members 13 senators and 16 representatives filed motion to intervene in the suit contending that number of legislative measures were then pending before congress and that congress had ample opportunity to vote to end military assistance to salvador if it wished 23 us congress senate committee on

dismissed the suit she ruled that congress not the court must resolve the question of whether the us forces in salvador were involved in hostile or potentially hostile situation while there might be situations in which court could conclude that us forces were involved in hostilities she ruled the subtleties of factfinding in this situation should be left to the political branches she noted that congress had taken action to show it believed the presidents decision was subject to the war powers resolution25 on november 18 1983 federal circuit court affirmed the dismissal and on june 8 1984 the supreme court declined consideration of an appeal of that decision26 as the involvement continued and casualties occurred among the us military advisers various legislative proposals relating to the war powers resolution and salvador were introduced some proposals required specific authorization prior to the introduction of us forces into hostilities or combat in salvador 27 other proposals declared that the commitment of us armed forces in salvador necessitated compliance with section 4a of the war powers resolution requiring the president to submit report28 neither approach was adopted in legislation but the senate foreign relations committee reported that the president had clear obligation under the war powers resolution to consult with congress prior to any future decision to commit combat forces to salvador29 on july 26 1983 the house rejected an amendment to the defens authorization bill hr 2969 to limit the number of active duty military advisers in salvador to 55 unless the president reported any increase above that level under section 4a1 of the war powers resolution30 nevertheless the administration in practice kept the number of trainers at 55

military exercises in honduras in 1983 and subseq uent years raised the question of when military exercises should be reported under the war powers resolution section 4a2 requires the reporting of introduction of troops equipped for combat but exempts deployments which relate solely to training on july 27 1983 president reagan announced joint training exercises planned for central america and the caribbean the first contingent of us troops landed in honduras on august 8 1983 and the series of ground and ocean exercises continued for several years involving thousands of ground troops plus warships and fighter planes the president did not report the exercises under the war powers resolution he characterized the maneuvers as routine and said the united states had been regularly

congress on the other hand contended that the exercises were part of policy to support the rebels or contras fighting the sandinista government of nicaragua threatening that government and increased the possibility of us military involvement in hostilities in central america several members of congress called for reporting the actions under the war powers resolution but some sought other vehicles for congressional control in 1982 the boland amendment to the defense appropriations act had already prohibited use of funds to overthrow the government of nicaragua or provoke military exchange between nicaragua or honduras 31 variations of this amendment followed in subsequent years after press reports in 1985 that the option of invading nicaragua was being discussed the defense authorization act for fiscal year 1986 stated the sense of congress that us armed forces should not be introduced into or over nicaragua for combat 32 in 1986 after us helicopters ferried honduran troops to the nicaraguan border area congress prohibited us personnel from participating in assistance within land areas of honduras and costa rica within 120 miles of the nicaraguan border or from entering nicaragua to provide military advice or support to paramilitary groups operating in that country33 gradually the issue died with peace agreements in the region and the electoral defeat of the sandinista regime in nicaragua in 1990

the war powers resolution faced major test when marines sent to participate in multinational force in lebanon in 1982 became the targets of hostile fire in august 1983 during this period president reagan filed three reports under the war powers resolution but he did not report under section 4a1 that the forces were being introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities thus triggering the 6090 day time limit on september 29 1983 congress passed the multinational force in lebanon resolution determining that the requirements of section 4a1 of the war powers resolution became operative on august 29 1983 34 in the same resolution congress authorized the continued participation of the marines in the multinational force for 18 months the resolution was compromise between congress and the president congress obtained the presidents signature on legislation invoking the war powers resolution for the first time but the price for this concession was congressional authorization for the us troops to remain in lebanon for 18 months the events began on july 6 1982 when president reagan announced he would send small contingent of us troops to multinational force for temporary peacekeeping in lebanon chairman of the house foreign affairs committee clement zablocki wrote president reagan that if such force were sent the united states would be introducing forces into imminent hostilities and report under section 4a1 would be required when the forces began to land on august 25 president reagan reported but did not cite section 4a1 and said the agreement with 31 the initial statutory restriction was contained in the co ntinuing appropriations resolution for 1983 pl 97377 this was followed by 24 million ceiling on intelligence agency support in fy1984 32 sec 1451 of pl 99145

the departure of the palestine liberation organization force the marines in the first multinational force left lebanon on september 10 1982 the second dispatch of marines to lebanon began on september 20 1982 president reagan announced that the united states france and italy had agreed to form new multinational force to return to lebanon for limited period of time to help maintain order until the lawful authorities in lebanon could discharge those duties the action followed three events that took place after the withdrawal of the first group of marines the assassination of lebanon presidentelect bashir gemayel the entry of israeli forces into west beirut and the massacre of palestinian civilians by lebanese christian militiamen on september 29 1982 president reagan submitted report that 1200 marines had begun to arrive in beirut but again he did not cite section 4a1 saying instead that the american force would not engage in combat as result of inci dents in which marines were killed or wounded there was again controversy in congress on whether the presidents report should have been filed under section 4a1 in mid1983 congress passed the lebanon emergency assistance act of 1983 requiring statutory authorization for any substantial expansion in the number or role of us armed forces in lebanon it also included section 4b that stated nothing in this section is intended to modify limit or suspend any of the standards and procedures prescribed by the war powers resolution of 198335 president reagan reported on the lebanon situation for the third time on august 30 1983 still not citing section 4a1 after fighting broke out between various factions in lebanon and two marines were killed the level of fighting heightened and as the marine casualties increased and the action enlarged there were more calls in congress for invocation of the war powers resolution several members of congress said the situation had changed since the presidents first report and introduced legislation that took various approaches senator charles mathias introduced sjres 159 stating that the time limit specified in the war powers resolution had begun on august 31 1983 and authorizing the forces to remain in lebanon for period of 120 days after the expiration of the 60day period representative thomas downey introduced hjres 348 directing the president to report under section 4a1 of the war powers resolution senator robert byrd introduced sjres 163 finding that section 4a1 of the war powers resolution applied to the present circumstances in lebanon the house appropriations committee approved an amendment to the continuing resolution for fy1984 hjres 367 sponsored by representative clarence long providing that after 60 days funds could not be obligated or expended for peacekeeping activities in lebanon by united states armed forces unless the president had submitted report under section 4a1 of the war powers resolution similar amendment was later rejected by the full body but it reminded the administration of possible congressional actions on september 20 congressional leaders and president reagan agreed on compromise resolution invoking section 4a1 and authorizing the marines to remain for 18 months the resolution became the first legislation to be handled under the expedited procedures of the war powers resolution on september 28

sjres 159 by vote of 54 to 46 the house accepted the senate bill by vote of 253 to 156 as passed the resolution contained four occurrences that would terminate the authorization before eighteen months 1 the withdrawal of all foreign forces from lebanon unless the president certified continued us participation was required to accomplish specified purposes 2 the assumption by the united nations or the government of lebanon of the responsibilities of the multinational force 3 the implementation of other effective security arrangements or 4 the withdrawal of all other countries from participation in the multinational force 36 shortly afterward on october 23 1983 241 us marines in lebanon were killed by suicide truck bombing bringing new questions in co ngress and us public opinion about us participation on february 7 1984 president reagan announced the marines would be redeployed and on march 30 1984 reported to congress that us participation in the multinational force in lebanon had

reagan reported to congress consistent with the war powers resolution that he had ordered landing of approximately 1900 us army and marine corps personnel in grenada he said that the action was in response to request from the organization of eastern caribbean states which had formed collective security force to restore order in grenada where anarchic conditions had developed and to protect the lives of us citizens many members of congress contended that the president should have cited section 4a1 of the war powers resolution which would have triggered the 6090 day time limitation on november 1 1983 the house supported this interpretation when it adopted by vote of 40323 hj res 402 declaring that the requirements of section 4a1 had become operative on october 25 the senate did not act on this measure and conference was not held the senate had adopted similar measure on october 28 by vote of 64 to 20 but on november 17 the provision was deleted in the conference report on the debt limit bill to which it was attached 37 thus both houses had voted to invoke section 4a1 but the legislation was not completed on november 17 white house spokesman larry speakes said the administration had indicated that there was need for action as the combat troops would be out within the 6090 day time period speaker thomas oneill took the position that whether or not congress passed specific legislation the war powers resolution had become operative on october 25 by december 15 1983 all us combat troops had been removed from grenada eleven members of congress filed suit challenging the constitutionality of president reagans invasion of grenada district judge held that courts should not decide such cases unless the entire congress used the institutional remedies available to it38 an appellate court subsequently held that the issue was moot because the invasion had been ended39 36 pl 98119 signed october 12 1983 37 us congress hrept 98566 on hjres 308 senate

attention on the application of the war powers resolution to use of military force against international terrorism tensions between the united states and libya under the leadership of col muammar qadhafi had been mounting for several years particularly after terrorist incidents at the rome and vienna airports on december 27 1985 on january 7 1986 president reagan said that the rome and vienna incidents were the latest in series of brutal terrorist acts committed with qadhafis backing that constituted armed aggression against the united states the war powers issue was first raised on march 24 1986 when libyan forces fired missiles at us aircraft operating in the gulf of sidra in response the united states fired missiles at libyan vessels and at sirte the libyan missile site involved the us presence in the gulf of sidra an area claimed by libya was justified as an exercise to maintain freedom of the seas but it was widely considered response to terrorist activities subsequently on april 5 1986 terrorist bombing of discotheque in west berlin occurred and an american soldier was killed on april 14 president reagan announced there was irrefutable evidence that libya had been responsible and us air force planes had conducted bombing strikes on headquarters terrorist facilities and military installations in libya in response the president reported both cases to congress although the report on the bombing did not cite section 4a1 and the gulf of sidra report di d not mention the war powers resolution at all since the actions were short lived there was issue of force withdrawal but several members introduced bills to amend the war powers resolution one bill called for improving consultation by establishing special consultative group in congress 40 others called for strengthening the presidents hand in combating terrorism by authorizing the president notwithstanding any other provision of law to use all measures he deems necessary to protect us persons against terrorist threats41

war powers resolution became an issue in activit ies in the persian gulf after an iraqi aircraft fired missile on the uss stark on may 17 1987 killing 37 us sailors the attack broached the question of whether the iraniraq war had made the persian gulf an area of hostilities or imminent hostilities for us forces shortly afterwards the us adoption of policy of reflagging and providing naval escort of kuwaiti oil tankers through the persian gulf raised full force the question of whether us policy was risking involvement in war without congressional authorization during 1987 us naval forces operating in the gulf increased to 11 major warships 6 minesweepers and over dozen small patrol boats and battleshipled formation was sent to the northern arabian sea and indian ocean to augment an

deployments or military incidents under the war powers resolution although on may 20 1987 after the stark incident secretary of state shultz submitted report similar to previous ones consistent with war powers provisions but not mentioning the resolution reports were submitted after the uss bridgeton struck mine on july 24 1987 or the uschartered texacocaribbean struck mine on august 10 and us f14 fighter plane fired two missiles at an iranian aircraft perceived as threatening later however after various military incidents on september 23 1987 and growing congressional concern the president began submitting reports consistent with the war powers resolution and on july 13 1988 submitted the sixth report relating to the persian gulf42 none of the reports were submitted under section 4a1 or acknowledged that us forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities the reagan administration contended that the military incidents in the persian gulf or isolated incidents involving defensive reactions did not add up to hostilities or imminent hostilities as envisaged in the war powers resolution it held that imminent danger pay which was announced for military personnel in the persian gulf on august 27 1987 did not trigger section 4 a1 standards for danger pay namely subject to the threat of physical harm or danger on the basis of civil insurrection civil war terrorism or wartime conditions were broader than for hostilities of the war powers resolution and had been drafted to be available in situations to which the war powers resolution did not apply 43 some members of congress contended that if the president did not report under section 4a1 congress itself should declare such report should have been submitted as it had in the multinational force in lebanon resolution several resolutions to this effect were introduced some authorizing the forces to remain but none were passed44 the decisive votes on the subject took place in the senate on september 18 1987 the senate voted 5041 to table an amendment to the defense authorization bill s 1174 to apply the provisions of the war powers resolution the senate also sustained points of order against consideration of sjres 217 which would have invoked the war powers resolution on december 4 1987 and similar bill the following year sjres 305 on june 6 1988 the senate opted for different approach which was to use legislation to assure congressional role in the persian gulf policy without invoking the war powers resolution early in the situation both chambers passed measures requiring the secretary of defense to submit report to congress prior to the implementation of any agreement between the united states and kuwait for us military protection of kuwaiti shipping and such report was submitted june 15 1987 later the senate passed measure that called for comprehensive report by the president within 30 days and provided expedited procedures for joint resolution on the subject after an additional 30 days 45 the house did not take action on the bill as in the case of salvador some members took the war powers issue to court on august 7 1987 representative lowry and 110 other members of congress filed suit in the us district court for the district of columbia asking the court to declare that report was required under 42 for the reports see list above under section on reporting requirements 43 questions submitted to department of state and response s thereto march 30 1988 in war powers resolution relevant documents correspondence reports p 9799 44 bills to this effect in the house included hjres 387 introduced october 22 1987 which also authorized the continued presence of us forces in the gulf 45 byrdwarner amendment to sjres 194 adopted by senate october

holding it was nonjusticiable political question and that the plaintiffs dispute was primarily with fellow legislators46 compliance with the consultation requirement was also an issue the administration developed its plan for reflagging and offered it to kuwait on march 7 1987 prior to discussing the plan with members of congress june 15 1987 report to congress by the secretary of defense stated on the reflagging policy as soon as kuwait indicated its acceptance of our offer we began consultations with congress which are still ongoing 47 this was too late for congressional views to be weighed in on the initial decision after which it became more difficult to alter the policy subsequently however considerable consultation developed and the president met with various congressional leaders prior to some actions such as the retaliatory actions in april 1988 against an iranian oil platform involved in minelaying with recurring military incidents some members of congress took the position that the war powers resolution was not being complied with unless the president reported under section 4a1 or congress itself voted to invoke the resolution other members contended the resolution was working by serving as restraint on the president who was now submitting reports and consulting with congress 48 still other members suggested the persian gulf situation was demonstrating the need to amend the war powers resolution as result of the persian gulf situation in the summer of 1988 both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee which established special subcommittee on war powers undertook extensive assessments of the war powers resolution interest in the issue waned after ceasefire between iran and iraq began on august 20 1988 and the united states reduced its forces in the persian gulf area

on december 20 1989 president bush ordered 14000 us military forces to panama for combat in addition to 13000 already present on december 21 he reported to congress under the war powers resolution but without citing section 4a1 his stated objectives were to protect the 35000 american citizens in panama restore the democratic process preserve the integrity of the panama canal treaties and apprehend general manuel noriega who had been accused of massive electoral fraud in the panamanian elections and indicted on drug trafficking charges by two us federal courts the operation proceeded swiftly and general noriega surrendered to us military authorities on january 3 president bush said the objectives had been met and us forces were gradually withdrawn by february 13 all combat forces deployed for the invasion had been withdrawn leaving the st rength just under the 13597 forces stationed in panama prior to the invasion 46 lowry v reagan 676 f supp 333 ddc 1987 see also crs report rl30352 war

before his decision although he did notify them few hours in advance of the invasion members of congress had been discussing the problem of general noriega for some time before congress adjourned it had called for the president to intensify unilateral bilateral and multilateral measures and consult with other nations on ways to coordinate efforts to remove general noriega from power49 the senate had adopted an amendment supporting the presidents use of appropriate diplomatic economic and military options to restore constitutional government to panama and to remove general noriega from his illegal control of the republic of panama but had defeated an amendment authorizing the president to use us military force to secure the removal of general noriega notwithstanding any other provision of law 50 the panama action did not raise much discussion in congress about the war powers resolution this was in part because congress was out of session the first session of the 101st congress had ended on november 22 1989 and the second session did not begin until january 23 1990 when the operation was essentially over and it appeared likely the additional combat forces would be out of panama within 60 days of their deployment moreover the presidents action in panama was very popular in american public opinion nd supported by most members of congress because of the actions of general noriega after it was over on february 7 1990 the house passed hconres 262 which stated that the presid ent had acted decisively and appropriately in ordering united states forces to intervene in panama

toward actions authorized or supported by the united nations under the auspices of security council resolutions us forces were deployed in kuwait and iraq somalia former yugoslaviabosnia and haiti this raised the new issue of whether the war powers resolution applied to us participation in military actions it was not problem during the cold war because the agreement among the five permanent members required for security council actions seldom existed an exception the korean war occurred before the war powers resolution was enacted 51 the more basic issueunder what circumstances congressional authorization is required for us participation in military operationsis an unfinished debate remaining from 1945 whether congressional authorization is required depends on the types of action and is governed by the participation act pl 79264 as amended as well as by the war powers resolution and war powers under the constitution appropr iations action by congress also may be determinative as practical matter 49 pl 101162 signed november 21 1989 50 amendments to national drug control strategy bill s 1711 october 5 1989 51 in that case the soviet union had absented itself

appropriate act or joint resolution providing for the numbers and types of armed forces and facilities to be made available to the security council once the agreements have been concluded further congressional authorization is not necessary but such agreements have been concluded section 7 of the united nations participation act added in 1949 by pl 81341 authorizes the detail of up to 1000 personnel to serve in any noncombatant capacity for certain peaceful settlement activities the united states has provided personnel to several peacekeeping missions such as observers to the truce supervision organization in palestine since 1948 that appear to fall within the authorization in ction 7 of the participation act controversy has arisen when larger numbers of forces have been deployed or when it appears the forces might be serving as combatants the war powers resolution neither excludes united nations actions from its provisions nor makes any special procedures for them section 8a2 states that authority to introduce u s armed forces into hostilities shall not be inferred from any treaty unless it is implemented by legislation specifically authorizing the introduction and stating that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the war powers resolution52 one purpose of this provision was to ensure that both houses of congress be affirmatively involved in any us decision to engage in hostilities pursuant to treaty since only the senate approved treaty 53 from 1990 through 1999 congress primarily dealt with the issue on case by case basis but members also enacted some measures seeking more control over us participation in future peacekeeping actions wherever they might occur the defense appropriations act for fy1994 stated the sense of congress that funds should not be expended for us armed forces serving under security council actions unless the president consults with congress at least 15 days prior to deployment and not later than 48 hours after such deployment except for humanitarian operations 54 the defense authorization act for fy1994 required report to congress by april 1 1994 including

in tandem with the united nations organizing and obtaining international support and authorization for multilateral military action against iraq week after the invasion on august 9 president bush reported to congress consistent with the war powers resolution that he had deployed us armed forces to the region prepared to take action with others to deter iraqi aggression he did not cite section 4a1 and specifically stated i do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent the president did not consult with congressional leaders prior to the deployment but both houses of congress had adopted legislation supporting efforts to end the iraqi occupation of kuwait particularly using economic sanctions and multilateral efforts on august 2 shortly before its recess the senate by vote of 970 adopted sre s 318 urging the president to act immediately using unilateral and multilateral measures to seek the full and unconditional withdrawal of all iraqi forces from kuwaiti territory and to work for collective international sanctions against iraq including if economic sanctions prove inadequate additional multilateral actions under article 42 of the united nations charter involving air sea and land forces as may be needed senate foreign relations committee chairman pell stressed however that the measure did not authorize unilateral us military actions also on august 2 the house passed hr 5431 condemning the iraqi invasion and calling for an economic embargo against iraq the united nations imposed economic sanctions against iraq on august 7 and the united states and united kingdom organized an international naval interdiction effort 57 later on august 25 the security council authorized such measures as may be necessary to halt shipping and verify cargoes that might be going to iraq both houses adopted measures supporting the deployment but neither measure was enacted on october 1 1990 the house passed hjres 658 supporting the action and citing the war powers

deter iraqi aggression and to protect american lives and vital interest in the region as in the house senate leaders emphasized that the resolution was not to be interpreted as an openended resolution similar to the gulf of tonkin resolution the resolution made mention of the war powers resolution the house did not act on sconres 147 congress also supported the action by appropriating funds for the preparatory operation called operation desert shield and later for war activities called operation desert storm some members introduced legislation to establish special consultation group but the administration objected to formally established group on october 23 1990 senate majority leader mitchell announced that he and speaker foley had designated members of the joint bipartisan leadership and committees of jurisdiction to make themselves available as group for consultation on developments in the persian gulf by this time us land naval and air forces numbering more than 200000 had been deployed after the 101 st congress had adjourned president bush on november 8 1990 ordered an estimated additional 150000 troops to the gulf he incurred considerable criticism because he had not informed the consultation group of the buildup although he had met with them on october 30 on november 16 president bush sent second report to congress describing the continuing and increasing deployment of forces to the region he stated that his opinion that hostilities were not imminent had not changed the president wrote the deployment will ensure that the coalition has an adequate offensive military option should that be necessary to achieve our common goals by the end of the year approximately 350000 us forces had been deployed to the area as the prospect of war without congressional authorization increased on november 20 1990 representative ron dellums and 44 other democr atic members of congress sought judicial order enjoining the president from offensive military operations in connection with operation desert shield unless he consulted with and obtained an authorization from congress on november 26 11 prominent law professors filed brief in favor of such judicial action arguing that the constitution clearly vested congress with the authority to declare war and that federal judges should not use the political questions doctrine to avoid ruling on the issue the american civil liberties union also filed memorandum in favor of the plaintiffs on december 13 judge harold greene of the federal district court in washington denied the injunction holding that the controversy was not ripe for judicial resolution because majority of congress had not sought relief and the executive branch had not shown sufficient commitment to definitive course of action

powers resolution was that it established process by which congress could authorize the use of force in specific settings for limited purposes short of total state of war the question is sometimes raised why congress did not declare war against iraq speaker foley told the national press club on february 7 1991 that the reason we did not declare formal war was not because there is any difference i think in the action that was taken and in formal declaration of war with respect to military operations but because there is some question about whether we wish to excite or enact some of the domestic consequences of formal declaration of warseizure of property censorship and so forth which the president neither sought nor desired

authorize war and to take certain specified related actions the skaggs provision was stricken by the housesenate conference committee on hr 4103 as events developed beginning in late 1998 and

being introduced into somalia to achieve the objectives of security council resolution 794 he said the forces would remain only as long as necessary to establish secure environment for humanitarian

in hostilities but that the forces were equipped and ready to take such measures as might be needed to accomplish their humanitarian mission and defend themselves they would also have the support of any additional us forces necessary by mid january us forces in somalia numbered 25000 since the president did not cite section 4a1 the 60day time limit was not necessarily triggered by february however the us force strength was being reduced and it was announced the united states expected to turn over responsibility for protecting humanitarian relief shipments in somalia to force that would include us troops on march 26 1993 the security council adopted resolution 814 expanding the mandate of the force and bringing about transition from usled force to unled force unosom ii by the middle

constitute the specific statutory authorization under section 5b of the war powers resolution on may 25 1993 the house amended sjres 45 to authorize us forces to remain for one year sjres 45 was then

intensified and congress took action through other legislative channels in september 1993 the house and senate adopted amendments to the defense authorization act for fy1994 asking that the president consult with congress on policy toward somalia and report the goals objectives and anticipated jurisdiction of the us mission in somalia by october 15 1993 the amendments expressed the sense that the

off funds for us military operations in somalia after march 31 1994 unless the president obtained further spending authority from congress 64 congress approved the use of us military forces in somalia only for the protection of american military personnel and bases and for helping maintain the flow of relief aid by giving the forces security and logistical support it required that us combat forces in somalia remain under the command and control of us commanders under the ultimate direction of the president earlier some members suggested that the us forces in somalia were clearly in situation of hostilities or imminent hostilities and that if congress did not authorize the troops to remain the forces should be withdrawn within 60 to 90 da ys after letter from house foreign affairs committee ranking minority member benjamin gilman and senate foreign relations committee ranking minority member jesse helms assistant secretary wendy sherman replied on july 21 1993 that previous

in their view was intended to apply to sustained hostilities the state department di d not believe congressional authorization was necessary although congressional support would be welcome on august 4 1993 representative gilman asserted that august 4 might be rememb ered as the day the war powers resolution died because combat broke out in somalia on june 5 and the president had not withdrawn us forces and congress had decided to look the other way on october 22 1993 representative gilman introduced hconres 170 directing the president pursuant to section 5c of the war powers resolution to

clinton said he had called up the military reserve and ordered two aircraft carriers into the region his message to the military dictators was to leave now or the united states would force them from

authorizing the president to take military steps to deal with the parties responsible for the attacks on the united states between september 13 and 14 draft language of such resolution was discussed and negotiated by the presidents representatives and the house and senate leadership of both parties other members of both houses suggested language for consideration on friday september 14 2001 the text of joint resolution was introduced it was first considered and passed by the senate in the morning of september 14 as senate joint resolution 23 by vote of 980 the house of representatives passed it later that evening by vote of 4201 after tabling an identical resolution hjres 64 and rejecting motion to recommit by representative john tierney that would have had the effect if passed and enacted of requiring report from the president on his actions under the resolution every 60 days 79 senate joint resolution 23 titled the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on september 14 2001 was signed into law on september 18 200180 the joint resolution authorizes the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons the joint resolution further states that congress declares that this resolution is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution finally the joint resolution also states that nothing in this resolution supercedes any requirement of the war powers resolution notable feature of sjres 23 is that unlike all other major legislation authorizing the use of military force by the president this joint resolution authorizes military force against organizations and persons linked to the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states past authorizations of the use of force have permitted action against unnamed nations in specific regions of the world or against named individual nations this authorization of military action against organizations or persons is unprecedented in american history with the scope of its reach yet to be determined the authorization of use of force against unnamed nations is more consistent with some previous instances where authority was given to act against unnamed states as appropriate when they became aggressors or took military action against the united states or its citizens 81 president george w bush in signing sjres on september 18 2001 noted the congress had acted wisely decisively and in the finest traditions of our country he thanked the leadership of both houses for their role in expeditiously pass ing this historic joint resolution he noted that 79 for background on discussions

members of the congress since the september 11 attacks and that he would continue to consult closely with them as our nation responds to this threat to our peace and security president bush also asserted that sjres 23 recognized the authority of the president under the constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against the united states he also stated in signing this resolution i maintain the longstanding position of the executive branch regarding the presidents constitutional authority to use force including the armed forces of the united states and regarding the constitutionality of the war powers resolution 82 prior to its enactment there was concern among some in congress that the president might not adhere to the reporting requirements of the war powers resolution when he exercised the authority provided in sjres 23 there appeared to be general agreement that the president had committed himself to consult with the congress on matters related to his military actions against terrorists and those associated with the attacks on the united states on september 11 on september 24 2001 president bush reported to congress consistent with the war powers resolution and senate joint resolution 23 that in response to terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon he had ordered the deployment of various combatequipped and combat support forces to number of foreign nations in the central and pacific command areas of operations the president noted that as part of efforts to prevent and deter terrorism he might find it necessary to order additional forces into these and other areas of the world he stated that he could not now predict the scope and duration of these deployments nor the actions necessary to counter the terrorist threat to the united states subsequently on october 9 2001 president george w bush reported to congress consistent with the war powers resolution and senate joint resolution 23 that on october 7 2001 us armed forces began combat action in afghanista n against qaida terrorists and their taliban supporters the president stated that he had directed this military action in response to the september 11 2001 attacks on us territory our citizens and our way of life and to the continuing threat of terrorist acts against the united states and our friends and allies this military action was part of our campaign against terrorism and was designed to disrupt the use of afghanistan as terrorist base of operations thus in light of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks against united states territory and citizens the president and the congress after consultations agreed to course of legislative action that did not invoke the war powers resolution itself but substituted specific authorization measure sjres 23 pursuit of such an action is contemplated by the language of the war powers resolution itself as of the end of october 2001 president bush had chosen to state in his reports to congress that the military actions he had taken relating to the terrorists attacks were consistent with both the war powers resolution and senate joint resolution 23 his actions follow the practice of his white house predecessors in not formally citing the language of the war powers resolution in section 4a1 that would trigger military forces withdrawal timetable congress for its part in s j res 23 stated that this legislation constituted specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution it also noted that nothing in sjres 23 supercedes any requirement of the war powers resolution the president and the cong ress in sum maintained their respective 82 statement of the president on september 18 2001 presid ent signs authorization for use of

significant threat to us interests and security posed by the prospect that iraq had or was acquiring weapons of mass destruction senior members of the bush administration cited number of violations of security council resolutions by iraq regarding the obligation imposed at the end of the gulf war in 1991 to end its chemical biological and nuclear weapons programs on september 4 2002 president bush met with leaders from both houses and parties at the white house at that meeting the president stated that he would seek congressional support in the near future for action deemed necessary to deal with the threat posed to the united states by the regime of saddam hussein of iraq the president also indicated that he would speak to the united nations shortly and set out his concerns about iraq on september 12 2002 president bush addressed the general assembly and set out the history of iraqi misdeeds over the last two decades and the numerous times that iraq had not fulfilled its commitments to comply with various security council resolutions including disarmament since the gulf war of 1991 he stated that the united states would work with the security council to deal with iraqs challenge however he emphasized that if iraq refused to fulfill its obligations to comply with security council resolutions the united states would see that those resolutions were enforced 83 subsequently on september 19 2002 the white house sent draft joint resolution to house speaker dennis hastert house minority leader richard gephardt senate majority leader thomas daschle and senate minority leader trent lott this draft would have authorized the president to use military force not only against iraq but to restore international peace and security in the region subsequently introduced as sj res 45 on september 26 it served as the basis for an extensive debate over the desirability necessity and scope of new congressional authorization for the use of force the senate used this bill as the focus for debate which began after cloture was invoked on october 3 the senate debate continued from october 4 until october 11 2002 and involved consideration of numerous amendments to the measure in the end the senate adopted hj res 114 in lieu of sj res 45 the draft measure was not formally introduced in the house instead the vehicle for house consideration of the issue was hj res 114 cosponsored by speaker hastert and minority leader gephardt and introduced on october 2 2002 hj res 114 embodied modifications to the white house draft that were agreeable to the white house most house and senate republicans and the house democratic leader the house international relations committee reported out slightly amended version of the joint reso lution on october 7 2002 hr 721 the house adopted the

october 11 by vote of 7723 and president bush signed the authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002 into law on october 16 2002 84 in signing hjres 114 into law president bush noted that by passing this legislation the congress had demonstrated that the united states speaks with one voice on the threat to international peace and security posed by iraq he added that the legislation carried an important message that iraq will either comply with all resolutions rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and its support for terrorists or will be compelled to do so while the president noted he had sought resolution of support from congress to use force against iraq and appreciated receiving that support he also stated that my request for it did not and my signing this resolution does not constitute any change in the longstanding positions of the executive branch on either the presidents constitutional authority to use force to deter prevent or respond to aggression or other threats to us interests or on the constitutionality of the war powers resolution the president went on to state that on the importa nt question of the threat posed by iraq his views and goals and those of the congress were the same he further observed that he had extensive consultations with the congress in the past months and that he looked forward to continuing close consultation in the months ahead he stated his intent to submit written reports to congress every 60 days on matters relevant to this resolution85 the central element of pl 107243 is the authorization for the president to use the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing thr eat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq as predicates for the use of force the statute requires the president to communicate to congress his determination that the use of diplomatic and other peaceful means will not adequately protect the united states or lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations security council resolutions and that the use of force is consistent with the battle against terrorism like pl 1021 and pl 10740 the statute declares that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution it also requires the president to make periodic reports to congre ss on matters relevant to this joint resolution finally the statute expresses congress support for the efforts of the president to obtain prompt and decisive action by the security council to enforce iraqs compliance with all relevant security council resolutions public law 107243 clearly confers broad authority on the president to use force in contrast to pl 1021 the authority granted is not limited to the implementation of previously adopted security council resolutions concerning iraq but includes all relevant resolutions thus it 84 pl 107243 116 stat 1498 for detailed sidebyside comparison of the house and senate versions of the authorization of force

adopted by the security council in the future as well as those already adopted the authority also appears to extend beyond compelling iraqs disarmament to implementing th full range of concerns expressed in those resolutions unlike pl 10740 the presidents exercise of the authority granted is not dependent upon finding that iraq was associated in some direct way with the september 11 2001 attacks on the us moreover the authority conferred can be used for the broad purpose of defending the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq nevertheless pl 107243 is narrower than pl 10740 in that it limits the authorization for the use of force to iraq it also requires as predicate for the use of force that the president determine that peaceful means cannot suffice and that the use of force against iraq is consistent with the battle against terrorism it further limits the forc used to that which the president determines is necessary and appropriate finally as with pl 10740 the statutory authorization for use of force granted to the president in pl 107243 is not dependent for its exercise upon prior authorization by the security council in the form that pl 107243 is drafted and given the context in which it was debated one could argue that it is classic example of an authorization vehicle contemplated by the original war powers resolution g18g155g152g153g152g156g142g141g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 after 34 years of experience with it in practice controversy continues over the war powers resolutions effectiveness and appropriateness as system for maintaining congressional role in the use of armed forces in conflict one view is that the war powers resolution is basically sound and does not need amendment 86 those who hold this opinion believe it has brought about better communication between the two branches in times of crisis and has given congress vehicle by which it can act when majority of members wish to do so the resolution served as restraint on the use of armed forces by the president in some cases because of awareness that certain actions might invoke its provisions for example the threat of invoking the war powers resolution may have been helpful in getting us forces out of grenada in keeping the number of military advisers in salvador limited to 55 and in prodding congress to take stand on authorizing the war against iraq contrary view is that the war powers resolution is an inappropriate instrument that restricts the presidents effectiveness in foreign policy and should be repealed 87 those with this perspective believe that the basic premise of the war powers resolution is wrong because in it congress attempts excessive control of the deployment of us military forces encroaching on the responsibility of the president88 supporters of repeal contend that the president needs more flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy and that the time limitation in the war powers resolution is unconstitutional and impractical some holding this view contend that congress has 86 fascell representative dante b testimony us congress senate committee on

to inquire into support limit or prohibit specific uses of us armed forces if there is majority support the war powers resolution does not fundamentally change this equation it is argued but it complicates action misleads military opponents and diverts attention from key policy questions third view is that the war powers resolution has not been adequate to accomplish its objectives and needs to be strengthened or reshaped89 proponents of this view assert that presidents have continued to introduce us armed forces into hostilities without consulting congress and without congressional authorization presidents have cited section 4a1 on only one occasion mayaguezand by the time the action was reported it was virtually over holders of this third view have proposed various types of amendments to the war powers resolution these include returning to the version originally passed by the senate establishing congressional consultation group adding cutoff of funds and providing for judicial review general discussion of these categories of possible changes follows

g23g156g142g561 in 1977 senator thomas eagleton proposed that the war powers resolution return to the original language of the version passed by the senate and this proposal has been made several times since this would require prior congressional authorization for the introduction of forces into conflict abroad without declaration of war except to respond to or forestall an armed attack against the united states or its forces or to protect us citizens while evacuating them the amendment would eliminate the construction that the president has 60 to 90 days in which he can militarily act without authorization opponents fear the exceptions to forestall attacks or rescue american citizens abroad would serve as blanket authorization and might be abused yet might not allow the needed speed of action and provid adequate flexibility in other circumstances

president could maintain forces in hostile situations abroad without congressional authorization from 60 to 30 days or eliminate it altogether some proponents of this amendment contend the current war powers resolution gives the president 60 to 90 days to do as he chooses and that this provides too much opportunity for mischief or irreversible action the original senate version provided that the use of armed forces in hostilities or imminent hostilities in any of the emergency situations could not be sustained beyond 30 days without specific congressional authorization extendable by the president upon certification of necessity for safe disengagement opponents of this and related measures argue that they induce military opponents to adopt strategies to win given conflicts in congress that they could not win in the field over time 89 broadgauged proposal reflective of this view is s 564 use of force act introduced by senator biden on march 15 1995

has an automatic requirement for withdrawal of troops 60 days after the president submits section 4a1 report some members of congress favor replacing this provision with expedited procedures for joint resolution to authorize the action or require disengagement one of the main executive branch objections to the war powers resolution has been that the withdrawal requirement could be triggered by congressional inaction and that adversaries can simply wait out the 60 days by providing for withdrawal by joint resolution this amendment would also deal with the provision fo r withdrawal by concurrent resolution under cloud because of the chadha decision on the other hand joint resolution requiring disengagement could be vetoed by the president and thus would require twothirds majority vote in both houses for enactment g5g158g157g152g143g143g561g152g143g561g8g158g151g141g156g561 some proposals call for prohibiting the obligation or expenditure of funds for any use of us armed forces in violation of the war powers resolution or laws passed under it except for the purpose of removing troops 90 congress could enforce this provision by refusing to appropriate further funds to continue the military action this has always been the case some contend and would not work because congress would remain re luctant to withhold financial support for us armed forces once they were abroad g7g149g146g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g139g162g561g5g152g151g140g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561 many proposed amendments eliminate section 5c providing that us forces engaged in hostilities abroad without congressional authorization are to be removed if congress so directs by concurrent resolution and section 7 providing priority procedures for concurrent resolution those who hold this view contend the concurrent resolution section is invalid because of the chadha decision

establishing specific consultation group in congress for this purpose senators byrd nunn warner and mitchell have proposed the president regularly consult with an initial group of 6 membersthe majority and minority leaders of both chambers plus the speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate upon request from majority of this core group the president is to consult with permanent consultative group of 18 members consisting of the leadership and the ranking and minority members of the committees on foreign relations armed services and intelligence the permanent consultative group would also be able to determine that the president should have reported an introduction of forces and to introduce joint resolution of authorization or withdrawal that would receive expedited procedures 92 other members have favored consultation group but consider that amendment of the war powers resolution is not required for congress to designate such group93 on october 28 1993 house foreign affairs chairman lee hamilton introduced hr 3405 to establish standing consultative group its purpose would be to facilitate improved interaction between the executive branch and congress on the use of us military forces abroad including under the war powers resolution or united nations auspices members of the consultative group would be appointed by the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate after consultation with the minority leaders the group would include majority and minority representatives of the leadership and the committees on foreign policy armed services intelligence and appropriations another proposal would attempt to improve cons ultation by broadening the instances in which the president is required to consult this proposal would cover all situations in which president is required to report rather than only circumstances that invoke the time limitation as is now the case 94

to give standing to members to assert the interest of the house or senate but whether it would impel courts to exercise jurisdiction is uncertain most recent federal court decisions have rejected war

the cold war the question has been raised whether the war powers resolution should be amended to facilitate or restrain the president from supplying forces for actions without congressional approval
