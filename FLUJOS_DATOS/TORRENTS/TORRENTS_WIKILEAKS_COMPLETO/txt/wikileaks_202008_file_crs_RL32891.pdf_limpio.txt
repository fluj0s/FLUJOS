knowledge center was dedicated on september 10 2004 and is located at the department of energys lawrence livermore national laboratory this center operates as an independent center though its work is closely coordinated with that of the nbacc facility centers while funding for the bkc originates from within the biological countermeasures portfolio the bkc is funded independently not as com ponent of the nbacc program13 the bkc draws on the expertise of scientists at lawrence livermore national laboratory and three additional national laboratories the pacific northwest national laboratory sandia national laboratories and oak ridge national laboratory three department of homeland security university centers of excellence located at the university of minnesota the university of southern

facility component centers executes piece of this overall program mission also the biodefense knowledge center appears to collaborate with these centers to assist them in meeting mission goals the biological threat characterization center is to conduct studies and laboratory experiments designed to find and address critical gaps in understanding current and future biological threats assess vulnerabilities conduct risk assessments and determine potential impacts 16 an apparent goal of this program is to provide sciencebased assessment of possible biological threats focusing on those pathogens deemed by the centers for disease control and prevention to have the potential for high consequence types of research to be performed in characterizing biological threats include but are not limited to investigating potential biothreat pathogens studying pathogen stability and viability and assessing lethality through doseresponse studies 17 an earlier presentation on nbacc program

construction of the nbacc facility along with new laboratory space for other federal agencies at the fort detrick site has been identified as beneficially spurring investment and development in the surrounding area27 some local advocates and citizen groups have protested the construction of the nbacc facility though28 they cite concerns regarding security safety and secrecy surrounding the facility29 the dhs operates the nbacc facility as an ffrdc overseen in manner akin to the department of energy national laboratorie s the nbacc ffrdc contractor has the responsibility for enacting the projects and program developed by the nbacc program office this includes bringing the existing interim centers into the new nbacc facility when constructed and continuing those activities currently

of the nbacc program and component centers are transparent and actively overseen may become an area of congressional interest two factors have contributed to an increased focus by biosecurity advocates on nbacc research activities the degree to which classified research may be performed by the nbacc program and the extent and quality of review for compliance with the biological and toxin weapons convention bwc because of the potential for classified research to be performed at the nbacc facility some biodefense experts have identified the lack of transparency as problematic for international relations and treaty compliance 30 other experts assert that such issues of transparency can be dealt with so long as process for review and compliance with applicable treaties is developed and maintained these issues and the departments efforts to address these factors are described below 26 the construction contract for the nba cc facility is reportedly fixed cost c ontractors liability contract where the contractor is liable for any additional costs above those agr eed upon in the contract thus the 141 million is described by dhs as ceiling above which the total

classified and unclassified activities will change depending on agency need and future planning thus the extent to which the capability to perform classified research will be utilized is undetermined34 initially only portion of the nbacc facility may operate under classified circumstances with this amount increasing or decreasing depending on evolving research priorities the nbacc ffrdc rfp provides some expectations for the ffr dc contractors future capabilities though stating the government has estimated final operations work force at 120 people with virtually all of them 95 requiring tssci clearance the offerors are expected to propose strategy and commensurate workforce for initial operations and transition the government estimates that 2025 of the contractors workforce during initial operations will require tssci clearances the government estimates that 4060 of the contractors workforce during transition will require tssci clearances 35 requiring that virtually all of the nbacc ffrd c workforce be eligible for and eventually possess clearance for classified information may provide advantages over requiring only sub section of the workforce to obtain requisite clearance one advantage may be increased flexibility in workforce management given changing workload another may be an increased ability to generate synergy between research skills and knowledge due to larger pool of qualified researchers able to converse about particular problem 36 conversely some experts are concerned about the potential proliferation of dualuse research results and biological

those research activities being performed40 strong internal oversight and review of these research activities may allay some of these concerns or suspicions as put by petro and carus thus any federal

separately from the research program offices so that reseach management and compliance oversight activities do not become conflated currently all nbacc research activities are reviewed and compliance determinations are made before the research activities begin if questions persist about whether research activity may pose compliance concern the compliance assurance program office and the compliance review group are empowered to require additional clarifying information be presented before compliance determination is made should the compliance review group not reach consensus regarding particular research activity the final judgement is reportedly made by the dhs secretary who is obligated to ensure dhs activities are in compliance 46 while such an internal compliance review process may be robust some arms control experts have been critical of compliance processes that remain entirely internal to single agency such critics assert that interagency review or review performed or coordinated through the white house for example through the national security council or the homeland security council would provide greater expert input and further divorce the compliance review from the programmatic and budgetary aspects of research program 47 other possible mechanisms for review of potentially contentious research exist outside of the department to assess federal research and development programs that may have potential dual use capabilities the department of health and human services has established the national science advisory board for biosecurity this boards duties include providing expert advice on ways to minimize potential misuse of dualuse research 48 the nsabb is expected to generate guidance on assessing dualuse research through local oversight at research institutions the nsabb was not given responsibility to view or assess classified research programs so might be of limited utility in overseeing such research

enact while the ability for outside observers to identify and understand the activities underway at the nbacc facility and funded through the nbacc program is deemed by some experts as key to maintaining international confidence in the us biodefense program such openness must preserve the protection granted to information deleterious to national security 49 it is difficult to determine

information restriction is matter of contention some arms control experts claim that openness in the us biodefense program should be held as the model for other countries other biosecurity experts assert that special care must be taken to assure that information that would disclose potential vulnerability is not inadvertently released once possible mechanism is the inclusion of local community members into the oversight process for nbacc research in other areas of contentious biological research local review boards such as institutional biosecurity boards have been used to oversee research activities typically the primary purpose of an ibc is to ensure that recombinant dna research follows the nih guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules 50 ibcs are required by nih guidelines to seat community members on the committee in addition to scientists and safety officials from the institution ibcs have also been highlighted as possible mechanisms for implementation of nsabb recommendations the dhs has stated that an ibc will be established at the nbacc facility but it is unclear what role the ibc would have in assessing research programs inclusion of such persons may be problematic in light of the potential for classified or lawenforcement sensitive nature of some activities the establishment of an ibc at nbacc may provide potential public oversight mechanism reassuring the local community and others with respect to the research being performed at nbacc some advocates have assailed the utilit of the ibcs though asserting that the ibcs often do not provide effective oversight of research facilities where they are established 51 another possible mechanism might be developing independent external oversight of research activities using scientific experts possibly using members of the national academies to assess research programs52 the dhs has established an advisory committee through the national academies to provide input into the nbacc research process53 the advisory committees suggestion and activities have not as yet been widely discussed or publicized formalizing the committee input mechanism or more widely disseminating the results of the advisory committees activities may be considered by critics as sufficient to allay transparency concerns the department of homeland security states that research performed by the department is solely for defensive purposes will be in accord with treaty obligations and will be published to the maximum extent possible in the open scientific literature54 as such they are committed to 50 while ibcs are responsible for oversight of recombinant dna research these responsibilities need not be so restricted the nih guidelines are requirements for recipients of nih funding regarding recombinant

arms cont rol community and increasingly within congress is the lack of clear research plan fo r nbacc programs or for the nbacc facility56 the research performed through the nbacc program is designed to fill in knowledge gaps regarding pathogens test the effectiveness of biological countermeasures and to assess the risk posed by new and future activities in biological science57 such research will likely span both classified and unclassified areas arms control experts have expressed concern that the research being considered at the nbacc facility may not be properly based on risk but instead might be based on other characteristics such as potential consequence or the ability of nation state to develop such weapon these experts suggest that more proper prioritization would focus on the capabilities of terrorists rather than rogue nations they also suggest that improper prioritization of research activities may lead to an arms race in the biodefense community as scientists engaged in biodefense attempt to develop countermeasures to more dangerous pathogens developed in their own laboratories 58 since the nbacc program deals with matters of homeland security public oversight of its research activities might compromise homeland security if that is the case some advocates argue that robust prioritization and planning mechanism should be developed so that the mechanism itself can be reviewed 59 they argue that such an activity will bolster confidence that proper prioritization and planning activities will occur even if the results of those activities are not available others might argue that such structures already exist and are in place citing the array of advisory boards and committees available to dhs in developing strategic planning60 since the continued ruppe

for the national bio and agrodefense facility the increase in bsl4 laboratory space is likely to result in corresponding increase in the number of scientists trained in the techniques required to handle contagious deadly pathogens some posit that such an increase will lead to further dissemination of information regarding biothreat agents possibly to scientists who oppose the united states62 others argue that the increase in bsl4 laboratory facilities and trained scientists will lead to more robust biodefense capability providing more rapid breakthroughs in pathogen identification and countermeasure development63 the construction of dhs bsl4 facility dedicated to threat characterization has raised community fears with regard to potential pathogen leakage theft or loss and possible indirect health impacts 64 similar concerns have been raised regarding the construction of the niaid bsl4 facilities65 the dhs and dod assert that such release is unlikely given the high safety requirements of bsl4 facility66 continued council for the department of homeland securitys science and technology directorate this advisory council dissolved in 2005 the department also requested

nbacc facility coordinate their efforts with other federal agencies may attract congressional interest when the department of homeland security was formed most programs addressing medical countermeasures to biological threats remained under the authority of the department of health and human services hhs most civilian programs addressing nonmedical countermeasures such as t hose funded by the department of energy were transferred to the department of homeland security67 with the establishment of the nbacc facility research and development activities in some areas being pursued by the btcc would be closely related to those supported by hhs68 results of such dhs research and development activities could also help inform and shape policy and research agenda in other departments for example the risk assessment activities undertaken by dhs could potentially aid in informing hhs strategic deliberations69 the dhs secretary is charged with coordinating homeland security research and development activities across the federal government if coordination is wellmanaged the effectiveness of research and development activities would be optimized results from dhs testing and evaluation of biological countermeasures for exam ple might inform new research areas for hhs to support on the other hand if coordination is ineffective significant overlap and duplication of effort may occur between agencies additionally effective coordination between the nb fac and the federal bureau of investigation fbi would be necessary for prompt forensics response following bioterrorism incident the nbfac has in its interim space completed processing of thousands of forensic samples in support of bioterrorbiocrime cases for the fbi acting as the lead federal facility for bioforensic analysis 70 the fbi has entered into contracts with department of energy laboratories to perform forensics and attribution activities for nuclear materials71 lessons learned from these activities may lower barriers to effective interagency actions following biological attack some coordinative activities designed to leverage the nbacc facility capabilities are already underway the dhs acting through the science and technology directorate has entered into the interagency biomedical research confederation at fort detrick this group consists of agencies and institutes engaged in medical or biotechnology research at fort detrick and also includes representatives from the national institutes of health the agricultural research service the centers for disease control and prevention and the

the feasibility study performed for nbacc identified several potential routes for the construction of nbacc phased approach in which the bkc was initially formed outside of the fort detrick facility and then incorporated into the facility at later date was one route identified another was the construction of the nbacc facility with the bkc integrated within it the bkc was instead established separately at lawrence livermore national laboratory and now appears to be center independent of the nbacc facility and nbacc program the bkc in its data collection analysis and dissemination capabilities appears to play similar role to the nbacc program and facility the degree to which information needs and gaps identified by one of the centers may be filled by the other center may rest heavily on internal communications and interactions efficient information sharing and planning may play key role in maximizing the effectiveness of both centers
