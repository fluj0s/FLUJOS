6205c17 shspec146 auditing errors there are two types of auditing activity in which you engage 1 rudiments type of activity you are trying to straighten something out right now not to dig something up done against the needle 2 auditing activity done against the tone arm long wide sweeps of the needle may count as ta motion here you are trying to dig something up you have to get good at sliding from one type of activity to the other say the pc suddenly declares that the list is complete you have to shift fast to middle ruds and check for missed withholds there are also negative middle ruds eg in this session have you tried not to withhold anything or in this session have you tried not to invalidate anything suppress anything etc there are two reasons why your pc keeps picking up more and more missed withholds one is that you have missed withhold and the other is that the pc is strenuously and attentively keeping his ruds in running the session and being very careful not to withhold etc it doesnt matter what you use as middle rudiment it could be an endtype rud halftruths untruths etc or whatever seems to be needed to keep the body of the session going the faster you get the rud in the better you are not looking for more than clean needle even if it only stays clean for ten seconds if you want rudiment to stay in you get your session ruds in and use the body of the session to prepcheck particular rudiment so it will stay cleaned up you can drive yourself and the pc nuts by not acknowledging everything the pc says in answer to your questions even if what the pc says doesnt actually answer up you have to be clever in prepchecking to probe around and actually help the pc to find out things he didnt know about it is possible that there will be chain and that the overt will blow after he tells it to you when you are doing rudiments dont go into process to handle an outrud until you have given it several chances to blow by inspection if you do run process get in and out fast treat it as lightly as possible the best ruds process is the one that gets the ruds in fastest time spent on ruds is time robbed from the session so dont get started handling ruds if you can avoid it just dust them off pcs will obligingly get rid of things that you dont seem to think are very important when you are in the body of prepcheck you want to give some importance to the overts you are searching for by apparently taking responsibility for the pcs overts just to the degree of being very interested and thorough about getting them you throw an element of responsibility into the session and the pc will come up with more data
