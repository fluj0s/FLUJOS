research and analysis has been relatively limited on the topic of the relationship between depreciated dolla r and any impact on foreign purchases of us firms there is also relativel limited amount of information on this topic nevertheless direct i nvestment transactions as whol seem to be tied more directly to the relative rates of economic growth between economies as well as expected longrun rates of return nd other economic factors th an to relatively shortterm movements in the exchange rate of the dollar actual and expected movements in the exchange rate may influence the timing and the magnitude of foreign investors decisions but little research has been done on this issue firms also engage in variety of t actics to nullify or mitigate the effects of movements in the exchange rate wh ich would weaken the linkage between movements in the exchange rate and direct investment transactions us and foreign multinational firms have come to raise significant part of their investment funds in the capital markets in which they are investing which also lessens the impact of movements in the exchange rate furthermore us and foreign multinational firms have become skilled at using various techniques to hedge the risks of changes in exchange rates this report assesses the current state of knowledge concerning the role of exchange rate movements in direct investment transacti ons

and the dollar since 2002 the dollar has depreciated agai nst broad basket of currencies and against the euro this depreciation has pr ompted some observers to question whether the cheap nominal dollar is leading to fire sale of us firms especially of those firms that can be identified as part of the nations defense i ndustrial base while some aspects of foreign investment have been studied extensively by academics and others relatively few economic studies ve addressed the linkage between direct investment and movements in the exchan ge rate and even those studies have produced mixed results in general terms most economists argue that depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar is not the key factor that drives the decision by most foreign firms to invest in the united states although th corresponding appreciation of foreign currencies would lower the cost of assets acquired in th united states the lower value of the dollar however means that the value of returns from us assets are reduced as well which would leave the ove rall rate of return on such investments unchanged10 in one study two economists argu that an appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the do llar could boost foreign direct investment in the united states because the appreciation leads to increased wealth for foreign firms relative to their us counterparts and greater acce ss to lowcost funds in local markets11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34000crs4 11 continued an imperfect capital markets approach the quarterly journal of economics november 1991 pp 11911217 12 bloningen bruce

cambridge mass national bureau of economic research 1988 p 2 14 for the purposes of this analysis chinese direct investment in the united states is not continuedanother economist argues that appreciati on of the yen in the 1980s provided some impetus for japanese firms to increase their direct investments in the united states because the appreciated yen lowered the price of certain firmspecific assets such as technology and managerial skills but that it did not necessarily improve the nominal returns to japanese firms12 actual and expected changes in the exchange rate of the dollar may well influence the timing and the magnitude of foreign investors decisions but little research has been done on this issue foreign direct investment and gdp generally economists argue that relative rates of growth between the us and foreign economies are indicative of relative rates of return and corporate profitability and therefore are key factor s in determining the direc tion and magnitude of capital flows including direct investment flows13 these flows also are affected by relative rates of inflation taxes in terest rates and expecta tions about the performance of national economies which means they can be quite volatile at times since the mid 1990s combination of strong growth and low inflation in the us economy likely were the main factors in attracting foreig n investors the sheer size of the us economy the vast number of investment opportunities and the relative liquidity of the market likely also enhance the appeal of investments in the united states from 2002 to 2005 us direct investment abroad was more than twice the amount foreigners invested in the us economy re flecting the period of slower growth in the us economy from 20012003 both us dir ect investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the united states increased in 2006 and 2007 reflecting both the stronger rate of growth of the us economy and growth in corporate earnings table 1

relative magnitudes of the act ual values involved the da ta also show the similarity in trends between us direct investment ab road and foreign direct investment in the united states such similarity seems counterintuitive since inward and outward investment flows are thought by some to be substitutes if they are substitutes us direct investment abroad w ould be expected to be strongest during periods when the us economy is not performin g well relative to foreign economies and foreign direct investment in the united states would be expected to be weak instead during periods when us direct inve stment abroad is strong fore ign direct investment in the united states is also strong and vice versa us direct investment abroad and foreig n direct investment in the united states may follow similar investment trends over time as firms in both the united states and in foreign markets respond to increases or decreases in demand for goods and services as the us economy expands or contr acts respectively for instance as the us rate of economic growth rises us firms would increase their investments at home in response to improved profitability nd stronger sales in addition these firms may well increase their investments abroad as production by foreign firms increases to meet the higher level of demand in the united states although us foreign affiliates export only about 10 of their worldwide production back to the united states increased levels of exports by foreign firms and the correspondingly higher levels of production abroad ma well stimulate produc tion and investment abroad by the foreign affiliates of us firms overall the data provide some suppor t for the general conclusion that the inflows and outflows of direct investment ar tied more directly to the overall rate of growth in the economy than they are to move ments in the exchange rate of the dollar nevertheless movements in the exchange rate of the dollar likely affect flows of direct investment through common linkages to the rate of growth in the economy and as firms adjust their payments of remi ttances in response to movements in the exchange value of the dollar to the extent that the rate of growth of us gdp movements in the dollar and direct investment flows are interrelated these interrelationships complicate efforts to separate out cause and effect chains of influence and the relative importance of any one factor the data in table 1 generally tend to support th concept that the rate of growth in the us economy as reflected by us gdp likely has greater influence on direct investment flows than does the exchange rate of the dollar data from table 1 on us gdp the nominal broad index of the dollar price of basket of foreign currencies and an inde x of foreign direct investme nt in the united states are shown in figure 2 again the index numbers for th dollar are constructed such that rise in the value of the index indicates that it takes more dollars per unit of foreign currency or that foreign currencies ve appreciated relative to the dollar if movements in the exchange rate of the dollar were key factor in driving inflows and outflows of foreign direct i nvestment then it would be reasonable to assume that the index for the dollar and for foreign direct investment in the united states in figure 2 would move in similar directions in other words rise in the exchange rate of the dollar to foreign currencies means that it would take morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34000crs7 dollars to buy foreign currency or that the dollar had depreciated in value relative to the foreign currency so that it would be ss costly for foreign investors then an appreciation in the value of foreign curre ncies and corres ponding depreciation in the value of the dollar would be accompanied by an increase in foreign direct investment in us businesses because such purchases would be cheaper in foreign currency such similar movement in the exchange rate of the dollar and foreign direct investment in the united states is observed from 2005 to 2007 time during which the annual rate of growth in the us economy is slowing likewise depreciation in the value of foreign currencies and an appreciation in the value of the dollar would be expected to be accompanied by decrease in foreign direct investment in the united states during the 2000 to 2002 period this type of relationship seemingly held as the dollar appreciated and foreign direct investment declined in addition as the dollar depreciated between 2002 and 2004 foreign direct investment increased th relationship however did not hold in 2004 as the dollar depreciated and as foreign direct investment declined the similarities between the general trend in foreign direct investment in the us economy and the rate of growth of the us economy as represented by the index numbers for gdp lends some support to the conclusion that th rate of growth in the economy is likely to be more important factor influencing the flows of dir ect investment than is the exchange rate of the dollar direct investment movements in the exchange rate and the relative rate of growth in us gdp likely are interrelated in number of ways that significantly complicates efforts to separate out the various chains of influence to determine direct cau seeffect relationships in addition to the nominal values fo r us and foreign direct

working paper 9715 may 2003foreign direct investment and capital markets there are number of factors that complicate efforts to determine cause effect relationship between m ovements in the exchange ra and direct investment first both direct investment and the exchange rate are closely related to the relative rate of growth of the domes tic economy and it may not be po ssible to separate out the individual effects second one characteristic of multina tional firms is that they utilize foreign and international capital markets15 to the extent that firms can raise funds in the market in which they are inves ting they can blunt exchange rate effects and weaken an expected relationship between movements in the exchange rate and direct investment third multinational firms have become skilled at using specialized foreign currency markets and foreign currency derivatives that help them reduce the risk and the economic impact of changes in exchange rates such activities likely would lessen the impact of changes in exchange rates on direct investment transactions most economists believe that the exchange rate of the dollar generally is determined by the relative longterm performance of the economy although the1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 year0100200300400 1002000 100 dollaryen exchange rate indexjapanese direct investment in the us source crs from us department of

move abruptly over the short run as result of factors specific to indi vidual currencies efforts to model and predict movements in the exchange rate of the dollar have prove n to be particularly vexing because number of factors can affect the value of the dollar and other currencies in the short run one factor complicating efforts to determine cause effect relationship between movements in the exchange rate and direct investment is the apparent similarity between the inflows and outflows of direct investment as mentioned previously in most cases it would seem reasonabl to assume that inward and outward direct investment generally would move in opposite directions in response to movements in the exchange rate and act somewhat as substitutes for one another in fact inward and outward flows of direct i nvestment have tended to trend in the same direction over time one possible explanation for this similarity is that the inward and outward flows of direct investment ar affected by the same underlying forces principally the relative rate of growth of the us economy compared to other economies the difficulties involved in unraveling the interrelationships between direct investment flows the relative ra of growth of various economies and movements in the exchange rate significantly complicate any efforts to isolate the relationship between direct inve stment and the exchange rate during periods when the us economy is growing at relatively more rapid pace than are other developed economies fo reign firms are encouraged to invest in us businesses since profits in those firms would be expected to be strong at the same time rising corporate earnings ssociated with growing economy would encourage us firms to step up their i nvestment spending both domestically and abroad since the commanding role of th us economy in the global economy means that the performance of the us economy would tend to have positive effect on economic performance abroad the advan ced development of us and global financial markets and the rapid pace of globalization in trade and investment activities likely means that the us and global economies are becoming increasingly intertwined which would increase the pr ospect that economic events would be transmitted more rapidly between the us and other economies strong performance in the us economy so tends to draw in foreign capital in various forms that adds to upward pressu re on the dollar so that the exchange rate of the dollar and the rate of growth in the economy would experience any number of direct indirect secondhand and cross effects thirdhand both the rate of growth of us gdp and the exchange rate of the dollar increased through the 1998 to 2000 period as the rate of growth of th economy slowed in the 2000 to 2002 period however the dollar continued to appreciate due in part to the mix of macroeconomic policies in the united states that attract ed inflows of capital since 2002 however the exchange rate of the dollar has depreciated against the euro and broad basket of currencies despite gene ral improvement in the rate of growth of us gdp sources of direct investment funds the data in table 1 also indicate that there are differences between us and foreign firms in the sources of their funds which likely lessens the impact of movements of the dollar on both us and fore ign direct

capitalmarket imperfections and investment journal of economic literature march 1998 pp 193225foreign firms make little use of intercompany debt to finance their investments instead multinational firms raise the bulk of their funds internally or in the particular foreign markets in which they are operating especially if those markets are in advanced developed economies as re sult this apparent preference for host country sources of financing would reduce the impact of movements in the exchange rate on crossborder flows of direct investment16 since nearly threefourths of us direct investment abroad is in highl developed economies with welldeveloped capital and equity markets similar to those in the united states us firms generally raise the funds they need in those markets in 1998 and 1999 as the us economy was growing at rapid rate us multinational firms financed their investments abroad with combination of equity capital reinvested earnings and intercompany debt as the us parent companies loaned funds to their foreign affiliates since 1999 intercompany debt has played smaller role in financing overseas investme nts instead equity capital and reinvested earnings have accounted for over 90 of the source of funds to the foreign affiliates of us parent companies with reinvested earnings acc ounting for about 60 of the funds the foreign affilia tes of us firms invested over the 20002007 period in contrast the affiliates of foreign firms operating in the united states relied heavily on us equity markets to finan ce over 80 of their investments during the 19992007 period reinvested earnings played significant role in financing the investments of foreign firms only in 2004 and 2005 when the declining value of the dollar combined with the increased rate of growth of the us economy to encourage foreign firms to reinvest the profits they raised in the united states back into their us affiliates this reliance on domestic sources of capital means that the relative importance of the exchange rate as factor that affects the investment decisions of firms likely varies over time depending on other economic factors especially the overall performance of the economy taxe s and the performance of corporate earnings international role of the dollar and derivatives volatility in the exchange value of the dollar has spurred many multinational firms to act to protect themselves against such fluctuations as result firms and other enterprises that deal in foreign currencies have become accustomed to participating in what is rmed over the counter curre ncy transactions that are aimed at reducing the risks and mitigating the effects of changes in the exchange value of the dollar the growth in the us economy and the growth in the international role of the

be of concern to congre ss which has shown heightened level of interest in the role and presence of foreignowned firms in the economy since september 11 2001 there is little academic re search and much still to be learned about the role of the exchange rate in the decisionmaking process of us and foreign multinational firms but movements in the exchange rate do not appear to be major factor in driving those investment decisions while us and foreign direct investment were both higher in 2006 than they were in 2005 neither us direct investment abroad nor foreign direct investment in the united states seems to be tied too strongly to the depreciation of the dolla r there does appear to be complex set of relationships that connect direct investment the relative rate of growth in the economy and movements in the exchange rate but it is difficult to unwind these relationships to determine the relative importance of each factor cursory examination of the available data seems to indicate that the relative rates of growth between the us and foreign economies likely is the most important factor in driving direct investment transactions as us and foreign firms become more adept at utilizing foreign capital markets and foreign currency derivatives they likely are reducing the importance of fluctuations in currencies as major factor in some of their investment decisions nevertheless firms likely do consider the movements in currencies and the relative values of currencies as they determine the disposition of corporate earnings in some cases the depreciation of the dollar relative to the euro caused foreign firms operating in the united states to retain the earnings from those operations to invest in the united states rather than to return those profits to the parent company at depreciated value over the near term more developing count ries are expected to reduce national restrictions to foreign di rect investment and more firms from both developed and developi ng countries are expected to gage in the direct investment process as result these firms lik ely will participate more extensively in international capital markets and place adde d pressure on global and local capital markets as sources of funds and likely act as agents of reform in the capital markets of developing countries in addition th proliferation of financial techniques communications technology and currency he dging strategies means that it will become even more challenging to untangle the direct and indirect factors that might determine specific causeeffect linkages be tween direct inves tment and movements in exchange rates
