congressional employees are retained to perform public duties that include assisting members in official responsibilities in personal committee leadership or administrative office settings2 organized to support members of congress in their various duties and functions in washington dc and constituency offices around the united states staff are involved in virtually all elements of the work of congress3 individuals in congressional staff positions may come from wide range of training or professional backgrounds these might include the law business medicine political campaigns engineering the social sciences or fine arts nevertheless congressional staff are seen by some as professional cohort congressional career tracks generally mirror common stages of other professional careers but with adaptations to the congressional workplace these adaptations include relatively short career ladders on which staff may acquire substantial 1 examples of congressspecific activities are those related to legislative representational or political duties of member of congress or collective responsibilities to debate or enact national legislation or to oversee the implementation of laws some of these duties are carried out in several staff positions including legislative directors caseworkers committee professional staff parliamentarians or reading clerks 2 congressional staff may not perform nonofficial or personal duties campaign duties on behalf of congressional employer may not be carried out by house staff with the exception of three designated staff members per member office who may carry out limited campaign duties on behalf of their employers most senate staff are prohibited from campaign duties in the course of their senate employment when they are not in official duty

this report focuses on positions in house and senate personal offices5 and provides sample position descriptions for 14 positions with similar job titles in each chamber6 identifying congressional staff duties and job descriptions is complicated by the highly decentralized nature of congressional employment practices the house of representatives is composed of as many as 500 entities that set

many professional environments including the widespread use of position descriptions or the absence of formal personnel practices and guidelines or clearly established lines of authority for personnel

caa as amended pl 1041 2 usc 1301 5 usc 3110 generally prohibits congressional employing authorities from hiring or recommending for employment family member the caa generally prohibits discrimination in congressional employment decisions based on an applicants or employees age disability race color religion sex or national origin or past or present duty in the uniformed services additionally the act requires that congressional employees must get paid at least the current minimum wage and that certain employees are entitled to overtime pay congressional employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave from work for certain family and medical reasons with some exceptions congressional employees cannot be required to take polygraph test workplaces in the legislative branch must be free of hazards that are likely to cause death or serious injury some congressional employees but not staff in member committee or leadership offices are also entitled to notification of office closings or mass layoffs or to form labor organizations to bargain with congressional employers the caa established an office of compliance to oversee implementation of the act for more information see the office of compliance website at httpwwwcompliancegov finally some house officers may employ staff who are subject to the house employees position classification act 2 usc 291 and regulations on applicable employment standards issued by the committee on house administration crs4 sources of position descriptions in 2006 two salary and employment surveys the 2006 house compensation study guide for the 110th congress house study and the 2006 us senate employment compensation hiring and benefits study senate study were conducted for the house and senate respectively13 the studies focused on staff in the personal offices in each chamber and provided data on salary work experience and position duties and functions data in the surveys were organized by position titles of 18 positions in the house study and 25 positions in the senate study there are 14 positions that have roughly congruent position titles and descriptions in both chambers those positions included the following chief of staff constituent services representativecaseworker counsel district or state director district or state scheduler executive assistant field representative grants and projects coordinator house director of special projects andor grants senate legislative correspondent legislative director office manager14 press secretarycommunications director15 scheduler washington dc systems administrator16 summaries of those positions functions and duties as proffered by the house and senate studies administrators17 are provided below this material should be 13 icf international 2006 house compensation study

position descriptions proffered in the house and senate studies for the positions appear comparable 15 in the house study data for the positions of press secretary and communications director are combined and jointly reported in the senate study data for the positions are reported separately position descriptions proffered in the house and senate studies for the positions appear comparable 16 neither study provided data for positions commonly found in house and senate offices including staff assistant and legislative assistant both of those titles however appear as alternate job titles for one or more of the positions identified in both chambers and presented in this report 17 house positions included in the house study and excluded from this analysis due to difficulties in identifying comparable senate position include legislative aide senior legislative aide staff assistant district and staff assistant washington dc senate continued crs5 interpreted with care using data from the house and senate studies raises concerns for several reasons related to data collection and the potential consequences of organizing data by position title data collection issues electronic versions of the chamberappropriate survey were sent to 440 house member offices and 100 senate personal offices the house study indicated that its data were based on the responses of 141 320 member offices while the senate study indicated that 81 senate personal offices replied the house study asserts that its information allows for stable conclusions to be drawn about the policies and practices of the current member offices18 the potential precision of that assertion is not clear since the report provides none of the supporting evaluations or qualifications of how well its data sample might represent the whole population of house personal offices similarly the senate study provides explanation of how representative its data are with an 81 response rate differences between the survey results and actual practice are likely to be smaller than differences in the house report nevertheless senate data could be affected by the challenges of surveying samples of relatively small populations and the potential diversity of employment and compensation practices in senate offices as with any survey based on sample of selfselected respondents there is risk that the resulting data may not be representative of the population as whole finally survey of the type conducted for the house and senate requires reliance on respondents some problems may arise due to lack of timely responses to the questions and in having to rely on the survey respondents to be forthcoming in responses knowledgeable about the choices from which they select and in possession of complete information questions concerning who in each member office responded to the survey and how potential differences among individual respondents might affect the final data are not addressed in either report neither report provided any information regarding the characteristics of survey respondents organizing data by position titles categorizing congressional staff positions by position title19 relies on an assumption that similarly titled positions in house and senate personal offices carry out the same tasks under essentially similar circumstances while personal offices may carry out similar activities the assumption might be questionable given the differences in staff resources in house and senate offices as well as potential differences within offices of each chamber 17

state office manager 18 icf international 2006 house compensation study p i 19 senator may establish position titles in his or her office by written notification to the disbursing office of the senate 2 usc 611d1c2 similar explicit authority for member of the house was identified crs6 for example house office that supports an at large representative representative from state with one seat in the house attends to the same constituency as that of senate office from the same state but the senator would have at his or her disposal budget that could potentially support up to twice as many staff as would the representative20 at the other end of the spectrum there may be differences in the nature of operations in the offices of senators from states with large populations with staffs as much as five times larger than those of their house colleagues who represent districts of considerably smaller populations within those states since an element of staff position responsibilities might be based on organizational size and complexity the differences between house and senate member offices could result in differences in job duties between incumbents in similarly named positions within the senate there might be differences in the nature of position duties in the offices of senators from states with larger or smaller populations within either chamber there may be differences in staffing approaches due to varied approaches to the work of congressional office or because members have wide range of varying priorities that particular staff positions serve acknowledging the imprecision inherent in congressional job titles an older edition of the senate handbook states throughout the senate individuals with the same job title perform vastly different duties21 other concerns regarding the organization of data according to job title are related to the unique congressional employment environment as well as the aggregation of position data in the surveys these factors might have an effect on the validity and reliability of any of the congressional duties and functions presented for any position in either chambers studies the analytic reliability of information contained in the surveys may be questionable due in part to the following differences between the surveys position descriptions and what incumbents in those positions actually do of concern in both surveys is the question of how well position descriptions proffered by the survey administrators matched daytoday activities performed by incumbents in those positions table 1 summarizes responses to questions that attempted to distinguish differences between the proffered position descriptions and the activities respondents actually carry out 20 each member of the house may employ more than 18 permanent employees as many as four additional parttime employees may be designated by the member in any of the following categories 1 parttime employees 2 employees drawing compensation from more than one employing authority of the house 3 interns receiving pay 4 employees on leave without pay and 5 temporary employees see us congress house statement of disbursements of the house as compiled by the

offices at httpwebstersenategovruleshandbook 21 us senate committee on rules and administration senate handbook washington 1996 p i13 available from the author crs7 imprecision and lack of consistency of job titles in congress the house and senate surveys identified several alternate titles for each of the 14 positions the lists were created by asking respondent offices for alternate titles in the senate respondents identified 118 alternative titles to the 14 titles offered by the survey administrators and appearing in both surveys in the house similar questions identified 69 unique titles applicable to the sample job descriptions provided by the survey administrator similarity of tasks carried out by staff with similar or dissimilar titles it may be the case that congressional staff in some positions with vastly different job titles perform similar duties in several instances alternate titles match one or more of the 14 titles evaluated here as well as several of the positions that were identified in only one chamber22 cross listed job titles are presented with each positions duties and functions breadth of roles carried out by incumbents in addition to their primary position title in the house study respondents were asked to identify any roles they carried out in addition to their primary duties respondents identified 131 roles identified in the house survey by job title 22 this finding excludes partial job titles that do not match one of the 14 titles as well as compound titles such as legislative counsel legislative aide and counsel etc if systematic approach to including partial matches to the 14 titles were pursued the number of alternate titles for each position could rise substantially crs8 table 1 accuracy of position descriptions proffered in house and
