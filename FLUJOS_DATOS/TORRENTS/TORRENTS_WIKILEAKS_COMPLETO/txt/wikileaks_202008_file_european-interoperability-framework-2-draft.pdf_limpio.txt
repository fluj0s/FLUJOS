european interoperability framewor k 11 purpose and legal framework the purpose of the european interoperability framew ork eif is to promote and support the livery of european public services by fostering cross border and cross sectoral1 interoperability to guide public administrations efforts in providing european p ublic services to businesses and citizens to complement and tie together the various natio nal interoperability frameworks nifs in european dimension this document non technical by nature is targeting all those involve d in the definition design and implementation of european public services the eif should be taken into account when mak ing decisions about the implementation of european public services and more particularly during the velopment of services and systems to support the implementation of eu policy initiatives furthermore the if should be considered when implementing publ ic services that in the future might become part of european public services the eif is developed and maintained in the framewor k of the idabc2 and isa3 programmes in close collaboration with the members states and the concerned commission services they h v w r k d together in the spirit of article 154 of the ec treaty according to this article and with the aim to help in the achievement of the objectives referred to in artic 14 on the internal market the community shall contribute to the establishme nt and development of trans european networks and shall aim at promoting the interconnection and interoperability of national net works as well as the access to such networks the eif contributes to the better functioning of th internal market through inc reased interoperability among european public administrations 12 definitions 121 european public service in this document european public service means cross border public sector service supplied by public administrations4 either to one another or to europe an businesses and citizens by means of cooperation between those administrations while not all european public services are supported by infor mation and communication technologies ict most of them will rely on some form of ict support 122 interoperabili ty the eif is concerned with interoperability in the v ery specific context of the provision of european public services 1 sector is to be understood as policy area eg customs police ehealth environment agriculture etc 2 interoperable delivery of pan european egovernment services to public administrat ions businesses and citizens idabc oj l 181 18 52004 p 25 3 interoperability

administration s european interoperability framework for european public rvices 2 although in almost all cases the provision of european public services will involve the exchange of data between ict systems interop erability is wider concept and encompasses the ab ility of organisations to work together towards mutually beneficial and commonly agreed goals therefore the following definition is used in the eif5 interoperability within the context of european p ublic services delivery is the ability of disparate and diverse organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial and agreed common goals involving the sharing of information and knowledge between the organisat ions through the business processes they support by means of the exchange of data between their res pective ict systems it should be noted that interoperability is multilateral in nature and is best understood as shared value of community 123 interoperability framework within the context of t his document an interoperability framework is an agreed approac h to interoperability for organisations that wish to work together towards the joint delivery of public services within its scope of applicability it specifies set of common elements vocabulary concepts principles policies guidelines recommendations and practices 13 the needs and the benefits of interoperability interoperability is both prerequisite for and facilit ator of the efficient delivery of european public services inter operability addresses the need for cooperation between public administrations aiming at the establishme nt of public services exchanging information between public administrations to fulfil legal requir ements or political commitments sharing and reusing i n f r m t i n m n g p u b l i c d m i n i s t r t

the one stop shop delivery of public services reducing costs for public administrations businesses and citizens through efficient and effective delivery of public services 14 the eifs recommendations the eif provides recommendations that address speci fic interoperability requireme nts implementing the recommendations will create an environment in which public dministrations organise themselves in order to establish new european public services this wil l help to grow european public services ecosystem6 with people familiar with interoperability organisations ready to collaborate and common frameworks tools and services facilitating the establishme nt of european public services 15 context the eif is part of set of interoperability initia tives aiming at providing support to the establishment of european public services the figure below shows the relationships between th ose interoperability initiatives the european interoperability strategy eis the eif the european interope

activities figure 11 system atic approach to the governance of interoperability at eu level should be followed and concrete goals should be set to this end the european inte roperability strategy eis7 provides the basis for defining the organisational financial and operation framework necessary to support cross border andor cross sectoral interoperability the eis steers the eif nd all other associated efforts by setting strategic priorities and objectives the scope of the eif is to guide in the design of uropean public ser vices the guidelines contribute to the convergence of eur opean interoperability services and tools the interoperability services and tools provide f oundation for the delivery of european public services 151 the political and historical context of intero perability in the eu to implement european public services the public s ector must confront many challenges the realisation of cross border and cross sectoral interoperability is recognised as being key factor in overcoming these challenges the achiev ement of cross border interoperability is political priority in european public service initiatives the provision of seamless cross border public services f r w h i c h i n t r p r b i l i t i s prerequisite is considered to have potential high impact on businesses and citizens the eu initiatives presented in the figure below il lustrate from

nteroperability figure 12 152 interoperability frameworks many public administrations already have or are in the pr ocess of developing frameworks addressing interoperability issues within their national region or local domains the scope of these frameworks is restricted to the jurisdictions within which the have been developed however european public administrations must be ready to work together in rder to deliver european public services to meet the ne eds of businesses and citizens it is important that interoperability frameworks used by public administrations both national nifs and european eif are aligned when addressing the various aspects of achieving interoperability within the context of uropean public service delivery by their nature nifs are in general more detailed and often prescriptive whereas the eif which operates at higher level of abstraction as meta fr amework is less detailed and in application of the subsidiarity principle does not impose any specific choices or obligat ions on the member states8 recommendation 1 public administrations should align their interoperability frameworks with t he european interoperability framework in order to take into account the european dime nsion f public service delivery as the eif and the nifs are complementary the eur opean commission supports national interoperability framework observatory nifo whose objective is to provide information about national interoperability frameworks allowing p ublic administrations to share experiences with and knowledge about such frameworks 8 the principle of subsidiarity applies not just from eu to member states but in some cases within member states at the federalnational level or at other level s eg regional provincial county and local municipaliti european interoperability framework for european public rvices 5 16 european public services scenarios the interoperability covered in the eif comes into play in number of interaction scenarios the european public services covered by t he eif can be subdivided into various interaction types illustrated in the following diagram figure 13 the first type is direct interaction between busi nesses or citizens of one particular member state and public administrations within another member state andor an eu administration a2b and a2c the second type is an interaction between administr ations of different member states or eu administrations a2a this second type of interact ion may support d m i n i s t r t i n s i n s r v i n g businesses or citizens a2b and a2c 161 scenario 1 direct interaction between businessescitizens and foreign adminis tration figure 14 european interoperability framework for european public rvices 6 example citizen of member state taking job in destination member state x has to complete number of formalities in member state x in order to est ablish himself 162 scenario 2 exchange of information between administrations on businesscitizen requests figure 15 example service provider established in member state x wishing to offer services in member state submits request for establishment in member sta in order to process his request for establishment number of administrative bodies and agencies in both member state x and have to interchange information about the service provider to that end in teroperability between administrations is needed 163 scenario 3 exchange of information between national administrations and eu instit utions figure 16 this scenario often involves the aggregation of inf ormation from national sources typically the exchanges involve sectoral networks of administrations where an eu legal basis requires member state administrations to collect exchange and sh are information with each other as well as with eu institutions and agencies european interoperability framework for european public rvices 7 examples of such scenarios include the member states providi ng information and statistics to competent european author ity which then disseminates the aggregated informa tion to the concerned public 164 examples of european public services number of specific examples of services9 can serve the purpose

introduction this chapter sets out number of general principle s of good administration that are relevant to the process of establishing european public services taken together the underlying principles describe the context in which european public services are being decided and implemented they complement one another regardless of their different natures eg pol itical legal or technical the 12 underlying principles of the eif fall into d ifferent categories the first principle sets t h f r m f r c m m u n i t c t i n i n t h r f u r p n p u b l i c services the next group of underlying principles reflect gen eric user needs and expectations 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 the last group of underlying principles provides foundation for collabo ration between public administrations 9 10 11 and 12 22 underlying principle 1 subsidiarity and proportionality the first underlying principle comprises subsidiari ty and proportionality as enshrined in the eu treaty the subsidiarity principle implies that eu decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citi zen in other words the union does not take action unless eu ac tion is more effective than action taken at national regional or local level the proportionality principle limits eu actions to w h t i s n c s s r t c h i v g r d p l i c objectives this implies that the eu opts for solutions t hat leave the greatest possible freedom for implementation to member states subsidiarity and proportionality also apply to the delivery of european public services and therefore to the exchange of information necessary for the livery of such services the exchange of information and the joint delivery of european public servic will occur either as consequence of eu legislation or when public authoriti willingly and proactively participate in coordinated initiatives 23 underlying principle 2 user centricity public services are provided to serve the needs of citizens and businesses more precisely those need s should determine what public services are provided and how public services are delivered generally speaking citizens and businesses will expect access to user friendly services in secure and fl exible manner allowing personalization and with full respect of privacy to provide any given piec of information only once to the government to access single contact point even when multiple administrations have to work together in order to provide the service multichannel delivery allowing access to services anyhow anyw here anytime european interoperability framework for european public rvices 9 24 underlyin g principle 3 inclusion and accessibility10 the use of ict should create equal opportunities fo r all citizens and businesses due to open inclusiv services that are publicly accessible without discrimination inclusion aims to take full advantage of opp ortunities offered by new technologies to overcome social and economic disadvantages and exclusion accessibi lity aims at ensuring people with disabilities and the elderly access to public services so they can experien ce the same service levels as all othe r citizens inclusion and accessibility have to be considered throughout the whole development lifecycle of european public service regarding design information cont ent and delivery inclusion and accessibility usually encompass multichannel ivery traditional service delivery channels may need to co exist with new channels established using technolog giving citizens choice of access inclusion and accessibility can also be furthered by the capabili ty of system to allow third party to act on b h f f c i ze n s w h are u n ab i th r p rm an n tly r t m po rari l t d i re c t ly m ak u f public services 25 underlying principle 4 security and privacy citizens and businesses must be assured that they in teract with public administrations in an enviro nment of trust and in full compliance with the relevant regu lations eg on privacy and data protection this means that public administrations must guarantee that the privacy of citizens and the confidentiality of information provided by businesses are r espected within the necessary security constrains citizens and busine sses should have the right to verify the information administrations have collected about them and t decide whether this information may be used for purposes other than those for whic h it was originally supplied recommendation 2 public administrations should agree on an appropriate common security and privacy policy for each european public service they establish 26 underlying principle 5 multilingualism multilingualism needs to be carefully consider ed when designing european public services trade off is to be made between the expectation of citizens and businesses to be served in their own languages and the possibility of member state pub lic administrations to offer services in all offici eu languages however european public services provided at eu level should ideally be available in all official eu languages multilingualism and linguistic neutrality11 comes into play not just at the level of the user i nterfaces but at all levels of desig n of european public services as for example certain choi ces at the level of data representation may limit the possibilities to suppo rt different languages the multilingual aspect to interoperability again b ecomes apparent when european public services require exchanges between ict systems across linguistic bound aries as the meaning of the information exchanged must be preserved whenever possible inf ormation should be transferred in language independent format agreed between all par ties involved recommendation 3 public administrations should design information systems and technical architectures that are linguistically neutral in order to cater f or multilingualism when establishing european public service 10 httpeceuropaeuinformation_societyactivities einclu sionpolicyaccessibilityindex_enhtm 11 system characteristic whereby implementing data or functi onality in one eu language is more difficult or different than doing the same in any other eu language european interoperability framework for european public rvices 10 27 underlying principle 6 administrative simplification businesses compile large amounts of information often solely be cause of legal obligations which is of direct benefit for them and not necessary for achiev ing the objectives of the legislation imposing the obligations this creates considerable administr ative burden12 that can be expressed as cost incurred by businesses for this reason the european commission has propos ed in january 2007 to reduce the administrative burden on businesses by 25 by 2012 to achieve this target public authorities across europe will have to act together it is also widely recognised that there is high redundan cy in information to be provided by citizens to public administrations repeated requests by different admin istrations for the same information place similar admi nistrative burden on citizens who waste time compiling data and filling in forms with the same information over and over again when establishing european public services eliminating the r equest for unnecessary or redundant information may require reorgan isation and reengineering efforts in the public adm inistrations back offices 28 underlying principle 7 transparency citizens and businesses should be able to understand administ rative processes they should have the right to track administrative procedure s that involve them and have insight into the rationale behind decisions that could affect them transparency also allows citizens and businesses to give feedback about the quality of the public services provided to contribute to their improvement and t suggest the implementation of new services 29 underlying principle 8 preservation of information records13 and information in electronic form held by administ rations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved the goal is t ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility reliability and integrit over time and can be accessed taking into account security and privacy in order to guarantee long term preservation of electronic records and other k inds f i n f r m t i n formats should be selected so as to ensure long term accessibility including preservation of assoc iated electronic signatures and other electronic certifications such as mandates for information sources owned and managed by nation adm inistrations the preservation is purely national matter for european public services and for informa tion that is not purely national preservation becomes european issue and the necessary preservation policy has to be foreseen recommendation 4 public administrations should formulate together long term preservation policy for electronic records related to european public services 210 underlying principle 9 openness within the context of the eif openness is the willingness of p ersons organisations or other members of community of interest to share knowledge and to stimu late debate within that community of 12 httpeceuropaeuenterpriseadmin burdens reductionfaq_enhtm 13 as defined by the model requirements for the manage ment of electronic records moreq httpeceuropaeuidabcservletsdocid16847 rec ord is documents produced or received by person or organisation in the course of business and retain ed by that person or organisation note record may incorporate one or several documents g when one document has attachments and may be on any medium in any format in addition to the content of the documents it should include contextu information and if applicable structural informat ion ie information which describes the component s of the record key feature of record is that it cannot be c hanged european interoperability framework for european public rvices 11 interest having as ultimate goal the advancement of knowledge and the use thereof to solve relevant problems in that sense openness leads to considerable gai ns in efficiency interoperability involves the sharing of information and knowl edge between organisations hence implies certain degree of openness there are varying grees of openness specifications software and software development m ethods that pr omote collaboration and the results of which can freely be accessed reused and shared are conside red open and lie at one end of the spectrum while non documented proprietary specifications proprietary softwa re and the reluctance or resistance to reuse s olutions ie the not invented here syndrome lie at the other end the spectrum of approaches that lies between these two extremes can be called the openness continuum european public administrations need to decide where they wish to position themselv on this continuum with respect to the issues discussed in the eif the exact position may vary on case by case basis depending on their needs priorities legacy budget market situation and number of other factors while there is correlation b etween openness and interoperability it is also tr ue that interoperability can be obtained without openness for exam ple via homogeneity of the ict systems which implies that all partners use or agree to use t he same solution to implement european pu blic service recommendation 5 public administrations should favour openness when working together to establish european public service while taking into account their priorities and c onstraints 211 underlying principle 10 reusability reuse is key to the efficient developme nt of european public services reuse means that public administrations confronted with spec ific problem seek to benefit from the work of others by looking at what is available assessing its usefulness or relevancy to the problem at hand and decide to use solutions that have proven their value elsewhere this implies that public administrations must be wi lling to share with others their service components reuse and sharing naturally lead to collaboration ie wor king together towards mutually benef icial and agreed common goals for the specific case of open source software the european commission has set up the open source observatory and repository osor14 and developed the european union public licence eupl15 to assist among others public admi nistrations to share and re use open source software components andor to collaborate on their development and impr ovement recommendation 6 public administrations are encouraged to reuse and share solutions and to collaborate on the development of common solutions when implementing european public services 212 underlying principle 11 technological neutrality and adaptability when establishing european public services public administratio ns should focus on functional needs and defer decisions on technology as long as possib in order to avoid imposing specific technologies or products on their partners and to be able to adapt to the rapidly evolving technological environment public administrations should render access to publ ic services independent of any specific technol ogy or product recommendation 7 public administration should not impose any specific technological solution on citizens businesses and other administrations when establishing european public s ervices 14 httpwwwosoreu 15 httpeceuropaeuidabceupl european interoperability framework for european public rvices 12 213 underlying principle 12 effectiveness and efficiency public administr ation should ensure that solutions serve businesses and citizens in the most effective and efficient way and provide the best value for ta xpayer money there are many ways to take stock of the value brou ght by public services solutions including considera tion such as return on investment total cost of ownership in creased flexibility reduction of administrative burden increased efficiency reduct ion of risk transparency simplification improvement of working methods as well as recognition of public dministration achievements and competencies european interoperability framework for european public rvices 13 3 the public services conceptual model 31 introduction this chapter proposes public services conceptual model which describes an organizing principle underlying the construction and operation of european public rvices the conceptual model is derived from survey on th implementation of european public services in the member states and embodies the common elements and best practices observed as blueprint for future implementations of european public service s the model aids in developing common vocabulary and understanding across the member states about the main elements comprising public service and their basic relationships to one another the conceptual model emphasizes building block approach to t he construction of european public services allowing for the interconnection and reus ability of components when building new services the conceptual model is generic by nature and there fore not every existing or future service will exactly fit into it h owever it is generic enough to be applicable at any level of go vernment providing public services from the local level all the way up to the eulevel and it illustrates the fact that any level of government can be provider of both basic and aggregate p ublic services in this sense the model clarifies and rationalises the relationships between entities that are collaborating to deliver public services furthermore the application of the conceptual mode l is intended to bring practical benefits in estab lishing european public services for example the splittin g of functionality into basic services with well defined interfaces conceived for reuse will simplify and s treamline the implementation of services and the re use of components avoiding duplicati on of efforts 32 the key concepts of the conceptual model the conceptual model promotes the reuse of informat ion concepts patterns solutions and standards in member states and at european level recognizing that european public services are based on infor mation from various sources located at different vels of administration in different member states and combine basic services constructed independently by public adminis trations in different member states therefore the conceptual model highlights th need for modular loosely coupled service compone nts interconnected through the necessary infrastructure working toget her towards the delivery of european public services it explicitly puts forward the eu wide adoption of service orientation to system conceptio n and development as well as an ict ecosystem that is broken dow n into consistent and in some cases commonly developed service components its particular service orientation is specific style of creating and using business processes packaged as services throughout their lifecycle recommendation 8 public administrations should develop component based service model allowing the establishment of european public services by reusing as muc h as possible existing service components public administrations will need to agree common scheme on how to interco nnect such components there are well known and widely used technical solutions eg web services geared to ensur such connectability but their implementation in an eu context w ill require concerted f f r t s b t h concerned public administrations including investments in the corresponding common infrastructure european interoperability framework for european public rvices 14 recommendation 9 public administrations should agree on common scheme to interconnect loosely coupled components and put in place the necessary infrastructure when establi shing european public services the basic elements of the conceptual model are depi cted in the diagram below public services conceptual model basic public functionsorchestrationusers aggregate public services base registriesinteroperability

facilitatorsexternal servicesbase registriesinteroperability facilitatorsexternal servicessecure data exchangemanagementsecure data exchangemanagement figure 31 in order to understand this model it is useful to subdivide it into three layers basic public functions secure data exchange and aggregate public services detailed in the following sections 321 the basic public functions the lowest layer of the conceptual model deals with the most basic components from which european p ublic services can be built it groups three types of such basic c omponents namely interoperability facilitators base registries and externa l services together calling them basic public functions figure 32 some of these basic functions have been developed p rimarily for the direct use by the public administration which has created them or by their direct customers ie the businesses and citizens but are made available for reuse elsewhere with view t being combined to provide aggregate public services others are generic andor infrastructural in natur while the remaining ones represent external services ie services provided by third parties the following sections describe in more tail each t ype of basic public functions basic public functions base registriesinteroperability facilitatorsexternal servicesbasic public functions base registriesinteroperability facilitatorsexternal servicesbase registriesinteroperability facilitatorsexternal serviceseuropean interoperability framework for european public rvices 15 3211 base registries the most important components are the base registries w h i c h r r l i b l s u r c s f b s i c information on i tem s such as pe rson s com panie s vehi cle s licen ce s build ings cations ro ad s tc such registries are under the legal control of and maintained by given publ ic administration but the information should be made available for wider reuse with th appropriate security and privacy measures the common thread running through all implementations of ba sic regi strie s is the fact th at th ey are authentic and authoritative in nature and are sepa rately or in combination the cornerstone of public services their content is in general not static they also reflect the information lifecycle recommendation 10 public administrations should make their authentic sources of information available to others while implementing the appropriate access and c ontrol mechanism to ensure security and privacy as foreseen in the relevant legislation one of the obstacles to the adoption of the c onceptual model for european public services implementation might be the existence of legacy systems such legacy systems and their underlying data repositories have specific characteristics limitin g the possibilities for reuse eg lack of published interfaces and they might require extensive re engineering efforts in order to make the information available for european public services access to authentic data sources across borders wil l be facilitated if the interfaces to these sources are published and harmonised at both the semantic and technical level recommendation 11 public administrations when working towards the establishment of european public services should develop the necessary interfaces to authe ntic sources and align them at semantic and technical l evel 3212 interoperability facilitators interoperability facilitators provide services such as tr anslation between protocols formats languages or standards 3213 external services this includes services provided by external parties such as t b u s i n s s l v l p ment services provided by financial institutions or at infrastructure leve l connectivity services provided by telecommunications providers 322 the secure data exchange layer this layer is central to the conceptual model since all access to basic public func tions passes through it secure data exchangemanagementsecure data exchangemanagementsecure data exchangemanagement figure 33 3221 secure data exchange from the business point of view administrations an d other entities are exchanging official information which might involve access to base registrie s such access should go through secure harmonized managed and controlled layer providing information exchanges between administrations businesses and citizens that are european interoperability framework for european public rvices 16 signed and certified both sender and receiver have been identified and authent icated through agreed mechanism encrypted the confidentiality of the transported data is ensured logged the electronic records are logged and archived to ensure legal audit trail in the proposed conceptual model those functions are grouped in t he secure data exchange layer this layer should allow secure exchange of certifie d messages records forms and other kind of information among the different systems in addition to the pure transport of data specific security requirements such as handlin g of electronic signatures certification encryption tim estamping etc should also be managed in this layer security is one the most important barriers for int eroperability if not applied in harmonised and agreed way among organisations the conceptu model i n n d s t h i g h l i g h t t h i s f ac t an d d raw t h attention of all service providers to consider the security issues head on and to collaborate on common framework to meet their respective security needs vi compatible mechanisms and commonly agreed specifications as well as to reach common understanding n essential characteristics such as authorisation levels and authenti cation strength one of the key prerequisites for implementing the functionality expected in the secure data exchange layer invol ves leveraging the national identification and authentica tion infrastructures in the member states into working cross border scheme this scheme should establish which ict archi tectures and data are needed in cross border context in order to make exist ing member states electronic identity infrastructures interoperable 3222 secure communications management the provision of secure ie signed certified crypted and logged data exchange also requires several management functions including service mana gement to ensure oversight of all communication activities relating to identification authentication and authorization data t ransport etc including eg access granting revocation and audit service registry to ensure given proper authorization access to available services through prior localisation as well as verification that the serv ice is trustworthy service logging to ensure that logging of all data exchanges for future evidence is adequately performed including archiving when necessary 323 the aggregate services layer aggregate public services are constructed by grouping number of basic public functions t h t r accessed in secure and controlled way those functions can be provided by several administrations of any level ie local regio nal national or even at the eu level the typical aggregate service is intended to appear to its users administrations businesses or citizens as one single service behind the scenes transacti ons may be implemented across borders across sectors and administrative levels aggregation is accomplished via appropriate mechanisms acc ording to the specific business requirements in the most general case some business logic would be required to implement the requirements and the implementation mechanism co uld take several forms such as orchestration or workflow engines all of them included in portal like access infrastructures european interoperability framework for european public rvices 17 figure 34 if aggregate public services are provided by intermediaries public administrations should establ ish process of authorization in order to determine wh ich basic public functions may be disclosed to which intermediary and certification of intermediaries in order to estab lish trust between us ers and providers of the services 33 applications of the conceptual model what makes the conceptual model powerful is its flexibility to create different aggregate services by combining service components from broad variety of providers usi ng the conceptu model the potential of further aggregating and combining the different rvices is unlocked the sections below describe three cases having high added valued in the eu cont ext the cross border case the cross sectoral case and the cross administrativ boundary case

application of the conceptual model involves llowing external access to national base registers hence requiring high degree of security and trust service levels and european public services depende

organising the c oopera tion among the public administrations at each level by the immediate higher level is essential european interoperability framework for european public rvices 20 4 interoperability levels 41 introduction this chapter introduces four interoperability level s each of these levels deserves special attention when new european public service is established figure 41 42 political context the establishment of new european public service is the result of direct or indirect action at political level ie of new bilateral multilat eral or european agreements if the establishment of new service is the direct consequenc of new eu legislation the scope priorities and resources necessary for the establishment an d operation of the service should be foreseen when the legislation is adopted however political support and sponsorship must also be ensured i n cases where new services are not directly linked to new legislation but are decided upon in order to provide better more user oriented public services likewise it is necessary to ensure political support for cross border interoperability efforts facilitating cooperation between public administrations16 in order for such cooperation to be effective all stakeholders involved must share visions agree on objective s and align prior ities actions at the cross border level can only be successful if all member states i nvolved accord sufficient priority and resources to their respective interoperability efforts prog ress towards agreed goals within agreed timeframes 16 the isa programme is an example

for european public rvices 21 recommendation 13 public administrat ions should obtain political support for their interoperability efforts required for the establishment of european public services 43 legal interoperability each public administration contributing to the provision of euro pean public service works within its own national legal framework sometimes incompatibilities between legislation in different member states make working together more complex or even impossible even in cases wher such legislation is the result of the transposition of european directi ves into national law legal initiatives may be needed to remedy such situations when exchanging information between member states in the context of the provision of european public services the legal validity of such informa tion must be maintained acros s borders and the data protection legislation in both originating and receiving co untries must be respected recommendation 14 public administrations should carefully consider all relevant legislation linked to the information exchange including data protection legislation when envisaging the establishment of european public service 44 organisational interoperability this aspect of interoperability is concerned with h ow organisations such as public administrations in different member states collaborate to achieve their m utually agreed goals in practice organisational interoperability is established through the integration of bus iness processes and the related exchange of information 441 business processes alignment in order for different administrative entities to be able to w ork toge the r fficiently and ffectively to provide european public services they may need to align th eir existing business processes or even to define and establish new business processes aligning business processes to contribute to european public services implies documenting them in commonly agreed way so that all public administrations cont ributing to the delivery of european public services have global view of the compounde d business process and understand their role in it recommendation 15 public administ rations should document their business processes and agree on how these processes will interact to contribute to the deliv ery of european public service 442 establishment of memoranda of understanding and service level agreements service orientation on w hich the public service conceptual model is built requ ires the rigorous structuring of the relationships between service providers and s ervice consumers among other things this involves the introduction of instrument s to formalize the mutual assistance joint activities and interconnected business processes in t he scope of cross border services provision these instruments can either be memoranda of unders tanding mous between governments on joint actions and cooperation andor service level agreem ents slas signed between participating public administrations considered as cross border activity such instruments should be preferably multi lateral agreements recommendation 16 public administrations contributing to the provision of european public services should s ystematically define mous and slas for the part of the european pu blic service they provide andor consume european interoperability framework for european public rvices 22 443 change management since the delivery of european public service is the result of the collective effort of number of collaborating parties t hat produce or consume parts of the service setting appr opriate change management process is critical to ensure the accura cy reliability and continuity of the service delivered to other public administrations business and citi zens recommendation 17 public administrations collaborating on the provision of european public services should define rigorous change management processes in order to ensure continuous delivery of such services 45 semantic interoperability semantic interoperability enables organisations to process i nformation from external sources in meaningful manner it ensures that the precise mean ing of exchanged information is understood and is preserved throughout the various exchanges between all communicati ng parties achieving semantic interoperability in the eu context is relatively new activity not achieved before on this scale however number of public administrations h ave lately gained experience in this field starting point for achieving semantic interoperab ility is the establishment of secto rspecific sets of data structures and data elements that can be referred to as semantic interoperability assets once these are established the cooperating organisations wil l need to agree on the meaning of the information to be exchanged due to the dif fering linguistic cultural legal and administrative environments in the member states reaching such agreement s poses significant challenges multilingualism in the eu adds further complexity to the pro blem of achieving semantic interoperability in the c n t x t f t h i f t h s m n t i c i n t r p r b i l i t l v l n c m p s s s b t h f t h f l l w i n g aspects semantic interoperability is about the meaning of information elements and the rela tionship between such elements it includes the development of the vocab ularies used to describe information exchanges and ensures that information eleme nts are understood in the same way by communicating parties syntactic interoperability i s b u t d s c r i b i n g t h x c t f r m t f t h i n f r m t i n t b exchanged via grammars formats and schemas achieving semantic interoperability in the european context requires at least agreed processes and methodologies for developing semantic in teroperability assets sector specific and cross sectoral communities to agree on the use of semantic interoperability assets at eu level ie sector specific and cross sectoral elements due to the complexity of the task and the large number of interested parties an organised effort towards harmonisation of both the processes and methodologies is needed 451 the eu semantic interoperability initiative17 several initiatives are working towards achieving s emantic interoperability both at national and eu level the eu semantic interoperability initiative ai ms at establishing the foundations of semantic interoperability for european public services across all sectors and in close collaboration with national initiatives it provides coaching services at b oth conceptual and implementation levels and webbased platform for collaboration and dissemination of solutions to semantic interoperability challenges public administrations establishing public services should verify at an early phase of any given projec t if existing semantic interoperability assets can be reused if not they can use the eu seman tic 17 semiceu semantic interoperability centre europe european interoperability framework for european public rvices 23 interoperability platform to advertise their goals and thei r approach to wider european audience seeking contact with other projects with similar needs recommendation 18 public administrations should support the establishment of both sector specific and cross sector communities aimed at facilitating semantic interoperability and should encourage the sharing of results produced by such communities through nationa l and european platforms 46 technical interoperability this aspect of interoperability covers the technica l aspects of linking information systems it includes aspects such as interface specifications interconn ection services data integration services data presentation and exchange etc while public administrations have specific characteristic s at the polit ical legal organisational and partly at the semantic levels interoperability at the chnical level is not specific to public administrations therefore technical interoperabil ity should be ensured whenever possible via the use of i t h r s t n d r d s n dorsed by recognised standardisation organisations or tec hnical specifications made available by industry consortia or ot her standardisation fora recommendation 19 public administrations should agree on the standards and specifications to be used to ensure technical interoperability when blishing european public services european interoperability framework for european public rvices 24 5 interoperability agreements 51 introduction this chapter presents the approach proposed to faci litate the cooperation of public administrations working together to provide given european public service as stated throughout this document the provision f european public services requires cooperation between different public administrations such cooperation t akes place at the different interoperability levels described in the previous chapter for each level the rg an i sation s involved sho uld fo rm alise their cooperation in interoperability agreements they should be drafted with sufficient level of det ail so that they achieve the intended result t h provision of the european public service in question w h i l l v i n g c h r g n i s t i n m x i m l internal autonomy at the legal level interoperability agreements are expressed in concrete and binding terms via legislation including european directives and their transposi tion into national legislation whos details are outside the scope of the eif at the organisational level interoperability agree ments can take the form of mous or slas that specify the obligations of each party participating in cross border business processes interoperability agreemen ts at the organisational level will define expected levels of services supportescalation procedures contact details etc referring when necessa ry to underlying agreements at the semantic and technical levels at the semantic level interoperability greements take the form of inter alia reference taxono mies schemes code lists data dictionaries or sector based libraries at the technical level interoperability agreements will include items such as communication protocols messaging specificatio ns data formats security specifications or dynamic reg istration and service discovery specifications while interoperability agreements at the legal and organi sation level will normally be very specific to the european public service to be provided int eroperability agreements at the technical level and to lesser extent at the semantic can often be mapped onto already existing formalised specifications18 recommendation 20 public administrations when establishing european public services should as much as possible base interoperability agreements on existing formalised specifications or in case such specifications do not exist collaborate with c ommunities working in the same areas however there are many reasons why standards and speci fications are produced besi des facilitating interoperability eg efficiency the creation of new markets or the extension of existing ones furthermore when trying to map interoperability ag reements at technical or semantic level on formalised specifications one may find that t h r r n u m b r f q u i v l n t c m p t i n g specifications from which to choose all of which may be able to fulfil such agreements while public administrations may decide to support multiple formalised specifications or technologies to ease communicati on with their citizens and businesses for reasons of effici ency they may wish to reduce the number of formalised specifications and tech nologies to support when working together to provide european public services similar decisions are often taken t within the context of the provision of single uropean public service but within wider context of cooperation w ithin or between organisations in this context it 18 within the context of this document formalised specifica tions are either standards in the sense of eu directive 9834 or specifications made available by industry consortia or other standardisation fora european interoperability framework for european public rvices 25 should be taken into account that internal interfaces m ay become external in the future w h n establishing new european public services decisions on what formalised specifications and technologies to use to ensure interoperability within the context of european public services should be based on tran sparent fair and non discriminatory appro ach one way to do so is by agreeing on common as sessment methodology and selection process 52 assessing and selecting formalised specifications when public administrations decide on what formalised specifi cations or technologies to select to ensure inter operability they should assess relevant formalised specific ations while being tailored to the specific interoperability need s of the public administrations in question such assessment and selection should be based on objective c riteria primarily relat ed to the functional interoperability needs when several formalised specific ations fulfil the functional interoperability needs additional criteria related to quality of implemen tation adoption by the market and the potential for reusability and opennes s can be used recommendation 21 public administrations should use structured transparent and objective approach to the assessment and selection of formalised specifica tions 521 specifications openness and re use the possibility of sharing and re using service components b ased on formalised specification depends on the openness of the specifications if the principle of openness is applied in full all stakeholders can contribute to the elaboration of the spe cification and public review is organised the specification docum ent is freely available for everybody to study and to share with others the specification can be implemented under the diff erent software development approaches19 it is up to the creators of any particular specification to cide how open they want their specification to be because of their positive effect on interoperability the use of open specifications characterised by the three features mentioned above as well as sharing and re use have been promoted in many policy statements and are encouraged i n the context of european public services delivery however public administrations may decide to use less open sp ecifications especially in cases where open s p c i f i c t i n s d n t m t the functional interoperability needs or the ones available are not mature andor sufficiently supported by the market or where l cooperating organisations already use or agree to use the same technologies recommendation 22 other things being equal public administrations should prefer open specifications when establishing european publi c services 53 contribution to the standardisation process in some cases public administrations may find that suitabl formalised specification is available for specific need in specific area if consequently new specifications have to be developed they may either develop the specifications themselves an d put forward the result for standardisation to 19 for example using open source or proprietary softwa re and technologies this also allows providers und er various business models to deliver products technologies and services based on such kind of formalised specifications european interoperability framework for european public rvices 26 become formalised specification or request new for malised specification to be developed by the relevant bodies even where existing formalised spec ifications are available they evolve over time and the expe rience shows that in general revisions may take long time to be c ompleted active government participation in the standardisation process mitigates concerns about ays supports better align ment of the formalised specifications with the public sector needs an d can help governments keep pace with technology innovation recommendation 23 public administrations should actively participate in the standardisation activities that are relevant to their needs
