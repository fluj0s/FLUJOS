and the hipaa privacy rule summary the common rule governs research that is conducted on human beings if it is funded by one of 19 federal agencies it requires review of proposed research by an institutional review board irb the informed consent of research subjects and institutional assurances of compliance with the regulations in 1974 45 cfr 46 was published following some cases of harm to human subjects such as those caused by thalidomid drug trials and the united states public health service syphilis study in tuskeegee alabama the regulations had their roots in numerous international agreements such as the nuremberg code and the declaration of helsinki nd domestic policies such as those put forth by the department of health education and welfare dhew now the department of health and human services hhs in 1991 16 federal agencies adopted the terms of 45 cfr 46 subpart thus creating the common rule since the common rule took effect events like the death of jesse gelsinger in 1999 due to his participation clinical trial have prompted scrutiny of the rule and its ability to protect research subjects in order to help enhance research subject protections in 2000 hhs removed the offi ce for protection from research risks oprr from the national institutes of health nih and created new office the office for human research protections ohrp in an elevated position in hhs in addition groups like the national bi oethics advisory commission and the national academies raised the following policy questions 1 should the common rule be applied to nonfede rally funded research social and behavioral research international clinical trials and research with human biological materials 2 do existing provisions ensure the participa tion and protection of children prisoners minorities those with diminished capacity pregnant women fetuses neonates and people in emergency situations 3 wh at should be the requirements regarding irbs membership responsibil ities training and

participants that have been adopted by various federal agencies in their respective sections of the code of federal regulations cfr when provisions of the common rule are cited in this report readers are directed to the hhs regulations that served as the basis for the common rule 45 cfr 46 subpart so that they may easily locate the text federal protection for human research subjects an analysis of the common rule and its interactions with fda regulations and the hipaa privacy rule introduction congress has shown keen interest in the common rule largely because of the federal governments longsta nding investment in medical research and its interest in researchsubject safety the common rule 45 cfr 46 subpart a1 is set of regulations that govern mo st federally funded research conducted on human beings its three basic requirements are aimed at protecting research subjects the informed consent of research subjects review of proposed research by an institutional review board irb and institutional assurances of compliance with the regulations informed consent meaningful informed consent is one cornerstone of human subjects protections to provide informed consent potential research subject must both understand what participation in study entails in other words be informed and agree to participate consent the common rule requires that researcher obtain informed consent usually in writing from living person or their legally authorized representative before the person can be admitted to study the common rules informed consent regulations focus primarily on the elements and documentation of informed c onsent rather than on the process used to obtain it as to the process the regulati ons require that informed consent be sought only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influe nce regarding the content and documentation the common rule requires that information be given in language understandable to the subject and that informed consent be clear of any exculpatory language releasing the investigator the sponsor the institution or its agents from liability for negligence 45 cfr 46116 in addition the common rule specifies that all of the following elements must be provided when inform ed consent is sought 45 cfr 46116ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs2 2 accreditation is procedure by which an authoritative body gives formal recognition that body or person is competent to carry out specific tasksa statement that the study involves research an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subjects participation description of the procedures to be followed and identification of any procedur which are experimental description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject description of any benefits to th subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research disclosure of appropr iate alternative proc edures or courses of treatment if any that might be advantageous to the subject statement describing the extent if any to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained for research involving more than minimal risk an explanation as to whether any compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are ava ilable if injury occurs and if so what they consist of or where further information may be obtained an explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects rights and whom to contact in the event of researchrelated injury to the subject and statement that participation is voluntary refusal to participate willinvolve penalty or loss of be nefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled when informed consent is sought the common rule also requires other information to be provided if applicable such as any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research or statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject which are currently unforeseeable 45 cfr 46116b irb review the common rules primary mechanism for ensuring the adequacy of informed consent and other as pects of human subjects protection is irb review irbs review and have authority to approve require modifications in to secure approval or disapprove all research activities covered by the common rule 45 cfr 46109a the common rule requi res that protocols for human subjects research be irb approved before the re search can begin 45 cfr 46103b the common rule does not require that irbs be accredited 2 but it does require them to meet certain membership and review procedures irbs generally comprise volunteer s who examine proposed and ongoing scientific research to ensure that human subjects are properly protected the common rule 45 cfr 46107 requires that each irb have the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs3 3 some unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects may be referred to as adverse events aes although the term is not used in the common rule itselfat least five members members with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution members that are not tirely of one profession at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose pr imary concerns are in nonscientific areas at least one member who is not affiliated with the institution membership diverse in race gender and cultural backgrounds and having sensitivity to community attitudes and if an irb regularly reviews res earch that involves vulnerable category of subjects such as children prisoners pregnant women or handicapped or menta lly disabled persons consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects irbs are to meet as necessary in institutions with high volume of protocols this is often monthly or more frequently in smallervolume institutions it is often less frequently to conduct their revi ews reviews may be conducted only at convened meetings at which majority of the members of the irb are present including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas in order for the research to be approved it mu st receive the approval of majority of those members present at the meeting 45 cfr 46108b irbs are to conduct initial reviews of proposed research and also m onitor ongoing research rereviewing it at least once per year 45 cfr 46109e irb may have member participate in the irbs initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has conflicting interest except to provide in formation requested by the irb 45 cfr 46107e to facilitate this monitoring and reevaluati on irbs are to be provided with reports of unanticipat ed problems involving risks to subjects or others that arise during research3 and to reevaluate the human subjects protections in the protocol if necessary 45 cfr 46103b5 the common rule does not specify which procedures an irb must follow in its review of protocols leaving that to local control but it does require that there be written procedures the procedures must specify how an irb will conduct its initial and continuing reviews of research report its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution and dete rmine which projects require review more often than annually and which need veri fication from sources other than the investigators that material changes have occurred since previous irb review in addition there must be writte n procedures that ensure prompt reporting to the irb of unanticipated problems noncomplian ce and proposed changes in research activities 45 cfr 46103b45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs4 4 list of the hhs secretarys categories of research that qualify for expedited review is available at httpwwwhhsgovohrphuman subjectsguidanceexpedited98htm visited apr 14 2005 the common rule requires that an irb determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied in order to approve proposed res earch 45 cfr 46111 informed consent is sought from each subject according to the requirements scribed above risks to subjects are minimized risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits if any to subjects and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result that the selection of subjects is equitable when appropriate that the resear ch plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects when appropriate that there are ad equate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data and if some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence such as ch ildren prisoners pregnant women mentally disabled persons or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons that the st udy has additional safeguards to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects in evaluating risks and benefits the ir b should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research the irb should not consider possible longrang effects of applying knowledge gained in the research for example the possible effects of the research on public policy as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility 45 cfr 46111a2 the common rule leaves the weighing of risk s and benefits in individual protocols up to local irbs enabling them to apply local community standards not every research project involving hum an subjects is required to gain irb approval through the formal review pro cess described above certain types of research projects may qualify for expedited review expedited review may be carried out by the irb chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the irb in reviewing the research the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the irb except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research research activity may be di sapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedite d procedure the common rule allows an irb to use an expedited review proce dure for one or both of the following 1 research that the hhs secretary has determined to be eligible for expedited review4 and found by the reviewers to involve more than minimal risk 2 minor changes in previously approved research dur ing the period of one year or less for which approval is authorizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs5 the common rule defines minimal risk as that in which the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encounter ed in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological ex aminations or test s 45 cfr 46102i assurance of compliance the common rules primary mechanism for ensuring that research institution is complying with regulatory requirements for irbs and for other human research s ubject protections is through requiring institutional assurances an assurance is written document containing promises of regulatory compliance to receive fe deral funding for research covered by the common rule each institution is required to provide an assurance of compliance with the common rule to the head of the federal department or agency from which it is receiving funding as an alternative the institution may substitute an assurance provided to office for protection from res earch risks oprr now the office for human research protections ohrp if the assurance is current approved for federalwide use by hhs nd applicable to the research in question 45 cfr 46103a to satisfy the common rules requirements an assurance must certify that the research has been reviewed approved and will be subject to continuing review by an irb 45 cfr 46103b the assurance must include among other things designation of one or more irbs established in accordance with the requirements of the rule and fo r which provisions are made for meeting space and sufficient staff to support the irbs review and recordkeeping duties45 cfr 46103b2 written irb procedures for initial continuing and expedited reviewand for ensuring prompt reporting of certain unanticipated problems 45 cfr 46103b45 statement of principles governing the institution for protecting therights and welfare of human

degrees representative capacity indications of experience such as board certifications licenses etc sufficient to describe each members chief anticipated contributions to irb deliberations and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution for example fulltime employee parttime employee member of governing panel or board stockholder paid or unpaid consultant 45 cfr

secretary of defense charles wilson issued top secret memorandum establishing policy for research related to atomic biological and chemical warfare the policy incorporated the principles of the nuremberg code and two additional protections prohibition on research involving prisoners of war and requirement that the secretary of the appropriate military service approve research studies national bioethics advisory commission ethical and policy issues in resear ch involving human participants aug 2001 p151 6 the common rule was developed as such by the interagency federal coordinating council for science engineering and technolo gy the following departments and agencies have adopted it department of health and human services department of agriculture department of energy national aeronau tics and space administration department of defense consumer product safety commission international development cooperation agency agency for international developm ent department of housing and urban development department of justice depart ment of defense depa rtment of education department of veterans affairs envir onmental protection agency national science foundation and department of transportation the rule applies to the central intelligence agency by executive order 12333 the social security administration by pl 103296 and the department of homeland security by pl 108458 the office of science and technology policy signed but did not codify the rule because it does not conduct clinical research 7 for example the department of labor and the nuclear regulatory commission are reported to sponsor human subjects research but have not adopted the common rule 8 the common rule exempts some categories of research from its requirements and gives department or agency heads final judgment as to whether particular activity is covered examples of types of research that may qualif as exempt are those that involve the use of continuedpolicies for the protection of human subjects5 in 1974 after more than 20 years of dhew involvement and consideration the regulations were codified 45 cfr 46 subpart in 1991 the terms of subpart of 45 cfr 46 were dopted by 16 federal agencies thus creating the common rule since 1974 hhs has promulgated and ame nded additional regulations to give extra protections to certain groups of hum an subjects including children prisoners and pregnant women as well as fetuses and human in vitro fertilization these regulations for the protection of vulnera ble populations 45 cfr 46 subparts b c and d provide protections for women and neonates pris oners and children respectively these subparts apply to hhs funded research but are not part of the common rule they do not generally apply to the other federal agencies that have adopted the common rule except for cases in which an agency has voluntarily adopted one or more of the additional subparts in this report 45 cfr 46 will refer to the full regulation including all subpa rts the common rule will refer only to the terms of subpart today the common rule governs 19 fe deral departments and agencies6 the common rule applies to res earch conducted at or funded by the agencies that have adopted it though it has not been adopted by all agencies that fund research7 this means that in order to be eligible to r eceive funding from one of the agencies that has adopted the common rule andor othe r subsections of 45 cfr 46 researchers and institutions must abide by the relevant regulatory provisions8 it also means thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs7 8 continued educational tests

hypothesis is tested in randomized controlled and usually blinded setting randomized means that the subjects have been randomly divided into two or more groups one or more groups receive an intervention such as drug and another control group does not controlled means continuedfederal law does not require research conducted without fede ral money or with money from an agency that has not adopt ed the common rule andor 45 cfr 46 to be conducted in accordance with these regu lations number of private companies have voluntarily chosen to follow the co mmon rule though these are not subject to federal enforcement mechanisms if they fail to comply some federal agencies and department s have adopted subparts of 45 cfr 46 other than the common rule or have imple mented their own regulations governing certain types of human subjects research for example the department of education has adopted subpart d which provides dditional protections for children involved in research 35 cfr 97401409 the department of justi ces bureau of prisons has adopted its own regulations regarding res earch involving prisoners which are similar to though more rigorous than 45 cfr 46 subpart c 28 cfr 5121021 the department of veterans ffairs has an office of research oversight which is responsible for advising the under secretary for health on matters of compliance and assurance in human subjects protections research safety and research impropriety and misconduct pl 108170 401 in addition the vete rans administration has engaged an external contractor to inspect and certify the human subjects protection program of every va fac ility conducting research involving human subjects9 other federal regulations the common rule and 45 cfr 46 are not the only federal regulations that may provide protections for human subjects one additional set of federal regulations for th protection of human subjects has been put forth by the food and drug administra tion fda fda is the federal agency responsible for reviewing the safety and fficacy of new biomedi cal products drugs devices vaccines etc before they can be marketed in the united states fdas regulations for the protection of human s ubjects 21 cfr 50 56 are very similar to and in many instances identical to the common rule they require informed consent 21 cfr 50 irb review 21 cfr 56 and assurance of irb review 21 cfr 31266 there are some key differences betw een fda regulations and the common rule and 45 cfr 46 fda regu lations have scope and t of definitions targeted to clinical trials10 that evaluate products for marketin g rather than to basic research11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs8 10 continued steps have been taken to minimize the effect s of variables other than the intervention that might affect the outcome such as for exampl subjects age health problems etc blinded means that the subjects and some times the researchers interacting with the subjects and recording results do not know wh ich group the subjects are in humansubjects research is broader category than clinical trials which would include nonclinical trials such as surveys and observational studies 11 basic research is broadly defined as aski ng questions to obtain knowledge it may encompass laboratory animal or other study methods it is broader category than human subjects research which is basic research that involves human beings 12 for more information see crs report rs20500 medical records privacy questions and answers on the hipaa final rule by c steven redhead 13 covered entity is health plan health clearing house or any health care provider who transmits health information in electronic form in connection with transactions for which the hhs secretary has adopted st andards under hipaa 45 cfr 164103the broadest difference is that unlike th common rule fdas regulations for the protection of human research participants ttach when research is used to support an application to fda for marketing regardle ss of the funding source other subtler distinctions which have prompted public calls for harmonizing the two sets of regulations include fdas regulatory pr ovisions for emergency use of product in critical situation and requirements for inve stigators to disclose financial conflicts of interest whereas the common rule doe s not in addition 45 cfr 46 makes two allowances that fda regulations do t for international research 45 cfr 46 subpart the common rule allows depa rtment or agency head to approve the substitution of foreign procedures in lieu of hhs policy and for research involving children 45 cfr 46 subpart d stipulates that an irb may waive the parental consent requirement if necessa ry to protect the subjects third set of federal regulations that may provide some protections for human subjects is the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information12 or privacy rule 45 cfr 164 which the hhs secretary issued pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl104 191 hipaas stated purpose focused broadly upon health insurance improving portability and continuity of health insurance coverage to combating waste fraud and abuse in health insurance and health care delivery to simplifying the administration of health insurance among other things the privacy rule regulates certain healthrelated entities covered entities 13 handling of protected health information phi which is generally speaking individually identifiable health information when human subjects research involves the handling of phi by covered entity the protections of the privacy rule attach regardless of the funding source or whethe r the research will be used to support an application to fda for marketing the requirements of the privacy rule are somewhat different than those of the common rule whereas the common rule requires informed consent before the person can participate in research the privacy rule requires patients authorizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs9 14 the privacy rule specifically permits authoriz ation to be combined with informed consent 45 cfr 164508b3i in addition in some circumstances including the conduct of research the privacy rules requirements may be satisfied by either informed consent or authorization see eg 45 cfr 164532a there are also certain exceptions to the authorization requirement which allow for standard healthprovider and insurer business practices for the provision of health care and for circumstances in which the requirement has been waived by an irb or privacy board 45 cfr 504506 15 for full list of the required elemen ts of authorization see 45 cfr 164508 c 16 45 cfr 164502f privacy rule 45 cfr 46102f common rule there are certain exceptions to the privacy rules requirement regarding postmortem research at 45 cfr 164512i1iii 17 background research might entail reviewing patients medical files to determine the frequency of common intervention so that th need for an improved intervention could be evaluatedfor the release of his or her phi 45 cfr 4650814 the elements of authorization are focused on disclosure of information ra ther than on preparation for participation in research elements include for example that authorization must be in plain language contain description of the in formation and its proposed uses contain the name of the person requesting authoriz ation list start and end date for the research include the authorizations expira tion date and state the individuals right to revoke his or her authorization15 the privacy rule requires authorization for the release of phi in some cases in which the common rule does not require informed consent fo r example for post mortem research the common rule app lies only to research involving living persons16 one other distinction is that although the privacy rule allows authorization to be combined with informed consent it specifically prohibits the combination of authorizations for various research projects compound authorization 45 cfr 164508b3 the comm on rule contains equivalent prohibition another distinction is that the privacy rule does not require oversight for background research17 that is conducted without re moving phi from the covered entity 45 cfr 164512i1ii under th terms of the common rule this type of inquiry would constitute human subjects research and trigger regulatory provisions 45 cfr 46102d another point of distinction between the privacy rule and the common rule is that the privacy rule allows for certain actions to be taken by either an irb or privacy board the common rule requires action by an irb according to the terms of the privacy rule privacy board which may be an irb 45 cfr 164512i1ib httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs10 has members with varying backgrounds and appropriate professional competency as necessary to review the effect of the research protocol on the individuals privacy ri ghts and related interests includes at least one member who is not affiliated with the covered entity not affiliated with any entity conducting or sponsoring the research and not related to any person who is affiliated with any of such entities and does not have any member particip ating in review of any project in which the member has conflict of interest because the common rule 45 cfr 46 f da regulations and the privacy rule all have different triggers human subjects research may have to meet all some or none of these federal requi rements for example an hhsfunded study conducted by hospital to help test drug for ma rketing would be subject to all of the regulations privatelyfunded study conduc ted in practitioners office to compare surgical techniques may be subject to none of them concerns about the common rule though the spectrum of regulations that may govern human subjects research have been implemented over time the regulations that are the basis of the co mmon rule were crafted over 30 years ago at that time research project was typica lly conducted at sing location and was largely federally funded since the origin regulations took effect the number of privately

ethical and policy issues in international research clinical trials in developing countries apr 2002clinical trials in developing nations as the pace and scope of international collaborative biomedical research have increased longstanding questions bout the ethics of designing conducting and followingup on international clinical trials have reemerged some of these issues have taken center stage because of the concern that resear ch conducted by inves tigators and sponsors from more prosperous nations in poor nations that are heavily burdened by disease may at times be seen as imposing ethically inappropriate burdens on the host country and on those who particip ate in the research trials29 in its april 2001 report ethical and policy issues in international research clinical trials in developing countries 30 nbac referred to these poor nations in which research is increasingly being conducted as developing countries where local tec hnical skills and other key resources are in relatively scarce supply the following factors are among those that nbac cited as often leading to bioethi cal dilemmas posed by research conducted in developing nations special challenges arise from the combined effects of different countries distinctive hi stories cultures politics judicial systems and economic situations in countries in which extreme poverty afflicts so many primary health care services generally are inadequate and majority of the population is unable to gain access to the most basic and essential health products and services so the people in these countries are often more vulnerable in situations such as clinical trials in which the promise of better health seems to be within reach making determination about the appropriate design for clinical trial depends on various contextual considerations so that what might be an ethically acceptable design in one situation could be problematic in another for ex ample it might be unethical to conduct clinical trial for health condition in country in which that condition is unlikely to be f ound in comparison the same trial might be quite appropria tely conducted where th trial results could be important to the local population in some countries the methods used in united states based studies for identifying appropriate groups for study enrolling individuals from those groups in protocol and obtaining informed voluntary consent might not succeed because of different cultural or social norms meeting the challe nge of developing alternative methodologies requires careful ttention to the ethical issues

discern what factors should be considered in the riskbenefit equation one way potential benefits from research may be categorized is by their likely recipients research study might have potential benefits for the research subjects for people in the same category as the research subjects andor for society in general84 despite general ethical prohibiti ons against putting one group of people at risk solely for the benefit of others many observers have found that some small amount of risk might be acceptable even if there is predic ted benefit to the subjects the national research council of the national academies nrc considered whether researchers could expos subjects to small amounts of pesticides that are currently in use in order to establish their safety85 such study would pose some minimal risk to the subjects but potential benefit would flow to them or to others in the same category the only benefit would accrue to society in this case the nrc found that health and environm ental benefits to so ciety could justify somewhat higher risk level than that posed by studies for which there is identifiable risk or for which there is reasonable certainty of harm nrc stressed that risk of lastin g harm is never justifiable86httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs40 86 continued research study that was designed to fill cr itical data gaps in the understanding of how children may be

experiments in human beings are mora lly unconscionable and scientifically dubious they fail to meet fundamental standards of permissible research as they offer potential therapeutic benefit to the subjects or society87 opponents of pesticide experimentation also claim that such experiments violate the nuremberg code and all subsequent nationa l and international codes of medical research ethics that were adopted precisely to prevent potentially rmful experiments from ever again being conducted on human beings88 parallel issue to whether studies with therapeutic value and minimal risk may be ethically conduc ted is whether study particip ants can ethically be denied known treatments and be placed on placebo as part of control group in the investigation of new drug or treatment while participation may benefit subjects who receive the new drug those in the placebo gr oup may not benefit and may actually undergo some risk if denied known treatment by their pa rticipation in the study according to ethicist howard brody researchers may deny part of the study group treatment known to be effective as long as subjects are not harmed in seeking the goal of gaining new knowledge89 the nbac drew finer distinction in human participants stating that when placebos are used and in all cases irbs should limit the amount of social and physical risk that can be imposed regardless of the participants willingness to participate or the monetary or other enticement being offered further the possibility of some benefit from one element of study should not be used to justify otherwise

govohrpsachrp visited apr 20 2005unlike the difficulty with estimating potential benefits which rests in part on the likely recipient the difficulty with risk assessment lies in ensuring that the level of risk triggers an appropriate level of review thorough review of protocols that pose minimal risks to human participants may be conducted quick ly while those with higher risk may require more scrutiny as the number and variety of research protocols involving human subjects has in creased some irb mbers have called for consistent transparent guidance about oversight required for various categories of human subjects research the nbac addressed this issue in human participants recommending that federal policy require an ethical review that is commensurate with the nature and level of risk involved and defining minimal risk as th probability and magnitude of harms that are normally encountered in th daily lives of the general population on related note nbac also recommende d that each component of study be evaluated separately and its risks should be both reasonable in themselves as well as be justified by the potential benefits to society or the participants potential benefits from one component of study shoul d not be used to justify risks posed by separate component of study this ty pe of component analysis is not currently required by or mentioned in the common rule which directs irbs to weigh the risks and potential benefits of the entire study see 45 cfr 46111a2 in other words the common rule allows an irb to justify an increased risk posed by one portion of research study by benefit gleaned from separate portion of research study or by the entire study90 the iom investigated the issue of levels of review in responsible research it recommended that the degree of scrutiny the extent of continuing oversight and the safety monitoring procedures for re search proposals should be calibrated to studys degree of risk specifically io m recommended that ohr

interpretations among irbs irb shopping second potential issue concerns the local flexibility that the common rule and fda regulations and the hipaa privacy rule by cross reference to the common rule

privacy rule and the common rule may jointly govern some research but apply differently from one anothe r in the following key areas150 1 scope the privacy rule has different scope than the common rule while the common rule attaches when there is federal funding source 45 cfr 46101 the privacy rule app lies regardless of funding source but restricts only the actions of covered entities health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers who transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with transaction for whic h hhs has develope d standards eg medicare claims151 the privacy rule restricts covered entities disclosure of phi whether in an ectronic or other form 2 background research the privacy rule requires oversight in one circumstance where the common rule necessitates prior irb review the privacy rule permits covered entity to use and disclose phi for research purposes without an individuals aut horization provided the covered entity obtains representations from the researcher that the use or disclosure of the phi is solely to prepare research protocol or for similar purpose preparatory to research that the researcher will not remove any phi from the covered entity and that phi for which access is sought is necessary for the research152 the common rule would classify the same background investigation into patient health records as human subjects res earch and would thus require prior irb approval 45 cfr 46102d f2 3 databases repositories and specified future research the privacy rule requires patients authorization for the release of phi in some cases in whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs63 153 there are few exceptions to this requirement specified in 45 cfr 164532 154 see eg julie ingelfinger and jeffrey

respect to the protected health information of deceased individual 45 cfr 160103 individual means the person who is the subject of phi 156 the emphasis of subjects emphasis is reflected throughout the common rule and prominently in its title federal policy for the protection of human subjects 157 health services research is the study of the effects of using different modes of organization delivery and financing for health care services its focus is on the effectiveness of health care interventions in realworld setting whereas clinical research concentrates on the efficacy of interventions in the controlled setting of clinical trialthe common rule does not require informed consent to obtain phi from database or repository or to reuse it in the future the privacy rule requires the researcher to obtain the specific authorization of each individual whose health information was procured specifically prohibiting the combination of authorizations for various research projects compound authorization 45 cfr 164508b3153 the common rule contains equivalent prohibition some who conduct registry or database research have questioned the necessity of obtaining specific authorization for each disclosure as the privacy rule requires claiming that the requirement is burdensome and that other adequate privacy safeguards could be implemented154 4 postmortem research the privacy rule has requirement regarding research on cadavers that the common rule does not the privacy rules definition of individual is not limited to living persons155 therefore the privacy rule would require researchers to obtain aut horization from legal representative of the deceased before conducting resear ch on deceased persons the common rule limits its definition of human subjects to the living and therefore does not apply to postmortem research 45 cfr 46102f 5 irb role while privacy and confidentiality issues are involved in all forms of research involving human participants the focus of irb review under the common rule is to protect the safety of individuals enrolled in clinical research156 however in the rapidly expanding field of health services research hsr157 which typically involves the seconda ry analysis of large databases of medical records previously collected for other purposes the principal risk to participants is not physical harm but loss of privacy the common rule specifies that irbs may only approve res earch that is judged to have adequate provisions to protect the privacy of s ubjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data 45 cfr 46111a7 and requires that informed consent include statement describing the extent if any to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be mainta ined 45 cfr 46113a5 even so it does not provide any additional require ments stipulate acceptable protection provisions or define terms the privacy rule may thus significantly expand the function of irbs by requiring them to weigh the potential threats to privacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32909crs64 158 the preamble to the privacy rule notes that waivers will rarely apply to clinical trials because the researchers are likely to have cont act with the research subjects and be able to seek authorization to use their medical inform ation waivers are more likely to be sought in hsr investigators conducting hsr may not have the ability to contact the original subjects and even if locating them is theore tically possible the number of individuals may be far too large to make contacting them practicable 159 susan h ehringaus aamc project

by the association of american medical colleges found that the privacy rule had the following effects on research159 research subjects were confused nd distracted by having to both consent to participate in research as per the common rule and authorize use of their phi as per the privacy rule collaborations became more difficult because the privacy rule requires authorization for phi to be shared among institutions and the common rule does not the quality of research was diminished and research costs wereraised because of the authorization requirements which require subject to assent before each separa disclosure of their phi the common rule has been interpreted to allow onetime consent for research the positive effects of the privacy rule on individual privacy are more difficult to document however it does make explicit requirements that must be met before personally identifiable health information can be disclosed the interaction of the privacy rule and the common rule was

ethical or legal framework controlled investigations was in place medical practice and research were gove rned by the hippocratic oath the first set of western writings about medical practice the oath was rooted in the ethical principles of nonmaleficence directing physicians not to harm patients and beneficence directing physicians to benefit patients with little concern for autonomy directing physicians to respect th informed decisions of patients one version of the oath advised the wisdom of concealing most things from the patient while you are attending to him turning his attention away from what is being done to him and revealing nothing of the patients future or present condition168 the hippocratic oath placed decisions bout medical care and research in the hands of physicians who had more scie ntific and medical knowledge than their patients decisionmaking by layperson was perceived to be burden physicians should alleviate rather than right they should respect nuremberg code

the nuremberg code instructed researchers to ensure that the potential benefits outweighed the risks of research and to minimize those risks researchers were also prohibite d from causing permanent harm or death to their subjects the nuremberg code did not resolve all possible issues it lacked detail failing both to describe how consent was to be obtained and was not capable of handling complex

confused committees and led to arbitrary application of the policy194 1971 dhew guide in 1971 dhew expanded the surgeon generals policy and defined many of the missing terms in its institutional guide to dhew policy on protection of human subjects the guide offered clarifications such as listing of the elements of informed consent nd added requirement that ongoing research projects be continually

its work culminated in the issuance of the belmont report199 which sets forth the following three principles principal of respect for persons consideration must be given to individuals autonomy this prin ciple underlies the requirement of obtaining informed consent principal of beneficence research must be shown to be beneficial and reflect the hippocratic ideal of doing harm principle of justice
