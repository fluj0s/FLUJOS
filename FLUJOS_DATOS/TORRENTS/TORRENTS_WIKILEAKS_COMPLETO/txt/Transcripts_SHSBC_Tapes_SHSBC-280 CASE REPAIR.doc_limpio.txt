case repair lecture given on 26 march 1963 how are you doing how are you doing audience fine thats much better thats much better got to get little live response around here someplace now the reason this lecture is late today has nothing to do with so dont blame as you know im running the goal to be responsible and so im not responsible for very much here dont you see and youre youre all responsible so why did you make the lecture late i have very very good announcement to make the 26th of march ad 13 the saint hill special briefing course is on this date entering theor has completed the hundred hundredth week of the course this is the hundredth week of the course you wouldnt think we could last that long huh i mean the instructors and myself and so forth that shows that we have tremendous survival capacity tremendous survival capacity now during that time there have been 192 students enrolled 130 students have been and gone and there are 62 students on course at present interesting huh now this is nice anniversary and in this anniversary i expect to make some clears in order to celebrate it and that means you hear you got that all right get clear this week okay all right now were doing pretty much okay and its fitting note to begin this lecture fitting note to give you lecture on case repair case repair now worry is the occupational hazard of the auditor doing routine 2 and routine 3 its so much so that there is even worry rule and to paraphrase the rule if the pc is doing okay dont worry and if the pc isnt doing okay worry in other words dont worryto give you corollaries dont worry yourself and the pc and start worrying about things and diving around on things unless theres some reason to do so if the pc looks bad and feels bad and so forth well thats the time to start worrying and the other extreme is dont neglect to straighten up pc who isnt doing all right dont just keep plowing madly on finding more items hoping for the best pc arc broke flu upset in general and all this sort of thing dont just keep going on and on and on doing new things new things new things get back take look at it and find out whats wrong because theres always something very specific that is wrong the worry rules youd be amazedyoud be amazed how upset some auditors can get how marvelously upset they can get over pc whos doing just fine and youll be equally amazed at the complete woodenindian godhelpusall presson presson presson of some auditors whose pc is all curled up in ball has turned completely black and the lists arent running and theyre not even in the same goal anymore and so on and they arent even able to get the pc on the emeter because he cant curl his hands up and here this auditor is trying to find new new items and so on and never repair anything thayh its quite interesting i want to interject comment there because i may forget it when i give you another lecture on goals ismary sue made this and id like to interject it there are two other types of auditors theyre the type of auditors on the routine 2gs theres the type of auditor who sets down the pcs goal given him you see the pc said oh ive got goal ive got goal ive got goal and so forth and the auditor just sits it puts it down over here and moves it aside and never does anything else with it he doesnt know why hes doing 2g and theres the other auditor who never does 2g1 but only sits there and does 2g2 you get the idea the pc keeps giving him goals so he keeps doing 2g2 and he gives goals 2g2 and so forth and there it is marvelous isnt it never does any 2g1 well theres happy medium theres happy medium when the pc gives you rocket reading goal you check it out and when the pc gives you goals and so forth why just put them down and if the pc gets too trying on the subject hes just nothing but trying to give you goals trying to give you goals and there doesnt happen to be anything rocket reading there or anything and you havent completed your 2g1 why just say well you know in the first half hour of this session why im going to check out the goals that you have given and in the remainder of the session were going to do just 2g1 if you think of goal of course why we can put it down but it wont be checked out in other words theres ways to handle this situation mary sue authored that observation it was direct observation not cynical comment the otherthe other thing here is that an auditor very often doesnt quite know why he is doing 2g1 and goes through all the eighteen buttons twice in two hours of auditing and hes done 2g1 thats pretty marvelous you know i dont think i could get the suppress button flat on preclear in under one session thats kind of different look well of course thats prejudiced look its prejudiced and so forth my pcs are usually insession well anyhow thats athats snide comment isnt it its just whenwhen you cant get the pc to answer the question the pc isnt giving you anything factual and so forth and giving you big brushoff on 2g1 and that sort of thing and saying well oh well yes ive suppressed lot of purposes im suppressing your purpose right now of trying to run 2g1 all right and the auditor says oh okay i dont get any read on that thats fine and all right have you invalidatedhow have you invalidated purpose well i guess i just invalidated your purpose now for trying to run 2gv all right thats clean thats clean that has nothing to do with why you run 2g1 as matter of fact pc who operates that way is the one who has to have the most 2g1 why because their overts come right into the session against the purposes of the auditor who is simply trying to run process which will deliver the goal into his hands all right so in goals findingin goals finding we begin the activity of creating case folder creating case background as we audit this person we create line or goals plot and we get our auditors report forms and all of that sort of thing and that goes forward and this is all germane this is all germane to case repair but case repair doesnt get crucial until the person has had that goal run now normally simply finding wrong goal on pcits so what if nobody does anything with the goal perfectly all right to have found the wrong goal who cares if nobody does anything with the goal and the repair of its very easy if nothing has been done with the goal repair is very simple all youve got to do is prepcheck it or even if somethings been done with it just give it prepcheck and that straightens it out and most case repair however does begin in the findingthegoal area because sometimes the pc has had found on him goal that wasnt ready to be found it doesnt rocket read or do very nice things you know and somebodys forced it off on him and the bank theyrethe gpm theyre running has nothing whatsoever to do with the goal that has been found and so forth well then you have to case repair it back to finding goal when this kind of thing exists so the 2gs do come into case repair they do come into case repair because you could take somebody who found wrong goal and his rs and rr disappeared and that sort of thing and theyve run down bank and they cant seem to find goal and that sort of thing well the thing to do is just to recognize that the case has been run off the rails most gorgeously and that the proper action is to straighten it up from goals point of view if however you did have goal it did fire and you did get blowdown on it and so on and youve merely run more items and strays out of another bank and so forth you of course still are engaged in 2g1 but you tend not to look on it as that you look on it as part of 3m the action which you should undertake when case has had one goal run and it has disappeared or something has happened with it the actions which should be undertaken are all resident in the 2gs theyre actually not 3m actions well what do you do you have to list goals against items and you have to list goals you have to null old lists and sometimes sometimes you have to run 2g1 on the person because their goal was so faint in the first place because 2g1 had not been run you see and therefore it was the wrong goal or something like that you have to prepcheck an old goal that you cant make any sense out of so case repair can begin in the action of routine 2g in other words if you had line plot in front of you and you didnt even have the goal for that line plot i saw one the other day you didnt think this will exist this goal actually did not compare to the line plot the goal was to experience and the line plot on it had something on this order it had people who do what i tell them i think that was the dominating theme of the line plot and here washere was this goal to experience what did it have to do with the plot well eithermaybe one or two of those items did belong to the goal to experience but then they had strayed off into some other gpm through reversingyou know they reverse oppose something and flipped over they did skip and they went over into this other gpm when they got over into this other gpm they just kept on finding items finding items finding items and the pc kept trying to say faintlyor maybe they omitted the how does the goal compare to it step because the pc usually says well of course it compares to it its the reverse of it and the auditor finally says well the step is not necessary and hes got goal to be ballet dancer see and they run across an item steam locomotive and the auditor is omitting how does this how does this goalhow is this goal related or how is this item related to experienceto to experience how is this item related to it steam locomotive or how is it related to the goal to be ballet dancer steam locomotive ballet dancer and the pc says steam locomotive ballet dancer well steam locomotive couldnt do ballet could it i dont know dont know i dont know how it relates to lets see steam locomotive and ballet dancer i dont know maybe the maybe maybe the steam coming out of the funnel maybe the steam coming out of the funnel maybe maybe it looks like ballet costume yeah must be i guess well the presson type of auditor says all right well now lets oppose it now lets see is it terminal or an oppterm and so forth who or what would oppose steam locomotive well theyre running this bank over here which is to be powerful see and they get all these items for the bank to be powerful and theyre sitting here with the goal to be ballet dancer theres one item on the line plot or two items or three items on the line plot that have to do with ballet dancer and all the rest of them have to do with to be powerful you see hydroelectric plants hydroelectric plants tremendous crushing force powerful people people who smash you and so forth and the auditors sitting there you knowif he was doing this step if he didnt omit ithed say all right now how would the item smashing people compare to relate to the goal to be ballet dancer well pcwell i guess he makes smashing impact on the audiences i guess smashing impact on the audience and the auditor says oh all right it does relate does relate good down it goes on the line plot hes sitting here looking at the meter one session he notices his rrs have been kind of small and all of sudden he cant get an rr theres rr on any list theres rr here theresthe needle is just sort of something and the tone arm is up here at five and quarter and whats he done well hes run 3m in such way as to make it necessary to repair the case with 2g you get that now the goals check 1963 issue ii says that the first actionthisll continue to be the first action in checking out clearis does the goal relate to the line plot and thatll seem silly to lot of you but youre going to be disabused of it man youll be out in some organization or keokuk or someplace an auditor is going to turn up with this line plot and its going to have hydroelectric power plants steam locomotives crushing smashing force inexorable pressure poor little weak erk and the goal of this is to be ballet dancer its just by inspection how do you repair this case you find the goal of the items which youve got or if youve got goal that fired and was inspected and seen to fire you find the items that apply to that goal so the items that apply to the goal of course is 3m action to find the goal for the items youve got is in actual fact 2g action and you just go at it and just find the goal youve got lot of items and you just go ahead with your 2g actions and you find the goal for them but basically you should try to find items for goal if the goal was proper goal and if it did fire and you will greatly appreciate when youve doing this having some class iv initial down in the corner of the auditors report not separate sheet floating around someplace but right on the auditors report the day the goal was found or few days later when they went and got it checked out and right down there in the corner it says checked out rred soandso soandso soandso signed initial and you say oh or name you say well its checked out by class iv auditor therefore therefore the action is to find the items which belong to this goal but if there was checkout and somebody said oh it rocket read all right the needle just went all over the place you know it rocket read yeah it rocket read when it was found it went just like that you say oh brother where are we at well i can tell you where youre at youve got hatful of items that may or may not have validity you have an auditor who didnt know rocket read youve got mess on your hands and you will be very pleased at that time as you look with some horror at this messyoull be very pleased to remember this primary datum of all case repair now this datum applies to running an old goal which has already been listed out on 4 lines 16 lines 40 lines and 114 lines its been listed out till you cant get tick on it anymore but it did produce at one time free needle with all this listing this applies to somebody who had wrongly worded source list it applies to somebody who suddenly cognited on what the first item was and made up his own line plot we had somebody here do that the other day by the way he didnt cognite on the first item he just made up the balance of his line plot and hes pretty sick too thats all right these wild actions you knowthese wild actions are all of themare all of them incapable of deranging the gpm you say what youre handling nearly indestructible commodity called the gpmor the gpms we should call the whole bank the goals problemsgoals problem masses and one gpm the goalsa goals problem mass in other words the and would be different and masses or mass in other words call one single gpm which consists of one goal and packet of items call that gpm and all of these many goals you see each one with their system of items and so forth why call that aggregation the gpms and i think well have little bit easier time communicating now gpm or the gpms are almost completely impervious to improper 3m now you can just hang that up as stable datum the pc can be made pretty green purple and pink the pc can be listed backwards and upside down the pc can be made pretty sick and be caved in most magnificently fine fine job of presson has been done on this pc you see hes been pressed on up to the point of where hes practically in the hospital and you say oh my god look at the extent of the damage well remember something remember something the human body is not the gpm and the thetan isnt the gpm what hasnt suffered any damage there of any kind whatsoever is the gpm and that is good datum for you well the pc hasnt been destroyed or anything like that he can still talk occasionally if hes fed quick brandy and then you listen you know closely hell be able to sayhell be able to say cat and you get another item for your list you know and feed him another quick brandy you know and get two items day for four or five months and you eventually get the new source list you see and he feels better sarcastic if the pc feels bad if the body feels bad if it all is caved in remember this is your stable datum the gpm is impervious to anything but perfectly done 3m that should make you feel good it doesnt make the pc feel good oh you can throw the pc into various parts of the gpm yes you can get splinter items yes you can list things backwards and throw him into other banks yes you can produce the full effect of being in grouper yes all these things can be done to the pc and theyre not comfortable but they dont disturb the order of sequence or anything else of the gpm isnt that remarkable youve run the whole goal out theres big blowdown the goal doesnt even tick anymore and yet youre absolutely certain looking at this line plot that less than half of the items on this line plotwhich only has twenty items on it and none of the fundamental bottom itemsthis whole line plot only half of it refers to this goal wheres the rest of the goal you saywell heres the worry type at work see but my god how can i find any more items or run any more items how can i possibly do any of this because look here look here i mean the goal hasnt got any further charge on it therefore i cant find the rest of the gpm because the goal hasnt got any charge yes you can go finding items as long as there are items to be found whether the goal responds to your read or not in fact practically everything youre ever going to worry about is covered rather magnificently succinctly and so forth that the gpms or gpm is impervious to anything but absolutely correctly donecorrectly done 3m and that should hearten you because at any stage of case repair everything thats been done right with 3m will remain right and everything thats been done wrong can be remedied and youll find out that the correct is sitting there isnt that interesting remember that now when you start doing case repair and itll keep you from doing lot of silly weird things and keep you from worrying thats for sure because all right this character comes in and hes got this and youve got the goal and the goals apparently been run out and theyve done source list for every item well somebody will sooner or later done source list and they found an item and then theyve done source list and they found an item and theyve done source list and they found an item and theyve done source list and they found an item well theyve done it the hard way theyve done it the hard way all you need to do is find where it didnt work anymore and at the point it didnt work anymore youre going to find that the gpm was totally impervious and where did it stop working it stopped working on the second source list and did they find any items after that yeah they found some ticks and they found some rocket reads and they opposed them and they did this and they did that and they found some things they found some things on the bank well dont disturb ever disturb an existing line plot you can haul items off of it and put it on some other line plot but dont ever disturb an existing line plot anything that youvebeen found on the pc has been found theres another big stable datum in case repair so they found steam locomotive in this goal to be ballet dancer all right you can put ring around it if you want to it doesnt seem to belong and sooner or later youre running this case and somebodys running the case and they say heres goal to be powerful haha i wonder if he got any items anywhere else in this case and so forth steam locomotive haha let tell you something very peculiar that steam locomotive has been found and exists on another line plot does not alter the gpm so far as 3m is concerned and the gpm called to be powerful will be found to obey all the rules of 3m and everything has to be done to it that has to be done to it isnt that interesting lets say you found item 1 item 2 item 3 item 4 item 5 let say all these things have been found and they already existed and so forth when you do youryour goal oppose list for that gpm and yes you do two goal oppose lists for the gpm which ill talk about in moment when you do the goal oppose list for the goal to be powerful itll land you right exactly where youre supposed to be if youve done it properly yeah but you say good god in 212 they found harelipped lightning bolt and they found weak as catwhisker and they found all these vital items all these vital items have been found and there they are and sure they belong in the line plot and that undoubtedly upsets because thatd be the top terminal and thatd be the top oppterm and oh life is too cruel here look all this stuffs been found so therefore im going to pick it up in the middle of the bank youre not going to pick it up in the middle of the bank youre going to pick it up in the right top oppterm or the right top term simple huh it is simple it doesnt matter whats been found it doesnt matter how many skips have been gone into in the bank it just doesnt matter ill give you some kind of an idea of this i had goal that we got into and ran about twenty items in ran it clearand didnt find the goal for it and then became aware that there was goal for it and there was bunch of randomity of one kind or another and we found the goal to the next bank and we finally came back and found the goal for this thing and ran it on down and finished it up and so on all was going along fine haha on the case repairon the case repair on that particular goal because source list had been done on it and so on and itd landed in the wrong spots we found nineteen items the nineteen correct items the nineteen correct items for that bank were found even though twenty items had already been found in the bank and it had appeared to run now you got that see why worry man look you know that thetan has been sitting around here for couple of hundred trillion years you realize that there have been psychiatrists all over the track i mean you probably didnt realize that it was stupid universe but it is been psychiatrists all over the track theyve been electric shocking people well that certainly should have upset the gpms shouldnt it have huh you know the idea of cure is hundred billion kilomegavolts or something you know and youve got all this blast pistol and glare fights and this person was through world war 1 and world war ii too and in addition to that was standing in the middle of hiroshima on that memorable day when the us collected motivator what thewhat the hell you know this is prettythis is pretty bad thing here and this pcthis pc is going togoing to respond properly his bank will be scrambled been electric shocked hes hadwell back about two hundred thousand years ago he had eighteen prefrontal lobotomies four transorbital leukotomics and had to listen to lecture by kennedy the guy was completely brainwashed utterly see all right now whats this bird all about whats this bird all about that didnt upset the gpm thats the stuff its made of the one thing it cant stand and ive got to give you lecture someday on exactly how the gpm is formed exactly why it is formed exactly why it is always of that pattern exactly why exactly why exactly why its the most remarkable story you ever saw if you want to know exactly what it is read book one and wherever it says engram in the explanation of why people have engrams why you just put in its appropriate place item or gpm and youve got the whole explanation its quite interesting but ill give youill give you lecture on this sometime there is reason he postulates each goal the only thing that i have ever been in error abouti said many times that he had reason to postulate these goals well in actual fact on very close examination he each time had reason to postulate the goal and it was borne out from the goal he had just survived and he carries that on over his postulation of his next goal but he doesnt just postulate them from nothing that is the first goal of the bank is postulated from nothing nothing else is all right now this this character has lived through all of these things this character has actually been subjected to the socialist economic principles of galbraith hes read book on economics by lord keynes hes been educated in several different schools and places and at numerous times in his life he couldnt find the decelerator switch in time to keep the ship from plowing into sun he in other words hes had ball this didnt upset his gpm the only thing that can upset gpm is just this just this is perfect mechanical auditingthis doesnt mean mechanical auditing but perfectly mechanically arranged exactly right approach with an emeter and so forth and there goes the gpm zzz it cant stand the precision which we give it because we know exactly how it hangs together it actually hangs together more or less by violence or lack of it so its very accustomed to violence and its very accustomed to mistakes and its very accustomed to all kinds of things but youfrankly itd be nearly impossible absolutes are unobtainable but itd be nearly impossible to make sufficient auditing goof to actually upset the gpm on the other hand you could make the pc very unhappy so itd make it very hard for you to get him in an auditing chair you might be sufficiently knuckleheaded i doubt it itd take lot of duress you might be sufficiently knuckleheaded to knock off the mockup dont you see you could affect the morale of the pc with regard to auditing strenuously you could affect the bodythe body is more resilient than you would suppose but in actual fact the handling of gpm correctly handles it and slightly incorrect handling doesnt handle it and doesnt even derange it i think that stands very much in your favor you start doing one wrong and you actually i dont know what the count of items you could find in the thing is concerned it is just go will go on and on and on and on and on and some of those items will be right but the bulk of those items neednt ever have been found thats why you get the varying length the varying length of gpm has to do with how long the goal served the pc as survival mechanism its success in other words as survival mechanism and that doesnt vary it very much the difference of line plots however gives an apparent difference in the number of items in the gpm because its how many extraneous items does the auditor find and put on the line plot thatstill in that gpm but really neednt have been foundthat would have blown if youd found the right item so you can put extraneous items in line plot you can also put strays in line plot that are from some other goal you dont recognize theyre from some other goal and they go into the line plot and it isnt till youre straightening them up afterwards after theyve done three or four and youre neating up line plots and you all of sudden where the hell does steam locomotive come from you see thooh theres steam locomotive sitting right there staring us in the face and its an oppterm and its got drunk engineer as its terminal and you say where did they come from where did that pair arrive from you look around for while you may not even have the goal yet but youll eventually find the goal and eventually you will find to be powerful something like that and youll be all set so stop worrying about the damage an auditor can do to the gpm because it is still sitting thereif its grossly misrun it is still sitting there ready to be run right and thats wonderful datum its still sitting there ready to be run right all right we found item 1 item 2 item 3 item 4 item 5 item 6 item 7 item 8 now all of sudden we couldnt find any more items and we got steam locomotive sitting in the middle of the line plot well where did that come from where did all this go from and we go back and we find that this one is ticking and that is rsing and another ones ticking and we say whawhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whats going on well your immediate conclusion is is well my god weve messed up the gpm to such an extent that and we cant find anything right you know write off one pc pcll feel like this too hell be sure that hes now nowll be written off whats the truth of the matter you go back and you look this over and you find something as flagrant as this when they did the first source list for that gpm they did it with wrong wording because the pc said he couldnt answer the right goal wording instead of who or what would to be ballet dancer oppose why the auditors qandaed and he said being ballet dancer oppose who or what would being ballet dancer oppose this of course has opposed an item naturally theres an item in there called being ballet dancer and hes handled this now as source list since itll kind of act like this and can be overlistedyou see any list can be overlisted and hell write it out and eventually hell get something that opposes it and sure enough hell wind up with something opposing it but after hes opposed couple of these ri lists he all of sudden winds up with nothing and its all backwards or hes skipping the bank and nothing is working right hes done wrong source list what is your proper action in all case repairs matter what state of running the gpm see youre not running pc in the first place youre running gpm the pc and you are cooperating in the running of gpm and at any stage of auditing on gpm youll find the first wrong action behind you that can now be foundthe first wrong action behind you that can now be foundand correct it and do it right the way it should be done well weyou can just apply it and apply it and apply it and apply it i mean there it is it goes back as early as the source list you found twentyseven items in this gpm and its all been very difficult and youve also found some strays and skips and have things backwards it was all very very difficult and you eventuallywhy you get very wise and you go back and you look at your source list this first goal oppose list see you look at this source list and you look at that thing and you say oh i dont know i said who or what would to be ballet dancer oppose and ii listed it but nothings run right since the first item that i found which is elegant dancing obviously an oppterm wound up with terminal to eat pork deteriorated form of ballet dancing or is it you dont even have to know that much about it go back and look at the mechanics of the source list whats it look like whats it look like well along about that time why the auditor lets say has heard lecture on dont overlist dont run the pc into the ground with overlisting so hes done perfectly validperfectly valid source list done perfectly valid source list perfectly valid its eight pages eight pages of goal oppose its all answered properly and so forth and theres even fifty items there on which rs or rr is markedis marked well you realizedo you realize that if you went over any section of the list and found something else rock slamming or rocket reading the list was incomplete hey you say but weve ruined it weve ruined everybody weve ruined everything now in routine 2 you cant make goofs like this you can take some item off of routine 2 list and oppose it and then you cant get anything else on the list to fire and its all disarranged but 3m isnt like that 3m is much more rugged the actions ofin the gpm are much more rugged he had an incomplete source list well lets complete it lets complete it all right and at page thirtynine only then have we got an area of fifty items beyond the last rr or rs and tone arm action page thirtynine well we skip back and we look at all the rrs and they dont fire and we find this mysterious thing has happened that something fired someplace on the list that we dont have anything null so we eventually null the whole list and there it is and there it is gorgeously its ballet dancers quite obviously fires like crazy we oppose it properly we keep opposing it everything starts running off bingbingbingbingbing goes right on down to the bottom of the bank and there we are bang yeah but youve already found seventeen items into this gpm obviously it was all disarranged everything has gone to pot hasnt it it didnt disturb the gpm lets say you found all the items to the bottom of the gpm and you even have the goal as an ri at the bottom youve gone that far and the thing is still all charged up and so forth and you suddenly say hey do you know that weve never done goal oppose list to start this gpm do you know that you can now do goal oppose list to start the gpm and goal oppose list to end the gpm this is getting phenomenal isnt it in other words if piece of its missing you can always put it there you can always do the right action now your stable data for case repairyour stable data for case repair is to take the auditor and put the fear of ron in him thats always the first action first action you say you realizeyou realize rons nearly an ot now and if he heard you doing things like this ohhhf you know that sort of thing i mean you know put it in like that you dont have to take responsibility for it you see as long as i dont hear about having to take responsibility for it why i will so your nextyour next action after youve done that you can also you can also pick up one of the one of the better looking girls around the organization or something like that and tell the auditor that this girlyoull arrange it so this girl will never again speak of him or to him or something like that you know you can work up things by which he will realize that he should read his bulletins and you get him to study up on his bulletins and read over his bulletins now if hes being too zzzzz about it all youd better have him read his bulletins all right have him read bulletins supplementary bulletins anything else that hes got on the thing and have him get this thing fairly straight because hes got some data in crosswise so dont just straighten up every blunder this auditor makes straighten up the auditor you got that straighten up the auditor and his blunder got that now right now theres some excuse theres some excuse because you havent got all the materials you could have data is still snugging in the job is getting easier and easier to do there are little short quick cuts that are being foundthat im finding that are not just shortcuts of doing 3m but actually more accurate methods of doing 3m which cuts out extraneous material and were still left with our basic stable data on source lists but were not left with the stable data on ris for instance its nonsense to run long ri list now but thats horse of different hue and ill give you bulletin on it the point the point im making here is the guy has got to know what has been found to be runnable now you read the first three bulletins back in 1963 and it is now 1985 and he hasnt read any of the rest of them that would be quite catastrophic wouldnt it trying to run 3m so you straighten him out and then straighten out what hes doing theres your stable data because if you dont get him and coax him every time to review his material on the thing and go over this and so onif you dont coax him also to do thatthen all your action will multiply on straightening out cases in other words hell keep fouling up cases which gives you more and more wasted auditing more and more wasted case repairs more and more wasted this you want to send him always back and refer him to bulletin and insist he read it you got that your next action on case repair just looking it over is handle the thing as though you were giving him clear test or something like that the steps are given in there compare the goal to the line plot do they make sense does the line plot got anything to do with the goal read the goal put in your lefthand buttons on the thing get it to fire see if it fires see if it ticks later in the bank of course it wont fire anymore then go over yourline plot and read from the bottom to the top or from the top to the bottom read each item against the meter just read them against the meter well let tell you if one of the items that should have come from source list now rrnow rock slams its been opposed but now rock slams brother that is the most incomplete source list that anybody ever just the fact that the item off of the source list rock slams is enough to tell you that the source list was improperly handled i mean its just onetwo see it was opposed and the charge did come off of it and the question didnt read anymore see all right thata harmonic of that carries through the remainder of yourof your actions here on this plot so here is your stable datum any item that reads matter how slightlyyou got that nowany item that reads matter how slightly after itself being opposed in actual truth came wrongly into being it came off wrongly done or handled list that is just your stable datum one two three four five six you see that takes care of everything in other words the list is wrong oh yes you say what about these wrong way oppose well ill get to that in minute if the thing rocket reads after having been opposed beautifully that still really is guarantee of wrong way oppose that is guarantee that the list on which it appearedyou know the list just behind it on which it itself occurredwas wrong got that now what you want is the earliest item on the line plot which now reads you say with or without tiger drill i dont care which doesnt enter into it the thing has to be charged in order to have invalidate read you realize that you find the earliest in that sequence of auditing that ticks and look behind it look at the list on which it appeared and do that list correctly therell be something wrong with that list itll be overlisted or underlisted or listed wrong way up or down or something therell be something wrong with that list thats the list youre looking for thats the list it isnt how long list is how short it is how beautiful the handwriting on it is none of these things enter it is simply that list that is the one you want and dont let anybody disturb that stable datum theres something wrong with that list all right if you dont find something wrong with that list you had better recheck earlier items found because you havent foundyoure not exploring the fundamental error in other words theres aif you cant find it off of that list immediately behind then you look earlier for another one that ticks because theres going to be something wrong with those theres going to be something wrong with those and as you go up the bank if theres apparently top on the goal or something like this you know that the item just isnt on the list at all but in actual sober fact in actual sober fact you donttheres variations to this you find the earliest one that was put on the plot that was put on the plot see thats in chronological order of finding not the earliest one or latest one in the bank or anything like thatget the earliest one that was put on the plot that ticks and then correct the list from which it came youll find inevitably and invariably and always that there is something wrong with that list i dont care whether it was the source list i dont care whether it was the first ri oppose the second ri oppose the third ri oppose theres always something wrong with that list now what about these wrong way to oppose well you worry more about wrong way to oppose than you should it isnt true that its something that you should neglect thats not true but wrongway oppose most frequently has this phenomena connected with it it throws you out of the gpm it throws the pc right out of that gpm into another gpm and you get what we will call stray and this stray looks entirely different than the rest of the plot so when you find stray on plot then you trace back and locate which one was wrongway opposed that gave you the stray wheres the first stray on the plot and that is the way you check your wrongway opposes now normally you try to list an item wrong way to the mass comes in on the pc and the needle tightens up and lot of undesirable things happen and its pretty obvious also calling the item to the pc with the line question one way and the line question the other way usually winds him up with an idea of which one turns on the most mass and you dont want that one you want the reverse one one of them makes him feel easier the other one so on some pcs out of pride will direct you to the wrong item and the test is not very good but in actual fact you yourself should know by inspection and your location in the bank whether its term or an oppterm have you got that you ought to get good enough to just recognize it by significance you trained auditor recognizing that all gpms follow the same pattern as the one in the march thirteenth bulletinthose lower items and so forth theyre all in that sequence and so forthshould recognize where you are and if youve cut in down deep into the bank with the wrong source list or something like this and it starts all going unsatisfactory you will find the first source list item that you found and put on the plot is still reading so it goes back to the first correction now what do you do with all these items you have on the plot you leave them on the plot you dont take them away from the pc you say there is his items there are your items thats it hes all happy about it theyre his items fine and you just proceed from the new correct item you find on the list that was incorrectly done just as though you had not found any other items and youll find out that your plot just keeps on beautifully and thats true for all stages of case thats true for all cases thats true for all gpms i dont know what more you can need as repair datum quite remarkable youll find ini know this that youll find if an item rses when you read it back on the line plot and you get an item that rses one of those ris now rsesthat the chances are it came from the source list and the source list was incomplete and the source list was total mess and it was nulled backwards and upside down and few other things like that if theres something wrong with the list the item that ticks comes from and the item that gives you stray was reverseopposed these are stable data in case repair and all case repair should include in itif you yourself are supervising auditorsthe case repair should include an admonition to the auditor to review his material hes probably rehes probably missing something try to teach him yourself bit tell him to reread his material keep him pushed on at it and all of sudden light will dawn bells will ring sirens will go off steam engine will vanish out of his immediate vicinity now theres your action get him educated repair the case see now if you yourself are doing it and youre trying to repair case dont repair case that doesnt need repair thats worrying too much dont fail to repair case that you yourself are auditing dont fail to repair case that needs repair dont just keep blundering on now you have the arc break assessment you have other things and you will come to learn that every time you goof badly is when the pc has small slight arc break or big roaring one and you fail to do an assessment off of the arc break bulletin you always thought you knew what was wrong and its very remarkable that you will find out that you didnt you will spot what is wrong in the immediate vicinity of it youll say yes i picked up the wrong item yeah i bypassed the fellows goal obviously im afraid that isnt what you did you probably did something else like you didnt complete the list or you didnt do something else and itll show up the judgment of the arc break assessment is better than the auditors thats true of all auditors thats true of true of all auditors itsthe judgment of that is better than the auditors judgment any day of the week it comes up and it says you have wrong gpm well god you know youre in the right gpm the thing is all worked out here youve got this goal and youve got these items and so forth wrong gpm hahahaha nuts here you have this goal to be ballet dancer and youve got smashing power steam locomotives there they are right there and so forth so you say obviously theres reason to do an assessment but ive seen some blunders made recently all done by an auditor who assumed he knew what was wrong because it was so obvious in front of his face and then pressed on with that assumption and then really went wrong because he didnt pick out what was wrong what was wrong was missed withhold all right but it was of slightly different character than he thought he thought he had the wrong goal or he bypassed goal he just bypassed gpm that was all he thought that hed reverse listed something he didnt reverse list something he hasnthes not picked the item off of list three lists ago it shows up something else the real rough ones are withheld from both the auditor and the pc thats the real rough ones that really cause you trouble well now thats case repair and i could give you 8760 laws and you could memorize and spend the rest of your life memorizing them all in actual fact there arent this many rules and laws in case repair there are just those rules and laws in case repair and you could also do some other things with case repair you could also run cases so that they always have to be repaired but the real method of repairing case is to run it by perfect 3m in the first place its my job to give you perfect 3m and its your job to see that it works for you too youll find out this indestructible thing the gpm will only surrender to exactly correct routine 3m its the only thing in the universe that makes dent in it that safeguards you because you can learn 3m i can teach it to you and on the other hand if case is run totally wrong why all you have to do is run it right and the only thing you have to do with case repair is find out where it wasnt run right and then youve got it taped and take the earliest action of it that wasnt run right correct it and the case all straightens out 3m looks very dramatic youre liable to get very very nervous you liable to develop ulcerosis glaucoma magna but actually youre probably worrying too much youve probably got too many conditionals theres all kinds of well geewhiz you know the pc kept blinking his eyes in the session and i knew very well there must be an oppterm there of some kind or another yeah the pc kept blinking his eyes in the session yeah probably couldnt have done anything else the auditor turning the sheets over for the listing kept hitting him in the face i mean you just worry too much you understand theres too many cockeyed significances theres too much worryworryworry thinkthinkthink figurefigure figure now what you want to think is are you doing exact routine 3m its my job to show you exactly what routine 3m is and then you recognize when it isnt done because theres 7865 ways per square inch of the pcs bank area that it can be done wrong thats by actual calculation okay you couldnt imagine all the ways it could be done wrong man has been trying to do something to his reactive mind and his bank and make dent upon his fellows for two hundred trillion years youve got the pc sitting in front of you with an intact gpm isnt that marvelous i consider its absolutely wonderful whats only more wonderful than that is we get the exact key to the lock and delicately and adroitly turn it in exactly the right place and open the door to freedom all right well thats the way you repair one i hope that itll do you some good i know that ive had quite time working out its principles because there were so many things that could be wrong and werent and these were the principles that stood up you will always have exceptions to it and the exceptions will inevitably be the creation of somebody who didnt know 3m in the first place okay thank you very much and good night
