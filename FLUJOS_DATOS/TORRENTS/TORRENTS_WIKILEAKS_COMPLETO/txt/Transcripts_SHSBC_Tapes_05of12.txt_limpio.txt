anyone has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc5 renum 5 1 jun 61 flattening process and the emeter flattening process and the emeter lecture given on 1 june 1961 based on clearsound only here we are i think this is the first of june what planet is this all right all right this is seminar the briefing course at saint hill now what questions do you have today yes female voice is it possible for us in tr on model session to have some training in the meter because i found yesterday that an auditor i had just hadnt got this and i kept feeling if she doesnt look at that meter shes going to miss this fall and yeah thats right i get that myself once in while when being audited you know i say well where are we just where are we because the auditor is sitting there doing an obsessive tr 0 hes not doing tr 0 hes doing obsessive tr 0 you see which means to them look at the pc look him between the eyes before you shoot him or something and this obsessive tr 0 you find this mostly in recent hpa students they really go mad on this they never do get themselves between the meter and the pc you know you can actually confront pc you know by looking at meter did you know that well anyhow anyhow that is good point that you have brought up now finish your question female voice well thats all is it possible for us to have that incorporated at late stage as part of the tr 0 in training in model session i should say that would be perfectly all right id say it would be sort of highschool version of it you give the fellow meter and let him have the meter in his lap while hes doing confronting the coach however is not on the meter and the only time this was ever suggested it was suggested that the coach hold meter with the pc not on it i never quite got why the coach would be holding block of wood which looked like meter that was the exact earlier one it didnt have anything to do with it but block of wood or anything that had mass and weight while doing tr 0 id say would be an upperstage tr 0 and would be very good thing to do and while running model session and so forth why have meter parked around this would be good thing your suggestion is very well taken your question is answered yes okay any other questions boy im glad youre that smart gee im glad youre that smart you know i you know when i get up that smart im going to be real proud of myself well if you havent got question i will tell you about some mistakes that are made the first and foremost of these mistakes is while running level flat running level flat this is the commonest mistake which is being made in hgcs academies coaudits from hell to halifax they dont run the levels right now let give you very brief summary of what this is all about in the first place we have discovered how to establish whether or not process is flat we have discovered how we can obey auditors code clause 13 thats for the first time this question is answered for auditors i never have any trouble with this lot of auditors never have any trouble with it but the majority of auditors do have trouble with it when is something flat that was the burning question you see did the needle whistle at you or what happened and as consequence they overran and underran and so on and there was great deal of conversation around this particular point down through the years trying to establish this and bring it home or develop some kind of system by which the communication would become adequate that communication has been developed and is found in emeter essentials you run the pc on the tone arm now there is an exception to this there is an exception to this called the rock slam and i will cover the rock slam as the exception in moment but dont think that i am not aware of this odd exception and it isnt an exception but as long as the tone arm is waving about on process you are guilty of breach of the auditors code if you leave that process before the tone arm is motionless or nearly so now we can communicate that cant we in other words that emeter will sit there and it will tell you whether or not process is flat now something can intervene in this pc between sessions you should always notice where pc reads before he goes out of session and notice where he is reading when he comes back into session because if the reading has materially changed hes gone out and played with mud pies and youd better find out about it because hes got withhold from the auditor and so forth thats the first and commonest error by the way of flattening process the pc goes out between sessions or even during break in an hgc maybe goes calls up her husband in cincinnati or something of the sort and says dear ive just decided that youre the dirtiest filthiest skunk i have ever heard of comes back into session again and that tone arm is reading 65 or it may even be reading 70 you know when pc cant read on the meter he is simply reading at 70 and thats not even joke seven is between 10 and 60 and youll occasionally find somebody who quote wont read on meter well its just due to the mechanics of the tone arm dont turn through 70 responsibility increases from 20 to 10 to 70 to 60 and youre going to find pc every now and then its not as rare as you think running the hot bombs youre running reading at 70 all right so lets say the pc was went off the meter this is the most baffling thing ive ever seen happen to an auditor the pc is ordinarily reading at about 50 comes back on and isnt reading anyplace on the meter and the auditor is liable to report the meter broken or something of the sort well its just fluke the pc has begun to read at 70 all right seven doesnt read on this meter you see seven is actually higher in responsibility than 10 so anyhow there ought to be 70 on the meter okay there is that variation now as this pc goes out of session reading at 50 and comes back into the session not reading on the meter at all or reading 60 or more ordinarily goes out reading at 30 and comes back into session reading 50 and you just go on running the process the process isnt running why because something has happened to the pc thats given him this present time problem and so forth and the whole thing about that is your rudiments are out so therefore when you stop sessions and give breaks and start sessions after these breaks you always start the thing with model session this keeps you from making these flumdumptious errors dont you see so its always good thing to end rudiments before youre going to have break and start rudiments after youve had break i dont care whether its lunch break or cigarette break see as long as the pc has gone out of your sight during that break youre going to have to run end ruds and beginning rudiments all right therefore this wont get in the road with your flattening process see because that could be vagary and throw this whole computation out the pc is running the tone arm is waving madly back and forth you have break comes back the tone arm isnt moving you say the process is flat and then you go on and assess for new process and now you have level left unflat on the case and pc being audited with present time problem you see the solution to that is always keep your rudiments in that is the smartest possible thing always keep your rudiments in okay now if you inevitably and invariably do this youll be all right and this rule applies then of you run process as long as it produces tone arm motion that tells you whether or not the process is flat now this little rule about quarter of tone or half dial or something like that is safety factor it wont trouble the pc and it wont assess again if it has gotten down to reading quarter to an eighth of dial of motion you wont find that level again as hot you understand if you leave it that way for about twenty minutes you know its just moving that little bit over period of twenty minutes you can safely leave the process thats the rule now lets see how the rule is got around there is lots of ways to get around these rules and this is the one which has now come up and this is being done everywhere broadly and with the maddest abandon imaginable now that we have way to flatten the process we have abandoned the idea that it takes process any time to get working so you can run five processes in an afternoon if none of them ever started to work and leave five processes unflat in single afternoons auditing and it has just been done london is just staggering around from arc breaks from ron and unable to flatten ow on ron today thats just literal truth theyre having an awful time because ron came down at 1220 last night getting the last reports and found ooo i spent an hour taking it apart and so forth i found that pc after pc had just been run level after level i couldnt let it happen one more day could i you certainly couldnt have put another fiveandahalfhours worth of unflat processes on it and somebody just actually took their finger totally off their number and even though this has been part and parcel occasionally on remarks they had not caught it as it went by when pc has to read or be assessed with fairly high sensitivity knob to get thirdofadial drop this is always true and its occasionally true on other pcs this is rough pc now thats some pc that reads with high sensitivity knob to get thirdofadial drop that is pc that has very low profile when he comes in any one of these conditions not all of these conditions have to be present to make this true and it also may be that youre just running an awfully sticky level on any pc you got the idea so this could happen at any time that you assess for process and then the first three hours of run on it dont really produce any tone arm motion except quarter to an eighth of dial of motion which of course is the definition for flat process well let ask you this why did it fall on assessment in the first place what mystery do we have here now only person who has got an occasionally floating needle who is getting right up straight toward clear can possibly flatten one of these things down in minutes youll notice as person is coming through toward clear that they do flatten them in minutes but then it becomes very obvious the tone arm actually stops moving and it doesnt stick it simply stops moving with fairly free needle and it wouldnt do bit of harm to overrun the process case is in kind of condition to take it you understand but these fellows that are get these jerky tone arms and have fairly sticky needle and have different reactions of various kinds will increase in read during the first period of auditing the new level theyll increase in read and then theyll get good tone arm motion and then the tone arm motion will die out and then when it has read for twenty minutes for an eighth to quarter of dial of motion it is flat so that is the whole statement with the one exception which i will take up in moment that is the whole statement in other words motion quite often has to be run into the tone arm before it can be run out you got it and if thing assessed and you didnt get any motion from the tone arm and you know this pc is not in marvelous condition yet and so on boy you just better keep running it and you funny thing you should ask yourself this question why is it that hour after hour i can run this thing and it gets an eighth to quarter why well it must be running something see eighth to quarter eighth to quarter eighth to quarter so forth it isnt tightening up the other phenomenon that youre trying to avoid is the needle freezing now when process is overrun on badoff case the needle will freeze the first symptom of this youre entitled to know is rising arm not rising needle forget rising needles but you got rising arm this pc has just been running along fine with half of the tone arm dial division of motion been running dandy sometimes full division sometimes division and half sometimes half division you know i mean its just going along and its all between 30 and 325 on the tone arm dial see between 30 and 325 here all right we look at this and its 30 its going 30 325 maybe itll go up above see 30 325 so on like this and here we go and we all of sudden 40 425 40 425 40 45 and we say boy that was nice move test it for twenty minutes because its liable not to be that stick its liable to blow down see but the first symptom of flattening process is rising tone arm now there are some auditors around trying to prevent tone arms from rising or thinking theyve boobooed if the tone arm starts rising as case is entered into processing originally you will see this as the first maybe some of the mystery of how i know whether or not your the level youre running on the pc is flattening out will explode under just this one fact its the fact youve started to get higher reads consistently see in the last hour youve been getting higher reads and those higher reads didnt blow down tbd now if the higher reads were going to blow down they would ordinarily have blown down in about twenty minutes or so you see they would have acted but that as it drifts up first from very minute motion this is the actual behavior on the flattening of process on pc who is not hes not up even to release yet is quarter quarter quarter an eighth eighth quarter quarter quarter and then all of sudden you start getting it up and it goes up about dial and then it goes little bit little bit quarter quarter quarter boy then its the danger point because this thing can actually go up to 50 suddenly and go clank and you can practically hear the thing go clank now theres danger in it going clank there is danger in it going clank and suddenly sticking and you going on auditing it that way for twenty minutes it is just going to make the pc uncomfortable its going to make the pc uncomfortable and youre going to have to reassess and youre probably going to have to reassess with difficulty because the bank is kind of froze up thats the most thatll happen to you if you were to run this for three days sitting at 50 on total freeze as an auditor has done two days this was done by an auditor and of course my god you couldnt have assessed the case you couldnt have done anything with the case except one thing run the auditor off on the prehav scale the auditor will assess did you know that an auditor will always assess when he has boobooed you know you can you always take all the bad auditing off of case if you run into any you know that and if youre real clever and because youre here and i can tell you its all right to run very brief terminals but if you take somebody whos only been with the guy for twentyfive hours and you run that on the prehav scale well its sort of one command or something like this and its just too brief and it is its messed up it gets messed up so on twentyfive or fiftyhour pc i mean where the auditor has only been with him for oh i dont know at the outside hundred hours or something like this youd better take the case apart with some oldtime process you understand what have you thought about that auditor what have you not told that auditor any kind of an 0w situation or something of this sort now if the auditor is let us say the husband or wife of the pc youre trying to straighten out on this or if there has been long association going up in terms of years now this then is longduration pt problem long duration is defined as years thats longduration pt problem years shortduration pt problem is in terms of months or weeks see we say long and short and then dont leave you wondering what we mean by long and short its years so its all right to take pt problem of long duration ie years and assess that person as terminal by name on the prehav scale and run that level and reassess and run the level now look do you know that its probably less than fifteen minutes level it may be as little as that this is one of the exceptions to the running flattening on the tone arm see its an exception but of course youre doing something exceptional so its not much of an exception youre doing something very exceptional youre taking person that well theyve known each other for ten years and youre running it on the prehav scale which is calculated to go on the whole track so youre doing something exceptional so you have an exceptional answer and it disobeys the twentyminute rule twentyminute rule you dont run that for twenty minutes to find out if its flat see see this is this is not the same thing were talking about when is general level of the prehav scale flat that is to say were just running it generally you know whom have you failed to help you know and that sort of thing thats general run the generalized terminal someone somebody you know something like that general run or an sop goals terminal which means selected general terminal but its selected terminal see all right that terminal of course that will just run and run and run and run and run and run and run because you the pcs attention is fixed on it hes in zoozoog now these general runs that is someone somebody whom have you failed to not help somebody whom have you desperately not intended to help and prevented everybody from helping you know that kind of question very broad you know all right that has briefer run so your longest run will be found ordinarily on the sop goals selected terminal your next longest type of run is your general run and those are long grinds very ordinarily and it is those i am talking about those two types of run where you find the tone arm unsticking and beginning to move early in the process then moving well and then fading out and getting down and eventually early in processing they will stick well if you can stop it just short of the stick youre good auditor and youll find it very easy to assess and all is well and so forth but even so you wont be in trouble even though you stick it for twenty minutes but lookahere dont you stick it longer than twenty minutes an absolutely fixed frozentight needle for twenty minutes you would have seen it approaching for long time if youd been watching motion would have gotten less and less and less and less and less and it freezes now that is different from the person suddenly swooping from 30 to 50 and then it doesnt move at 50 for fifteen minutes or something like this and all of sudden goes to 20 or the person sticking absolutely at 65 and then suddenly swooping to 10 this kind of an action is not an expected you wouldnt expect that needle now to stick but this sticking needle is going to come about when you were running it all right and it already looked like it was getting flat and your flat rule would have taken it off then and then it suddenly rose up and began to move even less now all of sudden itll either move little bit up usually or little bit down and go clank you can smell the rubber burning now if you continue to run that tone arm while its in that condition day after day man youre not doing scientology because youre in violation of clause 13 you are running process which longer produces change the only change its going to produce of course is just sort of cave everything in but its not beneficial change so the process is not producing change so you get off of it here and now you get off of it all right now what is this other exception i said then that this rule is not followed going on with these things the longduration ptp the guy for the last five years has been having trouble with his leg and he just sits in the auditing session with this hidden standard he runs cows crocs and alligators with great happiness and at each moment after he runs the command or every few commands why he kind of thetawise looks down at his leg you see to see whether or not that has been affected well alligators didnt fit in that leg so it must be something else you see hes running with his attention fixed on something else and he broke his leg five or ten years ago and it has troubled him ever since well you can assess that leg and by the way you can even assess it this way his name let us say is john you can assess johns leg something of that sort its always best to inspect the meter for bit of reaction but oddly enough you dont even have to to do that you just know this is longduration pt problem the best way to do it is to make list of terminals that the pc thinks it is and then take specific one not take general one see you dont want this thing to be profession you dont want it to be profession thats all because hell run on it for quite while if you take it as general thing see you could even say your leg point to it now and then bring him out of the past and itll run itll run on the prehav scale but of course flat process as law doesnt apply then to terminal which is specific terminal being run or problem of long duration by long we mean years we dont mean we dont actually mean longer than one lifetime see thats within this lifetime and if we do that voila we will have that thing taped but we run it on the needle we just keep an eye on the needle clank clank now oddly enough you will get tone arm motion but its kind of waste of time to kind of track the tone arm motion all of sudden the thing kind of frees up the needle kind of frees up or sticks or something like this and you ask about it youll find out the tone arm has stopped too but now lookahere heres the problem if you ran this for twenty minutes look the whole run in the first place was only ten minutes now youre going to test it for twenty minutes when there was tenminute run huh this doesnt this isnt bright see its something like measuring the depth of teacup with kelvin fathometer you see its just not smart so you have to kind of run it on the needle that takes lot of auditor judgment to run one of these things you cant be bad auditor and handle present time problem of long duration thats for sure youll flub it every time and also you cant run pc horribly enough who has present time problem of long duration on any other process than present time problem of long duration there it is thats it youve had it so the moral of that is audit well now there is the exception i spoke to you about which is running the rock slam and thats not really violation of process is flat when it longer produces tone arm motion ill show you this very clearly that if you had set here now you know rock slam rock slam is pretty pretty wild here and rock slam can be kind of this this this wide see thats pretty goodlooking rock slam isnt it all right now there it is slamming back and forth there its going two three inches actually rock slams can be quarter of an inch wide too you know but theyre erratic theyre not theta bop theta bop is as even as metronome and rock slam is very erratic and look look what would happen now look what happens to the tone arm as i make it rock slam you got it see see what the tone arm is doing while i make this thing rock slam hm look at what the tone arm is doing see ive got this meter just sitting here just turned on and on set and if to make it rock slam doing that well now im doing that with my hand but supposing the pc was doing it to it with its bank an auditor i have to tell you joke by the way i just got one through the lines the other day this just just got it through the lines this was very very amusing and i hope when the auditor hears he wont be arc broke but i was quite interested i misunderstood him completely he said the pc can reactively influence the emeter so im having difficult time running the pc and so i told him well id exorcised all the demons out of the thing so he neednt worry about that but listen that wasnt his question that wasnt what his question meant at all he believed that this pc was peculiar in that the pcs reactive bank was operating the emeter now this is an awfully good joke on this auditor because that is what an emeter is for and what it was designed to do and of course the emeter always tells you before the pc knows about it you see even though its just split second the meter knows before the pc does so the common and ordinary action is of course to ask pc question you get fall on the meter you say what was that and the pc said oh was there something there you know thats kind of his feeling whether its just for half second hes still got feeling on it he will once in while kind of feel the jolt in himself and tell you but he has this glmmp you know what was that you know and then he says ohohohwell thats the time i robbed the bank it was nothing much i robbed the bank yeah whew and the meter frees and thats what an emeter is for and this auditor asked actually put the question to that this was peculiar pc and that the peculiarity is that the reactive bank acted on the meter but look thats good thing this auditor when he finally gets the answer to that he has actually made virgin observation of the thing and hell all of sudden come up with an awful cognition on this you got the idea well thats better than just fooling around with it with box because ron said to you know and i think that in past years auditors used to do that they just used to fool around with the box because ron said you had to have one in your lap because i would find the most remarkable settings on meters sometimes and so forth and all kinds of things going on that had nothing to do with the pc or the case it is connected directly to the pcs reactive mind so of course you get this answer now supposing the reactive mind was moving this that way and instead of you seeing it on the needle here supposing the needle were being moved by the pcs reactive mind to hold the needle at set your tone arm would be doing this see my god what what how much meter action do you want how much tone arm action do you want see get the idea look at that and you see thats about what the reaction is causing over here see meter cant even keep up with it how much action do you want well the oddity is that when youre running pc whose goal has rockslammed ill tell you another little peculiarity while im going by it i noticed the other day you know the goal becomes less intense after you find the terminal did you know that do you know why that is because the goal is the significance which surrounds the terminal and the persons attention has been yanked off the goal over onto the terminal where it was fixed anyhow you got it so therefore the goal after you found the terminal usually will read less now than the terminal for very short period of time the goal reads as much as the terminal but after youve assessed an awful lot of terminals that goal starts looking awfully thin and ragged and it still will will flick bit itll still react bit but it was the right goal and it isnt the time for you to start doubting well was that the right goal now you could probably strip goal off by stripping the fellows attention off all the terminals that that goal was represented by see and then the goal would go null and the terminals went null and then you go back and look for the goal and the goal goes null you see the persons attention is fixed on the terminal see there is nothing in goal for his attention to be fixed on that is just air and theta see thats nothing but terminal is something mmm and he got into this goals line and what youre doing is reversing this situation he had problem that had to do with terminal so he then reactively achieved goal to solve this problem and the goals he comes up with are solutions if he could just do this then that series of problems would be solved you see thats what goal is its solution to the problems which have been given him usually by terminals and of course terminal can also be just an idea to him too which is bum thing we hope it isnt he was approached all of sudden by this terminal and it he got problem probably got some overts on the terminal or something and then eventually because he got overts on terminals in this way the terminal itself approaching him could overwhelm him that leaves his attention fixed on the terminal the little tag that is hanging out on the bank is goal you can always reach the goal whereas you very often dont reach the terminal with any other assessment see i have found more reliable tag in the goal its little label and its sort of hanging out here in the light from the dark dark bank you see and its little red tag and it says on the other end of this thing is something that has overwhelmed the living daylights out of if you will pull here package will open neatly first observation that something like this would happen by the way is clear back in 49 every engram by the way leaves its own little tag the whole track may be in complete spinning loop all parts of the track are all parts of the track and there it is in crumpled ball the odd part of it is that theres always this little tag reaching out of the ball that you can pull and the track starts coming apart you got the idea ill give you an example this boy has always been worried about red caps red caps actually upset him and for some reason or other red caps are very desperate and violent thing so wed better not have much to do with them you get the idea red caps all right you go into this case on the subject of red caps and you will find nice great big juicy engram that the pc knew nothing about he was in desperate automobile accident at the age of six and he hasnt clue about it but the driver of the other car was wearing red cap you see theres always piece of the engram showing well now weve gotten smart enough here so that theres piece of the whole track showing and thats called goal and you start knocking these goals out one after the other you actually do start knocking goals out its form of auditing and as you move ahead trying to find goal you eventually will find the biggest tag that has been left out see this little red tag and its the biggest most visible one and nothing will pull that tag and that is attached to the toughest terminal that overwhelmed the pc you got it so now youre going to do your goals assessment well dont be amazed that the little red tag now isnt quite so red see we pulled it weve got fingerprints on it now and it isnt quite representing what it represented before so after youve found goal youve proved the goal out and its there and it wont change and it wont move and that is it and there it is boom now we actually follow the string down and find out what it was attached to the pcs attention of course goes clang onto the terminal where it was fixed anyhow and this little red tag will not read as much on the meter now the goal wont read as much on the meter the terminal will now read more than the goal after youve really shook the terminals out you got the idea its only for little while that this tag will read now when youve got that terminal flat youve got to check for the tag again and when you check for the tag again its liable to come back and read better because youve got his attention freed off of it and it may be attached to something else too so you always inspect the goal again so goals tend to disappear on meter read but they still flick they still click and so forth all right as youre running this case on assessment this case develops on the goal rock slam and as youre assessing you just rock slams become more and more visible more and more visible and many falls are apt to drop into the category of rock slam you start with fall and you wind up with rock slam you got the idea when youve got rock slam assessment on goal youll have rock slam assessment on the terminal or you havent got the right terminal now you rock slam assess on the pc on the prehav scale in other words you assess only for levels that rock slam have you got the idea you re running rock slam case and its all going to rock slam from here on out have you got that everything is going to rock slam so naturally in running the case you run the rock slam out and if you dont have rock slam this is conditional rule needs to be proven out bit more but i think youll find it holds true when your rock slam has been gone theres rock slam of any magnitude for period of twenty minutes that level is flat for that terminal you got it why well your rock slam is now somewhere else on the prehav scale and the more you run an ordinary falling level the more your pc is going to get upset because his attention is affixed over on here you see and he cant keep his attention off of it so hes actually shooting to another part of the prehav scale got it so you run rock slams out and the same rule applies the rule applies uniformly and routinely and that is simply this that if you have assessed on rock slam whether on general level or on terminalgoal level if youre assessing rock slams you must run the rock slam out only and then for twenty minutes there must be rock slam on that terminal and thats by the way by the stopwatch practically thats really twenty minutes then you can consider that level flat and reassess and you reassess and find where the rock slam is now and now you will get new level that is rock slamming and you run that out you got the idea thats running by rock slam but as ive just demonstrated to you rock slam is terrific amount of tone arm motion fantastic amount even though its not visible its the needle thats going not the tone arm but if you were to hold that needle at set if you could you see that was how your tone arm would be going for that level now it can happen that present time problem of long duration can rock slam and that means that the pc is on his rock chain which is his goals chain in this particular case thats why we call it rock slam because thats his rock chain and his goal is sitting on his rock chain and so youre running right on down his rock chain now youre probably going to find more rockslamming pcs than you really suspect exist there are quite few of them around they are not rare phenomenon but thats how you do rock slam if you do general assessment and one of the levels rock slams youve had it because you now have to assess for rock slam you wont find anything but rock slams on this case you may find fall fall fall and then all of sudden rock slams during the assessment well rock slam persists and the difficulty in assessing rock slam is that the rock slam persists for several levels after youve turned it on so there is rule about this every time when youre running prehav assessment or youre running goals assessment or something and you turn on rock slam dont go to the next five levels without getting rid of the rock slam now how do you get rid of rock slam you can run essentially tr 10 that gets rid of rock slam you just say floor floor floor floor floor floor floor and theres rock slam you got the idea now you say the next level but boy do you note that that one you just had rock slammed because thats now what youre going to be looking for you start turning rock slams on on case thats what youll follow down to okay all right good enough i hope youre doing all right with your training and i hope your auditing is coming along fine you all look better all right if you get lot brighter tomorrow why youll have some questions okay thank you audience thank you end of lecture
