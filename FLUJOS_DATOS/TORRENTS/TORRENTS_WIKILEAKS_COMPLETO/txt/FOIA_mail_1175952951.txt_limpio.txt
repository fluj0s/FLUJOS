from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to stefan rahmstorf rahmstorfozeanklimade subject re urgent help re augusto mangini date sat 7 apr 2007 093551 0600 cc valerie massondelmotte valeriemassonceafr eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed hi stefan valerie was the lead on the holocene section so ill cc her i agree that your approach is the smart one its easy to show proxy records eg speleothems from few sites that suggest greater warmth than present at times in the past but our assessment was that there wasnt period of global warmth comparable to present we used the term likely however since there still is good deal of work to do on this topic we need better global network of sites keith can comment on the last 1300 years but again i think there is published evidence to refute what we assessed in the chapter again one or two records does not hemispheric or global make i think keith or valerie could comment further if theyre not eastering eystein likewise might have something but i think it is his national responsibility to hit the glaciers over easter best peck dear peck and ipcc coauthors i know its easter but im having to deal with augusto mangini german colleague who has just written an article calling the ipcc paleo chapter wrong claiming it has been warmer in the holocene than now and stalagmites show much larger temperature variations than tree rings but ipcc ignores them what should i answer one of my points is that ipcc shows all published largescale proxy reconstructions but there simply is none using stalagmites so please tell if this is true my main point will be the local vs hemispheric issue saying that mangini only provides local examples while the ipcc statement is about hemispheric or global averages but how about local variations do stalagmites show much larger ones than tree rings any suggestions what other counterarguments i could write do we have stalagmite expert on the author team other than contributing author dominik fleitmann whom ive already identified i have to submit my response to the newspaper tomorrow thanks stefan stefan rahmstorf wwwozeanklimade wwwrealclimateorg stefan rahmstorf wwwozeanklimade wwwrealclimateorg jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu xflowed
