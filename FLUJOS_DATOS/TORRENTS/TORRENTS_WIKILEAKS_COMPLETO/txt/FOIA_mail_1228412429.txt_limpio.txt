from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to wigleyucaredu subject re schles suggestion date thu dec 4 124029 2008 tom obviously dont pass on these proofs have gone back with about 60 changes to be made should be out first issue of 2009 the bet is that ca will say they found that the ipcc figure from 1990 was lamb diagram 6 months ago they did but they didnt get the right source and our paper was submitted in early 2008 ca will also comment on the section on pp2131 the summary of where we are with the individual proxies is useful for most of them but we didnt get anyone working with speleothems involved i remain unconvinced they get the resolution claimed yet to see speleothem paper which doesnt compare their individual site reconstruction with either the mbh series or solar proxy i hope ben gets the support from pcmdi and llnl cheers phil cheers phil at 2233 03122008 you wrote phil thanks for all the information on the giss etc data re below can you send preprint of the holocene paper tom ben when the foi requests began here the foi person said we had to abide by the requests it took couple of half hour sessions one at screen to convince them otherwise showing them what ca was all about once they became aware of the types of people we were dealing with everyone at uea in the registry and in the environmental sciences school the head of school and few others became very supportive ive got to know the foi person quite well and the chief librarian who deals with appeals the vc is also aware of what is going on at least for one of the requests but probably doesnt know the number were dealing with we are in double figures one issue is that these requests arent that widely known within the school so i dont know who else at uea may be getting them cru is moving up the ladder of requests at uea though were way behind computing though were away of requests going to others in the uk mohc reading defra and imperial college so spelling out all the detail to the llnl management should be the first thing you do i hope that dave is being supportive at pcmdi the inadvertent email i sent last month has led to data protection act request sent by certain canadian saying that the email maligned his scientific credibility with his peers if he pays 10 pounds which he hasnt yet i am supposed to go through my emails and he can get anything ive written about him about 2 months ago i deleted loads of emails so have very little if anything at all this legislation is different from the foi it is supposed to be used to find put why you might have poor credit rating in response to foi and eir requests weve put up some data mainly paleo data each request generally leads to more to explain what weve put up every time so far that hasnt led to anything being added instead just statements saying read what is in the papers and what is on the web site tim osborn sent one such response via the foi person earlier this week weve never sent programs any codes and manuals in the uk the research assessment exercise results will be out in 2 weeks time these are expensive to produce and take too much time so from next year well be moving onto metric based system the metrics will be and amounts of grants papers and citations etc i did flippantly suggest that the of foi requests you get should be another when you look at ca they only look papers from handful of people they will start on another coming out in the holocene early next year gavin and mike are on this with loads of others ive told both exactly what will appear on ca once they get access to it cheers phil at 0117 03122008 ben santer wrote dear tom i think that the idea of commentary in science or nature is good one steve sherwood made similar suggestion id be perfectly happy not to be involved in such commentary my involvement would look too selfserving one of the problems is that im caught in real catch22 situation at present im damned and publicly vilified because i refused to provide mcintyre with the data he requested but had i acceded to mcintyres initial request for climate model data im convinced based on the past experiences of mike mann phil and gavin that i would have spent years of my scientific career dealing with demands for further explanations additional data fortran code etc phil has been complying with foia requests from mcintyre and his cronies for over two years and if i ever denied single request for further information mcintyre would have rubbed his hands gleefully and written you see hes guilty as charged on his website you and i have spent over decade of our scientific careers on the msu issue tom during much of that time weve had to do science in reactive mode responding to the latest outrageous claims and inept science by john christy david douglass or s fred singer for the remainder of my scientific career id like to dictate my own research agenda i dont want that agenda driven by the constant need to respond to christy douglass and singer and i certainly dont want to spend years of my life interacting with the likes of steven mcintyre i hope llnl management will provide with their full support if they do not im fully prepared to seek employment elsewhere with best regards ben tom wigley wrote ben re the idea michael sent around to revkin et this is something that nature or science might like as commentary it might even be possible to include some indirect reference to the mc audit issue the notes i sent could be starting point one problem is that you could not be first author as this would look like garnering publicity for your own work as the 2 key papers are both santer et even having as the first author may not work an ideal person would be tom karl who sent response saying nice summary what do you think tom benjamin d
