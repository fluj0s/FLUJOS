joint staff services u nified commands us elements of combined commands defense agencie s and joint activities 4 policy assured access to the electromagnetic spectrum is vital t dod operations worldwide this publication identifies basic c onsiderations for operating spectrumdependent systems in joint military an d civil environment joint spectrum environment military operations rely heavily on equipment using the limited resources of the electromag netic spectrum in joint military operations requirements may exceed the am ount of spectrum available as result efficient use and control of the sp ectrum is critical to national security in terms of io combat operations and c2w effective spectrum management the organized control and use of the electromagnetic spectrum is fundamentally essential to sound defensive io nd c2 protection which ensures operations can be conducted with minimal intentional cjcsi 332001a 30 september 2002 2 interference and without negative e3 the rapid growth of sophisticated weapons systems as well as intelligence operations and commu nications systems greatly increases demand for frequencies lack of p roper preplanned frequency coordination will have an adverse effect upon friendly but competing users spectrum availability is further constrained by natio nal legislation designed to carefully protect the rights of sovereign g overnments by requiring approval prior to transmission in any portion of the spectr um that lies within particular countrys national borders joint and combined force operations must also consider the needs of coalition forces in future contingencies therefore an effective spectrum management structure is required not only to satisfy spectrum needs of military users but also to coordin ate with host nations to facilitate effective use of this finite resourc further spectrum issues are discussed within the enclosure b references b electromagnetic spectrum planning coordination and co ntrol to use the spectrum successfully all users must work together by exchanging vital spectrum information from the beginning of the joint planning process through execution of any operation via spectrum xxi architecture primarily personnel assigned to operations directorate of joint staff j3 i ntelligence directorate of joint staff j2 and communications directorate of joint staff j6 functional areas plan coordinate and control joint milit ary use of the electromagnetic spectrum to minimize unacceptable emi among all emitters and receivers and to address e3 issues in joint operations the three functional areas must work together additionally automat ed spectrum management systems at the joint and component levels requir vertical and horizontal interoperability c concept of control the supported jfc or cjtf holds the authority for assigning frequencies to users usually through the joint f requency management office or joint spectrum management element t he jfmo or jsme may on occasion delegate frequency assignment authority to subordinate commands decentralizing the management of the electromag netic battlespace authority to assign use of specific spectrum resource ut ilization of allotment plans developed by the jfmo or jsme should be delegated t the lowest level of command possible consistent with the principles of sou nd spectrum management spectrum use

as new requirements are identified situations of conflicting or competing use of the spectrum will occur conflicts within primary functional area are resolved at th lowest possible level by cjtf jfc

resolution is impossible at this level the matter is elevated to jfc or designee who is usually the jfmo or jsme joint spectrum assignment planning planning for use of the spectrum resource and assigning of spectrum management responsibilitie s must be fully integrated into the jopes process the complexity of eff ective joint spectrum use and management requires advance planning for scenarios of expected military operations each joint and subordinate component command must establish planning procedures to address all spectrumdepende nt systems used in support of an oplan and any other requirements of f riendly forces that impact the use of the electromagnetic spectrum spectru m managers must be fully integrated into the planning process at the initial and subsequent planning stages additionally planning must be done in consistent manner with each joint command without advance spectrumuse pl anning emi among users andor shortage of assigned frequencies may become severe
