territories the current state of the middle east has been frequently described in terms of growing sunnishiite rivalry in which sunni arab and western governme nts aim to contain irans panshiite foreign policy when pplied to lebanon this narrative is becoming an increasing reality many us policy ma kers fear that without significant outside support the march 14 movement an anti syrian coalition of some sunni druze and christian lebanese that came togeth er after the februa ry 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri will not be able to withstand syrian and iranian meddling through their shiite proxy hez bollah since 2005 the administration has pursued policy of strengthening the prowestern elements of the lebanese government critics charge that the united states may be fueling civil strife in lebanon by taking sides in lebanons comple x political mosaic others assert that us policy exaggerates iranian influence over hezbollah claiming that hezbollah has evolved over time into more i ndependent political actor in lebanon in order to support the lebanese govern ment the united states has pledged to devote more financial resources to reconstruction and military assistance the summer 2006 war between hezbollah and israel heightened the need for additional economic aid as the lebanese government and its internationa l and arab partners vied with iran and hezbollah to win the hearts and minds of many lebanese citizens who lost homes and businesses as result of the conflict iran channeled millions of dollars in cash assistance thr ough hezbollah to southern lebanon while the international community raised seve ral billion dollars at an emergency donor conference in stockholm sweden neverthe less lebanon remains in need of aid from
