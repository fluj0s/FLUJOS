trade and the wto agreement m angeles villarreal analyst in industrial organization and business resources science and industry division summary world telecommunications services trade is growing and evolving very rapidly appearing to corroborate expectations that the 1997 international agreement to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services would greatly increase world trade in those services while the agreement under the auspices of the world trade organization wto faces many obstacles to full effectiveness it is expected to benefit the highly competitive us telecommunications industries and facilitate world economic growth congress as always is concerned that trading partners adhere to their commitments essentially bills in the 107th congress were directly related to this issue however this report will be updated as events warrant context the wto agreement on basic telecommunications services which concluded nearly three years of negotiations occurred in context of developments on several fronts statutory institutional technological economic and structural it appears to have spurred and to have been spurred by such developments statutory and institutional the agreement was one event in sequence of developments in international trade and us law the north american free trade agreement which included some liberalization of trade in enhanced telecommunications among canada mexico and the united states went into effect january 1 1994 the uruguay round final act entered into force january 1 1995 after nearly decade of multilateral negotiations to expand world trade under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt it established the world trade organization which replaced gatt1 the us telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 which aims to promote greater competition in us telecommunications by removing 1 see crs report 98928 the world trade organization background and issues by lenore sek congressional research service the library of congress crs2 regulatory barriers was enacted february 8 19962 in another regional arena european union telecommunications markets opened to competition on january 1 1998 in november 1997 the us federal communications commission liberalized its policy of restricting entry of foreign firms in us nonbroadcasting telecommunications with an open entry standard for firms from wto member countries3 the wto basic telecommunications agreement built upon the annex on telecommunications part of the general agreement on trade in services gats itself component of the uruguay round final act the annex requires wto members to ensure that all service suppliers seeking to take advantage of scheduled commitments have reasonable and nondiscriminatory access to and the use of public basic telecommunications networks and services basic telecommunications was one of several issue areas upon which only partial agreement was reached in time for the final act further negotiations were to be completed by april 30 1996 while some progress was made it was deemed insufficient by some country participants but promising enough to justify extending the negotiations the agreement was reached february 15 1997 and went into effect february 5 1998 sixtynine countries originally endorsed the agreement since then the number of member governments with scheduled telecommunications commitments has risen to 86 member governments started new round of wto negotiations in 2000 but the proposals from these negotiations were tabled members began new negotiations in 2002 the statutory and institutional arena also has seen widespread trend for countries to liberalize andor at least partly privatize their telecommunications markets number of countries have completed or begun process of converting statecontrolled organizations to privately owned marketoriented firms through private investment liberalization has included allowing more than one supplier of particular type or category of product or service andor within particular geographic areas technological economic and structural developments the above described factors have interacted with or have been at least partly driven by technological economic and structural changes in telecommunications and in related industries for example digital technologies make it possible to distribute voice data and video on the same communications channel and thus to transmit more information per cable and portion of spectrum wireless transmission improvements and higher productivity in installing undersea fiberoptic cable have lowered the cost per circuit such developments enable telecommunications providers such as telephone and cable television companies to expand their capabilities to become generic multifaceted information providers and compete in many markets once considered to be monopolistic international call back and refile services enable telephone callers from highcost countries to effectively originate calls from lowercost countries and be billed at the lower rates this has tended to hold down international rates the technological advances moreover are very rapid 2 see crs report 96223 the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 brief overview by angele gilroy 3 us federal communications commission news commission liberalizes foreign participation in the us telecommunications market november 25 1997 crs3 structurally telecommunications has become globalized and increasingly linked across international borders many telecommunications firms are joining forces through mergers acquisitions equity sharing marketing arrangements and other combinations to position themselves better for future market growth by offering range of services and increasingly functionally integrated international service this globalized merger and acquisition trend has involved number of telecommunications firms of different countries and continues to do so at rapid pace both major cause and major consequence of the above developments has been rapid growth in world telecommunications services including international trade in such services data compiled by the international telecommunication union itu show that world revenue from telecommunication services of all types more than doubled between 1990 and 2000 and expected to increase 21 between 2000 and 2002 see table 1 revenue in 2000 from mobile service was over 23 times its 1990 level 2000 revenue from other services including leased circuits data communications telex and telegraph was almost six times its 1990 level and international telephone traffic minutes more than tripled between 1990 and 2000 high service growth is expected to continue in 2002 table 1 world telecommunications services indicator 1990

telecommunications union key global telecom indicators the agreement the agreement covers basic telecommunications services only participants agreed at the start of the talks to disregard differences in how countries might define basic telecommunications and to negotiate on all public and private telecommunications services that involve the simple transmission of customersupplied information voice or data from sender to receiver whereas the annex on telecommunications addresses access to existing services and networks by users the basic telecommunications agreement addresses the ability to enter telecommunications markets and sell services the specific types of services covered in the negotiations include voice telephone data transmission telex telegraph facsimile private leased circuit services fixed and mobile satellite systems cellular telephone mobile data services paging and personal crs4 communication services broadcasting is not included socalled value added services in which suppliers enhance the form content or retrievability of customers information were not formally covered by the negotiations however few participants chose to include these services in their offers enhanced services include online data processing data base storage and retrieval and electronic data interchange4 three basic elements the agreement which will be enforceable internationally through the wtos procedures for dispute resolution andor through individual country actions as specified by the agreement has three basic elements first the agreement provides for companies of signatory country access to the telecommunications markets local long distance and international of other signatory countries companies may have market access through any means of network technology by installing and using their own facilities through purchase andor resale of existing network capacity and through interconnections because countries agreed to cover basic telecommunication services provided over network infrastructure and through resale over private leased circuits market access commitments will cover services provided through the establishment of foreign firms or commercial presence this includes the ability to own and operate independent telecommunications network infrastructure second the agreement provides that companies of one country can acquire andor hold significant ownership or control of telecommunications services andor facilities in other participating countries this is partly implied in market access commitments that permit the establishment of foreign firms and the ownership and operation of telecommunications network infrastructure third participants agreed to establish framework of fair competition comprised of set of regulatory principles in reference paper based upon the us telecommunications act of 1996 the regulatory principles define and prohibit anti competitive practices such as discrimination and nontransparency especially with respect to interconnections licensing criteria and universal service each country is required to have an independent and impartial regulatory body overarching aspects in general the results of the basic telecom agreement are extended to all wto members on nondiscriminatory basis through the mostfavored nation mfn principle5 however at the end of the negotiations many participants exercised their right to file mfn exemptions for certain telecom services6 general descriptions of the elements of the basic telecommunications agreement mask the wide differences in the present openness of individual country telecom markets in the degrees to which individual countries have agreed to the numerous aspects of the 4 there are numerous exceptions in which countries have specified later dates for or the phasing in of implementation of commitments applying to one or more services or concepts 5 under mfn any concessions privileges or immunities granted to one country the most favored are extended to all countries that are accorded mfn treatment for more discussion of mfn and us mfn policy see crs issue brief ib93107 normal trade relations most favorednation policy of the united states by vladimir n pregelj 6 the united states filed an mfn exception for oneway satellite transmission of direct to home satellite direct broadcast satellite and digital audio transmission services crs5 agreement and in the scopes of such commitments some countries albeit minority made commitments whatsoever with respect to some individual aspects of the agreement details of individual country commitments can be found at the internet web sites of the wto and of the office of the us trade representative httpwwwwtoorg and httpwwwustrgov respectively implementation translation of the agreement into actual increased openness of telecom markets and lower rates for services faces variety of hurdles one is the difficult institutional and legal transition to competitive environment by many countries that now have single supplier of telecom services and independent regulatory body called for in the wto agreements regulatory principles two other hurdles are the large amounts of capital relative to domestic resources that some countries will require to put modern telecommunications infrastructures in place and b the corresponding technical assistance and support that some countries will require it may well be number of years before the agreements terms are fully implemented and the goals realized congressional oversight as rule trade agreements have not needed congressional action unless congress mandated they be approved in legislation or they required changes in us law legislation approving or implementing the agreement is necessary in those cases congress acknowledged that the united states would participate in extended telecommunications negotiations in the uruguay round implementing legislation where it set forth the us negotiating objective for these talks congress did not expressly require that any resulting agreement be legislatively approved however and most observers believe that the basic telecommunications services agreement does not require implementing legislation the agreement has entered into force essentially without objection as an executive agreement some members of congress initially were apprehensive about foreign investment in us telecommunications particularly regarding broadcasting the agreement does not cover broadcasting however and congressional concern seems to have eased in this respect and others impact the wto basic telecommunications services agreement is expected to increase world trade in telecommunications services and facilitate economic growth in general freer trade should result in improved products and services lower prices additional investment and better allocation of productive resources in the world economy inasmuch as the countries committing to full competition by 2005 accounted for 89 of world telecommunication service revenues in 1995 itu data liberalization is to be applied to very broad base of activity data suggest that the potential benefits of telecommunications trade liberalization may be greater in relative terms for emerging economies than for developed ones7 however the us telecommunications industry and us economy with one of the most 7 the itu reports that the gap between emerging nations and developed nations in total telephone penetration dropped by more than half between 1991 and 2001 however while the growth rate in least developed countries ldcs telephone networks has been accelerating the gap in telephone penetration between developed countries and ldcs increased between 1991 and 2001 crs6 advanced telecommunications infrastructures should benefit greatly in absolute terms this country accounted for 28 of world telecommunications services revenues in 1995 the highly competitive us telecommunications services industry should be able to greatly increase its presence in other countries telecommunications markets similarly the competitive us telecommunications equipment manufacturers should be able to boost sales considerably with the expected growth in world telecommunications services increased competition resulting from telecom trade liberalization is driving down settlement rates charged by foreign telephone carriers to complete international calls lowering the prices of such calls to consumers and businesses foreign settlement rates have tended to be much higher than us rates and many more calls originate in the united states than abroad accounting for much of the us trade deficit in telecom services during the 1990s table 2 probably indicative of the abovenoted effects of greater competition revenue from international telephone service increased 13 between 1995 and 2002 while total international telephone traffic minutes rose 114 table 1 table 2 shows that the us trade deficit in telecom services decreased steadily between 1996 and 2000 and that in 2001 the united states had surplus of 498 million services trade has been one of the fastest growing components in total world trade in recent years and the us telecommunications services industry appears to have benefitted from this trend two possible reasons for the increase in services trade are recent technological progress in telecommunications and information technology and worldwide trends in trade liberalization and regulatory reform8 table 2 us trade in services millions of dollars telecommunications
