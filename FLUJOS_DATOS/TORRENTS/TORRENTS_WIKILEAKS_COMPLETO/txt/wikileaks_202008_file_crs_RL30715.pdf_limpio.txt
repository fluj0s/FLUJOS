most part now concluded surrounding clinton administration revisi on of the federal ac quisition regulation to clarify the meaning and application of statutory require ment that federal contracting officers must determine that prospective contractor has satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics the new rule issued in the clinton administrations final days instructed contracting officers to consider compliance with wide range of tax employment environmental antitrust and consumer protection laws in deciding whether cont ractor is responsible and thus eligible for contract award during drafting and comment period sting more than 2 years the proposed rule came under unprecedentedly heavy cr iticism from business and contracting groups academic institutions and two fe deral agencies they said the proposed regulation was unnecessary and could lead to blacklist of contractors who run afoul of myriad federal laws in the normal course of business the clinton administration supported by environmental union civil rights and consumer watchdog groups defended the proposal as needed to clarify the application of existing law and weed out contractors who may discredit the government one of the reasons the rule was so controversial was th at it offered to proponents or threatened to opponents an opportunity to affect the behavior of contractors outside the realm of competition for government contracts labor environmental and corpor ate watchdog groups believed it would provide positive incentive to improve business ethics and promote voluntary compliance with broad range of tax environmental labor civil rights and cons umer laws business groups however warned that it would upset delicate balance in regulatory and litigation arenas by adding the threat of federal contract losses to current penalties arising from common disputes with government em ployees and watchdog organizations on december 20 2000 the contractor re sponsibility

lengthy ru lemaking process and its issuance as final rule though expecte d did not quell objections the amendment took effect on january 19 2001 within da ys the bush administration took action to

do business with the federal government he announced youd better maintain safe workplace and respect civil human and union rights5 this position was arguably consistent with the existing statutory requirement that responsible contractor was one that exhibited satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics for years however this requirement had been regarded as tool to protect the government against unscrupul ous contractors who c ould not be trusted to follow through on contractual terms6 reputable wellestablished companies did not need to be worried about being f ound irresponsible indeed some of the contractors found by the gao studies to be violators of nlra or osha laws were among the largest and bestknown companies in the country7 only few determinations of nonresponsibility had ever been made in connection with individual contract awards8 according to the far council the reason for this was simple the far had never provided co s with framework to guide

remedy the lack of guidance in july 1999 the far council first published in the federal register proposed amendment to section 9 of the far intended to clarify what constitutes satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics for federal contractor10 it sought to ensure that the government would do business only with companies maintaining good record of compliance with laws that extended well beyond those relating to contract pe rformance specifically it emphasized that cos could regard prospective contracto rs lack of compliance with tax laws or substantial noncompliance with labor laws employment laws environmental laws antitrust laws or consumer protection laws as indicating an unsatisfactory record of integrity and business ethics11 because the far amendment was termed clarification of existing requirements the proposed rule was not to be subject to procedural hurdles that would be required of significant regulato ry action or major rule such as review by the office of management and budget omb under executive order 12866 or 60day review period by cong ress under the congre ssional review act in fact however the proposal generate d substantial controversy and the far council received more than 1500 letters during 4month comment period it would later term the proposal the most controversial ever published by the far council12 while organizations like the aflcio the leadership conference on civil rights the national environmental trust and omb watch supported the rule the vast majority of co mments were received from bus iness and contracting groups and were critical they said the proposed rule was unduly vague and subjective and could lead to abuse or inconsistent application of the law by permitting consideration of unsubstantiated allegations by contracting officers who were unfamiliar with the laws in such areas as antitrust and envi ronmental and consumer protection criticshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30715crs4 13 us congress house committee on

that regulatory flexibility analysis was required proposed rule withdrawn and revised considering these objections the fa r council withdrew its initial proposal and on june 30 2000 issued revision that substantially changed the proposed rules provisions14 the june 2000 revised rule retained the original purpose of clarifying that satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics included satisfactory compliance with federal laws including tax labor and employment environmental antitrust and consumer protection laws however it sharpened the guidance on what contracting officers c ould consider in making responsibility determination the revise d proposed rule said that cos while they may consider all relevant credible informati on should give greatest weight to decisions within the past 3 years involving convictions or civil judgments against the prospective contractor in cases brought by the governme nt but it also instructed cos to consider administrative law judge decisions or complaints issued by any federal agency board or commission indicating the contract or has been found to have violated federal tax labor and employment antitrust or consumer protection law another significant change was the addition of certification requirement closely related to the above standards each prospective contractor would be required to certify that it had not been convi cted of or indicted for violating found to have violated or had an adverse judgments in any civil cases arising from any federal tax labor and employment environmental antitrust or consumer protection laws in which the united states brought the action if the bidder answered that it had then it is asked to explain the nature of the violation and whether any fines penalties or damages were assessed in pa rtial response to the assertion that some cos are illprepared to draw compliance conc lusions in broad range of legal areas the revised proposal specifi ed that they should coordinate their nonresponsibility decisions with legal counsel the revised proposal also contained an in itial regulatory flexibility analysis it revealed that 171000 small entities would be ffected by the rule but concluded that the impact on them would not be significant since the role of the small business administration in granting certificates of competency would not be changed revisions that the far

generally supported the need for strong statement on business ethics and in tegrity and had rais ed few objections to particular provisions the aflcio di d comment extensively on the revision while it

council could have issued final rule as early as august 29 2000 it did not do so until december 20 200020 the effective date of the final rule was january 19 2001 the final full da of the clinton administration the final rule made two substantial ch anges from the provisions of the second proposal the first was to add detail nd specificity to the guidance on how cos should weigh the evidence in making res ponsibility determinations the final rule strengthened the standard that cos must consider all relevant credible information and provided hierarchy of violations for consideration by the cos at the top of the hierarchy were federal and state offe nses convictions civil judgments and administrative rulings in matters that are relevant to involvement in public contracting such as contract fraud bid ri gging embezzlement and bribery second were indictments for these ffenses relegated to thir d category were violations or civil judgments related to tax labor and employment environmental antitrust and consumer protection laws the rule ne wly specified that normally single violation of law will not give rise to determination of nonresponsibility but evidence of repeated pervasive or significant violations of the law may indicate an unsatisfactory record of integrity and business ethics the guidance also placed greatest emphasis on violations within the past 3 years and said that corrective action taken by contractors shoul d be taken into account the second major change was in response to assertions that the requirement for bidders to list all such findings j udgments and indictments would be an unconscionable paperwork burden the fina l rules requirement was that only checkthebox certification would be need ed from prospective contractors at the preaward stage only when tentative selection had been made would the co ask the apparently successful bidder for specific details of any violations or judgments if that box had been checked points of contention with the rule while debate on the far revision wa s farranging five major points of contention generated the most controversy brief discu ssion of these controversial issues follows it is drawn from comments to the far secretariat the secretariats response in the preamble to the final rule position statements ci rculated to members of congress21 and letters to president bush from members of congress and interest groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30715crs7 22 memorandum for the far secretariat from matera director gsa acquisition policy division aug 29 2000 p 2contracting officer discretion opponents of the rule consistently said that it would place cos in the unaccustomed position of judging whether prospective contractors are sufficiently compliant with an extremely broad range of laws most of them involving considerations that ve never been part of the procurement decision or context they regarded the first version of the rule as amounting to unlimited discretion for subordina government officials to blacklist companies from receiving government contracts gsa argued that more specific guidance would not resolve the problem that government cos will not have feel for how serious many of the offenses are that would be brought to their attention22 counter argument was that the discre tion already exists in the law requiring responsibility determination and that the far revision provided muchneeded guidance in how to make it the added re quirement to consult with legal counsel and the limitation of respons ibility determination to single contract decision proponents of the revision said disputed the blacklist contention also procedural safeguards were put in place so that prospective contractors labeled nonresponsible would be told of that determination and be able to contest it before gao or the courts consideration of all relevant credible information the basic standard that cos must consider all relevant credible information was criticized as vague and as raising the prospect that allegations of poor corporate ethics from competitors unions and thirdparty advocacy groups w ould become routine part of the procurement process defende rs of the final rule pointed out that nothing prevented third parties from intervening before and that the rule had become progressively more precise in describing what informati on was to be regarded as most relevant nevertheless critics noted that complaints and administrative law judge findings were still included as basi s for determination of res ponsibility thus signaling that contracts could be denied to companie s based on unproved alle gations and pending decisions that are still under appeal they also voiced objections to the inclusion in the final rule of the observation that pros pective contractors record of compliance with foreign laws and regulations to the extent that the co becomes aware of them can constitute relevant and credible information which the co must consider certification requirements by reducing the certification requirement from listing of all violations by all bidders to simple checkthebox requirement the estimated paperwork burden associated with the rule was reduced but not by much removal of the requirement to list all violations d to reduction of 190000 hours of estimated burden but this was nearly offset by the secretariats recognition that most large and some small businesses would need to set up system to track compliance with disparate legal mandates large and diverse corporations and even some universities argued that there are likely to be many such situations in their far flung and often decentralized operations and that they could not be expected to keep track of them all without an information system for that purpose in the end the overall burden estimate was reduced from 607000 hours to 597000 hours total that some of the rules opponents believed was understated gsa believed that

act the aflcio on the other hand commented that the burden would be minimal because small firms w ould generally have little to report and firms of all sizes would need to collect similar informa tion in connection with liability insurance required disclosures on financial statements and securities and exchange commission filings and to compete for some state contracts23 effect on dispute resolution and prevention one of the reasons the rule was so controversial was that it ffered to proponents or threatened to opponents an opportunity to affect the beha vior of contractors beyond the realm of competition for government contracts the rules proponents believed it would provide positive incentive to improve business ethics and promote voluntary compliance with host of tax environmenta l labor civil rights and consumer laws the us chamber of commerce circulated count of more than 300 statutes that might be involved in the contractor re sponsibility determina tion business groups warned that the rule would upset careful balance in regulatory and litigation arenas by adding the threat of federal contract losses to current penalties arising from disputes with the government employees and watchdog groups that are already too frequent and contentious relationship to debarment proceedings one of the objections to the proposed rule was that the procedure it ou tlined duplicated remedy that already exists for contractor misbehavior gsa already maintains list of some 24000 firms and individuals that are barred for varying periods from competition for federal contracts epas comments on the rule maintained that existing debarment regulations presently provide sufficient authority and far more efficient remedy for making decision regarding business honesty and inte grity considering the same information for example epa routinely takes suspensi on and debarment actions for wide range of environmental conduct that address contr actors business integrity or competency24 proponents of the rule argued that the debarment list shows the need for better contractor res ponsibility decisions before contracts are awarded to bidders who later prove themselves to be irresponsible the aflcio said the rule was properly viewed as debarment prevention httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30715crs9 25 business roundtable et v united states ddc 100cv3088 26 these letters can

rescind final rule that has entered the code of federal regulations through formal rulemaking process27 the normal expectation is that changes to such rule need to go through the same process with
