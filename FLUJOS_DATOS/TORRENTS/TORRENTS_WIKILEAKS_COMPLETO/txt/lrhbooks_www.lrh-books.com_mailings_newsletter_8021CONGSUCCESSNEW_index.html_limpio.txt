untitled document apr 16 2008 stuck flows become unstuck on all sorts of things across the boards i own the congress lectures and listen to them just about every day average of 8 hours week and yes it is true that stuck flows become unstuck on all sorts of things from going up the bridge to the more mundane areas of life all across the boards lots of great cognitions ah moments and laughs ts im happy to say that the postulate has more than come true when i purchased the congresses i made postulate that by listening to these lectures on regular basis i would become more stable and pull in something positive in the way of writing career i was trying to create for myself i looked at the lectures as an investment in myself the most important investment one can make so i bought the lectures with that postulate in mind and im happy to say that the postulate has more than come true not long after i started listening to the lectures i got rather unexpected writing opportunity and since listening to the lectures on regular basis among all of the other things ive experienced i have suddenly found myself with viable writing career i dont think this is just random coincidence to its direct result of being more at cause more stable and more able to handle the responsibilities that this career requires of im not saying the lectures will magically put you in position where money is just dropping out of the sky and falling on you but they are little bit magical in the sense that they put you in position to actually be able to have money to do the things required to really have it in the amount you desire so if youre concerned about the price of owning the lectures forget it the amount of valuable data you will gain and the lines and flows that will open up for you as result of applying the data to your life will far outweigh any concerns you have right now about getting them lc i feel as though i am not alone it is like lrh is right here with i completed the last lecture of the anatomy of the spirit of man congress last night this is only the first congress and i have 17 to go and already i feel as though i am not alone up here because it is like lrh is right here with i am amazed by the way he talks the clarity the certainty the depth of his knowledge is absolutely incredible i have been able to accomplish projects and focus my attention in ways that i have perhaps only dreamt of before for many many yearsperhaps most of my lifei have had very difficult time focusing in order to accomplish projects and when i would complete projects everything would take such long time from initial idea until finished product now my mind is clearing up auditing just quiet cabin with lrh right here with yes life is starting to look much much brighter i wonder how it will look after i complete congress number 2 3 4 etc thanks million for helping get the congress lectures rb removelink 2006 bridge publications inc all rights reserved click here for copyright and trademark information grateful acknowledgement is made to l ron hubbard library to reproduce selection from the copyright works of l ron hubbard oec the bridge clearsound scientology lrh hubbard ot and dianetics are trademarks and service marks owned by religious technology center and are used with its permission services relating to scientology religious philosophy are delivered throughout the world exclusively by licensees of the church of scientology international with the permission of religious technology center holder of the scientology and dianetics trademarks scientologist is collective membership mark designating members of the affiliated churches and missions of scientology bridge publications inc is registered trademark and service mark in california and is owned by bridge publications inc mailed from bridge publications 4751 fountain ave angeles ca 90029
