from war situat ion and many systems and procedures were only in the process of being developed taking thes factors into account oios assessed the unhcr operation in liberia as average nonetheless if prompt action is not taken by management to significantly improve the application of key controls it could considerably impair the future effectiveness of the operation programme management project development and implementation had been ser iously hindered by the security situation this had not allowed unhcr until fairly recently to visit field locations to assess the needs of the potential returnees or to start with any re momentum project implementation needs assessment was conducted in december 2003 w ith other humanitarian actors nonetheless the assessment was limited as incoun try movements were restricted uptodate relevant and accurate statistical information on th expected returnee numbers was not readily available or the socialeconomic situation of the c ommunities oios

taken that fun ds provided to lush were properly accounted for and disbursed in ccordance with the subagreements however its internal controls needed to be strength ened gtz had technical problems with the accounting system and could not provide data to support the fi gures reported to unhcr serious problems were found in mecris financial ma nagement the accounting system was less than satisfactory number of errors were ide ntified and expenditure of over us 30000 could not be supported supply management the logistics systems and procedures needed to be c onsiderably strengthened to be able to effectively provide the logistical support necessar for large operation procurement pipeline should be established and an inventory management s ystem put in place the gtz workshop which had been looted during the war was just ree stablishing itself but an overview of the systems and procedures already in place was positiv extensive work was required to deal administrativel with the assets that had been looted with an estimated value of over us 2 million considera ble efforts have already been made to quantify the loss and verify assets nonetheless oios recommended that comprehensive strategy be developed on how to resolve the backlog in data verification and registration security and safety security is very high profile issue in liberia nd all the staff interviewed by oios was aware of their responsibilities further work was require d to ensure all unhcr offices and staff residences are moss compliant administration some us 13 million has been lost hopefully tem porarily due to the closure of the bank where unhcr funds were deposited in hindsight it may not have been prudent due to the unstable and deteriorating environment to keep on deposit large balance the representation needs to continually pursue this matter to ensure at least some of the funds are recovered duty was paid on fuel but it had not been systemat ically reimbursed oios estimated that unhcr paid duty of us 124000 from january 2003 to march 2004 moreover oios was informed that unmil was able to negotiate fuel pric at about us 1 per gallon less than unhcr if this is the case oios estimated that at the present level of activities unhcr could save some us 230000 per year if the same price wa s negotiated the fast track system for the deployment of staff t liberia was not effective all deployments should have been completed by march 2004 but still in july some of the key persons were only arriving others were not yet on the ground oios i s in accord with the observation of the unhcr realtime evaluation of the chad operation wh ere the effectiveness of the fasttrack system was questioned and it was recommended that i ts relevance be analysed for solar payments the representation was not dedu cting 25 per cent from staff provided accommodation by unhcr the representation stated that staff members deploy ed to these locations were subject to extreme difficulties giv the limited accommodation facilities oios appreciates that the conditions are difficult and the accommodation was substandard but would remind the representation that solar is liv ing

july 2004 oios conducted an audit of unhcrs operations in liberia the audit was conducted in accordance wit h the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing promulgated by the i nstitute of internal auditors and adopted by the internal audit services of the united nations rganizations oios reviewed the activities of the unhcr representation in liberia nd conducted brief review of its sub office so in saclepea and field office fo in gb arnga oios also reviewed the activities of three of its implementing partners 2 the board of auditors reviewed the unhcr opera tion in 2001 they recommended that the subproject objectives be more clearly def ined and proper and measurable indicators established also there was need to improve and strengthen the procedures over project monitoring receivables and asset management 3 the security situation in the country had not improved as quickly as expected this caused delays in the deployment of staff to field l ocations and for the 2004 reintegration activities the representation was still in the pro cess of formulating the programme it was expected that the assisted return of liberians will not effectively commence until october 2004 and possibly early 2005 for other major act ivities in liberia the care and maintenance projects for sierra leone refugees came to an end i n june 2004 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 7 july 2004 exit conference notes outlining the audit fi ndings and recommendations were shared with the representative in july 2004 the comments which were received in july 2004 are reflected in the final report the representation has accepted most of the audit recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to evalu ate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2003 and current year pro gramme activities under projects 03ablbrcm201 03ablbrrp351 03sbwafem13 1 and 03sbwafem132 with expenditure of us 12 million we also reviewe d project 04sbwafem133 with budget of us 23 million the obligation level as f 29 april 2004 was us 6 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented b deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbeit gtz expenditure of us 11 milli on liberians united to serve humanity lush expenditure of us 408000 and m edical emergency relief co operative international merci expenditure of us 350000 the majority of expenditure relating to direct implementation was international procurement we did not include the 2 procurement activities in the scope of the audit b ut reviewed the receipt and distribution procedures 7 the audit reviewed the administration of the ffice of the representation in monrovia with administrative budgets totalling us 4 million for 2002 and 2003 and assets as recorded on headquarters assettrak with an acquisition valu of us 59 million and current value of us 639000 in july 2004 some 180 staff were w orking for unhcr liberia this included staff on regular posts others pending app roval for regular posts united nations volunteers and some 40 individuals contracted unde r service agreements 8 the audit activities included review and ass essment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations general programme matters 9 at the time of the audit the expected returne and reintegration programmes had not yet begun considerable work was still required by the representation to be ready for the expected number of returnees and develop and imple ment the various rehabilitation and reconstruction projects that are necessary to facil itate and encourage potential returnees needs assessment 10 project development and implementation had be seriously hindered by the security situation this had not allowed unhcr until fairly recently to visit field locations to assess the needs of the potential returnees or start with any real momentum project implementation joint needs assessment was conducted in december 2003 in conjunction with other main humanitarian actors undp wfp unicef the transit ional government lrrrc and many more nonetheless due to the constraints of the security situation there were limitations to the assessments done as incountry m ovements were restricted this meant that there was lack of uptodate relevant and accurat statistical information on the expected returnee numbers as well as the socialeconomic sit uation of the communities oios recommended that as the security situation had impr oved new needs assessment be conducted and strategy developed in conjunction wi th other major players to buildrevise the programme on the actual requirements identified with the establishment of sos and fos in major operational areas needs assessment programm planning and implementation are expected to improve the representation actively participates in various interagency working groupscommittees covering basic sectors nd regular bilateral discussions on joint programme planning and implementation b project management and financial monitoring 12 project financial monitoring of partners was ab sent the spmrs were certified by the representation without any independent verificatio n of the partners financial information the representation informed oios that due to limite d staffing resources it had not been possible to visits partners oios review found serious weaknesses in the acco unting and 3 internal control systems established by local partn ers and if this had been identified at an earlier stage corrective action could have been ta ken oios appreciated that the representation has been dealing with number of em ergencies in recent years and staffing resources have been limited nonetheless oios emph asized the need to improve this important project management function as well as pr ovide more handson training and capacity building to local partners the representation stated that one of the first pr iorities of the new project control officer would be to establi sh proper and systematic project financial monitoring procedures c other programme matters 13 the bank in which unhcr deposited its funds closed in june 2003 at the time of closure unhcr had balance of nearly us 13 milli on refer to paragraph 36 oios reviewed the procedures adopted by the representati on for determining programme cash requirements as the bulk of the lost funds were for programme activities programme was not able to clarify how they were estimated due to the change around of staff oios noted however that direct implementation expenditure fr om fmis for january to march 2003 was only us 300000 but the cash replenishment reques t for april to june 2003 indicated requirement of us 650000 this may imply that the estimated requirements were overstated oios noted procedures are now implemented to monito r more closely and systematically cash requirements 14 other areas with regard to programme management were raised with the representation oios recommendations were accepted and appropriate action is or will be taken b review of implementing partners 15 for the three partners reviewed reasonable ass urance could only be taken that the unhcr funds provided to lush were properly accounte d for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenar beit gtz 16 partly as consequence of the war and technica l problems with the accounting system gtz could not provide oios with an accounting ledge r or summary figures to support the 2003 accounting transactions the basis of the spmr financial reports therefore although the supporting payment vouchers and invoices were vailable assurance could be taken as to the completeness and accuracy of the expenditure reported in the spmrs for the 2003 sub projects totalling over us 1 million similar prob lems were noted when oios requested accounting data for 2004 and even though the techn ical problems were eventually solved oios still recommended close monitoring of gtzs fi nancial activities particularly as sub project budget of us 49 million has been provided in 2004 the representation will closely monitor gtz b medical emergency relief cooperative interna tional merci 17 number of serious problems were noted in mecr is financial management of unhcr funds the accounting system established was assessed as less than satisfactory number of errors were identified and certain expend iture could not be supported oios 4 recommended that some us 31804 be recovered for rental charges of us 6000 not disbursed b some us 10690 for rehabilitation f clinic without budgetary provision or authorisation from unhcr and c expenditure of us 15114 charged that could not be supported recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should unless appropriate documentation and explanations have been obtained i n the intervening period recover from medical emergency relief cooperative international an amount of us 31804 which was charged without proper justification andor without proof that it was eligible for unhcr funding rec 01 c internal controls 18 for the three partners reviewed there was n eed to strengthen internal controls over cash and banking cheques were presigned due to th lack of bank signatories bank reconciliations were not prepared and in most case s bank transactions were simply the means of withdrawing cash to make payments oios understa nds that there is lack of confidence in the banking system and looking ahead when activiti pickup at the field level the absence of banking facilities may mean heavy reliance on cash payments nonetheless oios would encourage the representation to request partners to minimise the handling of cash to mitigate the risk of the loss of funds 19 for merci other internal controls were found to be seriously weak payment vouchers and supporting documents were sometimes ab sent authorisation and approval procedures were not adequate and salaries were not always signed for for lush strengthening of internal controls was also warrant ed and they would benefit from more advice and guidance from unhcr d audit certification 20 for 2002 budget provision was made for au dit certification and in some cases the budget was expensed oios did not consistently find 2002 audit certificates on file for 2003 subprojects competitive bidding exercise was co nducted to select an audit firm the selection of audit firms has been finalized c supply management 21 at the time of the audit there was dedicat ed supply unit with the logistics unit mainly involved in warehousing and customs clearanc activities administration was responsible for local procurement and asset managem ent administration assets and programme was responsible for international procure ment and asset management programme assets oios recommended with the assignment of s upply officers that the present responsibilities be reviewed with the aim of centr alising them since the audit meeting has been held by the representation and responsibilitie s and terms of reference were set for the supply officers assigned to monrovia and voinjama 5 procurement 22 there was limited procurement undertaken by the representation purchasing was generally assessed as satisfactory for the three h ighest value items purchased over the 15 months ending 31 march 2004 fuel us 622000 security services us 66000 and car insurance us 26000 however there was evidence that t hese services were procured competitively according to the representation these are procurem ent decisions taken at the interagency level with the suppliers selected by system wide pro curement committee oios accepts this but noted that for fuel and security services the same vendors continued without new bidding since 2001 the representation informed oios that new s election process should have taken place for 2004 but due to the urgency of operations it was p ostponed for the future the representation should ensure that for major procurements such as f uel interagency decisions are properly discussed and documented at the representation leve l contracts which are awarded as result of cooperation with other organizations of the syst em according to financial rule 10517 should be documented as such 23 the majority of the nonfooditems vehicle s office equipment etc were procured or received internationally we were unable to find however complete central information on all the goods ordered and received in 2003 for 2004 for programme procurement list of goods ordered internationally per project was available while this was good start oios recommended that proper pipeline system for procu rement programme and administration be established and managed centrally the representation accepted oios recommendation nd stated that various procedures are being instituted b warehousing 24 all the stock at the unhcr warehouse was loot ed during the war and from stock report dated june 2003 oios estimated the loss at well over us 300000 to lesser extent some thefts occurred from the warehouse in septembe r 2003 and june 2004 oios recommended that the representation initiate proced ures for the submission of the loss of stock to the headquarters asset management board h amb for writeoff appropriate action is being taken 25 warehousing procedures were not always operat ing effectively during the emergency period the warehouse was too small and goods were not properly stacked moreover the distribution of goods was not by purchase order po number and waybills were not yet in place oios was informed that periodic stock counts were made in an attempt to control stock balances but due to the warehouse conditions this could only give good estimate nonetheless at the time of our audit complete p hysical inventory was being conducted as part of the handover exercise of stock management to gtz also the new warehouse will allow stock to be stored by po and unhcr logistics has already established waybills and tighter internal controls 26 from review of the warehouse procedures oi noted that proper inventory management system had not yet been established the system was manual and cumbersome and resulted in duplication of effort as figures had to be reentered by the unhcr logistics 6 assistant in order to generate reports this was an inefficient use of unhcr logistics time the warehouse staff which are now gtz staff were not competent in the use of computers and it was felt that they did not have the necessary experience to manage largescale operation oios recommended that the representation in conjunction with gtz ensure that an adequate stock management system be introduced nd adequate training provided to enable reliable and timely reporting to unhcr gtz is in the process of computerizing the warehouse records from which it is expected that va rious reports can be generated also systems will be implemented to ensure proper contro l of items in the warehouses c vehicle workshop activities 27 the gtz workshop was looted during the war nd many vehicles were completely vandalised all the spare parts workshop tools and office equipment were stolen gtz estimated that this loss including the cost for th rehabilitation of the building was about us 346000 oios recommended that action be initi ated to submit this loss to the hamb action is being taken 28 at the time of the audit the gtzs workshop operation was just being reestablished and gtz was in the process of rehabilitatingconstr ucting new and much larger workshop to accommodate unhcrs expanded activities an overvie w of the systems and procedures already established by gtz was positive 29 there were limited spare parts at the worksho p and the international procurement was only arriving gtz was still waiting for workshop t ools and tyres which sms were procuring these were requested in february 2004 b ut had not been received meaning that some local procurement had to be conducted in the i ntervening period although the procurement is now being initiated oios highlighte d the need for proper planning to ensure the timely receipt of spare parts and tools if the are not readily available it could adversely effect the operation the representation stated that gtz would be consist ently monitored to ensure stock is maintained at an optimum level 30 the representation maintains workshop heade d by an international unv with the other staff employed under service agreements th decision to do this was based on the fact that gtz was too expensive while appreciating this initiative as the liberian economy improves and if gtz is still deemed too expensive it would be more appropriate to procure such services rather than implement them directly 31 in the vehicle workshop yard there are 29 can nibalised vehicles looted they are taking up valuable space which could be used by th office of the representation as that courtyard had very limited space oios also noted number of cannibalised trucks at the gtz workshop the representation has identified suitable locati on to park the scrapped vehicle pending the local asset management board l amb decision d asset management 32 since operations restarted after the war ass ettrak has not been working effectively and we understand that from programme perspective asset management data has not been updated for years the data available on assettrak therefore was not reliable or complete 7 oios noted that the representation was attempting t update the records and the current assettrak records showed an acquisition value of us 87 million and net book value of us 47 million as recorded on unhcr liberias ass ettrak oios was informed that only 50 per cent of the entries may still be valid as t he database includes assets held by field offices which had not yet been verified and in all likelihood were looted during the war 33 oios was pleased to note the action already t aken to bring the records uptodate to quantify the losses and to initiate writeoff proc edures four gs45s have been for prepared for the vehicles looted and cannibalised which inc luded 67 vehicles with an estimated replacement cost of us 17 million however much more was still required to move forward in systematic manner oios recommended th at comprehensive strategy be developed on how to resolve the backlog in data ver ification and updating of records as well as determine if additional temporary assistance wou ld be required to complete the exercise considerable efforts have been made to resolve the pending issues concerning assettrak focal point has been identified followup meetin g was scheduled to verify the final list of looted items to be submitted to hamb an inventory of all assets at the representation vel have been completed and properly entered in assettr ak for field offices an inventory exercise is underway d security and safety 34 security is very high profile issue in libe ria and for all the staff interviewed by oios it was clear that they were aware of their res ponsibilities the representative appears to be very active member of the smt and ensures tha t staff are updated on security issues at least weekly there are three field safety advisor s and number of security assistants and clerks based in monrovia and in the east and west f the country the most recent country security plan was in draft form but was in the pro cess of being finalised unhcr is involved in contributing to the plan as well as its periodic updates 35 further work is required to ensure all unhcr offices and staff residences are moss compliant fire equipment has been ordered and some of it was arriving at the time of the audit antifragmentation film for windows is being procured centrally for all agencies in liberia but it has still to be received administration financial management 36 as referred above paragraph 13 funds of us 13 million has been lost hopefully temporarily due to the closure of the tradevco ban k in which unhcr funds were deposited in hindsight it may not have been prudent due to t he very unstable and deteriorating security environment to keep on deposit such large balanc cash replenishment request of 21 million was made in aprilmay 2003 the representation is continuing to follow up with the central bank of liberia on the recovery of funds posited with the tradevco bank prior to its closure oios appreciates that the representation is active ly following up on this matter but would like to be kept informed of the action be ing taken to resolve the issue to obtain at least part of the us 13 million 8 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia in conjunction with unmil and other agencies should continue to fol lowup on the recovery of unhcr funds of us 13 million t hat have been lost as result of the closure of the trade vco bank rec 02 37 due to the lack of confidence in the banking system by unhcr staff salaries are paid in cash via the bank and collected on the last fri day of the month this procedure has its risks as all staff go to the bank on the same d ay and such routine can be unsafe for staff moreover due to the large number of persons going to the bank considerable time is spent by staff waiting to be served the representations finance unit is encouraging st aff to open bank accounts and oios would support this pening bank accounts allows more flexibility and would streamline the present monthl procedures necessary by the finance unit the representation indicated that this would take t ime to implement as the staff association was avidly against the request to open bank accounts 38 some attention was required to clear old rece ivables and the matching of the recording of advances paid against the recoveries made at th so and fo level activities were limited but oios would recommend further training for staff particularly as some are new to unhcr operations and unfamiliar with its systems an d procedures b duty on fuel 39 duty was paid on fuel and although procedure s were in place for the recovery of the duty imposed in reality the full amount due to unh cr has never been received also since the end of the war duty has been refunded oios estimated that unhcr paid duty of us 124000 on fuel purchased from january 2003 to marc h 2004 40 moreover oios was informed that unmil as result of negotiations at the dpko new york level was able to purchase fuel at about us 1 per gallon less than unhcr at present unhcr is paying an average of about us 21 5 per gallon including duty if us 1 dollar price reduction was received which we ass ume includes the duty element it could result in considerable savings to unhcr particular ly as activities expand at the present level of activities unhcr could save some us 230 000 per year oios recommended that this issue be actively pursued to ensure unhcr equa lly benefits from reduced price in fuel the representation in coordination with other ag encies is pursuing country team approach aimed at ensuring that all agencies are treated fairly with regard to local purchase of fuel in liberia this is an important issue which has significant financial impact on unhcr in oios view therefore the invo lvement of unhcr headquarters particularly as the negotiations were initiated at dpko headquarters may facilitate the discussions at the field level 9 recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for africa should assist the unhcr representation in liberia to ensure unhcr obtains reduction in the cost of fuel to the equivalent paid by unmil this could result in significant savings to unhcr estimated at about us 05 million over the next two years on the basis of the presen t low level of activities rec03 c medical insurance plan mip 41 oios was unable to assess whether adequate sy stems and procedures were in place over mip as the person responsible was absent from the office on mission for mip training in nairobi we highlighted that it was risk to hav only one person competent on the system the representation had already identified this and human resources assistant was now also being trained on mip 42 there seemed to be problem with the mip system an d from the data received from headquarters it recorded that claims had been pr ocessed for 2002 and 2003 from the files in monrovia we noted that claims had been processe d during that period but there was backlog oios recommended that the representation review the status of mip claims and ensure the backlog is addressed oios also stressed to the representation that mip was highrisk area and strong internal controls need to be implemented to mitigate the potential of fraud as outlined in the division of human resource s managements dhrm most recent instruction issued in may 2004 43 the representation did not make mip deduction s from staff salaries until they were included on the monthly payment order mpo this m eant that when they were included on the mpo the full amount was deducted at one time ca using some hardship for the staff member oios would suggest that until staff are inc luded on the mpo only some 80 per cent of their net salary is paid to account for mip and pension fund deductions so as not to exceed unhcrs payroll section calculation of net s alary d personnel 44 the fast track system for the deployment of s taff to the liberia operation was not effective although deployments should have been co mpleted by the end of march 2004 only 29 staff 60 per cent had been deployed and some of them were already staff on the ground on mission status still at the time of the audit three months after the expected date of arrival some staff were only arriving senior admin officer senior protection officer and other key personnel supply officer project control offi cer had not yet arrived various reasons were given for the delays such as nonrelease from the previous duty station sick leave and delays in obtaining visas for their assigned duty s tation some of the appointed staff had not even indicated when they would take up their positi on if there had been large influx of returnees the representation would not have been ble to effectively cope with it oios will not raise specific recommendation on this issue as it was noted in the recent realtime evaluation of the chad operation that the effective ness of the fasttrack system was questioned and it was recommended that the relevan ce of fast track procedures be analysed 10 45 over 40 persons are recruited by unhcr under serv ice agreements which is not contractual arrangement permitted within unhcrs ru and procedures staff employed using such contract were security guards mainten ance men mechanics and cleaners both at monrovia and in field locations some action howe ver was being taken to address the issue and call for offers for some of these services t be supplied by companies has been initiated also oios understands that the present security company will extend their services to the field locations 46 the hiring of staff under nonconventional method s continues to be an ongoing problem in unhcr which needs to be addressed at th headquarters level oios appreciates particularly at isolated field locati ons where companies are not always available alternative arrangements need to be sought unhcr h eadquarters has still not properly addressed this issue or has it provided adequate as sistance to field offices on how to manage in situations where certain services are required but posts have not been created as all such adhoc arrangements should be phasedout by the end of 2004 iom 812001 fom 792001 dated 28 september 2001 more positive ac tion is required to assist field offices the representation is currently exploring the optio n of hiring national unvs in the areas of mechanics and generator technicians for guards and cleaners company will be selected oios will readdress this issue on an unhcrwide ba sis in 2005 d special operational living allowance rate sol ar 47 from 1 july 2004 some us 4000 is payable m onthly to staff under solar solar is meant to contribute towards meeting living expenses within the special operational area the representation did not deduct 25 per cent us 1000 of solar from staff at the sos and fos who were provided fr ee accommodation by unhcr the representation was therefore not complying with iom fom 122004 dated 23 january 2004 special operations approach solar oios recomme nded that the representation revised its practice with immediate effect 1 july 2004 and deduct 25 per cent deduction from solar payments in reply the representation stated that they were currently in the process of fully establishing its presence at six f ield locations in liberia staff deployed to these locations were subjected to extreme difficult ies given the limited accommodation facilities 48 oios fully understands that the living condit ions are difficult however since accommodation albeit substandard is being provid ed by unhcr the 25 per cent deduction rule applies it must be made clear to staff that s olar is living allowance and not hardship allowance when accommodation is provided staff are only igible for 75 per of the solar payment oios agrees however that efforts re required to improve the living conditions of staff working at field locations recommendation head2right the division of human resources management should r eview the practice adopted by unhcr liberia of paying 100 per cent solar us 4000 in addition to the provision of free ac commodation and should ensure compliance with iomfom 122004 spe cial operations 11 approach payment of solar dated 23 january 2004 the representation should be requested to deduct 25 per cent us 1000 of the solar and recover any overpayments made since 1 july 2004 accordingly rec 04 iv acknowledgement 49 i wish to express my appreciation for the ass istance and cooperation
