public safety and justice table 3 illustrates how the traditiona l categories of federal funding for the district have been replaced with new ones beginning with fy1998 federal contribution the revitalization act changed the tra ditional way of accounting for the appropriation of federal funds to the district of columbia it eliminated the annual federal payment to the district and annual federal contribution to certain dc retiremen t funds that had been present throu gh fy1997 see tables 2 and 3 in partial replacement of the federal payment the act introduced federal contributio n to the operations of the nations capital and authorized contribution of 190 million for fy1998 the senate appropriations committee recommended federal contribution to th district of 190 million the amount authorized by the revitalization act but 30 millio n higher than the presidents 160 million request however s 1156 required that the extr 30 million be used to help pay down the districts accumulated general fund deficit which was projecte d to be approximately 527 million by the end of fy1997 the house bil l recommended federal contribution of 180 million but put conditions on its use the final appropriations act follows the senate bill and provides the full 190 million authorized not less than 30 million of this is to be used to repay the accumulated general fund deficit the federal contribution m ay be used to repay advances from the us treasury made to the district under provisions of the revitalization act management reform subtitle b of the revitalization act is known

district estimated that the swap brought about by the revitalization act of smaller federal payment in exchange for the federal assumption of certain dc functions or expenses would bring the district

appropriation major funding trends summary the amoun ts for total federal funds to the district table 3 and total district f columbia funds table 4 should not simply be added together to reach grand total of funds appropriated on behalf of t he district this is because some federal payments to the district are counted twice once as part of fed eral funds to dc on the federal expenditure side and again as part of district of columbia funds on the district revenue side in fy1997 all of the federal funds appropria ted on behalf of dc were paid over to the district to help cover expenditures also accounted for under the districts own local funds in fy1998 the districts local funds will include the federal contribution to the nation s capital and one of the special federal payments appropriated the federal payment fo r management reform however the other federal payments provided in the fy199 8 appropriations are for act ivities outside those included in the districts budget of local funds this includes the payments for corrections and criminal justice the national park service and the medicare demonstration project48 the calculations in table 5 adjust f or this double counting total district of columbia funds appropriated for fy1998 are 4962967000 this is 58341 million less than th total amount of local funds appropriated for fy1997 5021308000 total federal funds appropriated for the district are 835 million for fy1988 this is 116 million more than the 719 millio n appropriated for fy1997 simply adding these two lines together suggests that the combined total funds appropriated for the district increased by 57887 millio n between fy1997 and fy1998 however when these numbers are corrected for the double counting explained above there is net increase of 578659 million in combined federal and local funds available to the district for fy1998 compared with fy1997 this is largel explained by the fact th at the new federal payments for dc corrections and criminal justice are not counted again within the districts own budget while the prior federal payment was counted twice table 5 total funds appropriated for the district of columbia fy1997 and fy1998

the revitalization act affecting dc appropriations is how the federal contribution to the district of columbia will be determined for future fiscal years the revitalization act officially repealed the federal payment to the district f columbia but in its stead authorized federal contribution towards the costs of th operations of the government of the na tions capital subtitle g section 11601 of pl 105 33 the act authorized specific dollar amount for the fed eral contribution for fy1998 only 190 million for future years the act left the dollar amount of the federal contribution to be determined according to the act after fy1998 for each subsequent fiscal year such amount as may be necessary for suc h contribution in determining the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization under thi s paragraph congress shall take into account the findings described in paragraph 1 the four elements cited as findings in paragraph 1 may be paraphrased as follows the congressionally imposed height limit on buildings and other limitation s relating to the federal presence in the district that may tend to reduce ta x revenues the congressional prohibition against levying an income tax on nonresiden t commuters which limits the districts ability to tax income earned in th district of columbia the unreimbursed public service costs imposed by the federal government s presence and the resultin g high tax burden on district residents relative to residents of other jurisdictions in the washington dc metropolitan area and other cities f comparable size as with previous legislation authorizing the federal payment the revitalization act does not present for mula or methodology for translating the generalized notion of compensating the district for the federal governments presence
