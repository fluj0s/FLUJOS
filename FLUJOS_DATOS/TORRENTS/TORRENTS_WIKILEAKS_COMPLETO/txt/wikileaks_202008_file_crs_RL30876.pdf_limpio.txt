of the us codethe presidents reorganization authority review and analysis summary among the initiatives being promoted with the beginning of the administration of president george w bush is that of renewing the presidents lapsed authority to submit reorganization plans to congress the general rationale offered for renewing this authority is that it would provide additional flexibility and discretion to the president in organizing the executive branch to promote economy and efficiency as well as his political priorities the regular legislative route for considering presidential proposals involving organizational changes is deemed by reorganization authority supporters as being unduly slow and cumbersome thus the proposal to permit the president to submit reorganization plans subject to mandat ory congressional consideration with fast track procedures is viewed by the reorganization proposals proponents as necessary reform for good government critics of the reorganization plan authority reject the arguments and assumptions behind the proposal and defend the efficacy and legitimacy of the regular legislative process for executive reorganization proposals this report

reorganization authority was delegated by congress to the president 5 usc 901912 from time to time under various forms between 1932 and 1984 the rationale for this delegation was to be found in the view that the key to effective and efficient government lay in delegation by congress to the president of broad authority to reorganize the departments agencies and program administration subject only to legislative veto reorganization was viewed in large measure as technical non political exercise best left to the experts in the executive branch from the early 1960s on however questions were raised in congressional deliberations as to the constitutional basis for such authority and processes and the political wisdom of assigning broad reorganization authority to the president successive reorganization acts despite changes in procedures and limitations on what could be included in reorganization plans remained based on the concept of permitting the president to submit proposals to congress that would go into effect unless either house prevented activation by passing motion of disapproval this legislative veto process was increasingly criticized as the years passed also the reorganization process began to be questioned as to both its utility and its potential for increasing conflict and distrust between the branches congress in successive reorganization acts gave the president authority to skirt the regular legislative process yet when the president invoked the authority his actions were criticized by some for violating constitutional procedures the white house appeared to some observers to be forwarding reorganization plans simply to justify its request for reorganization authority plans were submitted that arguably would not have been accepted as legislation using the regular legislative process thus increasing tensions between the branches the process was rigid that is amendments were permitted even technical amendments agreed to by all the parties after each presidential misuse congress responded by adding restrictions and exemptions gradually circumscribing the power until the reorganization plan process as provi ded in the 1977 reorganization act as amended was mere shadow of the baseline 1949 reorganization act with the 1983 chadha decision immigration and naturalization service v chadha 462 us 919 striking down the legislative veto the utility and desirability of the reorganization act compared to following the regular legislative process came in to question whereas fast track options within the larger legislative process retain their appeal under certain circumstances and reorganization of the executive branch may indeed be one of those circumstances president since 1984 has requested the renewal of the reorganization authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30876crs2 2 there are only two indirect references to the question of administrative organization in the constitution namely that the president may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices and that the congress may by law

ronald c moe delegating with ambivalence the legislative veto and reorganization authority in studies on the legislative veto prepared by the congressional research service for the continuedorigins and early use of the presidents reorganization authority while questions regarding how best to organize the executive branch were raised in the constitutional convention the constitution itself is nearly silent on organizational matters2 the document does reflect however the clear intention that congress is to play critical role in the organization design and management of the executive branch it is congress not the president that establishes departments and agenc ies and to whatever degree it chooses the internal organization of agencies it is congress through law that determines the mission of agencies personnel systems confirmation of executive officials and funding and ultimately evaluates whether the agency shall continue in existence all of which is not to downplay the role of the president as chief manager but rather to reaffirm the intention of the framers with respect to the role of congress as comanager of the executive branch the comanagership concept has been criticized by proponents of the theory of the dominant president that has enjoy ascendency beginning with the progressive movement throughout most of the last century while secretary of commerce president herbert hoover 19291933 had been propone nt of the idea that congress should delegate to the president authority to propose reorganizations of the executive branch subject to some form of congressional disapproval3 near the end of his term hoover was successful in persuading congress when passing the economy acts of 1932 and 1933 to include provision assigning the president

scientific management principles5 from this point of view congress and the legislative process were viewed as too cumbersome and prone to particularistic interest group pressures support for the reorganization plan concept and process thus rested from the beginning on negative opinion of congressional processes and congress alleged inability to move wisely and expeditiously on issues of organizational management this critical view held by many members of congress themselves6 has been recurrent over the years and continues to this day to be major rationale offered for proposals to renew the presidents reorganization authority7 although presi dent franklin roosevelt had some interest in executive reorganization during the new deal years he was more focused toward creating new agencies and programs than in consolidation and retrenchment the reorganization act was rarely used and allowed to lapse in 1935 as america faced heightened international pressures however roosevelt indicated renewed interest in executive reorganization as tool for increasing presidential authority and for preparing america to meet its wartime responsibilities8 one product of this changed political climate was passage of the reorganization act of 19399 this act provided that for two years the president could submit reorganization plans that would go into effect unless congress disapproved by concurrent resolution of disapproval as far as congress was concerned the objective was for the president to use the authority to reduce expenditures to the fullest extent consistent

given authority under title i of the war powers act to make temporary emergency wartime reorganizations for the duration of the war plus six months11 in 1945 congress again granted the president authority for two years to submit reorganization plans 59 stat 613 this act was similar in most respects to the 1939 act in that it provided for congressional rejection of plan by concurrent resolution12 and expressly prohibited the abolition or transfer of all functions of executive departments and certain designated agencies reorganization act of 1949 congress next renewed the presidents reorganization authority by passing the reorganization act of 1949 63 stat 203 major provisions of which remained in force until 1977 although the act was patterned in the main after the reorganization acts of 1939 and 1945 there were several import ant differences13 at the urging of the first hoover commission whose report appeared in 194914 congress gave the president much greater latitude than he had enjoyed under the earlier acts because it appeared to authorize submission of plans to reorganize executive departments and virtually all agencies once reorganization plan was submitted congress could not amend the plan but had either to accept or reject it in toto reorganization plan is effective at the end of the first period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of

summer 1981 pp 30118reorganization plan the 1949 act therefore established onehouse veto procedure for reorganization plans in the immediate wake of the hoover commission report and the passage of the reorganization act large number of reorganization proposals were effected by the regular legislative process administrative order and lastly by reorganization plans with respect to the latter president truman in 1949 initially submitted eight reorganization plans of which six became effective while in 1950 20 of the 27 were allowe d to go into effect these plans included proposals for strengthening the executive office of the president broadening the authorities of independent regulatory commission chairmen and transferring the public roads administration to the department of commerce legislative bills were also enacted most notably the national security act amend ments the ease with which most of the reorganization plans became effective reflected two factors the existence of consensus that the president ought to be given deference and assistance by congress in meeting his managerial responsibilities and the fact that most of the reorganization plans were pretty straightforward proposals of an organizational character this high rate of passage however was misleading in that it tended to obscure the emergence even at this early date of opposition to the reorganization process itself in the 28 years between 1949 and 1977 the reorganizatio n act of 1949 was renewed seven times as renewals were sought debated and granted amendments were adopted altering the original act the thrust of these amendments was toward limiting the presidents discretion in what could be included in reorganization plans and what procedures would have to be followed in the approval process the limitations included modifications to the effect that only one plan could be submitted within 30 day period and could include only logically consistent subject matter plan could not create new legal authority this latter point was important to congress as it prevented the reorganization procedures from being used to circumvent congressional authority to legislate in 1964 congress eliminated the presidents authority to submit plans proposing the creation or abolition of new executive departmen ts15 each restrictive limitation could arguably be traced to what the majority in congress believed at the time to be an abuse by the white house of the discreti on permitted in the procedures good deal of distrust attributable to the reorganization process appeared to emerge between the branches16 with considerable regularity throughout this period many in congress challenged the reorganization act on constitutional grounds the chairman of the house government operations committee repr esentative jack brooks was both persistent and consistent over the years in voicing objections to the procedures provided in the reorganization act he argued that the procedure produced situation where the president was making law without the constitutionally required approval of both houses of congress and the subsequent signature of the

and was not renewed by congress until 1977 soon after his inauguration president jimmy carter requested congress to renew this authority including certain suggested revisions hearings were held in both the house and senate on the presidents proposal and major amendments were offered after considerable debate the bill passed and was signed by the president on april 6 1977 91 stat 29 5 usc 901912 as crucial provisions of the 1949 act were considerably altered it was decided to redes ignate the law as the reorganization act of 1977 among the changes approved were the following 1 the presiden t would be allowed to amend plan within 30 days after sending it to congress 2 the prohibition against establishing abolishing transferring or consolidating departments was expanded to prohibit also the abolition or consolidation of independent regulatory agencies 3 enforcement function or statutory program could be established by plan 4 resolution of disapproval was required to be introduced in each chamber and 5 more than three plans could be pending before congress at one time section 905 of the reorganization act of 1977 listed additional limitations on the presidents authority to submit reorganization plans as follows 905 limitations on powers reorganization plan may not provide for and reorganization under this chapter may not have the effect of 1 creating new executive department abolishing or transferring an executive department or independent regulatory agency or all the functions thereof or consolidating two or more executive departments or two or more independent regulatory agencies or all the functions thereof 2 continuing an agency beyond the period authorized by law for its existence or beyond the time when it would have terminated if the reorganization had

legislation to renew the presidents authority to submit reorganization plans in 1977 chairman brooks partially achieved his objective of requiring congressional vote on reorganization plans through an amendment to the bill17 as in the reorganization act of 1949 plan would become effective after 60 days unless either house passed resolution disapproving it at this point brooks sponsored actionforcing requirement was included when the president submitted plan to congress resolution of disapproval had to be introduced at the same time by the chairmen of the house government operations committee and the senate governmental affairs committee the two committees would be required to make recommendations to the house or the senate respectively within 45 days or the committees would be deemed as having been discharged from consideration of the resolution since any member could move for consideration of the resolution it was believed unlikely that any future plan would go into effect without congress having chance to vote on it under the authority of the reorganization act of 1977 president carter submitted ten reorganization plans all of which congress permitted to become law in each instance defeating resoluti on of disapproval none of the plans involved major reorganization proposals18 reorganization authority under the 1977 act was granted to the president for three years later extended for an additional year that authority expired on april 7 1981 reorganization act of 1984 the reorganization act of 1977 expired on april 7 1981 some in the new reagan administration called for the renewal of the authority although the president never made it major part of his personal agenda the administration requested congress in 1983 to renew the authority and hearings were held on hr 1314 97th congress by the subcommittee on legislation and national security of the house government operations committee chaired by representative brooks on april 12 1983 the bill which provided number of substantive alterations to the 1977 reorganization act was intended by its sponsors to be cooperative effort by the president and congress to expedite reorganizations believed to be needed by the executive branchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30876crs8 court decisions during this immediate period especially the supreme courts decision in ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 had significant impact on deliberations in congress in chadha the supreme court ruled that all legislative vetoes includ ing those attached to the reorganization authority were unconstitutional in an effort to meet the requirements of the chadha decision hr 1314 required that joint resolut ion be introduced in both the house and senate upon receipt of reorganization plan affirmative action on this resolution was required for the reorganization to become law if either house failed to vote such inaction would constitute disapproval of plan also in the unlikely event that president vetoed the plan he had previously submitted veto override would require two thirds vote of both houses expedited procedures established in the 1977 act were also significantly altered in hr 1314 the 1977 act included 60day time period for congressional consideration of each reorganization plan and also provided that more than three plans might be pending at any time brooks and representative frank horton as congressional sponsors of the legislation believed that the time frame was overly burdensome and therefore extended the period for congressional consideration to 90 days within the 90day time period other time limitations were extended proportionately the 1977 act allowed 30 days from the date of submission for the president to amend the proposal hr 1314 extended that allowance to 60 days the time period in which president might withdraw reorganization plan was extended from 60 to 90 days committee action previously required within 45 calendar days following submission was extended to 75 calendar days if the committee failed to report resolution within that period it would be deemed to have been discharged and the resolution would be placed on the appropriate calendar another signif icant innovation in hr 1314 was the requirement that an implementation section be included in the presidents messag accompanying the reorganization plan such provision was recommended by the general accounting office in its report of march 20 1981 entitled implementation the missing link in planning reorganizations the gao had found that agencies were experiencing considerable problems in implementing reorganization plans agencies reorganized under the reorganization act of 1977 experienced substantial startup problems these included delays in obtaining key agency officials inadequate

provision was to assure that durin g the planning of reorganization proposal the administration gave appropri ate emphasis in staff time and resources to studying implementation requirem ents in order to reduce if not eliminate the substantial problems which have been found to exist in the implementation of past reorganization plans20 the committee considered and concluded that the restrictions in the 1977 reorganization act on the subject matter that may properly be included in reorganization plans submitted to congress should be continued the house considered the legislation on april 10 1984 and the senate on october 11 1984 president ronald reagan signed the act pl 98614 on november 8 1984 the provisions of the act were to remain in effect for less than two months expiring on december 31 1984 during this period the president did not submit any reorganization plans nor did he subsequently request renewal of the authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30876crs10 what about the future reorganization of the executive branch has been and will be continuous process laws are passed requiring that new agencies be created or terminated existing agenc ies be altered or programs initiated or discontinued within departments and agencies reorganizations are conducted under secretarial direction and usually follow from changes in secretarial priorities or changes in available resources organizational change is the norm in agency life not the exceptional action in this larger context the presidents reorganization authority might be considered minor element it has not been used since president carters last reorganization plan in 1980 yet the reorganization plan concept retains much of its appeal when supporters call for renewal of the presidents reorganization authority what precisely are they calling for is the call intended to revive the reorganization act of 1984 with its provisions or is it for bill with provisions more closely resembling the 1949 reorganization act in either case will the executive branch find the reorganization authority worth having without the simplified process associated with the legislative veto provision it appears that what most supporters have in mind is the reintroduction of an expedited process similar to the 1984 act but without number of the congressional exemptions and limitations accreted over the years the principal argument favoring renewing the presidents reorganization authority appears to be that this will encourage the president through the office of management and budget to take the initiative in organizational management issues something that has not been the case in recent years critics on the other hand argue once again that the regular legislative process is not only constitutional but tends to contribute to whatever wisdom there may be on the subject by letting congress and the interest groups have their say if bill introduced properly and permitted to follow normal procedures does not pass the working assumption ought to be that it did not persuade majority as to its propriety and efficacy and thus failure is democratically justified to some degree therefore critics argue that the expedited procedures of the reorganization act are undemocratic in recent years executive branch reorganization per has been outoffashion labeled as box shuffling by its critics greater faith has been placed by wouldbe management reformers in changing management practices rather than organizational structures the reinventing government exercise of the clintongore administration emphasized performance rather than political accountability as the primary value for government management thus organizational issues were subordinated to the values of performance and results in sense therefore promoters of the reviving the presidents reorganization authority are reasserting an earlier set of management values and practices
