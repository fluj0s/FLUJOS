ilities has recently proposed new rule that would modify the implementation regulations for the dd act specifically the department of health and human services hhs is seeking co mment on whether the current process involving class action lawsuits provides adequate protection for individuals with developmental disabilities nd on what criteria should be applied or what clearance process should be followed to include an individual as member of class19 in addition hhs has asked for feedback about how to handle situations in which there is difference of opinion between the individual with developmental disability and his or her guardian regarding whether to become member of class action lawsuit the underlying objective of hr 2839 hr 3995 and the proposed regulations discussed above is to address some concerns that have been raised about the activities of some federally f unded dd act programs specifically voice of the retarded vor an advocacy organization has argued that pa organizations have been complicit in the neglect and even death of some individuals with seve re mental retardation by br inging class action lawsuits which have ultimately led to the closure of some icfsmr20 vor contends that some lowfunctioning persons would have preferred to remain in an institutional setting and would have been able to do so if pas had been required to secure the approval of the families or guardians of these developmentally disabled individuals before filing class action suits on their behalf21 by contrast organizations like ameri can disabled for attendant programs today adapt have argued that the admin istrative burden associated with opting in to lawsuit is unreasonable and would only delay or hinder efforts to deinstitutionalize services for individuals with disabilities moreover they contend by limiting the number of class action suits brought against icfsmr the optin provision in hr 2839 would have insulate d facilities that provi substandard
