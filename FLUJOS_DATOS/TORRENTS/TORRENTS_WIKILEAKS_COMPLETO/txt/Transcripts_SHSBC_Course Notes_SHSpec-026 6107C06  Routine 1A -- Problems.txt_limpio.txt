6107c06 shspec26 routine 1a problems the cure for step 6 phenomena or creative processing ill effects is six way confront bracket on the pictures and responsibility on pictures people who go solid on step 6 type processes have an automaticity where if they create anything everything theyve ever created gets created hence since the bank is an individual creation the bank beefs up if you use these remedies and you keep these things in mind it would be safe to do creative processing you can prove this by taking picture improving it then looking at picture b you will find that picture b has also improved if you improve the pcs ability to perceive you improve his ability to create and it is only because the pc is doing it all himself that you can clear him however if you improve the pcs ability to create without improving his ability to confront youve done him in art school does this same with technical schools if you make sure the school has only text diagrams and real objects being studied youll cave the students in everything he doesnt like about the subject will eventually come to the fore because you are running cant have on him its games condition you are fixing it so he cant have what hes being educated in the more theory on the mind you give someone unaccompanied by an ability or opportunity to confront the substance of minds thinkingness and the beingness of life the less reality they will have on it so youd do better to leave them alone in their present confusion all training must be accompanied by confronting particularly in the creative fields the cure for obsessive create is confront if the guy is creating his own aberrations it must be that the road out would be confront that would be the secret of clearing mind is an obsessive unknowing creation into which only few important factors enter create problems confront change responsibility notknow goals prevent the pc from looking at anything hes always looking at tomorrow not looking at what hes looking at theres nothing wrong with having goals but what you are looking for is the obsessive goal of the case theres only one of these and it prevents the pc from looking at any part of that goals chain because the goal is so obsessive that it removes his attention from that chain to something that isnt yet in the chain when you find the terminal that represents that goal youll have found the terminal theyve never looked at or inspected but have been with an obsessive goal the pc isnt in pt hes down the future track at an imagined future point so of course he isnt confronting where he is one of the pcs goals leads to the person who most obsessively had that goal which is the valence the pc is in and of course this is the total noconfront of the bank all bunched up in that spot if you only looked at tomorrow and never observed the immediacy of the situation you would eventually have asised any future of it at all so it hangs in time 100 youve never asised any immediacy of the situation so it is all there on that chain and all the future of it is asised goals processing undoes this mechanism of noconfront you are taking off all the futures if you did goals processing crudely and peculiarly you could get the pc totally regressed so that only some back point of the track has any reality to him and present point does if you arc broke him didnt keep him moving on the track this could happen rightnowness of moments on the track those points are on the goals chain theyre moments where the pc wished to god he were somewhere else but he cant be somewhere else so all hes got left to escape to is future this solid scene hes looking at part of it is actually observed its total overwhelm and hes got future there future postulate so it stays on the track as solidity since he cant confront it hell hit these and bounce into the future this could happen quite early in sop goals running the more hes confronted elsewheres than the unwanted incident the more they have asised and the more hes fixed in the incident where he didnt want to be when you run creative processing these points come up easily because hes obsessively creating them all the time problem is the least confrontable thing there is being composed of unconfrontable confusions some pcs will run total irresponsibility on problems of any kind they will perceive connection between having trouble in life and not confronting problems in their lives this is the clue to slow clearing profiles dont change when ptps exist clue to cases is the magnitude of problem the pc comes up with it can drive kids buggy when their parents idea of what problem is is grossly different from theirs you may see someone sitting in the middle of disaster of dramatic or quiet sort who is worrying about the fact that the lady next door has bought new hat thats the level of problem which that person can confront and the things connected with the disaster are not problems in fact theyre not even there someone could say to this lady why dont you straighten all this out and shell think theyre nuts that theres nothing to look at or if there was something there there would be nothing you could do about it you could probably do sanity and ability test by making list of problems by dynamics prepared list in gradients of magnitude you could then have the test taker just check the problems in each dynamic what he checks would tell you where he lives
