and proposed options february 2 2001 richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30825house schedule recently proposed options summary house scheduling practi ces have been criticized frequently in recent years for bringing about compressed workweeks protracted daily sessions conflicts between floor and committee work pressure on family life and inefficient use of time generally especially in the context of reform efforts in the 103rd and 104th congresses 19931996 several alternatives have drawn support and objection these discussions indicate that current practices are strongly related to members weekend commutes to their home distric ts members generally arrange their schedules so as to devote to these trips as much as possible of the time when recorded floor votes are expected these practices tend to result in tues daytothursday week with three afternoons generally available for floor business and only two mornings for committee work as consequence committee meetings extend into afternoons and floor sessions into the morning creating scheduling conflicts for members floor sessions also extend into the evenings taking time from personal life for members with families in the washington area to address these conditions some members have suggested that convening the house earlier in the day making the floor schedule more predictable and similar practices could reduce the need for evening sessions and thereby make it more feasible to continue to schedule extended weekends for travel to the district different approach to these problems proposes to adopt full fiveday workweek the first session of the 104th congress attempted such schedule even then however members travel schedules made it generally impracticable to conduct floor votes before the end of monday afternoon or after the middle of friday afternoon also under the rigorous conditions of that session even this schedule did not eliminate frequent resort to evening sessions third alternative proposed has been to provide week of recess after each third workweek of five full days in fourweek period this schedule would afford more working days and more available mornings than would continual threeday workweeks the intent of this plan is that members concentrate their trips home in the recesses rather than between consecutive weeks in which the house meets however senate experience with similar plan suggests that members are likely to continue commuting on short weekends even when longer recesses are also provided fourth alternative proposed as middle course among the preceding has been to establish fourday workweek this plan would afford more time for floor and committee sessions than currently without making weekend commutes impracticable in one version the workweeks would be staggered so as to provide fourday weekend every other week although this plan could still increase the time available for washington work it might yet fail to reduce member commuting on the short weekendshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30825contents commuting compression and committee work 1 tuesdaytothursday

rise of the continuedhouse schedule recently proposed options commuting compression and committee work many members have in recent years expressed dissatisfaction with the way the house arranges its work schedule the chief complaints appear to be that existing practices make inefficient use of time and do not allow predictability generating persistent scheduling conflicts and other time pressures these issues gained in prominence especially through the work of the 1993 joint committee on the operations of congress jcoc often known as the hamil tonboren reform committee during 1994 hearings by the house committee on rules on the jcocs recommendations and in the 104th congress 19951996 after the new republican majority adopted reforms based in part on these deliberations this report discusses how four types of house schedule that have been practiced or proposed during the past decade address these areas of dissatisfaction the four types of schedule are the tuesdaytothursday schedule the fiveday workweek the three weeks on one week off plan and the fourday workweek these four scheduling arrangements are distinguished primarily by the length of the workweek each has different implications for 1 weekend and recess commuting 2 compression of the legislative workweek 3 the length of daily floor sessions 4 the timing of committee meetings and 5 conflicts among floor work committee work and personal life observers agree that members generally strive to return to their home districts whenever they can accomplish the round trip in the time available at least those representing the most distant districts obtain very little actual time at home on two day weekend round trip most members appear willing to extend their weekly trips home into the workweek as long as

will occur because votes must be scheduled for times when most members will be present these patterns of weekend commuting tend to compress floor business into the midweek days this compression in turn tends to require floor sessions to extend beyond the customary afternoon period into the evening or forenoon or both when floor sessions extend into the evenings especially on an unscheduled basis they tend to interfere with members family lives this circumstance appears to be chief source of the demand that scheduling be made more family friendly when floor sessions extend into the forenoon on the other hand they tend to conflict with committee meetings at the same time low attendance on days without floor votes tends to require committees to meet chiefly on the midweek days as well in addition because the house normally meets in the afternoons members can take the morning of the first day of each week on which floor votes occur as travel time and that morning becomes unavailable for committee work for these reasons committee meetings tend to extend into the afternoons the overlapping of committee and floor work that results from all these considerations is chief source of scheduling conflicts tuesdaytothursday schedule in recent years the house has frequently tended to confine recorded votes to the middle three days of the week2 it does so either by meeting in pro forma session on mondays and fridays or by rolling until the next business day any recorded votes that may be ordered on those days3 alternatively on monday the house may roll recorded votes

17 1994 p 4the core objection raised against schedules of this kind has been that they afford too little time for the legislative work of the house critics assert that when only three weekdays are available for floor business late nights and missed famil dinners become frequent especially during busy legislative periods or when the house does not convene until noon4 alternatively the house may find it necessary to convene in the forenoon which tends to create conflicts with committee meetings at the same time as one member noted this schedule permits committees to meet only on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays and most meet at tuesday 1 oclock wednesday at maybe 9 oclock in the morning and thursday at 9 oclock5 given this limited range of options committee meetings must frequently conflict with each other under this schedule as well committees often find it necessary to continue meeting into the afternoon when their activity tends to conflict with floor sessions together these practices exacerbate scheduling conflicts for members many have accordingly criticized these arrangements for fostering fractured attention and undermining the quality of deliberation both in committee and on the floor6 additionally when few floor votes occur on monday and friday many members may lengthen their weekends further arriving on tuesday and departing on thursday under these conditions one member has argued tuesdaytothursday schedule does not afford even true threeday workweek for legislative business but instead two half days and full day on wednesday7 nevertheless substantial groups of members have recurrently supported this arrangement over other alternatives in 1993 more than 100 members endorsed its retention against the fourday workweek recommended by the

week18 the experience of the 104th congress also highli ghted the importance many members place on preserving opportunities for extended weekend commuting in february 1995 for example the leadership announced its intention to start taking up business on the floor by 2 pm on mondays some members from the far west protested that even 5 pm arrival on capitol hill required them to leave their districts on the earliest flight of the morning the leadership ultimately adopted suggestion that recorded votes ordered on mondays be stacked until 5 pm19 respon ding to preferences of this kind most of the plans for fiveday legislative workweek discussed by the jcoc had proposed to retain restrictions on recorded votes on the first and last business days of the week the leadership in the 104th congress also attempted to avoid recorded votes before 5 pm on mondays and after 3 pm on fridays20 under the plan offered before the 105th congress too floor sessions were to begin at noon on monda and recorded votes were to occur before 5 pm on that day or after noon on friday21 the more fiveday schedule observes such restrictions the less it differs from tuesdaytothursday schedule three weeks on one week off proposal that attracted substantial favorable interest during the deliberations of the jcoc involved instituting regular weeklong recess after each third week of floor sessions this proposal became known as the three on one off plan such schedule it was argued would facilitat scheduling five full days of legislative business during each of the other three weeks22 under this plan only two of every four weekends would be restricted to two days the other two weekends would be absorbed into the recurring recesses which would afford members the opportunity for nineday trip to their districts once every four weeks23 as one member argued this schedule would permit especially thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30825crs6 23continued 1994 vol i pp 112 118119 subcommittee on rules of

p 11from the west coast to spend less time sitting on planes24 such considerations suggest that members from distant districts would tend to gain the most from this schedule inasmuch as commuting on short weekends is least efficient for them under three on one off arrangement each fourweek cycle would contain 15 business days rather than 12 under tuesdaytothursday schedule25 this gain would presuma bly reduce the need for convening the house before noon and continuing in evening sessions and some have suggested that it could foster earlier annual adjournments as well26 the plan would also reduce from four in 12 to three in 15 the proportion of legislative working days falling on the first day after break thereby increasing from eight to 12 the number of mornings in each fourweek period on which it would be practicab to schedule committee meetings27 substantial majorities of house member s responding to the jcoc survey supported the three on one off concept and over 100 later signed letter to the leadership in its support28 another group of similar size however signed petition in opposition to this schedu and the family friendly advisory committee recommended against it29 the house contingent of the jcoc declined to endorse the plan on the ground that it could work effectively only if the leadership ensured that recorded votes would occur on all five workdays30 objections raised against the three on one off plan again reflect the strong preference of members to continue commuting even on twoday weekends members of the advisory committee objected to the proposal specifically on the ground of the difficulty of such travel especially to distant districts31 one member contended that under this schedule members might feel compelled to bring their

chief reason for house interest in three on one off schedule was that senate leadership had instituted similar arrangement in 198833 during hearings of the jcoc however senate leaders remarked that colleagues had continued to request that recorded votes not be scheduled on mondays and still strove to begin their weekend travel on thursday night by 1993 the senate was continuing to schedule recesses of week in each month but had increasingly reverted to threeday weeks for legislative business and especially for recorded votes34 one house member concluded that the senates three on one off schedule does not work and arguably they spend less time here than they did in the old days because what they have now is their one week off plus the tuesday through thursday club going the other three weeks35 fourday workweek in its report the house contingent of the jcoc declined to recommend schedule involving business weeks of five days36 instead it concluded that fourday workweek would be sufficient to reduce the need for evening sessions37 and to permit restoring separation of times for committee and floor business38 under this proposal the existing schedule of recesses within the session would be maintained legislative workweeks of four days would still afford members weekends of three full days for commuting to their districts variant proposed by one member would yield similar weekends by alternat ing three and fiveday business weeks39 some members nevertheless opposed the jcoc plan on the ground that fourday weeks would still make it very difficult to travel to the district for the weekend40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30825crs8 41ibid pp 170171 177178 42ibid pp 170172 176177 43ibid pp 194 203 44eliza newline carey clean sweep national journal vol 27 jan 21 1995 pp 156 158responding to this objection the democratic study group task force later proposed an alternative form of fourday workweek under this variant the fourday weeks would be staggered with alternating mondays and fridays off to provide for fourday weekend every two weeks41 like the three on one off plan this variant would require two twoday weekends in every fourweek period it would use the days saved however not to provide single more extended travel opportunity but to preserve the remaining two fourday weekends to make the full fourday week available for legislative business the task force proposed to require that the first floor session of each week open with recorded vote on approving the journal and that the last one close with recorded vote on the motion to adjourn42 by this means one proponent contended fourday workweek would permit the house to schedule committees for four days instead of day and half or two days as allowed by tuesdaytothursday schedule43 these requirements would still not increase the practicability of committee meetings on the first morning of the business week accordingly another proposal for fourday week called for floor votes on monday tuesday and thursday and for reserving wednesday for committee day the feasibility of this plan would depend on most members remaining available in washington during the committee day because round trip home in single day would not be feasible the day of floor session lost on wednesdays could conceivably be made up by convening the house in the forenoon on monday for full day of session enforced with an initial roll call vote daily schedules and predictability to the extent that any schedule preserves opportunities for weekend commuting it must presumably also retain some compression of the legislative workweek compressed workweek in turn will entail longer daily floor sessions members favorable to preserving opportunities for weekend commuting have generally argued that the house can adequately perform its legislative work in compressed workweek their proposals have focused on ways of managing the extended floor sessions and the conflicts between floor and committee meetings that compressed workweeks tend to foster during the 104th congress when the leadership contemplated from the outset that evening floor sessions would be required even with fiveday workweeks several members protested that these arrangements would undermine attempts to give members more time with their families44 some urged that floor action and familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30825crs9 45rep wolf

thursday sessions more nearly equally rather than using late wednesdays to compensate for earlier thursday adjournments48 during this same period the family friendly advisory committee took the view that if the house met at 9 am or 10 am on the three midweek days and planned for late evening sessions on wednesdays it could normally adjourn on tuesdays by 6 pm for family dinners and on thursdays by 4 pm for trips home49 another member less optimistically argued that legislative business could successfully be conducted in three days per week if the house continued in session from 9 am to 9 pm on those days50 neither of these proposals explicitly addressed how continual forenoon floor sessions might affect committee work some members suggested that scheduling pressures in floor sessions could be eased while still minimizing conflicts with committee work and personal life by using the forenoon and evening portions of floor sessions as much as possible for nonlegislative forms of

floor sessions themselves is cited as one of the chief ways in which the house schedule fails to be family friendly52 unpredictable requirements for extended sessions in turn presumably grow more intense as the compression of the workweek increases improving predictability however faces an additional difficulty that has been little remarked in this context the leadership cannot easily regulate or even predict the hundreds of decisions by individual members on which the flow of legislative action depends it can announce schedule but ultimately lacks much capacity to ensure its realiz ation even rules designed to enforce schedule would have to be modified continually to respond to the flow of daily legislative events only by organizing the house more on hierarchical and managerial principles rather than collective and deliberative ones might the leadership obtain means for fulfilling members demands for predictability comparison and conclusion in contemporary circumstances any scheduling arrangement seems unlikely to win acceptance unless it either accommodates or brings about alterations in certain established patterns of behavior specifically that members generally strive to travel to their districts during any break of at least two days in the legislative schedule strive to extend the duration of any trip home as much as possible regard floor sessions as insufficient reason to remain in washington unless recorded votes are in prospect and regard committee meetings alone as insufficient reason to remain in washington the central objective of each proposed change discussed above is to permit spreading floor and committee work over greater number of days so as to reduce schedule conflicts and extended sessions the chief objection to each concerns the difficulties that more extended workweek creates for weekend commuting both the three on one off plan and the staggered fourday week are explicitly designed to meet these objectio ns by finding more efficient combinations of legislative time with commuting time the following table accordingly summarizes the four alternatives discussed here by compar ing the time each makes available for floor
