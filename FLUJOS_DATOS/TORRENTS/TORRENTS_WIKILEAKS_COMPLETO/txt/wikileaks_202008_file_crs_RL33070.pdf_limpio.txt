maguire government and finance division march 24 2008 abstract this report discusses the general issue of familyowned businesses and then discusses the conse quences of several options including making revisions and hence returning to pre2001 law in 2011 making the repeal of the estate tax permanent and modifying exemptions while retaining an estate tax this latter discussion considers expanding or altering the existing general or business exemptions providing an exemption for all business assets dollar ceiling or other restrictions or modifying the qfobitype exemption to eliminate cliﬀ eﬀect that currently exists because only estates with half of the assets in business were eligible for the special deductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33070g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

estate tax by increasing exemptions and lowering rates the estate tax is scheduled to be repealed in 2010 and provision to tax appreciation on inherited assets in excess of limit will be substituted the 2001 tax provisions sunset however so that absent change making them permanent the estate tax will revert in 2011 to prior pre 2001 law proposals to make the repeal permanent or to significantly increase the exemptions and lower the rate are under consideration discussions of the estate tax have focused particularly on the effects on family businesses including farms and the perception that the estate tax unfairly burdens family businesses because much of the estate value is held in illiquid assets eg land buildings and equipment the estate tax may even force the liquidation of family businesses special family business deduction the qualified family owned business interest exem ption qfobi was enacted in 1997 because of higher exemptions and previous cap on the combined regular and small business exemption this provision is longer relevant if however the estate tax repeal sunsets qfobi will again be germane in the 109 th congress hr 8 which would make the repeal permanent was passed by the house but not by the senate there were also proposals to allow an expanded business exemption to allow higher exemption or both higher exemption and lower rate hr 5970a proposal for credit eventually equivalent to 5 million exemption 10 million for married couple with tax rates initially set at the capital gains tax rate currently 15 and scheduled to rise to 20 for estates up to 25 million and at twice the gains rate for those over 25 million was passed by the house on july 29 2006 several bills have been introduced but not acted on in the 110 th congress although related amendments to the budget resolution in the senate in march 2008 were defeated despite this attention to family business evidence suggests that only small fraction of estates with small or family business interests have paid the estate tax about 35 for businesses in general and 5 for farmers compared to 2 for all estates recent estimates suggest that only tiny fraction of familyowned businesses less than ½ of 1 are subject to the estate tax but do not have readily available resources to pay the tax thus while the estate tax may be burden on those families the problem is confined to small group if the estate tax is repealed qfobi will allow an exemption for some or all of business assets in about third to half of estates with more than half their assets in these businesses but the value of the exemption will be reduced because the general exemption has increased if the estate tax repeal is made permanent liquidity will cease being problem although family businesses may be more likely than other estates to be affected by the capital gains provisions exposure to the estate tax if it is reinstated would be significantly decreased by increases in either the family business or general exemptions the report also discusses an uncapped exemption and an uncapped exemption targeted at liquidity issues this report will be updated as legislative events warrant

and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra phased out the estate tax by gradually increasing the exemption and lowering the rate the tax will be eliminated in 2010 provision providing for carryover basis for assets transferred at death will replace the current stepup in basis this latter provision would require heirs when selling inherited assets to pay tax on the gain that existed at the time of death in addition to any appreciation since transfer 13 million exemption would be allowed with an additional 3 million for surviving spouse the repeal of the estate tax and the provision for carryover basis is sunsetted and absent legislative change will revert to pre2001 law in 2011 with an exemption of 1 million and top statutory tax rate of 55 the law will also revert to the prior rule of steppedup basis for assets where capital gains tax would be paid on appreciation of assets existing at the time of death current discussions about the estate tax are focusing particular attention on the effects on family businesses including farms 1 many policy makers and observers have maintained that the estate tax unfairly burdens family businesses because much of the estate value is held in illiquid assets eg land buildings and equipment 2 the estate tax it is suggested forces these businesses to liquidate vital assets to pay the tax critics of the estate tax posit that in some cases liquidating the business completely may be the only option prior law contained special deduction for familyowned businesses the qualified familyowned business interest deduction or qfobi to addre ss this issue this deduction was capped so that the total of the normal exemption and the family business exemption could not exceed 13 million the deduction was also contingent on meeting number of qualifying rules qfobi is currently irrelevant since the exemption is 15 million and was repealed by egtrra for 2004 and beyond but will play role again if the egtrra provisions sunset the estate tax both under current and permanent rules contains some other provisions that may make the payment of the tax easier for familyowned businesses qualifying estates can pay the tax in installments over maximum of 10 years after fiveyear deferral and can value their land as currently used rather than at fair market value 3 familyowned business may also be more likely to benefit from minority and marketability discounts which allow lower valuation if the property is held by several heirs with minority interest or is otherwise difficult to sell4 1 for discussion of the political issues surrounding the estate tax issue including the issue of family businesses see michael j graetz and ian shapiro death by thousand cuts the fight over taxing inherited wealth princeton princeton university press 2005 2 nonbusiness assets such as cash bonds and publicly traded stock are all relatively liquid assets under current estate tax rules the basis of these assets is stepped up to th value at the time of death thus eliminating the potential for capital gains taxes on inherited appreciation after liquidation 3 some of the deferred tax is subject to 2 interest payment the provision allowing current use valuation requires recapture tax unless heirs continue to use the land in the business for at least 10 years the market value can be reduced by maximum of 750000 through 1998 after 1998 the maximum is indexed for inflation rounded to the next lowest multiple of 10000 in 2004 the maximum was 850000 4 the idea behind the minority discount is that heirs without control are constrained in the flow of income and the possibility of sale there are other related discounts such as marketability discounts because ready market exists for the asset there are concerns that these discounts are exce ssive in some cases and that they are used through estate planning to minimize estate taxes and the joint tax committee in its study options to improve tax compliance and reform tax expenditures january 27 2005 has proposed some revisions see pp 396404 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33070g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141g561

legislation to that effect in the 109th congress hr 8 passed the house making the change permanent would involve significant revenue loss in excess of 50 billion in 20125 there were also proposals to retain the estate tax but allow an expanded business exem ption hr 1612 and s 928 higher exemption hr 1577 and hr 1574 or both higher ex emption and lower rate hr 1560 hr 1568 and hr 16146 recently proposals have been made to retain the estate tax they include proposal suggested by senator kyl to provide 5 million exemption per spouse and 15 rate equal to the current capital gains tax rate senator baucus has proposal to provide larger exemption and lower but graduated rates as permanent provision in 2006 the house adopted hr 5638 which allowed 5 million exemption per spouse and sets the rate at the capital gains tax rate currently 15 but scheduled to revert to 20 in 2011 for estates not over 25 million and twice that rate for the remainder this legislation was included in hr 5970 and passed by the house in the 110 th congress several bills have been introduced but action has been taken on them7 these bills include making the repeal permanent increasing the exemption excluding farmland from the estate tax base and significantly expanding the size of the qfobi exemption this report discusses the general issue of familyowned businesses and then discusses the consequences of several options including making revisions and hence returning to pre2001 law in 2011 making the repeal of the estate tax permanent and modifying exemptions while retaining an estate tax this latter discussion considers expanding or altering the existing general or business exemptions providing an exemption for all business assets dollar ceiling or other restrictions or modifying the qfobitype exemption to eliminate cliff effect that currently exists because only estates with half of the assets in business were eligible for the special deduction

has been devoted to the effect of the estate tax on family farms and businesses and in particular the forced liquidation of family businesses and business assets very few family businesses pay the estate tax and very little of the estate tax is collected from family businesses and none from truly small businesses due to the exemption levels of those estates with family business assets most would appear to be able to pay the tax as discussed below farm and business assets appear to account for around 1112 of taxable estate assets and perhaps little more because these data are from 2003 when some qfobi still existed 8 some data reported in another crs report9 are instructive regarding the ability of familyowned businesses to pay the tax of taxable estates in 2006 63 reported farm

returns report some business or farm assets there is some overlap between the farm and business numbers only 14 of estates were those where farm assets were at least half the estate and only 16 of estates had business assets that accounted for half the estate farm assets in these returns accounted for 06 of estate value and business assets 41 since estates with less than half their assets in farm or business assets would have other sources from the estate itself to pay the tax only this small fraction of estates would presumably have to deal with possible liquidation and these estates were targeted by qfobi table 1 and table 2 below report the percentage of estates with business assets by estate size and the value of the business assets as percentage of the estate by estate size for returns filed in 2006 respectively this same report also estimated that only 33 of business owners face the estate tax and about 5 of farmers do this share is slightly larger than the share of all decedents where less than 2 pay the tax reflecting the higher average wealth of the farm and business owners if one considers the ability to pay the tax out of all nonbusiness assets then if half the estate is held in other assets given tax rate of 55 and since assets are excluded from the estate through general exemptions as well the nonbusiness assets would generally be adequate to pay the tax since the tax as share of the estate will usually be below 50 of the value according to the data reported above about 20 of returns with farm assets 1464 have more than 50 of assets in farm assets suggesting that less than 1 of decedents with farm assets would not have enough nonbusiness resources to pay the tax for business owners only about 4 involve returns where business assets are more than one half the estate thus by this calculation less than 110 of 1 of business owners would not have enough nonbusiness resources to pay the tax t able 1 p er centage of estates with business assets

tax out of liquid assets alone cash bonds and publicly traded stock under pre2001 law and thus would not have to cash in any other property such as home or other real estate recent study by the congressional budget office10 hereafter the cbo study examined data from 2000 to determine the fraction of estates that would not have enough liquid assets stocks bonds cash etc to pay the tax they also indicated that liquid assets would be somewhat higher because it was not able to include assets held in trusts in this study for farms it found that in 2000 8 of farm estates could not pay the tax out of liquid assets given that an estimated 5 of farm estates pay the tax less than one half of one percent of farm decedents would be faced with selling any nonliquid assets whether business or other to pay the estate tax the cbo study did not examine business owners broa dly since it restricted its examination to those business returns that were eligible for qfobi and which therefore by definition have estates where business assets account for over half of the estate these estates are thus much less likely than the average business owner to have sufficient liquid assets to pay the estate tax but even among these estates only 32 did not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the estate tax thus it seems likely that the shares of businesses overall that could not pay the tax out of liquid assets are similar in magnitude and probably smaller than farms t able 2 p er centa ge of estate v alue held in business assets b t ype of asset and estate siz in 2003 size of gross estate amou

nue servic statistics of income estate tax returns filed in 2006 these estimates suggest that only tiny fraction of familyowned businesses less than ½ of 1 do not have enough readily available resources to pay the estate tax thus while the estate tax may be burden on those families the problem is confined to small group in addition businesses that do not have other assets sufficient to pay the tax still have the option of paying in installments borrowing or selling partial interest in the business on average these businesses also received significant minority discounts so that the

exemption will rise through 2009 to 35 million and the rate will fall to 45 in 2010 the estate tax will be repealed but in 2011 the rules will revert to those that existed before egtrra under these rules which were last revised in 1997 the general estate tax exemption will be 1 million the tax rate will be 55 12 and qfobi 11 minority discounts ranged from an average of 16 for residential real estate to 51 for undeveloped land or farmland 12 the estate tax actually has graduated rates but the exemp tion is effectively credit which means that the first dollar taxed is taxed at rate in the middle of the tax schedule rather than at the beginning as in the income tax the first taxable dollar is effectively taxed at 41 the rates rise to 55 and there is also 5 surcharge applying for estates between 10 million and 1784 million to eliminate the advantages of the lower rate and exemption so that estates above this top limit are taxed at an average rate of 55

limited to 13 million thus the effective qfobi exemption is capped at 300000 returning to the status quo and qfobi raises several issues key one being that the real value of the cap has fallen compared to pre2001 law so more qualifying estates will be subject to tax thus it might be appropriate to increase the overall cap the qfobi provisions are subject to number of restrictions designed to ensure that the business is family owned the decedent and decedents fa mily must own 50 of the business or own 30 of business that is 70 owned by two families or 90 owned by three families the business cannot have been publicly traded in the last three years more than 35 of the business income may be personal holding company income and the business must have been owned and operated for five of the past eight years heirs are required to continue the business for the next 10 years to avoid recapture finally qfobi applies only to estates where at least 50 of the assets are family business assets there are also restrictions on the amount of working capital which are designed to prevent the movement of cash and other liquid assets into the business to increase the deduction or allow an estate to qualify the rules designed to target the qfobi provisions have been criticized due to their complexity for example michael graetz and ian shapiro write everyone now agreesregardless of which side of the issue they are onthat qfobi has been complete and utter failure it did not solve anything qfobi has so many requirements so many structures and pitfalls that very few family businesses have obtained any tax relief at all because of it 13 this is harsh criticism and it is not necessari ly supported by the data according to the cbo study for 2000 about 1 of taxable returns claimed the qfobi and about 14 of estates filing returns did so given the evidence that only about 3 of taxable estates had more than half of assets in business and recognizing that some of these estates become nontaxable because of qfobi it appears that about third to half of these businesses qualified for qfobi qfobis scope was limited primarily because it was allowed only for those estates where majority of assets were in the business other estates with more than half of their assets in business assets might not have qualified because the business assets were not fully family business ie largely owned by more than three families or because the heirs chose to sell the business the qfobi provision does nevertheless raise questions of equity and can produce some economic distortions as well as complications the special business deduction does create some issues of equityas is the case with any type of special tax exemption those with eligible business assets will pay lower taxes on the same amount of wealth than those without such assets this inequity is necessary price of targeting specific group and must be weighed against the benefits of the qfobi targeted tax benefit generating smaller revenue loss than broader exemption qfobi also creates economic distortions it induces taxpayers to shift assets into business form or alternatively to avoid liquidating business when that outcome would be most desirable how these incentives work depends in part on the kind of exemption consider an unlimited 13 graetz and shapiro p 36

tax rate dollar shifted from nonbusiness assets to business assets saves 55 cents or from another perspective if business assets earned the same return as other assets one would be willing to pay 222 11055 for business asset that normally sells for dollar or if asset prices are fixed one would be willing to accept rate of return that was as much as 55 smaller in business investment than in other investments the qfobi provision was limited to estates with 50 or more of gross estate value in business assets and was capped thus very large estates that had already used up the cap would have incentive to shift assets as would estates with so few business assets they would be unlikely to qualify however smaller estates that fell below the cap and were eligible would have the same incentives as described above for the unlimited simple exemptions each dollar shifted would with 55 tax rate save 55 cents and estates that were very close to eligibility would have powerful incentives to shift business investments though cliff effect to use simple example from pre2001 law 675000 regular exemption and maximum of 13 million with the business deduction but using flat rate for illustrative purposes if business assets were 45 and the estate totaled 3 million by shifting 150000 in assets from nonbusiness to business would save 343750 055 times 625000 even if the assets were virtually worthless as long as they were not shifted for long time causing forgone earnings one would be better off making the investment cliffs are generally to be avoided in devising minimally distorting tax rules third response to this cliff effect would be to overvalue business assets these rules also magnify existing incentives to undervalue other assets this response does not distort investment but it does use up resources in estate planning and causes unintended benefits and revenue losses the cliff effect can also intensify the existing incentives to remove nonbusiness assets from the estate all of the special business deduction provisions create incentives to recharacterize as much of the estate as possible as business assets the provision of qfobi that required keeping the business in the family after the decedents death that recaptured all or part of the tax when the business was ended also produces economic distortions the provision affects the allocation of capital and the employment of the heirs this rule of course was intended to target those family businesses whose failure to continue was due to the estate tax finally the qfobi provisions complicate administration and compliance for example there are rules to prevent holding of cash and other liquid assets in the business since all businesses must have some cash or nearcash assets available it is necessary to determine what level of working capital is needed in the business such provision would be necessary with any form of business exemption since without such rules nonbusiness assets could be lodged in the business there are also provisions to deal with ownership and control by the family and whether someone has materially participated in the business from this analysis it seems clear that qfobi went long way towards achieving its objective but it does reflect problems that arose as result of the targeting of the provision these problems do not mean that qfobi was not desirable as it reflects specific tradeoff of the benefits of addressing the liquidity problem at minimal revenue cost against the efficiency equity and administrative costs the difficulties in qualifying for qfobi were perhaps largely because the provision was targeted at familyowned businesses that dominated the estate not estates that were less clearly familyowned

repeal is made permanent the liquidity issue will disappear for years 2010 and after however given that less than 3 of estates could encounter liquidity problem returns with more than half of assets in the business 14 for farms and 16 for other businesses this repeal would be very costly from the federal budget perspective if the only objective were to deal with the familyowned business issue there is liquidity problem with this tax regime because there would be estate tax and the capital gains tax would apply only if the assets are sold this new regime would however raise some different issues regarding the effects on the family business theoretically under an income tax all accretions to wealth over given period of time should be taxed traditionally the us income tax has not imposed tax on gain until realized and has allowed stepped up basis for appreciated assets so that tax on the gain accumulated by the decedent is taxed on sale by the heirs the estate tax provided backstop to this exemption so that large accumulations of gain would be taxed under the estate tax the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra addressed this issue through changing the asset valuation to carryover basis regime when the estate tax is repealed in 2010 under carryover basis the heir assumes the basis of the decedent in other words the heir steps into the shoes of the decedent and would pay capital gains taxes upon sale of the asset based on the appreciation from the original purchase price or value 14 congress included in egtrra 3 million spousal exclusion and 13 million general exclusion for capital gains on transferred assets to reduce the tax burden on heirs who sell inherited assets family businesses and small businesses more generally likely have significant unrealized capital gains when the proprietor dies one study estimated the amount of unrealized capital gains held at death for estates valued under 5 million to be approximately 35 of the estates value approximately 34 billion in the aggregate in 1998 15 any business with total assets valued less than the exemption amount which is 15 million in 2005 rising to 35 million in 2009 would not pay any federal estate taxes16 in addition the value of all assets in the business would be stepped up to the value at the time of death based on the above estimate of the portion of estate value represented by untaxed capital gains the stepup treatment confers significant tax benefit to these estates the estate tax regime with the steppedup basis on transferred assets clearly favors these relatively small business estates sheltering total of approximately 34 billion in capital gains from taxation some have noted that farms in particular benefit from this treatment because among other reasons the income tax basis of raised animals for farmers on the cash method of accounting is zero 17 14 this value is identified as the costb asis of the asset ordinarily it is th original purchase

replaced with carryover basis treatment explained earlier congress however included safe harbor for 13 million in capital gains passed to nonspouse using the 35 unrealized capital gains estimate above this treatment would on average shelter an estate valued at approximately 37 million from capital gains tax liability if heirs sold bequeathed assets18 the smaller the portion of unrealized capital gains the larger the overall estate size that could avoid capital gains taxation the difficulty in assessing and confirming the decedents basis would create an incentive to overstate basis to avoid capital gains taxes theory suggests that the potential capital gains tax liability for the very large estates may generate dynastic asset hoarding for the largest estates in the nber study cited abovethose with assets over 10 millionthe unrealized capital gains comprised over 56 of the estates total value the unrealized gains are predominantly business assets in these very large estates 723 of the unrealized gain is held in active farm or business assets over time the potential tax liability would likely increase along with unrealiz ed capital gains further reducing the probability of capital gain realization for family businesses that heirs wish to continue the potential tax liability and asset liquidity are not primary concerns under the carryover basi s regime in contrast for heirs who wish to liquidate the business in particular business with significant untaxed capital gains the carryover basis treatment may generate significant tax implications the disincentive would contribute to lockin effect likely growing with each generation g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g19g8g17g4g11g561g6g152g149g149g138g155g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561 with legislative changes the effective qfobi ex emption has fallen due to the increase in the general estate tax exemption the qfobi dollar limit could be increased which would reduce the number of firms

2000 485 estates claiming qfobi paid tax and 164 of those had insufficient liquidity to pay the tax with 1 million general exemption rise to 15 million total allowing 500000 qfobi deduction would

or both this approach is much more costly than increasing the qfobi exemption since it would apply to all tes but it would alter the taxation of both business and nonbusiness estates substantially in 2000 52000 estates owed taxes and 2834 55 had insufficient liquid assets to pay the tax at that time the general estate tax exemption was 675000 increasing the exemption to 15 million the 2005 value 2 million the 20062008 level and 35 million the 2009 level would reduce the number of taxable estates by 18 this estimate is calculated by dividing 13 million by 35

and 6 of taxable estates would not have enough liquid assets to pay the tax these results suggest that most estates are in the lower part of the asset value distribution and that large estates have significant liquid assets in the case of farmers the proportional reduction would be greater 82 92 and 96 respectively the share although not the number of estates that would have insufficient liquidity to pay the tax would rise from 8 to 9 12 and 20 respectively these values suggest that the share of liquid assets in farm estates becomes smaller as estates become larger in different study the tax policy center found that in 2011 with 1 million exemption there would be 760 taxable estates with farm or businesses comprising more than 50 of assets with 2 million exemption there would be only 210 and with 35 million exemption only 50 19 these reductions in the tax burden on business assets are however accompanied by even more important general reductions in estate taxes so that if the objective is to provide relief for family businesses it is not target efficient clearly an increase in the general exemption would dramatically reduce the number of taxable estates with familyowned businesses g3g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g7g161g142g150g153g157g146g152g151g561g143g152g155g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g18g155g152g153g142g155g157g162g561 an alternative approach to raising the general exemption would be to provide an exemption for all business property with all business property deducted estate would have taxes that required the liquidation of the business with tax rate of around 50 about one quarter of the estate would be used to pay taxes if business assets were 50 of the total since farm and business assets are slightly over 10 of assets in taxable estates the cost of this provision would be slightly over 10 of the cost of repealing the estate tax altogether an openended business exemption would eliminate the cliff effects of the current qfobi since all estates with any business property would be eligible to exclude business assets but it would also increase the number of estates that would claim special deduction and increase the amount of assets that receive special tax treatment the increase in the number of estates and the amount of assets receiving favorable tax treatment would also create distorting effects encouraging disproportionate investment in business assets across broad range of estates an open ended deduction would also be much more costly than the current qfobi deductions and would much less precisely target familyowned businesses recall that about 40 of taxable estates have business or farm assets but only about 3 have more than half their assets in business assets and only about 1 qualify for qfobi in addition to expanding the scope of coverage estates would receive much larger deduction with an unlimited business exemption general business exemption could still have dollar cap which would reduce the cost relative to an openended deduction any type of deduction aimed at certain assets would still require rules to prevent abuse such as limits on cash transferred into the business and would still create inequities and incentives although there would longer be incentives to overvalue business assets or undervalue other assets to qualify for the deduction as in the case of the cliff

in this case the business exemption would be function of both the size of the estate and the share of the estate that is held in business assets this targeted approach might provide significant revenue savings relative to an exemption that simply excludes all business assets this approach is illustrated using simplified example with flat rate estate tax rate recall that the federal estate tax before the egtrra 2001 changes included graduated rates and the exemption was actually credit for the taxes that would have been due on the amount up to the exemption amount the graduated rates if retained in final law however would need to be taken into consideration under the option described here congress might wish to consider the policy option of limiting the business exemption so that the tax is more than the liquidated value of the nonbusiness assets the reasoning behind this policy objective is readily apparent optimally the estate tax should not force family business or farm to liquidate business assets that generate income particularly if the business is to continue in the family after the original owner dies in this scenario the tax on the entire estate should match the value at most of nonbusiness assets for example consider an estate where the total value of all assets in the estate is 10 million the regular exemption is 1 million and assume the tax rate is flat 55 simplified version of the pre2001 tax law rules further assume that threequarters 75 of the value is held in business assets if all business assets were exempted there would be an exemption of 85 million 75 million for the business assets and an additional 1 million regular exemption and the tax due would be 825000 suppose instead that an exemption is set precisely so that the tax equals the liquidated value of the all nonbusiness assets or 25 million this outcome requires total exemption of 5454545 25 million divided by the tax rate of 55 plus the 1 million regular exemption or stated differently the tax on what is left in the estate after the business exemption and the regular exemption amount must generate 25 million in taxes at the 55 rate the estate tax is 55 times 1000000010000004454545 or 25 million which is exactly the value of nonbusiness assets in this case the effective tax rate is 25 25 million divided by 10 million business faces liquidity problem there is cliff and the revenue cost of the exemption is less than what would be the case if all business assets were exempt from the estate tax in contrast if exemptions are allowed for all estates the revenue loss is larger than necessary to target the liquidity issue if estates are excluded based on fixed share of business assets cliff at 50 of total asset value in business assets for example as in the qfobi the rules create very powerful incentives to shift assets to business uses to meet the qualification threshold this effect will become more powerful if the exemption is unlimited if the rules precisely target the business assets to deal with the liquidity issue as described in the previous example there is also an incentive to shift assets into business uses in the example provided above there is an implicit 100 tax on nonbusiness assets which also creates powerful incentive to shift assets into the businessnot as powerful as cliff effe ct but more powerful than simple exemption

that the tax does not consume the entire value of the nonbusiness assets for example if every dollar shifted into business asset increased tax liability by less than dollar the incentive effect to reclassify assets is muted the equation below allows variety of changes in taxable portion of nonbusiness assets20 the variable d is the portion of the nonbusiness assets that would be used to pay the tax reducing d reduces the estate tax burden on nonbusiness assets if policy makers chose to only devote 60 of nonbusiness assets and 0 of the business assets to pay the tax then d06021 ebatesanbd t

flat rate and 1 million general exemption note that the difference between the 55 tax and the unlimited business exemption is that the business exemption includes the general exemption when it is smaller rather than being added to the business exemptions ie each differs by 550000 which is 55 of 1 million this adjustment could be made to general unlimited exemption and would reduce the revenue cost significantly adjusting the exemption of business size in this fashion allows revenue savings for the federal government relative to an unlimited exemption and eliminates the cliff effect and although the equations seem complex this system would simplify estate planning because qualifying for the exemption would not be as important shifting one dollar from nonbusiness to business use would save the taxpayer less than one dollar with the size depending on the share parameter ie if the d parameter is set at 70 each dollar shifted saves 70 cents more than with an unlimited exemption where it saves 55 cents t able 3 re v enue cost of options for 10 million estate with 55 flat t ax rate revenue cost in mil lions share of estate in business assets in three estates estate i estate ii

evidence suggests that only small portion of businesses and farms are subject to the estate tax there may still be concern about the impact on those particular businesses the options discussed for addressing familyowned business issues involve tradeoffs between the revenue cost of providing exemptions to broader group than necessary to address the issue including repealing the estate tax in general and other issues the more targeted the proposal the more administrative distorting and equity issues arise but the smaller the revenue cost the qfobi deduction which is the most targeted of the options considered in this paper created particularly difficult problem due to its cliff effect and the final approach discussed is aimed at eliminating the cliff effect and providing sliding scale deduction targeted at liquidity issues of course if policy makers desire to eliminate the estate tax as provided in 2010 and there are arguments for doing so the liquidity issue would disappear but the revenue effect would be significant and the substitute capital gains provisions would exacerbate lockin effects
