the 12 sections of title iii address specific rule changes to update and streamline existing regulations the regulatory relief provisions in title iii are similar to those passed by the house in 2004 hr 1375 108th congress and in 2006 hr 3505 109th congress the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 pl 109351 regulatory relief measure addressing all depository financial institutions was enacted on october 13 2006 the statute contains four relief provisions specific to credit unions1 the four provisions are addressed in both curia and hr 3505 credit union advocates support the remaining provisions of curia to ensure the financial strength of credit unions and enhance the services provided to credit union members opposition to the legislation was expressed by three banking trade associations in letter to the speaker of the house2 the letter states that the legislation would increase the powers of credit unions and raise serious safety and soundness concerns although separate hearings were not held on curia the house financial services committees subcommittee on financial institutions did hold hearing on hr 3505 on october 18 2005 three additional hearings were held to review and consider regulatory relief proposals these hearings provided forum to offer new or updated proposals3 all four hearings featured testimony from federal regulators trade associations individual httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22212 institutions and consumer advocates since 2001 congress has been working with regulators and industry representatives on legislative proposals to reduce existing regulatory requirements and the compliance burdens they place on depository financial institutions the goal has been to identify outdated duplicative or ineffective regulations that are not justified by either the need to ensure safety and soundness or to provide consumer protection this legislation would also counterbalance new responsibilities placed on banks and thrifts by the antimoney laundering and the antiterrorist financing provisions of the 2001 usa patriot act pl 10756 witnesses at the hearings mainly addressed the institutions they represented or regulated the national credit union administration and credit union representatives testified at all four hearings testimony was supportive of hr 3505 but also encouraged congress to either incorporate all of the provisions of hr 2317 curia into the omnibus regulatory relief legislation or pass the bill separately several witnesses representing banks and savings associations expressed opposition to the capital and lending authority provisions of curia that were not included in hr 3505 in general their position is that credit unions should not be granted authorities which could enhance their competitive strength while continuing their exemption from federal income tax4 1 three provisions are identical to sections 301 303 and 305 of title iii of curia the fourth provision amends the statutory definition of net worth this is addressed in title i of curia and by both hr 3505 and hr 1042 please see this reports overview of the curia titles 2 the letter can be found at httpwwwicbaorg look under icba letters to capitol hill letter dated mar 1 2006 3 the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs held hearings on june 21 2005 and mar1 2006 and the house financial services subcommittee held hearing on may 12 2005 4 for discussion of this issue please see crs report 97548 should credit unions be taxed by james m bickley crs3 an overview of the curia titles the credit union regulatory improvements act of 2005 hr 2317 was introduced on may 12 2005 the legislation had 109 cosponsors by february 28 2006 the following is an overview of the bills three titles title i capital reform this title reforms the prompt corrective action pca system for federally insured credit unions5 after six years of experience with this congressionally mandated system the ncua is seeking adjustments that provide supervisory flexibility and incorporate more riskbased approach the objective of pca is to minimize the probability of credit union insolvency through early intervention by the federal regulator pca establishes net worth ratio framework that requires progressively more stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory actions for credit unions with low or declining net worth levels net worth is all of the credit unions retained earnings6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22212 curia would provide more flexibility to the current statutory requirements of the pca system the bill would reduce the standard net worth ratio requirement for credit unions to level comparable to what is required of institutions insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation the proposal includes more riskbased approach to credit union capital standards the legislation modifies the requirements for net worth restoration plans imposed by the ncua in addition the statutory definition of net worth would be amended to address potential problem raised by new merger guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board title ii economic growth this title amends the authority of federal credit unions to make member business loans many of the financial services provided by credit unions are similar to those offered by banks and thrifts but credit unions are distinguishable because of their cooperative framework and unique charter requirements individual credit unions are owned by their membership credit unions can make loans only to their members to other credit unions and to credit union organizations this title would enhance credit union member service and help to maintain credit union competitiveness by making adjustments to the statutory restrictions on member business loans currently the aggregate limit on credit unions net member business loan balances is the lesser of 175 times the credit unions net worth or 1225 of the credit unions total assets curia would replace this limitation with flat rate of 20 of the total assets of credit union in addition the legislation would exclude loans or loan participations to nonprofit religious organizations from the member business loan limit the definition of member business loan now excludes loans that are equal to or less than 50000 curia would amend the definition to exclude loans of 100000 or less 5 pca standards were mandated by pl 105219 12 usc 1790d 6 retained earnings normally includes undivided earnings regular reserves and any other appropriations of undivided earnings designated by management or regulatory authorities crs4 provisions of this title would also enhance the ability of credit unions to assist the economic revitalization efforts of distressed communities it would give credit union operating in an underserved community more flexibility in regards to the leasing of space in building or property in which the credit union maintains physical presence currently credit unions may lease space only if they have plans to take over the entire property title iii regulatory modernization the provisions of this title are very similar to the legislation passed by the house in 2004 hr 1375 108th congress an overview of each of the 12 sections is provided below section 301 leases of land on federal facilities for credit unions this section

facilities on the federal land httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22212 section 302 investments in securities by federal credit unions the investment authority of federal credit unions is limited by statute to loans government securities deposits in other financial institutions and certain other limited investments this may place them at competitive disadvantage with statechartered credit unions and other

investment grade the total amount of the investment securities of any one obligor or maker could not exceed 10 of an institutions net worth section 303 increase in general 12year limitation of term of federal credit union loans to 15 years federal credit unions are authorized to make loans to members other credit unions and to credit union organizations loans are restricted by statutory 12year

the groups forming multiple common bond charter are restricted to 3000 members under most circumstances this numerical limitation has been concern in voluntary mergers of multiple common bond credit

provide that this numerical limitation does not apply in voluntary mergers section 307 conversions involving common bond credit unions this section addresses voluntary mergers or conversions involving single or httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22212 multiple common bond credit union and community credit union credit union charters are granted by federal or state governments on the basis of common bond this

there are three types of federal credit union charters single common bond occupational and associational multiple common bond more than one group each having common bond of occupation or association and community community charters are required to be based on single geographically welldefined local community neighborhood or rural district this section would require the ncua to establish the criteria to use to determine that member group or other portion of credit unions existing membership located outside the community base can be satisfactorily served and remain within the newly constituted credit unions field of membership section 308 credit union governance this section deals with three separate issues it provides for the expulsion of federal credit union member for good

credit union administration with greater flexibility in responding to market conditions the rate of interest on loans made by federal credit union may not exceed 15 under most circumstances this section would permit the ncua to consider whether rising interest rates or the prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety and soundness of individual institutions when the agency debates lifting the usury ceiling section 310 credit union conversion voting requirements this section deals with the process credit union follows when it undertakes charter conversion to become mutual savings bank the ncua has expressed concern that the membership of the credit union needs to fully understand the effect conversion may have and therefore the importance of the memberships vote on

majority of those members who vote on the proposal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22212 section 311 exemption from premerger notification requirement of the clayton act this section would give all federally
