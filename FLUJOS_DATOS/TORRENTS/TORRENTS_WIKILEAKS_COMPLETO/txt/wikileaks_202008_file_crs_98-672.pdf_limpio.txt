august 11 1998 us intelligence and indias nuclear tests lessons learned richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division summary the us intelligence community did not have advance knowledge that india intended to conduct nuclear tests beginning on may 11 1998 although intelligence agencies cannot have foreknowledge of every significant development in world affairs many observers and senior intelligence officials believe that in view of the election of an indian government committed to inducting nuclear weapons much greater attention should have been given to indications of impending nuclear tests commission headed by retired admiral david jeremiah reviewed the intelligence communitys performance and recommended number of measures to improve future performance some of the most important of these were addressed in the fy1997 intelligence authorization act pl 104293 but implementing the legislation has been delayed as filling key positions has been delayed persisting problem is the tendency of analysts to discount seemingly irrational initiatives by other countries background the series of nuclear tests conducted by india beginning on may 11 1998 was not predicted by the us intelligence community although foreknowledge would not necessarily have enabled us policymakers to head off the explosions the absence of information has raised fundamental questions about the nations intelligence effort which will cost some 267 billion in fy 1998 defenders of the intelligence community point out that even though many in the public have come to expect constant coverage of all regions of the world resource s are finite information of adversary value is routinely hidden other concerns are pressing and south asian developments do not directly threaten us security most observersincluding members of congress and senior officials in intelligence agenciesagree nonetheless that the failure to have provided warning of the indian tests before they occurred was major lapse with significant implications for predicting nuclear developments in other countries and that actions must be taken to improve intelligence performance

report june 2 1998 reproduced at httpwwwodcigov indian nuclear policy1 india in previous surprise to the us intelligence community exploded its first nuclear device in 1974 from that time on proliferation experts realized that india has had the capability to explode nuclear weapons at any time in late 1995 us intelligence agencies detected preparations for nuclear test at pokharan site some 350 miles southwest of delhi leading to diplomatic representations that many observers credit with persuading the indian government to call off the explosions the protest also may have provided the indians insight into the capabilities of us intelligence collection efforts parliamentary elections conducted in februarymarch 1998 resulted in minority coalition government headed by prime minister atal behari vajpayee of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp whose election manifesto had included commitment to exercise the option to induct nuclear weapons it should be noted that all major indian parties are committed to maintaining nuclear option and that vajpayee who once served as foreign minister is considered moderate among bjp leaders the bjp government that took office in late march was soon made aware of international concerns about the possibility of nuclear testing and proliferatio n the american ambassador bill richardson in an april 14th meeting in new delhi and national security advisor samuel berger in subsequent washington meeting with the indian foreign minister underscored us opposition to nuclear testing and proliferation in response indian leaders indicated that precipitous actions were likely to be taken and that fullscale review of the countrys national security policies was underway the indians also made great efforts to avoid test preparations that would be readily detectable by overhead satellites the planning for tests was apparently kept within small circle of senior officials and ministers2 although the intelligence community monitored indian developments and scrutinized activities at pokharan on regular but not constant basis the official confirmation of indian tests at pokharan on may 11 caught us intelligence agencies by surprise director of central intelligence dci george tenet stated while the intelligence community has for years closely followed the indian nuclear program there is getting around the fact that we did not predict these particular indian nuclear tests we did not get it right period we have professional responsibility to stand up acknowledge that and learn from it3httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98672crs3 4 quoted in risen and weiner us may have helped indian hide its nuclear activity the lack of foresight was not limited to government officials for example writing

central intelligence agency 1994 p 178intelligence analysts as well as policylevel officials throughout the government shared the blame for failing to anticipate the tests phyllis oakley the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research was quoted as telling reporter after senate hearing look we were wrong we were all wrong4 members of congress were harshly critical of the lack of warning senator shelby chairman of the senate intelligence committee termed it colossal failure5 it was small comfort that the intelligence community was able to point to the likelihood of the pakistani tests that did occur in late may the inevitability of intelligence failures scholars who have studied intelligence history recognize that surprises can never be eliminated the modern intelligence community including the central intelligence agency cia arose in large measure out of the failure to anticipate the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 there have been nonetheless number of significant events since the end of world war ii for which there was little advance knowledge eg the north korean attack on south korea in 1950 the introduction of soviet nuclear missiles into cuba in 1962 and the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 the quantity of information available has varied in each case but like the attack on pearl harbor these intelligence failures resulted in part from analysts inability to realize that hostile countries pursue policies that appear illogical and counterproductive with mindset disposed to believe that potential action is irrational even almost unthinkable an analyst may ignore indicators that in retrospect make the action appear inevitable sherman kent who was for many years in charge of the preparation of national intelligence estimates wrote in the aftermath of his failure to detect the installation of soviet missiles in cuba in 1962 it is melancholy fact of life that man will often blind himself to truth by going for the comforting hypothesis by eschewing the painful6 in the end surprises may not achieve their ultimate aims there is usually escape from the hard realities of capabilities and resourcesthe attack on pearl harbor after all was colossal strategic error that ultimately led to the total defeat of imperial japan nevertheless the intelligence community was created to prevent future pearl harbors and that is still its main mission analysts studying india which has never been at the center of us security concerns may also have to overcome some unconscious biases india as the worlds largest democracy and nonparticipant in most of the cold war garnered certain amount of uncritical sympathy from western academicians who have trained intelligence analysts some observers suspect among intelligence officers an institutional bias in favor of indiashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98672crs4 7 see jonathan medalia indian and pakistani nuclear tests potential test ban risks and technical benefits crs report 96631f july 17 1996 8 the comments by admiral jeremiah quoted herein are taken from the transcript of the jeremiah news conference of june 2 1998 reproduced at httpwwwodcigov policies that derives from the work of the cias predecessor organization the office of strategic services many of whose officers gave tacit and overt support to the indian independence movement during world war ii balanced against such difficulties however are the facts that nuclear proliferation is one of the highest concerns of the us government that the basic parameters of the indian nuclear program were well known7 and that an indian government had just come into office with hesitancy about inducting nuclear weapons into its strategic arsenal it is clearadmittedly with 2020 hindsightthat more collection efforts should have been directed to the nuclear test site and that analysts and policymakers should have had better sense of the dynamics of indian politics and delhis international ambitions the jeremiah report in the wake of widespread concern about the indian tests dci tenet appointed committee headed by retired vice admiral david jeremiah who had previously served as vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to assess the intelligence communitys performance and report back within 10 days although the jeremiah report has not been made public its major conclusions were discussed in june 2 1998 press conference8 it made recommendations in four principal areas analytical practices manpower and training collection processes organization to ameliorate the mindset problem jeremiah recommended that the intelligence community use outside regional experts in more systematic fashion to ensure that government analysts are kept abreast of the latest work by academic and other nongovernmental specialists it was further suggested that experts in the process of analysis be brought in to encourage consideration of contrarian hypotheses the report also recommended the establishment of mechanisms to guarantee stronger integration of analysis from different agencies and disciplines in regard to collection jeremiah acknowledged an imbalance between the intelligence communitys ability to collect imagery and the ability to read and analyze it in everyday language that means there is an awful lot of stuff on the cutting room floor at the end of the day that we have not seen observers consider this imbalance to be fundamental problem of intelligence community management that has yet to be effectively addressed it is perversely easier to justify expensive collection programs that produce vast quantities of data than more analysts to review and report the information obtained in addition it is difficult to have an adequate number of collectors and analysts skilled in the foreign languages that become important at specific times technical specialists with advanced academic training related to sophisticated collection andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98672crs5 9 tenet press statement june 2 1998communications systems may be able to command salaries that cannot be matched by government agencies observers have suggested greater use of outside experts and even reserve military personnel jeremiah also addressed the need to coordinate collection systems more effectively imagery signals intelligence human intelligence including diplomatic reporting and other disciplines along with open sources press television etc yield the evidence on which analysts base their work separate us agencies manage different types of collection systems and it is administratively challenging to ensure that information on important topics is collected by the most appropriate collection means the jeremiah committee review concluded that the organization of the intelligence community needs to be examined thoroughly to assess the process by which responsibilities are assigned and resources allocated and whether resources are adequate dci tenet indicated his approval of the review stating that i accept all of admiral jeremiahs recommendations i am making it my highest priority to implement them as quickly as possible9 coordinating intelligence efforts many of the conclusions of the jeremiah committee are consistent with recommendations made in 1996 by two wideranging reviews viz the house intelligence committees staff study ic21 intelligence community in the 21st century and the report of the commission on roles and missions of the intelligence community usually known as the aspinbrown commission after its two chairmen the late aspin and harold brown both former secretaries of defense the fundamental conclusion of these reviews was that there should be better coordination by the dci of the various agencies that comprise the intelligence community but without fullscale unification in practice it has proven very difficult for dcis to exercise coordinative responsibilities in part this reflects the diverse priorities of individual dcis some of whom devoted considerable attention to covert operations or to participating in the policy deliberations of the national security council it is however also reflective of an absence of communitywide mechanisms based on statutes that give the dci the ability to mandate effectivel pressure or at least strongly encourage cooperation among the different agencies for many years the only communitywide officials were the dci and the deputy dci both of whom allocated most of their time to the cia itself the fundamental reality of the intelligence community has been the fact that the dci does not have line authority over agencies other than the cia in particular he does not have operational control of the large defense department intelligence agencies such as the defense intelligence agency the national reconnaissance office the national imagery and mapping agency and the national security agency amendments over the years to the national security act of 1947 gave the dci some authority to coordinate the work of all agencies and to establish standards and priorities in reality however budgets of dod agencies are controlled by the secretary of defense and their operations are heavily influenced by the pressing needs of military commanders number of legislativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98672crs6 10 see richard best jr intelligence reorganization in the 104th congress prospects for more corporate community crs report 96681f september 13 1996initiatives have been introduced to give dcis the authority to execute budgets and exercise line authority but according to many observers congress has chosen not to do so as result of the close operational nexus between dod agencies and the military services some members of congress however continue to believe that the dci should have authority to execute the intelligence budget even for agencies in the defense department enacted in the aftermath of the ic21 study and the aspinbrown report title viii of the intelligence authorization act for fy1997 pl 104293 included provisions designed to strengthen the authority of the dci10 the dci was given greater authority to develop annual budgets for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities he was also given statutory authority to approve collection requirements and priorities and to resolve conflicts in collection priorities additional positions requiring senate confirmation were created deputy dci for community management and three assistant dcisfor collection for analysis and production and for administration the changes envisioned by the fy1997 act were not implemented quickly in late 1996 dci john deutch resigned subsequently there was protracted confirmation process that resulted in george tenet not being sworn in until july 1997 in addition the administration and some members of congress strongly opposed the requirement that the three new assistant dcis be confirmed by the senate as result of this disagreement the first deputy dci for community managementjoan dempsey career intelligence professionalwas not confirmed until may 1998 and assistant dcis have only recently been appointed it being agreed that they will serve for year without senate confirmation many observers believe that sufficient statutory authority now exists to enable the dci to create more corporate and better coordinated intelligence community even if it is not consolidated single entity under his direct control according to this view the problems reflected in the failure to anticipate the indian nuclear tests give dci tenet the opportunity to align collection and analytical resources more effectively and to demonstrate whether or not additional statutory authority might be required conclusions the failure to predict the indian nuclear tests of may 1998 provides an opportunity to review the priorities and capabilities of the intelligence community and to implement legislation signed in october 1996 that gives the dci more specific authorities and additional staff to manage the national intelligence effort out of this review and the implementation process may emerge consensus for further legislative initiatives more intractable problem are the mental biases of analysts who often downplay unpredictable and in their view irrational and counterproductive undertakings by foreign countries efforts to introduce outside expertise into the intelligence process and to encourage contrarian analyzes may help but the challenge to overcome the constraints of analysts own mindsets or the consensus of an agency will likely remain
