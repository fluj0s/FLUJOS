forces of an enemy nationstate th terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 illustrate however that small groups of nonstate actors can exploit relatively inexpensive and commercially available technology to conduct very destructive attacks over great distances todays us armed forces were deve loped principally with stateonstate conflict in mind combating nonstate actors however presents number of distinct challenges in terms of operations cost and mindset nonstate actors generally strive to hide within civilian populations while us policy makers typically seek quick and decisive victories nonstate actors seek protract ed war nonstate actors often employ cheap commercia lly available weapons that often result in expensive responses by the united states many of the weapons and methods employed today by us armed forces can be used against nonstate actors some how ever are more directly applicable than others us experience in conducting cl ose air support cas employing special operations forces sof and advising fri endly governments in using aviation to defend themselves from insurgents and rrorists may form basis for building capabilities against nonstate actors pursuing objectives against nonstate act ors while winning the hearts and minds of local populations or at least not alienating them appears to be key consideration recent military action has k illed or captured prominent terrorists but it is unclear whether this action actually degraded the terrorist organizations capabilities in some cases these actions may have even strengthened them there is consensus view that airpower is one of the united states great military advantages some are increasingly concerned however that military aviation is focused too much on the demands of fi ghting conventional fo to the detriment of irregular warfare also called mootwa military operations other than war and that the department of defense dod must reshape its aviation forces to increase their relevance in small wars while maintaining the capability to win major conflicts determination of dod needs for comba ting nonstate actors and fielding more relevant forces raises number of ac quisition issues some argue that dods overall acquisition priorities are still too oriented toward large high tech acquisition programs most applicable to fighting or deterring peer competitor in stateonstate conflict equa lly important however are the mindset changes that may be required to transition to force equally adept at fighting conventional and non conventional foes these mindset

the united states has not faced true peer milita ry competitor since the soviet union disintegrated recent conflicts such as panama libya iraq desert storm bosnia kosovo afghanistan and iraq iraqi freedom illustrate that us armed forces have proven very effective at achieving classi c military objectives against other countries armed forces in variety of circumstances achieving politically significant military objectives against nonstate actors includi ng terrorists and insurgents has proven more difficult1 in the past combating nonstate actors was seen by many to be lesser included case nonstate actors appeared to be less threatening to national security than the well funded well or ganized and much more milita rily potent armed forces of an enemy nationstate if for example the us military was deemed adequate to deter or defeat the soviet military then it was also deemed adequate to combat non state actors the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 graphically illustrate however that small groups of nonstate actors can explo it relatively inexpens ive and commercially available technology to conduc t very destructive attack s over great distances few observers today consider nonstate actors to be lesser included case increasingly it is recognized that in many cases co mbating nonstate actors presents different and in many cases greater set of challenges than combating conventional military foe senior decision makers have number of tools at their disposal to attempt to find identify track capture neutralize or kill terrorists and other nonstate actors

fiel ded today were organized trained and equipped principally with conventional stat eonstate warfare in mind senior leaders in the department of defense dod appear to appreciate the dis tinct challenges that combating nonstate actors present however nd are taking steps to ensure that these challenges are reflected in longterm military plans programs and policies in the spring of 2004 dods 2006 strategic planning guidance found that the us is well positioned to deal with c onventional military adve rsary increasingly however the us may find itself facing nonconventional foes for which it is not well prepared2 further it has been reported that dod leadership has instructed regional combatant commanders to develop and maintain new war plans designed to reduce the chance of postwar instability like the situation in iraq3 based on these plans some predicted that the 2005 qu adrennial defense re view qdr could upend us military procurement plans as pentagon officials shift their

divided into three categories operational challenges mindset ch allenges and cost challenges operational challenges compared to the armed forces of nation state nonstate actors are easy to def eat in direct combat n onstate actors typically lack the equipment training and discipline that define military service actually engaging in direct combat with nonstat actors is the core operational challenge nonstate actors typically dont wear unifo rms indeed they generally strive to integrate themselves into the local civ ilian population thus target identification is very challenging nonstate actors rarely mass into easily recognizable formations they typically lack large infrastructure or obvious logistics processes therefore nonstate actors present few high value targ ets for us forces this challenge has not been lost on dod l eadership for example for many years though theres been concern that intelligence collection capability basically rested in the ability to find tank or an artillery piece hiding in grove of trees the problem now be comes how to find individuals hiding in groups of peoplethis presen ts huge problem for us6 the leadership and structur of nonstate organizations such as qaeda are opaque such organizations might be di ffuse and operate over long distances qaeda for example often operates thr ough partner organizations which might be small and have fluid leadership one dod l eader has said when we kill or capture one of these leaders another one steps in and quickly takes their place7 therefore even characterizing the nonst ate actor target can be di fficult for military planners once identified nonstate actors are often difficult to engage due to concerns over collateral damage even conventional stateonstate c onflict presents collateral damage concerns when one party is ac tively trying to shield itself behind non combatants however delivering weapons effects with extreme precision takes on increased importance rand study summed up the operati onal challenges ferreting out individuals or small groups of terrorists positively identifying them and engaging them without harming nearby civilians is an extremely demanding task substantial improvements will be needed in several areas before the air force can be confident of be ing able to provide this capability to combatant commanders8 mindset challenges successfully combating nonstate actors will likely require different training tactics doctrine political strategies and potentially rules of engagement than are optimal for conven tional military warfare

of preemptive military force by richard f grimmett for more indepth discussion of this topicchanges may combine to require different politicomilitary mindset for senior decision makers the us military policy makers and the general population desire short conflicts with clear success criteria exit strategies and decisive victories in conventional setting victo ry typically entailed an adversarys unconditional surrender but nonstate actors may define victory as not losing their continued existence is victory th is mindset characterizes seve ral palestinian terrorist groups that fought israels occupation of pale stinian territories in most cases they themselves cannot achieve ra pid decisive victory so they follow strategy of protracted war according to one schol ar insurgent terrorist and criminal organizations consciously design themselves so that our military and police forces cannot rapidly and decisively defeat them9 others note that even dying for their cause intentionally or voluntarily is percei ved as victory for terrorists its different paradigm than the traditional military concern for limiting casualties10 this is characteristic of groups such as hamas and qaeda that employ suicide tactics the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 may require and may have already initiated change in mindset regarding what level of threat should trigger us military action fear that terrorists or ot her nonstate actors may acquire weapon of mass destruction nuclear biologi cal or chemical weapon has engendered debate on preemptive or preventative em ployment of us armed forces while many would support preemptive attack to obviate an imminent attack on us interests the definition of what qualifies as imminent is highly debatable11 further preventing insurgent victory ove r friendly government may not be enough to prevent this threat instead the united st ates will likely desire to prevent nonstate actors from taking over large portions of nationstates because these territories could be used to train terrorists and initiate attacks at global distances the recent reported discovery of an insurgent chemical wea pons lab in fallujah iraq exemplifies this threat in conventional warfare setting arme d forces typically attempt to avoid civilians or shield them from the wars consequences when combating nonstate actors however civilians may need to be engaged at an unprecedented level winning the hearts and minds of the cal populati on or at least not alienating them could become large part of the ove rall counter insurgent or counter terrorist

almost by definition nonstate actors employ weapons and methods that are inexpensive when compared to training equipping and employing military force however the cost to defend against nonstate actors or to combat them can be high for example terrorists can acquire manportable air defense systems manpads for as little as 5000 if terrorist succeeded in shooting down commercial airliner with this shoulderfired missile the immediate cost of losing the airplane would be over 100 million and the indirect costs much higher further fielding technologies on commercial aircraft to defend against this threat could cost the united states 10 billion in acquisition costs alone14 identifying and fielding systems and methods that can combat terrorists cost effectively will likely be an important challenge to overcome aviation activities highly applicable to combating nonstate actors given the right context virtually every military aviation asset or activity can be used to combat nonstate actors yet some are more directly applicable than others close air support cas close air support cas is military aviation mission that appears highly relevant to the nonstate actor challenge dod

or insurgent leaders has gained public prominence since the septembe r 11 2001 attacks on the united states although their use did not necessarily origin ate with september 11 or with the united states since the september 11 attacks u s forces appear to be making increased use of air power in antiterrorist missi ons us forces ve conducted several successful strikes on senior figures or allies of th qaeda organization on the other hand the effectiveness of airpower in an antiterrorism anti insurgent mission is not unquestioned and it is difficult to compare the effect of air strikes in comparison to other antiterrorist methods for example several senior qaeda operatives have not been killed in us air strikes but have instead been captured in police or intelligence operations by allied law enforcement services the most prominent of such captures was the rrest of senior qaeda operative khalid shaykh mohammad by pakistani officers reportedly working with us intelligence in march 2003 some might argue that the arrest of khalid shaykh the organizations most senior terrorist pl anner and the reputed architect of the september 11 attacks damaged qaedas operating ability more than any air strike against any other qaeda leader another senior operative reputed to be khalid shayks replacement abu faraj allibi was captured in small town mardan about 70 miles north west of pakistans capita l islamabad in march 2005 other qaeda fighters and operatives were reportedly captured in us ground operations in afghanistan an example is of the egyptian cleric umar abd rahman convicted of terrori st plots related to the 1993 bombing of the world trade center the ahmed abd alrahman reportedly was killed fighting alongside taliban forces in battle against us troops in november 2001 during the major combat phase of operation enduring freedom30 another major question is to what to attribute the success of any given anti terrorist air operation the success of ai r strikes on terrorist leaders and groups appears to depend in large measure on the development and timely exploitation of precise intelligence on the location and movements of these individuals as noted in the examples below thos strikes that have been ccessful have generally beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32737crs10 31 hanley charles targeting leaders may not end terrorism experts say st louis

acquisition of precise actionable intelligence on terrorist individuals whereabouts broader question is whether or not successful attack on an individual terrorist leader whether by air power or any other means contributes to the overarching goal of reducing terrorist operations by the ta rgeted group that broader question is significant but difficult to measure terrorist organizations effectiveness might be redu ced by many different vari ables reduction in popular commitment to its cause deaths of its leaders due to other causes including arrests or natural causes splits within the orga nization economic impr ovement in the areas where the group operates the availability of senior operatives to replace those killed and an almost infinite number of other variab it could be argued that if other variables remain constant the effect of targeted strike on an individual terrorist or insurgent group appears to depend in some measure on the breadth of terroristinsurgent organizations leadership and the capabilities of its less senior operatives some experts say that ethni c or territorial based groups are somewhat more resilient to the deaths of key leaders than are ideologybased organizations31 another argument is that some us strikes cause collateral damage causing somecivilians to resent us operations and perhaps give aid and comfort to the terrorist or insurgent organizations the following represent specific us or allied country use of air power in anti terrorist or antiinsurgent missions and analys is of the effect of those strikes on the group to which the target individual belonged one of the first uses of us air power in an antiterrorism mission was the april 1980 attempt to rescue the us diplomats and other americans held hostage by the re volutionary government in iran32 the mission involved six fuel and equipmentcarrying c130 aircraft meeting up with eight carrierlaunc hed sea stallion helicopters at remote iranian desert landing strip called desert one the plan was for the helicopters to fly us commandos to tehran where they would raid facilities holding the us hostages free them and return to desert one for evacuation however three sea stallions developed mechanical pr oblems at desert one possibly due to the intake of sand into the engines and the mission was aborted there before flying to tehran the sty abortion of the mission in the iranian desert resulted in collision among aircraft that killed eight us military personnel hostage s were rescued the failure of the mission caused the joint chiefs of staff and other defense department and government organs to assign higher priority to the study and implementation of unconventional wa rfare and the strengthening of special operations forces spanning all us

aircraft forced the egypt air plane to land in italy where the terrorists were taken into custody by italian authorities abbas was released by italian authorities due to lack of evid ence but in 1986 he was tried in absentia in italy convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment he later threw his support behind israelipalestinian negotiations and lived out his life mostly in baghdad where he was captured by us invasion forces in april 2003 while in us custody he died ostensibly of natural causes in march 2004 in probably the most widely noted air strike connected with the september 11 attacks in novemb er 2001 an armed us predator drone supplemented by us co mbat aircraft killed mohammad atef the number three leader of qaeda behind osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri his location was pinpointed when taliban defector told us special forces in afghanistan where he would be33 and the site was surveyed by the circling predator immediately before and after the strike34 atefs death almost certainly represented blow to the qaeda leadership structure he had been associated with bin laden for the prior ten years his daughter married bin ladens in early 2001 and atef was allegedly responsible for planning antius operations in somalia in 1993 and possibly the two bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania in august 1998 however it is difficult to fix precisely the degradation in qaedas capabilities that resulted from atefs death in comparison with the other us and allied operations against qaeda and with other factors such as the loss of afghanistan as base of

israel used hellfire missile launched from an ah64 apache helicopter to kill then leader of lebanese hizballah abbas musawi as he dr ove in motorcade through south lebanon hizballah shiite islamis t militia backed by iran and syria had become the most active opponent of israels military presence in south lebanon which began with israels invasion of lebanon in 1982 and ended with isr aels unilateral withdrawal in may 2000 it was believed res ponsible for the october 1983 bombing of the us marine barr acks in beirut as well as the holding of us civilian hosta ges in lebanon during 19841991 and is classified as terrorist organization by the united states however the killing of abbas musawi did not materially diminish hizballahs capabilities and the st rike on him apparently provoked significant retaliation in the march 1992 bombing allegedly by hizballah of israels embassy in buenos aires us report on terrorism state department p atterns of global terrorism 2003 states

during 2004 many attribute that obser vation not to israels targeted killings but to fence structure israel has been building which makes it difficult for hamas and other militants to cross from the occupied territories into israel proper although hamas institutional capabilities apparently have not been crippled by these targeted strikes neither did th strikes produce large sustained popular palestinian unrest against israel one of israels early uses of targeted killing incorporated air power in support role in april 1988 an israeli commando team conducted seaborne raid on t unis beachfront villa inhabited by senior plo military commander khalil wazir abu jihad he was killed in the raid accord ing to detailed published accounts of the operation43 two boeing 707s outfitted with advanced electronic gear flew overhead during the ra id to conduct electronic warfare and to keep the commando team in communication with the israeli defense ministry in tel aviv ot her israeli aircraft protected the israeli sea craft during the four day voyage to tunis and then back in addition israeli helicopters were aboard larger ship off the tunisian coast to assist the raiding party if need be they reportedly were not used the implications of the operation against khalil wazir are matter of speculation some might argue that at the time of this killing the plo was already undergoing reassessment that would lead plo leader yasir arafat in december 1988 to renounce terrorism and recognize israel s right to exist shift that led five years later to mutual recognition between the plo and israel and to negotiations to re solve their outstanding conflicts some might argue that arafat was shaken by israels ability to strike the senior plo leadership in an operation so far from israels borders and that the raid might have prompted arafat to more quickly abandon the plos use of terrorism and opposition to negotiations with israel others believe that khalil wazir was highly

military advantages some are increasingly concerned however that military aviation is focused too much on th demands of fighting conventional foes to the detriment of irregular warfare and that the challenge for the air force is to reshape its forces to increase their relevance in small wars while maintaining the capability to win major conflicts45 some argue that dods overall acquis ition priorities are still too oriented toward large high tech acquisition programs most applicable to fighting or deterring peer competitor in stateonst ate conflict within aviation systems might include advanced fighter aircraft or highly specialized aircraft such as radar jammers others argue that these kind of platforms are still required for stateonstate conflict despite us preeminence in this area and that new concepts of operation new organizational schema or technology upgrades may increase these systems applicability to nonstate actor challenges in worst case scenario this underfo cus

argument that many in dod lack clear understanding of how airpower can contribute to irregular warfare for example soon after the armys 3rd infantry division captured baghdad the division released its air force air support operati ons squadron to redeploy believing that the airliaison element had nothing to offe r at that point worse yet the airmen left because they were not sure how airpower and space power could contribute47 this apparently premature dismantling of formal airground coordination appears to have been mirrored at higher levels as th war in iraq appeared increasingly likely the air force created new headquarter s organization called the air component coordination element acce by all acc ounts the acce functioned effectively and was largely responsible for smooth c oordination of ground and aviation forces but the acce was dissolved in late april 2003 as major combat operations drew to close48 it appears that the experiences in afghanistan and iraq are stimulating military leaders to reexamine how ground combat is conducted it was re ported in november 2004 that for the first time in decades the army has issued field guide to counterinsurgency warfare an acknowledgment that the kind of fighting under way in iraq may become more common in the years ahead49 in 2004 the marine corps appended its small wars manual which was published in 1940 reexamination of dods airpower mindset appears timely and may be critical to successfully combating nonstate actors in the future policy makers face the questions of th desirability of helping dod reorient its airpower activities toward greater emphasis on combating nonstate actors and the means of accomplishing this reorienta tion this report explores these questions by evaluating potential

compared to more expensive manned aircraft or satellite systems new generations of sensors may be needed to fly on these sensor platforms to improve the ability of us forces to det ect and monitor the activities of small groups of enemy combatants for example new synthetic aperture radar sar that operates simultaneously in uhf and vhf to det ect stationary targets under trees or camouflage would clearly be useful57 if they are to survive however nonstat actors know that they must not remain stationary therefore us radars with ground moving target indicators gmti are valuable gmti radars have been used in by us forces in combat since 1991 and against nonstate actors in afghanistan nd iraq while gmti radars have proven useful in detecting and targ eting small groups of irregula rs some shortcomings have been noted for example the number of gmti assets was insufficient to provide desired coverage also lack of optimal base access reduced the availability of gmti assets finally it was

comparatively simple sensors with direct application to antiterrorism activities compared to larg er more sophisticated and expensive sensors detecting small groups of people can be difficult but distinguishing enemy combatants from noncombatants can in many scenarios be extremely difficult gathering and exploiting actionable intelligence is key part of this challenge some have argued that the us militarys intelligence training and collection must concentrate more on understanding criminal terrorist and in surgent networks even if this means putting less emphasis on the traditional st rengths of our military intelligence such as determining the conventional ground order of battle and targeting power grids and transportation networks61 it has been reported that dod has initiate d major program to develop new intelligence devices for tagging tracking and locating potential insurgent leaders and terrorists62 the details of this effort are currently unclear however it is likely that any effort to improve the ability to differentiate terrorists from civilians track them and target them will employ multiple airborne sensor and intelligence assets these techniques could be exploited to more effectively attack small groups or individuals or in law enforcemen t capture and arrest operations as mentioned earlier one criticism that has been levied on those in dod responsible for acquisition deci sions has been that they overly emphasize large cold warstyle programs or try to apply these programs to the antiterrorism mission when less hightech solutions may

when terminal air controllers have identified targets and supplied target coordinates to attack platforms at least three acquisition issues pertain to better enabling these personnel first the gao and

battlefield air operations bao k its that these personnel use typically composed of navigation equipment com puters communication gear night vision goggles laser range finders and batteries weigh on the order of 160 lbs reducing the weight of this equipment would do much to increase terminal controller mobility with potential benefits for survivability and maintainability68 third move away from voice only communications to machinetomachine datalinks may allow terminal air controllers to pass target coordinates directly from handheld target designators to strike aircra ft some assert that this improvement alone could reduce the required time to attack fleeting targets from an average of 30 minutes to less than five minutes69 while these improvements to sof and terminal air controllers equipment could potentially increase their effectiveness they will likely remain relatively specialized and scarce resources increasing the priority of many battle management programs that fall under the rubric of network centric warfare n cw may prove beneficial to detecting identifying tracking and ta rgeting fleeting groups of nonstate actors70 many of these programs such as the affordable moving surface target engagement amste or the advanced tactical targ eting technology at3 programs seek to distribute sensing and targeting functions among network of multi mission aircraft rather than centralizing these functions on highly specialized and expensive aircraft71 emphasizing these kinds of battle management technologies may speed up decision making against fleeting targets and may

survivability include developing more effective defensive countermeasures and decoys fielding new weapons that could maintain the ac130s precision and fi re power but at gr eater distance and increased collaboration with uavs to enable increased situational awareness for ac 130 crews some techniques to reduce the ac130s infrared i r electro optical eo and acoustic signature may also be pursued but the benefits of these techniques is questionable due to the ac 130s large size and slow speed which make the aircraft highly visible new and more capable aircraft upon whic h future gunship could conceivably be based include the c17 an ac17 could fly faster nd higher than the ac130 and its larger size could accommodate more and different types of wea pons whether this option would be cost effective is unclear air force estimates put the cost of the standard c130j hercules trans port at approxima tely 50 million82 however the ac130u which includes wea pons targeting systems and other upgrades is priced at 190 million per aircraft83 the c17 without any modi fications for weapons or targeting systems costs approximately 191 million each84 using the same rough cost difference between the c130 and the ac130 suggests that an ac17 could cost 340 million each 140 million more than the c17 replacing the ac130 with some numbe r of uavs appears the most radical potential program but perhaps most co mpatible with other air force and dod efforts to develop network centric pproaches to warfare the number and capabilities of these uavs are being studied and will likely be driven much by the maturation of technologies th at will give uavs more autonomy than they currently possess or allow single remote operator to control multiple aircraft85 final issue

unless coordinated closely however modernizing sof aircraft could incur increased om as well as new procurement costs the air forces csarx for example is expected to cost 6 billion to procure 194 new aircraft om costs are not known because the csarx is still notional the hh60g that it will replace however is 87 common with army h60 helicopters dod achieves or should achieve important economies of scale savings in operating large fleets of highly common systems such as h60 helicopters replacing the hh60 with new helicopter might not just incur 6 billion in new spending but could also increase om costs if new aircraft are unnecessarily dissimilar to others in the inventory another cost issue is what impact these relatively expensive programs may have on dods top line budget might they b

have direct impact on sofrelated insertionextraction aircraft by reducing funds driving up co sts or potentially cancelling programs proponents justify many of the programs described bove by the perception that todays aircraft are increasingly vulnerable to growing threats the air force and outside analysts often point out that ma ny countries have access to rfacetoair missiles sams and information technol ogies that can be combined to form integrated air defense systems iads the potential proliferation of iads is one of the primary justifications put forth for developing and fielding advanced combat aircraft like the fa22 raptor108 it is not clear to others however that iads will be as threatening to lowflying helicopters already fielding selfprotection equipment as they

other aircraft could more freely operate it also appears that there may be different perspectives among the services regarding the vulnerability of todays helicopters the air force for example seeks the csarx in part because it is said to be more survivable than the hh60 helicopters it will replace110 however army special operations forces initiated service life extension program slep in 2004 for all their h60 aircraft this suggests that army leaders believe that h60 helicopters are sufficiently survivable albeit with upgrades and dont require near term replacement advanced integrated air defense systems iads will be fielded exclusively by nation states not nonstate actors nonst ate actors will likely rely instead on man portable or vehiclemounted and easily tran sportable air defense systems nonstate actors will also tend to field those systems that they can easily access not necessarily the most advanced systems thus if iads are sufficiently threatening to justify new sof helicopters it may only be in the context of conflicts with states that sponsor terrorism rather than in conflicts with terrorists or insurgents themselves command control and communications c3

communications employing air assets in these scenarios could be facilitated by command and control aircraft dedicated to matching ground forces requests for air support including the attack of

said that approximately 450 uavs were operating in iraq and that there may be need to better organize such large fleet121 weapons nonstate actors tend to offer smaller softer targets than military actors and they often shield themselves behind civilians or civilian infrastructure eg hospitals schools religious and cultura l sites the applicab ility of smaller less destructive ordnance against

increase the precision of weapon guidance are likely applicable to targeting nonstate actors developing smaller ordnance increasing the aerial employment of guns developing retarge table munitions and

bombs may also be worth exploring these weapons have been used in recent conflic ts where collateral da mage was concern however because the nonexploding bomb w ould often ricochet and skip far from the target it was often not effective either at destroying the target or in limiting collateral damage124 some suggest that some sort of nonexplosive disintegrated kinetic device that would hit the target like 50lb sandbag at terminal velocity killing an individualbut leaving only cl oud of dust as collateral damage would be worth investigation125 better or more pervasive employment of aircraft guns may offer the accuracy and low yield that operational planners desire when attacking nonstate actors current aircraft guns range from relativel modest 50 caliber machine guns to very powerful 105mm cannons these weapons can destroy vehicles and cause serious damage to buildings but do not produce th blast and fragmentation of aerial bombs that contribute to collateral damage two improvements may be considered to increase the applicability of using aerial guns against nonstate actors the fi rst effort would be to reduce the chances of bullets ricocheting which could cause unintended damage to illustrate the potential effects of ricochet when combat aircraft tr ain in airtoground strafing safety officers anticipate potential ricochets in an area as large as 50 square kilometers these effects could cause considerable collateral damage in an urban setting inert aircraft rounds are being developed that ar said to reduce the chances of ricochet by 90 percent and the range of rounds that do ricochet to 10 square kilometers126 currently aerial guns are most effectiv against ground targets when the aircraft flies at relatively low altit udes where the aircraft is vulnerable to ground fire another improvement would be to develop firecontrol so ftware that would provide accurate fire solutions for strafing at safe altitudes127 ground forces anticipating

impairing these func tions eg interdicting communications destroying radars and other sensors isolating c2 elemen ts airpower planners hope to achieve rapid and decisive strategic effect on the

this is because classic air doctrine calls for operations that are planned and controlled centrally but executed in decentr alized manner this golden rule seeks to maintain unity of command while allowing improvisation by those directly engaged in combat air force doctrine dictates that air force assets be centrally commanded and controlled even when figh ting terrorists and irregular

closely emulate law enforcement activities which are locally planned and executed136 one approach to decentralizing ai r operations against nonstate actors particularly in the area of close air support cas would be to coordinate air and ground forces at lower levels of organizati on than is currently practiced coordination at lowers levels can take place both within and between services it appears that steps are being taken by the army for instance to coordinate air and ground operations at lower command leve ls traditionally much of the armys aviation was found at the corps level acco

deploying uavs among the armys or the marine corps smallest ground its could facilitate the detection and targeting of nonstate actors as well as communication with larger ground units army or marine corps uavs could so potentially replace or augment manned aviation performing such roles as tactical ai rlift or medical resupply by owing and controlling these resources themselves sm all ground units may be able to employ them more fluidly and responsively to the anticipated tactical situation than would aircraft controlled by hi gher echelons of forces much operational air and ground coordination between the services such as between the army and the air force tends to occur at the battalion level and higher tactical air control parties tacps are typically composed of an air force officer who coordinates with the army battalions operations officer and three airmen three of the four have received extensive training to coordinate and control air strikes in support of ground forces many ve suggested that tacps be embedded in army units smaller than the battali on such as companies or perhaps even platoons regularly integrating air cont rollers into lower levels or army organizations would require additional personnel than curre ntly are trained for this mission while this integration could he lp decentralize airtoground coordination and facilitate airground for ces coordination which service would provide these additional air controllers is not clear the army is reportedly interested in increasing the training its artillery fire support officers receive to

prefer to satisfy the armys need for additional controllers by increasing the number of air force air controllers140 according to press reports air force officials are skeptical about turning over the mission to army troops air force controllers who get five years of training have to juggle as many as dozen planes each carrying different kinds of bombs with different capabilities air force officials question wh ether there are enough planes in their arsenal to train more army controllers141 some air force air controllers point out that profound cultural differences exist between how the army and the air force perceives airpower and that army air controllers may not employ ai rcraft as effectively as air force air controllers even if trained to the same standards142 the marine corps appears to be facing similar problem shortage of air controllers to meet the needs of companysized and smaller units to increase the number of air controllers the marine corps allowed nonaviators to train for this mission143 in october 2004 the air force announced the creation of joint airground operations jago office that would serv as focal point for this mission area while this appears welcome step the j agos stated goals for both the near and medium time frame were technology impr ovements not the more difficult but potentially equally valuab doctrinal considera tions described above144 speedy resolution of how best to increase the number of air controllers or otherwise encourage the decentralization of airgr ound operations may require oversight from senior decision makers direct action vs supporting or advisory activities the question confronting policy makers is how much emphasis should be placed on involving airpower directly against nonstate actors compared to advising and supporting allied airpower activities or llocating resources mainly to ground units and security personnel searching for terrorist leaders exploring and re solving this question could have profound impact on procuremen t training and om budgets one challenge for air forces engaged in direct action agai nst nonstate actors is that they often operate in politically charged environments where their presence can exacerbate tensions between governments fri endly toward the united states and local populations that may be sympathetic to terrorists in its field manual

government and risks converting the conflic t into usonly war that combat role can also further alienate cultures that are hostile to the us145 another consideration is th at directly engaging nonstate actors in many cases requires highly specialized equipment such as mh53j pave low helicopters as just one example this equipment tends to be expensive and currently of limited quantity personnel also tend to be highly traine d and in limited quantity the marine corps notes for example that due to adverse operational conditi ons and the need to often act independently fighting nonstate actors requires large percentage of seasoned and highly trained pilots146 these specialized forces are required in some number for action against conventional foes but growing need to combat nonstate actors might stress the current force structur or demand that it be increased the need for indirect invol vement of military aviation such as aviation foreign internal defense afid in conflicts with nonstate actors is widely accepted one observer asserts that one of the most important roles that us forces can play in the fight against terrorist groups is to train dvise and assist the fo rces of other nations in counterinsurgency and counterterrorist operations147 also strengthening friendlynation airpower eg philippine military air forces engaged in conflicts with muslim insurgents could reduce the chances that us forces would have to get directly involved further if us forces do have to get direc tly involved good afid will likely increase the options available us commanders by providing more competent coalition partners148 some argue that dod already overempha sizes direct action against nonstate actors for example one observer writes that the specialization of afsof aircraft such as the ac130 mc130 mh53j and now the cv22 reflects the emphasis on di rectaction making them particularly expensive complex and logistically demanding if it is the tendency for conventional aviators to think in terms of hightech conventional platforms then it should come as surprise that speci operations aviators similarly think almost exclusively in terms of their own specialized platforms149 those that advocate increasing supporting air power functions such as advising allies in aviation foreign internal defense argu that afid is consistent with underlying national strategy for example when the 6th special operations squadron was being established the goal was to create unit capable of supporting then defense secretary dick cheney s contention that our

administrati on officials regarding the ongoing conflict in iraq afid advocates argue that the need to assist others in defending themselves is even greater today than it was in 1991 for example the changes brought about by 911 in the international environment and the direction taken by the 2003 national security strategy seems to make forces capable of fid operations not conventional warfare the most likely force jour for the us armed forces151 aviation foreign internal defense afid advocates also say that afid allows the united states to influence the shape and capabilities of foreign air forces in ways that can not only combat insurgen ts but also promote stability visavis neighboring countries by helping the pa kistani air force improve its counter guerrilla capabilities for example afid advisors could also attempt to lead pakistan away from an air fo rce capable of conducting dee p offensive air strikes that might threaten india in essence us fid advisors could help pakistan build coast guard rather than navy152 finally while afid advisors could still risk alienating local populati ons hostile to us activity in given country the afid footprint would likely be much smaller than direct involvement of us airpower and could reduce the chances of alienating the population the air force special operations co mmand afsoc describes afid as complement to direct action policy ma kers wishing to elevate afid from complement to an activity equal in scope to afsocs direct action may consider increasing the 6sos resources the 6s annual budget of appr oximately 56 million is small fraction of the special operations commands roughly 2 billion budget for procurement rdte and om153 historically the 6sos has encountered difficulties acquiring the types of fixed and rotarywing aircraft it needs to advise developingworld air forces scholars suggest that purchasing these relatively low tech aircraft runs counter to air force cultural bias toward acquiring technologically advanced aircraft154 further 6sos pers onnel require specialized training that allows them to operate independently in austere and foreign environments advocates maintain that augmenting the 6sos budget would sustain or improve this traini ng and allow the 6sos to increase its personnel on the other hand advancing the air fo rces afid activitie s may require more than increased resources

with air force leaders155 some say that finding ways to give the 6sos more traction within the air force bureaucracy may be another way to foster increased afid capabilities they cite requesting nnual reports on afid or elevating the rank of the squadrons commander currently lieutenant colonel or making this join t organization as three potential approaches in november 2005 it was announced that 2660 marines would join the special operations command in addition to two battalions of trigger pullers approximately 800 of the marines w ill be specia lists in intelligence logistics and foreign internal defense156 supporters of improving afid capabilities could see this as an opportunity if the marine corps is now willing to place its troops under the control of socom some might argue that the timing is right to augment the 6sos with detachment of marine aviators adding ma rines to the 6sos would not just increase the squadrons manpower but would also likely improve knowledge and processes among all par ties as marine corps expe rience with close air support and fid is introduced to the air force creating joint capability in afid could also raise the bureaucratic prominence of the 6sos some might argue others might argue that such joint marriages tend to take time to implement and that the cultural melding of air force and marine corps aviation assets wont likely happen in the near future
