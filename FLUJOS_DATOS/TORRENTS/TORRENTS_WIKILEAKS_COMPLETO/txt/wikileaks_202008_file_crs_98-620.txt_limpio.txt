research service the library of congress abstract this report examines family cap policies implemented by states under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program most of the 22 states that have implemented family cap policy stipulate that additional tanf benefits will be provided for children born to woman who is already receiving tanf benefits this report describes family cap policies of the states and their plans to reduce nonmarital births provides some background on the family cap approach discusses findings from couple of studies on the effect of family caps on childbearing and describes some of the legal issues concerning family caps in addition it provides detailed discussion of family cap policies and nonmarital birth strategies for each of the 22 states appendix it also presents three tables in appendix b that show the effect of tanf family cap on combined tanf and food stamp benefits by state for the states with tanf family cap rule for

program summary pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 prwora signaled the end of an era longer would income eligible singleparent families be guaranteed cash welfare benefits under the new system federal funds are sent to the states in the form of block grants giving states almost complete control over program eligibility and benefits under the prior program of aid to families with dependent children afdc family generally automatically received increased benefits when an additional child was born into the family unit concerned about the growth in nonmarital births and mounting welfare costs early versions of the welfare reform legislation included measure to deny benefit increases under afdc for children born to mothers already receiving benefits this feature became known as the family cap afdc law required states to obtain waiver in order to implement family cap policy prwora enacted into law on august 22 1996 replaced the afdc program with temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant states were given until july 1 1997 to implement tanf and longer had to apply for waivers from the federal government to implement family cap policies pl 104193 was silent on the issue of family caps and thus allowed for variations in the implementation of such measures states have subsequently approved several versions of the family cap since new jersey became the first state to enact family cap measure in january 1992 21 other states have followed an analysis of the effects of family cap on tanf recipients illustrates that benefits are lower in comparison to what would have been available under prior law by varying degrees depending on the state this lower amount of cash aid is partially offset by an increase in food stamp benefits research completed to date on the ramifications of enacting family cap supports the views of both opponents and proponents of the measure some opponents of the family cap maintain that its existence is just one of myriad of complex economic and noneconomic factors weighed by single mothers in their decisions to become pregnant bring pregnancy to term or abort pregnancy some proponents of family cap policies argue that it promotes parental responsibility and reduces the welfare burden on taxpayers they contend that early data indicate that the family cap has helped reduce the number of women on assistance who give birth to additional children in 1997 the state of indiana was sued by welfare recipients and their excluded children over the constitutionality of the family cap the results of this legal battle are yet to be determined also the family cap is again being challenged in the new jersey courts in addition on june 16 1998 representative christopher smith

president clinton reopened the debate on welfare reform during the 1992 presidential campaign with his pledge to end welfare as we know it the president however did not send welfare proposal to congress during 1993 instead in november 1993 house republicans forged ahead with their own welfare proposal hr 3500 which included provision that prohibited the payment of aid to families with dependent children afdc benefits for new baby born to woman already receiving afdc benefits the presidents legislative proposal submitted in june 1994 hr 4605 s2224 included less restrictive provision that gave states the option to limit afdc benefits for women giving birth to subsequent children while receiving afdc assistance in september 1994 house republicans included family cap requirement in their contract with america that was signed by all but 57 republican candidates for house seats the election of republican congress in november 1994 focused more attention on the welfare proposal outlined in the republican contract with america the welfare reform provisions of the house republicans contract with america were introduced as hr 4 the personal responsibility act on january 4 1995 the family cap measure was viewed by many members of the republicanled 104th congress as way to provide disincentive for women receiving welfare benefits to give birth to additional children and more generally as way to reduce outofwedlock births concomitant with the congressional debate many states did not wait for federal welfare reform instead they went forward with their own demonstrations to promote selfsufficiency of welfare families by august of 1995 15 states had received federal waivers that allowed them to implement family cap during the 1995 welfare reform debate moderate and conservative senate republicans disagreed over whether to deny federal funding for cash benefits to children born to welfare recipients ie the housepassed version of the family cap provision hr 4 on september 13 1995 20 republican senators joined the 46 democratic senators in supporting senator dominicis amendment to strike the family cap requirement the amendment passed by vote of 4634 senator gramm warned that removing the restriction would perpetuate system that subsidizes crs2 illegitimacy which gives cash bonuses to people who have more and more children on welfare1 after vetoing two bills containing welfare reform legislation in december 1995 and january 1996 because of their other provisions president clinton signed hr 3734 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 into law pl 104193 on august 22 1996 prwora ended the afdc and related programs and replaced them with new block grant program called temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf provides states with greater flexibility to design their own programs for families with children in the end prwora was silent with respect to the family cap thus states now have total discretion over whether or not to have family cap policy under the former afdc program all states paid greater benefits for larger families at least up to family size of six this meant that in all states family of five would receive larger check than family of four and so on at some point however this incremental increase in benefits ceased meaning that family of eight received in most states the same amount of benefits as family of 12 the amount of incremental benefit increases given to families also varied from state to state the family cap generally is defined as not increasing tanf benefits simply because woman has another child while receiving tanf benefits thus under family cap policy the tanf benefit amount is based on the size of the family at the time of enrollment into the program which means that the birth of one or more children after enrollment has effect on the tanf benefit payment therefore under family cap policy families of the same size may be treated differently if the mother has more children while she is already receiving tanf benefits the family cap has been one of the most controversial aspects of the welfare reform efforts undertaken by the states various groups have lined up either in support of the policy or in opposition to it proponents of family cap assert that the welfare system of the past provided the wrong incentives and rewards leading many women irresponsibly to opt to have additional children in order to gain more benefits they argue that family cap promotes parental responsibility and reduces the welfare burden on taxpayers they contend that family cap policy sends out the message that mothers and fathers not taxpayers need to take personal responsibility for providing the financial support needed to take care of their children the republicanled house of representatives made the family cap part of its contract with america and included it in the various versions of its welfare reform legislation other supporters include conservative organizations such as the family research council when women on welfare were asked about the family cap 67 said they felt it was fair and 86 said it promoted responsibility2 another survey conducted by public agenda found that 53 of welfare recipients said that not increasing benefits when mothers on welfare have 1 1995 congressional quarterly cq almanac p 749 2 these data were obtained from the washington post new jersey officials say birth rate drop not linked to welfare benefits cap september 12 1997 p a22 crs3 more children is absolutely essential to improving welfare in addition 46 of welfare recipients who were asked whether hypothetical woman who has second baby outofwedlock should receive welfare benefits said yes she should receive the same benefits as before3 according to spokesman for georgia governor zell miller georgia has saved about 3 million year since the first version of its family cap policy was implemented and has sent out the message that the state would not pick up the bill for women who have additional children while already receiving welfare assistance some of the coalitions that have formed to fight the family cap have brought together groups that have not traditionally been in agreement on other issues coalition of disparate groups emerged during 1995 and 1996 to fight the family cap measure this union brought together groups of liberals and conservatives advocates of prolife and prochoice civil rights organizations and religious groups opponents of the family cap argue that the measure will lead to an increase in abortions that it is ultimately most harmful to children because it denies them adequate financial support and that it opens the door to potentially coercive policies that may restrict womens reproductive choices such diverse groups as feminists for life the child welfare league of america planned parenthood now the aclu the national governors association the national conference of state legislators and the us conference of mayors united to oppose mandatory family cap when women on welfare were asked about the family cap about 50 said they felt the policy hurt children and 37 said it interfered with womans right to have baby 4 another survey conducted by public agenda found that 21 of welfare recipients who were asked whether hypothetical woman who has second baby outofwedlock should receive welfare benefits said yes she should receive additional welfare benefits5 new jersey plaintiffs who have filed law suit against the family cap policy cite violations of equal protection under the state constitution arguing that two classes of children are being treated differently based exclusively on the timing of their births they also claim that the policy violates womens state constitutional right to privacy by interfering with their reproductive choices whereas pl 104193 was silent with respect to the family cap it explicitly provides incentives for states to reduce levels of outofwedlock births also referred to as nonmarital births pl 104193 authorizes and appropriates 1 billion over 5 years for performance bonuses to reward states that achieve the goals of the act including reduced nonmarital pregnancies provides 400 million over 4 years in bonus payments to states ie the top five states that reduce their nonmarital birth rates and abortion rates requires the secretary of the department of health and human services dhhs to annually rank states on their performance in reducing nonmarital birth ratios and authorizes entitlement funding for

dhhs that includes an outline of how the state intends to establish goals and take action to prevent and reduce the incidence of nonmarital pregnancies and establish numerical goals for reducing the nonmarital births without commensurate increase in the number of abortions under the only comparable provision in prior law states were required to provide family planning services to any afdc recipient who requested them in order to prevent or reduce the incidence of births out of wedlock appendix includes brief description of state efforts to reduce nonmarital births as presented in their tanf state plans on june 16 1998 representative christopher smith introduced hr 4066 bill that would prohibit states from implementing family cap policy for tanf families according to representative smith the two most predictable outcomes of the family cap policy are likely increase in the number of babies aborted by indigent women and the further impoverishment of children born to women on welfare6 current family cap rules the majority of the 22 states that have adopted family cap measure stipulate that additional benefits will be provided for children born 10 months after the family begins receiving assistance connecticut and florida pay reduced benefits rather than zero benefits for additional children new jersey and arizona increase earnings disregards for families subject to the family cap to encourage them to substitute earnings for the loss in benefits this allows recipients to keep larger portion of their earned income and still be eligible for tanf benefits the two states increase the disregard by an amount equal to the benefit increment that would have been awarded for the new baby if family cap were in place idaho and wisconsin have taken yet another path opting to award flat benefit to the family regardless of family size most of the family cap states make exceptions for children that were conceived as result of incest or sexual assault several states make exceptions if the child is the firstborn of minor included in the welfare grant thus the grandchild of the grantee 6 congressional record tuesday june 16 1998 remarks of representative c smith p

prwora did not address family caps leaving it up to individual states to decide whether or not they wanted to implement such measure fifteen states had family cap in place prior to prwora and seven more added cap after that legislation some states including wisconsin georgia and delaware have made changes to their family cap measures since they were first implemented under federal waivers under afdc wisconsin changed from having family cap to fixed benefit structure regardless of family size under afdc georgia exempted woman from the family cap policy for 24month grace period from the initial receipt of benefits georgia dropped that period from 2 years to 10 months after tanf was in place delaware has taken tougher stance on first time minor mothers who are included in their mothers tanf assistance unit than other states by including them in their family cap penalties this means that the mother of minor who has child does not receive an increased tanf benefit based on the birth of her new grandchild several states have exempted that group of mothers maryland mandated that the amount of benefits that would have previously gone to assist an additional child must now go to third party social service organization to be used for childspecific inkind services not cash oklahoma law stipulates that instead of an incremental benefit increase voucher in the amount of the incremental benefit be given to the mother of the new baby the voucher is to be used for infant and toddler clothing food and other articles of necessity for the infant and toddler idaho treats families with earnings differently than families without earned income role of food stamps in general food stamp eligibility rules make tanf families automatically eligible for food stamp benefits the goal of the food stamp program is to increase recipients food purchasing power unlike other forms of welfare assistance the food stamp program sets national benefit level that varies with family size household income shelter costs and child care expenses in fy1997 monthly food stamp benefits averaged 71 per recipient and are expected to average 74 per person in fy1998 the effects of family cap are to certain extent lessened because tanf families are entitled to receive food stamps as result when tanf benefits are not increased with the birth of an additional child food stamps automatically increase in recognition of larger family size effect of family caps on tanf benefits generally under state family cap provisions the familys tanf benefit would not be increased with the birth of new baby this means that the tanf benefit for the family would remain the same assuming other things are unchanged thus the family would have to stretch the unchanged tanf cash income to meet the needs of any additional child or children born to the family crs7 table 2 in appendix b shows the maximum monthly amount threeperson family would receive with and without family cap rule compared with what she would have gotten under system without family cap it shows that implementation of the family cap would result in reduction of the potential tanf benefit of mother with two children one of whom was born after she began receiving tanf by between 11 connecticut and 31 north dakota in combination with the increased benefits from food stamps the tanf family cap would result in between 4 mississippi and 15 north dakota decline in combined tanf and food stamp benefits compared with system without family cap depending on the state in the median state based on the tanf benefit for threeperson family tanf benefits were less than prefamily cap benefits by 68 per month for mother with two children this is 201 reduction in potential monthly tanf benefits if food stamps are taken into account combined tanf and food stamp benefits would drop by 48 per month because of the family cap this is 8 less in monthly combined benefits than what would have been provided in system without family cap table 3 in appendix b shows the maximum monthly amount that fourperson family would receive with and without family cap rule compared with what she would have gotten under system without family cap it shows that implementation of the family cap would result in reduction of the potential benefit of mother with three children one of whom was born after she began receiving tanf by between 7 connecticut and 19 oklahoma depending on the state in which she lives in combination with food stamps the tanf family cap would result in between 3 north carolina and 8 california decline in combined tanf and food stamp

guidelines by state without the family cap and with the family cap rule tanf mother living in the median state ranked by benefit level whose second child was born while she was receiving tanf would have combined tanf and food stamp income equal to 526 of the federal poverty guidelines 13650 for family of 3 in 1998 without family cap rule versus 487 under the family cap rule tanf mother living in the median state ranked by benefit level whose third child was born while she was receiving tanf would have combined tanf and food stamp income equal to 535 of the federal poverty guidelines 16450 for family of four in 1998 without family cap rule versus 500 under the family cap rule crs8 legal questions regarding family cap the family cap has been legally challenged in new jersey and indiana the latest challenge to the new jersey family cap provision was filed in september 1997 in the case sojourner v the new jersey department of human services now legal defense and education fund and the newark new jersey law firm of gibbons deo dolan griffinger and vecchione joined the american civil liberties union aclu of new jersey to represented the new jersey plaintiffs the plaintiffs cited violations of equal protection under the state constitution and argued that two classes of children are being treated differently based exclusively on the timing of their births the suit also argued that the policy violates womens state constitutional right to privacy by interfering with their reproductive choices7 according to data from the new jersey department of human services the agency that administers the welfare plan for new jersey as of december 1997 more than 25000 mothers with newborns have been denied additional assistance as result of the family cap policy which was implemented in october 1992 the implementation of the family cap provision has been upheld by federal district court and the 3rd circuit appellate court8 the family cap also was challenged at the state level in indiana in june 1997 the indiana chapter of the american civil liberties union filed complaint in state court arguing that the state policy violates plaintiffs federal constitutional right to family integrity and privacy the suit also argues that the policy penalizes children for their parents behavior thereby violating federal and state constitutional due process requirements in addition the plaintiffs assert that the voucher system which provides recipients with onehalf of the amount they would have received without the cap was not properly implemented thereby violating federal and state due process requirements9 request for summary judgment is scheduled to be heard in september 1998 indicating their pessimism about favorable outcome some members of the indiana aclu have indicated that the decision will likely be appealed to the state court of appeals immediately after the september decision 7 now legal defense fund 99 hudson st 12th floor new york ny 10013 see also american

center crs9 research on family caps since the 1960s much of the research conducted on welfare has focused on its effects on family structure this according to many researchers is because most exits and entrances to the welfare rolls are due to changes in family structure rather than changes in labor supply or earnings10 an increase in the number of families maintained by women alone was one of the major changes in family composition in the 1970s and 1980s while there has been much research on the effect of cash welfare on family structure there are only two studies that specifically examine the effect of family cap on childbearing in new jersey after starting with an experimental design ie control group and experimental group researchers ended up using less definitive quasiexperimental prepost comparison design11 the arkansas study used the experimental design approach findings in the new jersey study indicate that the family cap in certain circumstances appears to exert small impact on birth rates whereas findings in the arkansas study indicate that the existence of family cap has impact on births these studies and their findings are discussed in greater detail below new jersey study the state of new jersey the first to implement family cap commissioned rutgers university to conduct an evaluation on the effect of the states policy on the rate of outofwedlock births and the abortion rate the rutgers study was done for the new jersey department of human services under the terms of the hhs waiver authorizing the state to conduct the family development program fdp welfare demonstration program that included the family cap under the new jersey child exclusion measure the state denies the incremental increase in benefits to any child who is conceived and born into family already receiving cash assistance the study using quasiexperimental prepost comparison design compared birth rates among new jersey afdc households from december 1990 to december 1996 researchers from rutgers concluded that the family cap has had effect on births to women that were the designated welfare payee of the assistance unit 10 moffitt robert incentive effects of the us welfare system review journal of economic literature v xxx 1 march 1992 11 researchers conducting both the new jersey and arkansas studies suggested that the use of classical experimental design may not always be appropriate for the assessment of social experiments they note that there are simply too many conditions that are not under the control of the welfare agency that can contaminate any attempt at experimentation for instance both studies indicated that many participants did not know whether they were in the control group or the experimental group further many in the control group thought that the family cap applied to them thus the results obtained from the control group would not be reliable comparison others caution that using multivariate statistical techniques to examine birth rates and abortions also has drawbacks they note that multivariate statistical methods are very sensitive to the assumptions and restrictions imposed by the statistical model used thus the reader should be cautious in accepting the findings of these studies as conclusive crs10 however they found that the family cap does appear to exert small effect on birth rates decreasing births by about 140 per year over what would be expected due to trend and population composition changesif all persons in the cash welfare assistance unit are included in the analysis if only children born to the payee are considered the study shows that the family cap has effect on first generation daughter births the study reports that births to welfare payees were decreased by about 50 per year over what would have been expected the researchers also found that the family cap does appear to exert small but nontrivial effect on abortion rates adding about 240 abortions per year over what would be expected due to trend and population composition changes12 there were 31860 abortions in new jersey in 1996 according to recent new york times article new jersey officials have rejected the abortionrelated findings of the rutgers study and characterized the report as draft that needs substantial revision13 arkansas study classical experimentaldesign study conducted by the university of arkansas at little rock school of social work reported on the arkansas welfare waiver demonstration project awwdp which was implemented in july 1994 and concluded in june 1997 it found evidence in the effectiveness of family cap on afdc benefits to influence the birth of additional children to mothers who receive afdc the study examined members of an experimental group consisting of welfare recipients who were subject to the family cap policy and control group consisting of welfare recipients whose benefits were determined based on the states afdc program the study found statistically significant difference between the control and experimental groups with respect to birth rates furthermore when questioned about what level of benefits would influence the decision to have another child 94 of the fertile experimental group and 82 of the fertile control group answered none14 georgia data in georgia department of human resources officials had estimated that 14765 women on welfare would give birth every year without the cap they predicted the 12 report on the impact of new jerseys family development program results from pre post analysis of afdc case heads from 19901996 by
