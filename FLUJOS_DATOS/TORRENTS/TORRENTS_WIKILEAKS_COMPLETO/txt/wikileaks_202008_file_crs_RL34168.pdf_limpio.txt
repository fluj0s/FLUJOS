dollar amounts because of rising prices however the purchasing power of those dollar amounts changes over time for that reason policy makers have seen fit in some cases to arrange for those amounts to be increased automatically as prices rise to keep their purchasing power unchanged without such an arrangement either the real value of those amounts would fall or policy makers would have to take periodic steps to increase them to offset the effects of inflation most of the effect on the federal budget of automatic colas may be accounted for by three programs individual income taxes social security and income support programs tied to the poverty thresholds the consumer price index cpi is based on prices and quantities of goods and services which can be directly observed it measures the change in income required to purchase fixed marketbasket of goods and services but that is not true measure of change in the cost of living true costofliving index would measure the change in income required to maintain constant level of satisfaction if existing measures of price change exaggerate what increase in income is needed to maintain consumer satisfaction then increases in benefit payments that are indexed are larger than they need to be to maintain their value to beneficiar ies and income tax brackets shift upward more than necessary to avoid bracket creep both effects tend to increase the budget deficit there are other price indexes that may be superior measures of change in the true cost of living but they have some practical disadvantages one standard for choosing price index for automatic colas might be which one is most appropriate in some cases it might be argued that what is appropriate is not measure of price change but rather measure of change in income with respect to public policy in general it has been argued that indexation may have the effect of inhibiting policy makers from making changes to those programs that are indexed it may be that indexing benefit implies kind of guarantee of future benefits making any future change likely to be more contentious it may be that there is loss of policy discretion and an increase in policy inertia with respect to those programs that are indexed indexed benefits rise over time with regard to changes in underlying economic conditions however budget priorities are constantly shifting and if economic growth is sluggish and revenues are less than expected that may put additional budgetary pressure on those programs that may be relatively more subject to discretion this report will not be updated

to increase them to offset the effects of inflation these automatic costofliving adjustments colas are also referred to as indexing values that are adjusted automatically are said to be indexed because they are linked to an index of prices as might be expected there are number of consequences that follow from indexing one implication of indexing is that the index itself becomes an object of scrutiny to those who might otherwise have interest in it the index also becomes potentially powerful policy lever in that it directly influences the federal budget both outlays and revenues indexing may also be source of policy inertia in that it implies that the amount that is indexed is less susceptible to discretionary changes this report looks at how indexing influences the budge and identifies major programs that have indexing provisions it also explains what price indexes attempt to measure and discusses some of their weaknesses finally it points out some practical things to keep in mind when establishing an indexing provision

g18g155g146g140g142g561g11g151g141g142g161g142g156g561 indexation usually relies on one of two consumer price indexes cpi both are published monthly by the bureau of labor statistics b ls of the department of labor one is the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu and the other is the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw both are intended to track changes in the prices of the goods and services purchased by typical household in the populations surveyed of the two the cpiu reflects larger share of the population1 cpi data are usually released toward the end of the month following the month in which the data are collected g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161g142g156g561 number of elements in the individual income tax are automatically adjusted for inflation indexation was introduced beginning with the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 and the number of provisions of the individual income tax code that are indexed has continued to grow in the absence of indexation inflation in combination with progressive tax rates tends to raise the average effective tax rate as an individuals income rises to keep pace with rising

though there has been real gain in purchasing power this has been referred to as bracket creep linking the income levels that define the tax brackets to price index prevents that from happening only those increases in income that represent real gains above and beyond inflation are subject to higher tax rates other elements of the individual income tax code that are linked to price index are the earned income tax credit the standard deduction and the personal exemptions2 these automatic adjustments are based on changes in the cpiu specifically the automatic adjustment in each year is based on the average level of the cpiu for the 12month period ended in august of the previous year relative to the average cpiu for the 12month period ended in august of particular base year3 for example the inflation adjustment factor for the standard deduction for any given year is determined by the ratio of the average cpiu for the 12month period ended in august of the previous year to the average cpiu for the 12month period ended in august 1987 the data required to calculate the automatic adjustments for the coming year are usually available in late september

average value of the cpiw for the three months of the third calendar quarter in the previous year relative to the average of those same three months from the year before for example the cola for january 2008 will be based on the percentage change in the cpiw between the third calendar quarter of 2006 and the third calendar quarter of 2007 the data required to calculate the cola for the coming year are usually available in late october g5g146g159g146g149g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 retirement benefit payments under the civil service retirement system csrs are automatically adjusted in january of each year to reflect increases in the cpiw like the social security cola the adjustment is based on the thir d quarter

payments under the federal employees retirement system fers are also based on the third quarter over third quarter increase in the cpiw there are however some additional adjustments to calculate the cola if the increase in the cpiw is 2 or less then the cola is equal to the cpiw increase if the increase in the cpiw is more than 2 but less than 3 the cola is 2 if the increase in the cpiw is more than 3 the cola is 1 less than the increase in the cpiw this cola only applies to fers retirees aged 62 and over 2 see james c young inflation adjustments affecting individual taxpayers in 2006

of federal government income support programs including food stamps medicaid the subsidized portion of medicare prescription drug coverage and the low income home energy assistance program liheap benefits paid by the programs are not indexed but the poverty thresholds themselves are adjusted each year to reflect increases in the cpiu each year the poverty thresholds are increased by the increase in the cpiu between the two prior calendar years for example the poverty thresholds for 2007 were calculated by increasing the 2006 thresholds by the increase in the average cpiu for 2006 over the average cpiu for 2005

cpis as they are now calculated are based on prices and quantities of goods and services which can be directly observed they measure the change in income required to purchase fixed marketbasket of goods and services however that is not true measure of change in the cost of living true costofliving index would measure the change in income required to maintain constant level of satisfaction or utility in the jargon of economists the idea of utility is pervasive in economics with given income which constrains choices consumers decide how to spend their money based on how much utility or satisfaction is derived from the various goods and services available there is however unit of measure for utility so there is way of quantifying the utility associated with particular good or basket of goods and services the inevitable gap between any practicable costofliving measure and its theoretical ideal makes it difficult to know exactly how close any actual measure may be to that ideal the issue of price index accuracy may seem arcane but it is not trivial suppose that existing measures of price change exaggerate what increase in income is needed to maintain consumer satisfaction if that is the case then increases in benefit payments that are indexed are larger than they need to be to maintain their value to benefi ciaries that means federal outlays rise more than necessary to maintain the value of those benefits similarly income tax brackets shift upward more than necessary to avoid bracket creep and tax revenues are less than they would be if the price index were measured ideally price index that overstates the true increase in the cost of living thus causes outlays to be higher than necessary and revenues to be less than was intended both effects tend to increase the budget deficit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34168g3g158g157g152g150g138g157g146g140g561g5g152g156g157g561g152g143g561g14g146g159g146g151g144 g561g3g141g147

overstatement is subject to dispute in 1996 special commission established by the senate finance committee the boskin commission named after its chairman issued report estimating that the cpi overstated inflation by about 11 per year4 since that report was released bls has introduced number of changes that may have reduced some of any upward bias in the cpi5 the cpis are fixedweight price indexes6 from one period to the next they measure the change in total price of an unchanging mix of goods and services consumers however regularly vary their spending habits even as the average level of prices rises relative prices also change some prices rise more rapidly than others and in some cases prices may fall over time as relative prices change consumers will tend to buy more of those goods and services whose prices are rising less rapidly than average and fewer of those goods and services whose prices are rising more rapidly than average by changing spending patterns in this way consumers can partially insulate themselves from the general increase in prices at least as measured by fixedweight price index like the cpi to the extent that spending patterns change solely in response to changes in relative prices it may be that the cpi tends to overstate the effect of inflation on consumer wellbeing however spending patterns change for other reasons over time tastes and preferences change food purchases may change for example for dietary reasons as incomes rise consumers may demand more luxuriesfor example substituting restaurant meals for those prepared at home if changing spending patterns simply reflect changing consumer preferences it is less likely that the cpi overstates the effects of rising prices on consumer wellbeing bls now publishes price index that attempts to eliminate any bias resulting from changing consumer spending patterns the chained consumer price index for all urban consumers ccpi u is not fixedweight index to measure the change in prices between two periods it uses both prices and quantities from both periods and so takes changing marketbaskets into account 7 data for the ccpiu are available beginning with december 1999 although there is some variation in the differences on average increases in the ccpiu have been between 03 and 04 slower than the cpiu another difficulty with the cpis is the introductio n of new goods to the indexes typically the indexes register the change in price of existing goods and services but when new good is introduced there is price for it in the previous period so there is usually delay before new goods can be introduced to the index cell phones for example were added to the cpi 4 advisory commission to study the consumer price index michael boskin chairman toward more accurate measure of the cost of living final report to the senate finance committee december 4 1996 p 93 5 the boskin commission report was not withou t its critics see economic policy institute getting prices

failed to reflect significant price declines as they became ubiquitous the characteristics of goods also change over time making it difficult to compare prices from one period to the next for example cars are safer color television replaces black and white standard sets are replaced by high definition ones and computers make more calculations per second true costofliving index would take into account that some of any change in price in good might be due to the change in characteristics measuring the value of change in quality is not always straightforward in some cases an improved good may be sold alongside its outmode d version and the difference in price can be taken as measure of the value of the improvement even that method may be flawed however because the introduction of new model may cause the price of the older one to fall because it is perceived as obsolete the introduction of ne w generation of computers for example may cause the price of the previous one to fall because consumers know that future software releases may not run on that model one method that bls uses to adjust some goods for quality change views goods as bundles of characteristics or attributes for example personal computers are adjusted for quality change based on the attributes of their components such as processor speed amount of memory and storage capacity changes in the characteristics of many goods and services however are more difficult to quantify and so quality adjustments are far from straightforward the characteristics of goods are not the only changes that must be addressed in costofliving index how those goods are sold also changes over time in recent years the proliferation of buying clubs and other big box retailers has provided consumers with lowerprice alternative the shift to selfservice gasoline stations is another example just as the cpi may be slow to reflect changes in the mix of goods and services that consumers buy changes in the nature of retail markets are not immediately taken into account bls efforts to improve the cpi as costofliving index began long before the release of the boskin commission report and they continue specific changes subsequent to the boskin report include the introduction of the new ccpiu more frequent updating of the expenditure weights used in the cpis and increased efforts at quality adjustments especially for durable goods 8 robert gordon who was member of the bosk in commission recently published an assessment of the cpi 10 years after the commissions report9 he found that in some cases the commission may have overestimated the bias because of inadequate adjustment for quality change in the cpi but may have underestimated the upward bias attributable to inadequate accounting for the effects of consumer substitution reviewing the post boskin commission changes in cpi methodology gordon estimates the current upward bias in the cpi to be 08 percentage points 8 john s greenlees the bls response to the

methodological changes in the cpi10 it found that some of the bias reported by th boskin commission that was due to consumer substitution had been reduced the study also found that although bls has greatly expanded efforts to make adjustments for quality change those adjustments have not had significant quantitative effect on the index itself the bls study also points out that some have argued it is possible that some quality adjustments are overdone and that there could even be downward bias in the cpi most studies however have found reason to believe that there is some upward bias there also seems to be some suspicion that the value of lifeextending medical advances as well as many technological advances cannot help but be undervalued

protection of those amounts most automatic adjustments are tied to one of two cpis the cpiu or the cpiw there are however other price indexes published by the government that measure change in consumer prices none is perfect the choice may reduce to what is most appropriate and what is practical social security benefits are indexed to the cpiw at the time the benefit cola was first established there was only one cpi the cpiu was not published until 1978 the cpiw tracks the prices for goods and services purchased by households deriving more than 50 of their income from wages and clerical workers earnings that would seem to exclude many retirees and it might be that the cpiu would be more appropriate index to adjust social security for the effects of inflation from practical standpoint however it would not have made that much difference between 1978 and 2006 the cpiw increased at an annual rate of 40 and the cpi u increased at an annual rate of 41 in the case of social security beneficiaries the claim is often made that the cpiw does not reflect the spending patterns of retirees in particular it is argued that the elderly spend more than the average household on health care and that health care costs rise more rapidly than prices for other goods and services for that reason some have suggested that separate price index for the elderly population should be calculated g4g14g21g514g156g561g7g161g153g142g155g146g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g11g151g141g142g161g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g7g149g141g142g155g149g162g561 beginning with december 1983 bls began calculat ing an experimental index for the elderly using data already collected for the cpi program if the purpose of indexing social security benefits was to maintain the value of those benefits to retirees in an environment of rising prices it might seem appropriate to use price index that tracked the goods and services purchased by social security beneficiaries11 on average the elderly consume different ba sket of goods and services from the overall population they tend to spend more on health care and less on transportation for example as result historically the experimental index for the elderly has risen about 03 percentage points 10 david s johnson stephen b reed and kenneth j stewart price measurement in the united states decade after the boskin report

price index for the elderly to adjust social security benefits is that just as the inflation experience of the elderly varies from that of the overall population so too are there differences in spending patterns within the elderly population itself switching to price index woul d still leave some whose inflation experience was underestimated by the index but they would be fewer although the experimental index differs from the cpiw as might have been expected there are other considerations to keep in mind because it is an experimental index fewer resources are used in its construction it relies entirely on data collected for the estimation of the other cpis the survey on which the marketbasket is based was considerably smaller than the one used for the other cpis and thus more subject to sampling error further additional survey was conducted to determine whether the elderly shop in different outlets from the overall population if bls were to initiate more formal program to estimate change in the cost of living of the elderly it might yield different results one further consideration is that if the experimental index for the elderly is found wanting any automatic costofliving adjustment affecting the elderly might at least rely on the cpiu rather than the cpiw since the elderly are underrepre sented in the cpiw although the cpiu might be the more appropriate of the two it would be unlikely to make much practical difference

price index for all urban consumers ccpiu differs from the cpiu in that it takes into account changes in spending habits over time resulting from changes in relative prices for that reason it is considered to be closer to true measure of changes in the cost of living historically the ccpiu has increased more slowly than the other cpis the annual difference has typically been about 03 percentage point but has been as large as 08 percentage point13 while the ccpiu might be considered better measure of changes in the cost of living it might be unsuitable for use in any automatic cola provision the reason is that unlike the cpiu or cpiw the ccpiu is subject to revision once the cpiw and cpiu are released those numbers are final and will not change the ccpiu however is subject to two revisions after its initial release in the case of data for each janu ary the wait for the final statistic is the longest the first estimate is released in the following febr uary the first revision is released in february of the following year and the final revision is released in february the year after that the wait for the final number for any given january is more than two years if timeliness is an important aspect of colas that may present problem in an era of stable inflation rates it might make little practical difference if colas were based on an increase in prices that happened as much as two years earl ier in an era of accelerating inflation however delayed adjustments would result in declines in the real value of the indexed amount 14 12 see crs report rs20060

provision would be more timely but might present other complications for example if given benefit payment were indexed to the first release of the ccpiu and subsequent revisions indicated faster rate of increase beneficiaries would likely be displeased g17g157g145g142g155g561g18g155g146g140g142g561g11g151g141g142g161g142g156g561 there is also broad array of price indexes associated with the economic accounts used to generate estimates of gross domestic product gdp each of the components of gdp has corresponding price index one of those is referred to as the chaintype price index for personal consumption expenditures pce the pce price index tracks the prices of all household consumption like the ccpiu it also takes into account that household spending patterns change over time and so it avoids some of the over statement of inflation that is typical of fixed weight price index the pce price index as well as the other price indexes associated with the gdp accounts is useful as an economic indicator because when the methodology used to estimate it changes the entire time series is revised at given time the pce price index time series is based on uniform methodology the pce price index however is subject to more frequent revisions which like the ccpiu may make it unattractive for use in any automatic cola pce price index data are quarterly the first release is published in the month following the end of the quarter to which the data refer the reference quarter that figure is revised again the following month and again the month after that further it is subject to revision in each of the next three julys additional revisions are possible after that g515g6g146g142g157g516g561g5g17g14g3g156g561 there is another possible automatic cola provision and as mentioned above there is version of it applied to pensions in the fers retirement system this is sometimes referred to as diet cola in this indexing arrangement the automa tic adjustment is something less than the full increase in the price index used that might be done to limit the budgetary consequences of benefit program over the long run but it might also be done because the cpis are believed to overstate the effect of rising prices on household s the historical gap between the ccpiu and the cpiu thus might be seen as basis for reducing the automatic adjustment that would result from direct link to the cpiu g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 aside from any theoretical issues related to indexing there are few practical matters that may be important first is that the timing of the cola must take into account that the data will be available that may seem obvious but it might be prudent to leave some time between when the data are released and when the cola takes effect there are two reasons for that one is for there to be time to advertise the cola to those affected another reason is the possibility that the release of the data might be delayed in 1995 for example because of controversy over the federal budget at the end of 1995 there was mporary government shutdown that shutdown resulted in delays in the publication of the cpis for december 1995 and january 1996 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34168g3g158g157g152g150g138g157g146g140g561g5g152g156g157g561g152g143g561g14g146g159g146g151g144 g561g3g141g147

which one is most appropriate however in some cases it might be argued that what is appropriate is not measure of price change but rather measure of change in income the poverty thresholds as described above are adjusted annually by the change in the cpiu using price index to adjust them implies that they represent an absolute standard of poverty but some may consider them to be relative standards that have meaning only in the context of the overall distribution of income if poverty is seen as relative measure it might be more appropriate to adjust it to keep pace with rising incomes from time to time indexing the statutory federal minimum wage has also been discussed15 like the poverty thresholds the minimum wage might be viewed either as an absolute standard in which case if it were to be automatically adjusted it might make sense to link it to price index if however it is considered to be relative standard for worker pay it might make more sense to link it to measure that reflected changes in average wages in cases where the benefit to be indexed is intended for specific purpose such as health care as opposed to general income support it might be more appropriate to use price index that reflected changes in the cost of health care with respect to public policy in general it has been argued that indexation may have the effect of inhibiting policy makers from making changes to those programs that are indexed 16 it may be that indexing benefit implies kind of guarantee of future benefits making any future change likely to be more contentious it may be that there is loss of policy discretion and an increase in policy inertia with respect to those programs that are indexed indexed benefits rise over time with regard to changes in underlying economic conditions however budget priorities are constantly shifting and if economic growth is sluggish and revenues are less than expected that may put additional budgetary pressure on those programs that may be relatively more subject to discretion g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 brian w cashell specialist in macroeconomic policy
