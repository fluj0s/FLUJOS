rule reform the secs depth of book alternative summary when securities investor submits stock trade order through broker to buy or sell stock that is listed on the nations dominant stock exchange the new york stock exchange nyse the order joins an array of other orders for the stock that are displayed by various interlinked market centers that also trade nyselisted stock these trading venues include various regional exchanges and alternative trading systems if the investor submits an order to buy or sell x number of shares of stock in company yyy he or she is legally entitled to whatever the best displayed prices quotes across the various market centers are at that time tradethrough occurs if the best prevailing quotes are ignored and an order is routed to market center offering an inferior quote this is generally illegal under rule known as the trade through rule but some institutional investors and automated alternative trading systems ats argue that saving penny or so per share under the tradethrough rule can be less important than other execution attributes like speed certainty of execution or trade anonymity the nyses largely manual trading protocol generally has the best priced quote but does not always produce the speediest execution or provide great certainty of execution compared to automated markets on december 15 2004 the sec voted to propose reg nms for public comment among other things the proposal presented two trade execution options 1 the market best bid and offer bbo regime trading protocol that when manual quote as in the case of the nyse represents the best price traders would be able to bypass or ignore it when an automated quote such as from an ats represents the best prevailing price it would be illegal for traders to bypass it the protocol would apply to both nyselisted and nasdaqlisted securities which are currently not subject to the tradethrough rule and 2 voluntary protocol known as the depth of book dob that would have incorporated the first option and would allow for the simultaneous execution of an orders remaining shares at incrementally inferior priced quotes as long as they were displayed as in the case of the first option the sec principally touted the dob option as means of encouraging the submission of more limit orders limit orders put liquidity into stock markets enhance price discovery and can thus help to lower trading costs these putative benefits were predicated on widely held theory that limit order submission grows with their likelihood of execution there are however other potentially complicating factors that underlie limit order submission that involve market conditions institutional investors have been critical of the relative dearth of limit orders with which to interact condition that dob might have partially helped to address but dob option was also likely to cost much more than the 167 million that the sec estimates the first option would cost it also could have resulted in the exodus of large numbers of institutional orders to automated trading venues that ensure order anonymity possibly hurting the traditional markets where small investors trade in june 2005 the sec voted to opt for the first option the market best bid and offer protocol by rejecting the dob option and embracing the bbo option which will go into effect in april 2006 sec cited that the dob would harm intermarket competition and would be costly and difficult to implement contents background 2 the depth of book alternative 5 the dob some precedents and basic arguments 6 institutional investors and the dob 9 technology and cost issues 10 best execution and the dob 12 tradethough rule reform the secs depth of book alternative the various interlinked securities markets that trade new york stock exchange listed nyselisted stocks are required to route trading orders to the market center displaying the best price or quote if the order is routed to quote that is not the best quote it becomes tradethrough and is generally illegal according to the trade through rule provision in the bylaws that govern the venues that trade in those stocks the restriction applies to market centers that provide both slower manual quotes as is largely the case with the nyse and automated or electronic quotes1 as is the case with alternative trading systems ats2 on december 15 2004 as part of wideranging policy rulemaking reform proposal to the securities exchange act of 1934 the securities and exchange commission sec voted to propose reg nms for public comment among other things the complex proposal presented two basic stock trade execution protocol options 1 the market best bid and offer bbo trading regime protocol that would dictate that when quote stock trading order originates from manual trading execution venue represents the current best buying or selling price in that stock traders would be able to bypass or ignore it which they cannot currently do but when an automated quote such as from an ats represents the best prevailing price it would be illegal for traders to bypass it 2 and the depth of book dob alternative voluntary protocol that would include the first option and would allow the simultaneous execution of an orders remaining shares at incrementally inferiorpriced quotes as long as they were displayed in june 2005 the sec voted to opt for the first option the bbo protocol stating that it offered proper balance between the imperative to promote competition between orders and to preserve competition between markets it rejected the dob protocol stating that it would problematically restrict intermarket competition and would be costly and difficulty to implement the reform goes into effect in april 2006 this report provides an examination of the highly controversial and ultimately rejected dob proposal it begins by providing background on the dobs regulatory origins then examines 1 the mechanics of the dob and some of its precedents 2 the central arguments and counter arguments surrounding the dob 3 how dob 1 this is basically defined as the ability to immediately interact with quote 2 ats which are also known as electronic communications networks or ecns are essentially high powered computers that match buy and sell orders ats generally focus on the trades of institutional investors and limit orders in which an investor sets parameters on how high he is willing to buy or how low he is willing to sell certain amounts of shares crs2 might have affected institutional investors 4 technology and cost issues surrounding dob and 5 how the dob would have fit into the brokers duty of best execution background when securities investor submits stock trade order through broker to buy or sell stock that is listed on the nations dominant stock exchange the nyse the order joins an array of other orders for the stock that are displayed by various interlinked market centers that also trade nyselisted stock these trading venues include various regional exchanges and alternative trading systems if the investor submits an order to buy 100 shares of stock in company yyy and the lowest and thus best displayed price across the various market centers trading the stock is 551 per share for that many shares then he or she is legally entitled to that price likewise if the investor submits an order to sell 100 shares of the stock and the highest and thus the best displayed price across the various market centers is 549 per share for that many shares then he or she is legally entitled to that price however if an order to either buy or sell stock ignores the best prevailing prices in this example 551share to acquire the stock and 549share to sell the stock and it is routed to market center offering inferior prices it is tradethrough one of the reasons why tradethrough may occur is the existence of different kinds of trading technologies each with unique set of advantages and disadvantages which may involve being able to provide the best prices or may perhaps involve being able to provide faster and more certain executions the tradethrough rule can be found in the bylaws of the intermarket trading system its an association of exchanges charged with governing the order routing communication networks that facilitate trades in stocks listed on the nyse and the amex the its is itself product of the securities act amendment of 1975 to the securities exchange act of 1934 among other things the 1975 amendment directed the sec to facilitate the establishment of fully integrated system of securities markets the national market system nms the nyse is predominantly manual trading market in which most trade executions are conducted through an auction process that takes place on physical trading floor3 the manual trading system generally yields the best prices but 3 in the nyses manual trading environment floor brokers hold customer orders in stock and enter them into continuous miniauctions overseen by specialist assigned to the particular stock the specialists are responsible for maintaining fair and orderly markets in the assigned stocks and also receive orders via electronic routing orders that they can use to help fill floor brokers orders this auction market has stock traders called specialists who execute trades on physical floor announcing the prices at which they are willing to buy bid and sell offer the specialists are primarily agents who undertake little financial risk and receive commissions for matching buying and selling interests their central tool is the limit order book compilation of unexecuted conditional orders to buy or sell shares at less or more than certain specified prices that have been submitted to them about 12 of the continued crs3 benefitting from recent technological advances rival trading venues such as ats and nasdaq market makers are now able to execute trades at speeds never imagined decades ago speeds generally faster than those on the nyse4 various institutional investors have argued that saving penny or so per share under the tradethrough rule can be less important than other execution attributes like speed of execution certainty of execution and trade anonymity which can help prevent other investors from trading against them and bidding up prices handling about 80 of the trades in its listed stocks the nyse tends to have the best quotes the best priced offers to either buy or sell various stock at any given time but there is certainty that an investor will necessarily always secure those quotes in the relatively slow floor trading and dominant part of the exchange where the entities who execute trades have up to 30 seconds to decide whether or not to actually execute quote on december 15 2004 the secs commissioners voted four to one to propose modification 5 of an earlier and highly controversial february 2004 proposal reg national market system nms which would redesign certain rules in section 11a of the securities exchange act of 19346 among other things the february proposal would have effectively preserved but somewhat modified the tradethrough rule on nyselisted stock while also expanding it to nasdaqlisted stocks specifically it would have codified the rule acrosstheboard expanding it beyond its present status as merely part of the its 3 continued orders on the nyse are filled by an electronic matching system called direct which is limited to smallsized trading orders 4 while the nyse specialists operate in an auction environment in which they have monopolies over the trading in specific stocks nasdaq market makers in nasdaq stocks compete with other highly decentralized market makers in the trading of various stocks the electronically linked market makers traditionally operate as principals meaning that they are willing to assume the financial risk of buying from and selling stocks to customers from their own inventories in return for potential profit from the spread some nasdaq market makers trade nyselisted stocks but like the ats they account for small fraction of those trades nasdaqlisted stocks are also traded on ats including nasdaqs supermontage and its newly acquired brut like inet and number of fully automated exchanges the national stock exchange formerly the cincinnati stock exchange and arcaex tiny fraction of trades in nasdaqlisted stocks are executed in manual market centers like the boston stock exchange 5 regulation nms federal register vol 69 247 dec 27 2004 p 77424 proposals are requisite part of the secs rulemaking process wherein it internally interprets one of the several securities laws that govern the securities markets those laws which include the securities exchange act of 1934 also provide the framework for the agencys oversight of those markets but the statutes tend to be written rather broadly largely focusing on basic principles and objectives the secs central objectives are to maintain fair and orderly markets and to protect investors to help it realize the objectives as the securities markets have evolved the agency has used the authority granted to it under the laws to flesh them out through the rulemaking process 6 regulation nms federal register vol 69 46 mar 9 2004 p 11126 crs4 bylaws7 within up to 5 cents beyond stocks best prevailing buying and selling prices it would have allowed investors like institutional investors who use automated markets to trade through bypass the better displayed price on non automated market on an orderbyorder basis it would have allowed investors to do tradethroughs if they formally opted out of the tradethrough rule known as reproposed rule 611 or the reproposal the december proposal also applied to all nms securities including those on the nasdaq8 but it would alter the earlier proposal in number of ways when manual quote represents the best price in particular stock traders would be able to bypass or ignore it9 automated quotes would be protected by the tradethrough rule when an automated quote represents the best prevailing price it would be illegal for traders to ignore or bypass it the reproposal eliminated the optouts an integral part of the earlier proposal it argued that by giving best price protection to automated but not manual quotes the optouts favorite of some institutional investors and ats were longer necessary10 thus under the december 2004 proposal best priced quotes produced by automated markets would generally have trumped other trade execution attributes like speed of execution not significant issue in those markets although there can be some variability and certainty of execution the odds that an order will be executed making general argument for the reproposed tradethrough rule proposal william donaldson the then chairman of the sec noted that while it may be faster to trade another order at worse price and that while certain individual traders might personally benefit from tradethroughs the overall market could be hurt by traders who ignore better priced orders as long as they are displayed by automated markets11 the earlier and the newer tradethrough rule proposals give added weight to automated executions the initiatives are also reflection of the growing national and worldwide embrace of automated trading over manual trading developments that have been instrumental in the nyses decision to greatly ramp up the scale of its own automated trading in 2004 the exchange submitted plans for new hybrid 7 as part of the its bylaws tradethrough rule enforcement is triggered by parties who report that they have observed it being violated under both the february and december proposals market centers would have to monitor and report violations up front 8 the nasdaq is technically not an exchange but an association in 2000 it submitted an application to the sec for conversion to exchange status 9 both proposals would also eliminate the current exemption from the tradethrough rule provided to block orders stock trades of 10000 shares or more 10 by late dec 2004 approximately 35 members of congress had reportedly written the sec in support of the earlier optout provisions while eight had written in support of an unconditional trade through rule gregory bresinger congressional members press for the optout traders dec 31 2004 11 us regulators clash over trading rule changes the asian wall street journal dec 17 2004 p m9 crs5 trading system to the sec for approval it would marry its manual specialistbased floor trading system with greatly expanded version of an automated electronic trading system known as direct which now handles about 12 of the exchanges trading volume it can only be used for relatively smallsized orders12 the depth of book alternative at present brokers are required to enter only their best bid and offer for stock at any given time into database of consolidated quotes from their fellow brokers but the reproposal offered an alternative protocol that would extend this requirement to all of their prevailing quotes not just their best ones the sec proposed voluntary regime under which brokers who sought price protection for all of their quotes would have to display all of their bids and offers in real time database that is universally accessible to market centers trading the stock in other words market center with the best price would have to hand off the remainder of any stock trade order to other market centers with the next best price if the first market center was unable to complete the order rather than continuing to execute the trade at inferior prices based on the original or top of the book price championed by the financial firms goldman sachs and citigroup this alternative trading protocol alternative is known by number of names including depth of book dob voluntary depth and virtual central limit order book clob the reproposal described the dob as mechanism for brokers who want to fill orders including large block trades to sweep various markets for the best incremental prices simultaneously executing trades in the same stock across various markets13 one sec official succinctly noted that the dob basically meant show your hand and you have higher probability of success in having your order executed14 among the opponents of dob were fidelity investments the largest mutual fund the nyse and nasdaq consider the trading scenario under the secs simple tradethrough rule proposal assume that there is market which is displaying 500 shares at the national best offer of 2002 and also has offers at each price level below the best offer assume there is market b that is displaying 500 shares at 2003 its best offer and also has 4000 shares at 2004 that is not displayed also assume there is market 12 crs report rs21871 the tradethrough rule by mark jickling provides detailed examination of issues surrounding impact of the secs tradethrough rule proposal on trading in nyselisted stocks 13 for an additional fee traders can currently avail themselves of real time depth of book limit order display feeds for both nyselisted and nasdaqlisted stocks 14 rachel mctague and kip betz in move likely to stall nyse sec reproposes market structure rules dec 20 2004 bnas securities regulation and law report p 2221 crs6 c that is displaying 300 shares at 2005 its best offer and that there is market d that is displaying 800 shares at 2007 its best offer under the secs first tradethrough rule option if an order arrives at market to buy significant amount of shares that would satisfy all the displayed liquidity in the other markets market would only be required to send orders to satisfy the best offers at markets b c and d even though the 4000 share order on market b is for significant amount of stock it would be ignored and would remain unexecuted in favor of the inferiorpriced orders in markets c and d because they represent the best prevailing quote from each market but it appears that under dob if the superior priced 4000 share quote from market b was displayed it would have priority over the best but inferior prices on markets c and d another way of understanding how the dob would probably have worked is the following an individual investor whose broker is merrill lynch wants to buy 5000 shares of walt disney co at price higher than 2705 at the time that investors order is presented to merrill lehman brothers brokers customer is advertising 4000 disney shares for sale at 2700 on the nyses floor computer systems today the merrill broker could buy the initial 4000 shares for 2700 but then would have to wait to find an additional 1000 shares either on the nyse or another market to complete that investors order at or near the desired price but lets suppose that the lehman broker all along had an additional 1000 disney shares to sell at 2701 under the proposed rule revisions the lehman broker would be required to publish his entire list of sell orders at the beginning enabling the merrill broker to simultaneously purchase both the 4000 shares at 2700 and the 1000 shares at 2701 the nextcheapest price completing the investors order in one fell swoop under dob the two transactions would not have taken place on the nyse where disney shares are listed the first 4000 share transaction at 2700 per share could take place on the nyse while second transaction the purchase of 1000 shares from third broker for 2702 per share could have occurred for example on the chicagobased automated electronic exchange arcaex the dob would have thus allowed other brokers who seek to fill orders including large block trades to sweep all markets for the best price and to execute trades simultaneously in the same stock across different markets brokers would thus be allowed to pick off the best prices from various markets some observers say that it is also important to emphasize that the dob would only be voluntary but others predict that competitive pressures will probably result in first movers prompting subsequent widespread use the dob some precedents and basic arguments when investors submit an order to their broker to buy or sell stock that order is either market order or limit order market orders are requests to buy or sell crs7 stock at whatever current prices the market is offering limit orders are conditional orders to buy or sell stock that set parameters on the acceptable prices examples of limit order would be an order to buy 300 shares of xerox stock at 2400 per share or less or an order to sell 1000 shares of google at 1355 or more limit orders produce number of positive externalities for stock markets and investors they enhance market depth and liquidity15 increase market transparency and improve price discovery16 generally and particularly for small investors the more liquid market is the less volatile it is and the lower should be the cost of trading on it making the markets more attractive for the submission of limit orders was central goal of the secs february 2004 tradethrough rule proposal the agency largely framed its dob policy option as way to expand on that attractiveness the idea of dob has some history for example in 2000 as part of concept release public policy think piece the sec staff proposed that consideration be given to more expansive version of its current dob proposal17 policy option that it claimed might also provide greater investor access to market enhancing limit orders in the increasingly fragmented securities markets18 known as clob central limit order book the policy option was supported by arthur levitt jr then the chairman of the sec few high profile wall street firms like merrill lynch morgan stanley goldman sachs and at least one ats but it also confronted significant congressional19 and industrywide opposition the principal criticism was that the proposal would amount to government imposed mandate that would hamstring the ability of the securities industry to evolve and innovate via natural competitive forces the agency never implemented the clob about the same time number of institutional investors raised related concerns that the markets were suffering from dearth of accessible limit orders and in 2000 diverse number of financial industry players including the securities industry association the trade group of brokerage firms the investment company institute the mutual fund trade group and number of mutual funds and institutional 15 liquidity measures the degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the assets price generally the higher the level of trading in particular stock the more liquid is that market 16 this is the method for determining the specific prices for securities based on the interaction of demand and supply 17 for example unlike the dob option that was proposed in december 2004 the clob would have incorporated time priority when there are several equally priced quotes execution priority would have been given to those that were submitted the earliest 18 notice of filing of proposed rule change by the new york stock exchange inc to rescind exchange rule 390 commission request for comment on issues relating to market fragmentation exchange act release 42450 sec docket feb 23 2000 19 among the proposals congressional opponents were hon phil gramm then the chairman of the senate banking committee the hon tom bliley then the chairman of the house commerce committee and the hon michael oxley then the chairman of the house finance and hazardous materials commerce subcommittee crs8 investors formed group to explore various ways of enhancing limit order transparency without enacting clob20 during the past decade the nations stock markets have moved from pricing stock in eighths of dollar to sixteenths of dollar and finally to pennies or decimals and subpennies in some cases one manifestation of the move to decimal pricing is that quotes tend to be spread across many more potential fractions of dollar in the predecimal days there may have been 10000 shares of given stock available at the best bid and offer prices now there may be only 200 shares at those prices with considerable part of the market depth in the form of quotes that may be pennies off of the best bid but by not being the prevailing best bid or offer the orders face an additional hurdle that they will not be executed potentially discouraging traders from continuing to submit limit orders by granting trade through protection to nonbest priced quotes the sec argued that the dob should help ensure that more limit orders are executed thus encouraging investors to submit more of them major cost of submitting limit order is that it will go unexecuted an occurrence that the sec and some others said should have been reduced with dob this presumption of robustly positive correlation between the odds that limit order will be executed and investors willingness to submit them is widely subscribed to theoretical orthodoxy21 but actual empirical research on why investors decide to submit limit orders is not very extensive some of the research that has been conducted on investors willingness to submit limit orders has identified number of other salient market variables they include average trading volume the size of the spread and the level of market uncertainty22 additional criticism of the dob came from the nyse exchange officials said that dob would have effectively killed the auction component of the exchanges proposed hybrid execution system view shared by number of observers outside of the exchange23 from the critical investor benefit perspective there is research indicating that the nyses specialist system tends to provide lower trading costs for 20 laura santini wall street firms buy side to explore price transparency investment dealers digest june 26 2000 21 among others officials at the investment company institute the national mutual fund trade association support the idea that by protecting nonbest priced quotes the dob should help foster greater interest in the submission of limit orders 22 ingrid and stephen sapp order submission the choice between limit and market orders efma 2004 basel meetings paper 14th annual conference on financial economics and accounting fea nov 27 2003 some other financial observers contend that probably the biggest thing that market can offer to institutional investors to stimulate their limit order flow is better trade anonymity also potentially undercutting the robustness of the relationship between limit order execution and individual investor willingness to submit them are surveys that report that the vast majority of individual investors lack basic understanding of what limit order is investors flunk securities survival quiz wall street letter aug 6 2001 p 4 23 for example see john thain ceo of the nyse the quest for the right balance the wall street journal dec 21 2004 crs9 certain kind of stocks while for other kinds of stocks nasdaqs more automated dealer trading appears to provide lower costs24 when small investors stock orders are internalized broker routes customers stock trade order to his firms trading desk for interaction with the firms stock inventory meaning that the orders bypass exchanges or market centers order internalization is very commonplace in the securities industry25 for years institutional investors have identified internalization as significant reason why they are unable to access substantial pockets of limit order flows deleteriously affecting overall market quality26 the dob would not have addressed internalization and the isolated pools of liquidity that result from it institutional investors and the dob for institutional investors and the millions of small investors they represent the most significant cost of trading large blocks of shares is known as the price impact the change in stock price caused by the potential impact of executing large orders to buy with rising prices or to sell with declining prices to help minimize the price impact institutional orders are typically divided up into chunks which are sequentially put out for execution over the course of day or more but this segmented strategy also means that the information about their trades may be subject to leaks and risk being front run that is traders with knowledge of the orders may exploit that knowledge by buying or selling ahead of the institutions orders for their own gain27 such trading can result in up or down price movements that are detrimental to the institutional investors yettobefilled order institutional trades also tend to incur significant trade transactions costs and opportunity costs due to changes in market prices during the time it takes to complete trade the dob could have enabled institutional investors to get some orders filled before leaks about their orders result in the orders being front run by other traders an ongoing concern for them in addition the ability to get potentially faster 24 for example see kee chung bonnie van ness and robert van ness trading costs and quote clustering on the nyse and nasdaq after decimalization journal of financial research sep 22 2004 the study found that the nyses specialist system offers lowcost executions for smaller lowvolume stocks while the nasdaq dealer system offers lowcost executions for large highvolume stocks 25 major public policy concern with internalization which has also been voiced by sec officials is that internalization may result in brokerage firms interests taking precedence over the interests of investors its adherents however counter that by making deep proprietary liquidity available to clients brokerage firm can offer greater price improvement on more orders 26 for example see laura santini wall street firms buy side to explore price transparency investment dealers digest june 26 2000 27 the cost of front running has dropped considerably with decimal pricing as the front running trader merely has to offer to buy share of stock at penny more crs10 sweeping trades could also mitigate some of the opportunity costs of trading in securities markets with fluid prices but potential cost of the dob to institutional investors would have involved the very same issue of potential leaks of trade information and front running to minimize price impact by trading anonymously large institutional investor trades for nyselisted stocks are often intentionally undisplayed by nyse floor brokers for nyselisted stocks or by ats for nasdaq stocks known as reserve orders these hidden quotes stand ready to be executed by matching incoming orders and one of the concerns with the dob was that betterpriced limit order that is hidden in reserve could be ignored because displayed liquidity has priority over non displayed orders but because dob could have resulted in reserve orders being bypassed there was another concern that there will be pressure to display them which can carry its own potential shortcomings with institutions seeking to avoid display of their orders there are concerns that there could be significant migration of institutional orders to trading venues like crossing networks that exist exclusively for them one concern was that substantial migration to such markets could result in significant diminution in liquidity and possible erosion in market quality in the traditional securities markets where small investors orders are traded and where the bulk of institutional orders are also traded28 such migration would however take institutional orders significantly away from the institutions professed interest in finding greater opportunities to interact with retail limit order markets markets that tend to provide superior price discovery technology and cost issues the dob would have required trading centers to monitor large number of quotes that are protected from normal proscriptions on trading through displayed by other markets and route orders to execute against those incoming quotes to do so the sec emphasized that the technology required would have to ensure that 1 market participants had data source that identified the protected quotes 2 such quotes data would be available on fair and reasonable terms and 3 market participants would have fair and efficient access to the protected quotes at reasonable costs the secs proposal did not provide cost estimate of implementing the technology capable of handling dob but the dob would have built upon the foundation of the less ambitious tradethrough rule proposal we can assume that it could significantly exceed those costs the sec estimated that aggregate costs for the tradethrough reform would be 144 million in onetime costs 184 million in 28 larry tabb the secs nms to incent and protect wall street and technology dec 21 2004 in addition officials at fidelity the nations largest mutual fund opposed the dob largely on freedom of choice grounds they asserted that the government should not be dictating to investors where they should send their orders amy borrus new york stock exchange more breaks for the big board business week dec 6 2004 crs11 compliance costs and 35 million to update written policies and procedures or total of 167 million29 at least some of the costs of new technology probably could have been passed on to investors although the ats and the venues that trade nasdaq securities currently have the technology to publish dob quotes30 industry sources say that dob could have placed significant additional demands on current market data dissemination technology especially in terms of the need for much more capacity to carry the greater volumes of data that would probably be produced through the years establishing connectivity among the various entities in the securities industry participants has become both cheaper and easier there is also currently glut of telecom capacity in the several dozen or so largest metropolitan markets31 and while some securities industry observers acknowledge the declines in the marginal cost of technology they have also complained about its burgeoning total costs at least in the shortrun some questions were raised about the feasibility of implementing the required technological upgrades in various parts of the securities industry32 dob might also have forced institutional investor trading desks and online brokers who serve retail customers to retool the technology that allows them to view quote data33 another issue which the sec itself raised in the reproposal is whether the dob might have potentially heightened market systemic risk by providing for more centralized and concentrated data spigots which could possibly become single points of failure market center outages are known to occasionally occur34 the past several years have seen the growing use of trade facilitating technology known as algorithmic trading software sometimes called smartrouting technology used by brokers for their institutional investor clients and at times directly by the institutions themselves the software can both analyze and implement efficient methods for doing trade in automated trading markets trades that may involve multiple market centers the software is capable of doing depth of book types of searches which has raised questions about the need for government regulation initiated dob but the technology which uses statistical modeling is not perfect is not universally employed for institutional trades and is generally not used for 29 secs trade proposal irks some in industry dallas

trading markets and though it began as technology designed to facilitate retail investor day trading it is generally not available to most individual investors35 users of the algorithmic trading software could have incurred additional reprogramming expenses under dob36 another technologyrelated criticism of the dob was that it would place the government in the role of dictating the shape and form of future technology many argued that these decisions are better left to the market participants themselves they noted that over the years the advance of market oriented technological innovations has been significant part of the widelyacknowledged overall drop in trading costs the emergence of the ats technology being prime example of technology that has helped reduce investor costs it was also argued that the informationsharing provisions of the dob proposal would have limited such innovation stymying the ats incentives to create faster more efficient trading models and constraining exchanges incentives to innovate technology beyond that which may be minimally required by regulation in the reproposal the sec responded that under dob each market would have the freedom to choose the course of action most appropriate for its particular competitive strategy generally speaking in both its february and december 2004 reg nms proposals the sec appeared to be eschewing the heavily bureaucratic intermarket tradingsystem consortiumbased model of market center linkages and pushing for more privatelyorganized market center linkages somewhat akin to the current linkages connecting the trading venues that trade nasdaq stocks best execution and the dob in fulfilling its mandate to facilitate national market system the sec has pursued four broad policy objectives 1 competition among markets 2 transparency in the pricing of securities 3 better linkages between market centers and 4 best execution of investors orders the latter goal the best execution of investors orders is at the heart of the issues that surrounded the agencys tradethrough and dob reform proposals best execution is the secs requirement that in executing an investors orders broker has duty to seek the best execution that is reasonably available for its customers orders this means that broker must evaluate the orders it receives from all customers in the aggregate and periodically assess which competing markets market makers or ats offer the most favorable terms of execution among the factors that broker needs to consider when executing its customers orders for best execution include 1 the opportunity to get better price than what is currently quoted 2 the speed of execution and 3 the likelihood the trade will be executed 35 tower group projects algorithmic trading volume to double to

can thus have number of interpretations for an individual investor who is an active trader attempting to exploit market volatility best execution may mean fast executions at the lowest possible prices but for an individual investor who is passive investor who lets his portfolio just lie for years best execution may have less overall significance many institutional investors are concerned with selling an entire block of stock at good price rather than selling only part of the block at somewhat better price which helps frame their perception of what constitutes best execution their particular perspective on what constitutes best execution will be influenced by how they prioritize attributes such as trade anonymity certainty of execution and fast executions in fast moving markets for example thus historically best execution has technically been an inexplicit case specific construct but through the years sec officials have placed particular emphasis on the ability to get better price as its core characteristic it is position that appears to have been ratified in its later tradethrough proposal of december 2004 which would have universalized topofthebook price protection where markets best displayed bid or offer could not be traded through for an inferior price but by only permitting price protection for automated quotes the sec appears to be at least partially breaking with its traditional treatment of best execution by saying that providing price improvement is still critical but that it will confer regulatory advantage on automated and not manual markets that do so the dob proposal arguably represented an expansion of the earlier february 2004 proposals interest in reinforcing the ability to secure better prices facet of best execution in order to legitimately access quotes that may be inferior to the best price on particular market but that may be superior to the best prices on other markets they would have to be displayed for other versions
