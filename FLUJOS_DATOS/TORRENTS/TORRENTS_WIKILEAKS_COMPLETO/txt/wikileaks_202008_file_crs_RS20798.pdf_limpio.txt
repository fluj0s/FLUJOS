december 2001 will likely focus largely on domestic issues its impact on crossstrait relations is uncertain chinese nationalism and military modernization in the prc will likely continue to contribute

months as president these include an economic downturn labor demonstrations chens anti corruption campaign aimed at kmt votebuying and gangrelated politics black gold and premier chang chunhsiungs announcement that work on taiwans fourth nuclear power plant project begun by the previous kmt government would be halted opposition members have threatened to introduce motions of confidence in premier chang and to recall president chen however they have recently backed down partly in response to public demands to reduce political deadlock research trip findings taiwans democracy is experiencing period of rancor and instability as it undergoes process of political maturation some taiwanese government and party officials repeated the saying that the dpp has not yet learned how to rule while the kmt has not yet learned how not to rule the congressional staff delegation observed several important features of taiwans transition politics one the political system lacks institutions for moderating partisanship and facilitating the transfer of power for example few formal and informal procedures and precedents have been established for divided government two taiwanese political parties do not have experience forming coalitions and creating stable parliamentary majorities three voter identification tends to be unstable and unpredictable dpp representative explained that political personalities rather than party ideologies drive taiwanese politics an american observer stated that intraparty factionalism further destabilizes taiwanese politics four the mass media though free lack traditions of objective reporting spokesperson for the government information office stated that most mass media in taiwa n including newspapers and television are government or partyaffiliated and politicallybiased2 there are firm indications about how taiwans political parties will fare in the december 2001 legislative elections although party is expected to attain majority in the legislative yuan according to an american observer at the american chamber of commerce amcham in taipei while the kmt continues to wield economic clout and political influence its popularity has continued to wane for several reasons it has not democratized from within expanded its party base created compelling alternative vision for the country or produced charismatic leader economic challenges to the chen administration background president chen faces some troubling economic indicators at the end of 2000 taiwans stock market had fallen by more than 50 since chens election and

lived in taiwan for several generations including during the japanese colonial period 18951945 and mainlanders who came to taiwan after the communist takeover of the mainland in 1949 the dpp and taiwan independence movements have generally drawn most of their support from native taiwanese the kmt is divided among native taiwanese and mainlander factions 8 chen also promised that as long as the prc had intention of using military force against taiwan he would not change the national title change the constitution to enshrine the stateto state principle nor promote referendum to change the status quo in regards to the question of independence or unification beijing has asserted that although the prc would strive for peaceful reunification through negotiations to be held on an equal footing it may use force if taiwan were attacked by another country if taiwan declared independence or if taiwanese authorities refuse sine die the peaceful settlement of crossstraits reunification through negotiations see continuedskilled and high tech jobs to the mainland according to some estimates nonperforming loans have reached 1217 percent of all taiwan bank loans4 research trip findings an expert at the american institute in taiwan ait which conducts usroc relations stated that the notion of troubled taiwanese economy is more perception than reality nonetheless ait officials envisioned several longterm trends that would challenge the taiwanese economy these include declining exports to the united states increasing imports from abroad if taiwan joins the wto5 greater economic competition from china the loss of global competitive advantage of some taiwanese export items and falling consumer demand at home some american and taiwanese economic analysts viewed china as the key to taiwans continued development they told the delegation that the prcs accession to the wto and direct trade transportation and communication between the mainland and taiwan would further open china to taiwanese investment and exports because of common language and culture taiwanese investors and traders on the mainland already have an edge over their american japanes and european counterparts however roc government officials stated that some restrictions on investment in mainland china were necessary in order to help preserve taiwanese technological superiority economic autonomy and political leverage the onechina issue6 dpp policy the platform of the dpp has long advocated independence for taiwan7 however in his inauguration speech of may 20 2000 chen shuibian

relations opposition party efforts while president chen and the prc government have made little progress in breaking the impasse on opening formal talks many opposition lawmakers up to onethird of the legislature reportedly have gone to beijing to engage in informal discussions on crossstrait issues they and the prc government have appeared eager both to resume the dialogue that broke off in 1995 and to undermine president chens role in the process9 chen shuibian has expressed willingness to resume crossstrait talks but without agreeing to the prcs onechina principle as starting point by contrast opposition leaders have been more accepting of the one china principle as basis of negotiations10 research trip findings taiwanese and american political experts told the delegation that following the march 2000 presidential election both the dpp and the kmt have taken more conciliatory stances toward the mainland the kmt has downplayed former president lee tenghuis suggested statetostate framework for negotiations the dpp has conveyed greater acceptance of the idea that some political accommodation with the prc is inevitable while the independence faction within the party has been marginalized several government officials privately suggested that vice president annette lu an ardent member of the independence faction does not enjoy widespread public support an official at the roc mainland affairs council mac stated that dpp and kmt positions on crossstrait issues have converged somewhat both parties support the status quo position of neither independence nor unification for the time being both put forth democratization on the mainland as condition for substantive moves toward greater political ties or unification dpp authority on international affairs cautioned however that the maintenance of taiwans sovereignty is still central goal of the party he suggested that sovereignty could be achieved in two ways through independence or crossstrait political arrangeme nt that is mandated by the taiwanese electorate according to several roc government officials over twothirds of taiwanese support the status quo and president chens inauguration day remarks the remaining onethird of taiwanese are split between those who advocate independence and those who favor unification in the near future thus president chens approval ratings which fell from over 75 during his first few months in office to 50 in november 2000 reflected anxiety over the islands economy rather than his positions on crossstrait relations

separate country from china while others particularly those in contact with relatives in the prc expressed sentimental ties to the mainland crossstrait economic ties background despite the uncertain and often tense political atmosphere cross strait economic ties have grown considerab ly since the late 1980s bilateral trade was worth 258 billion in 1999 up 145 percent from 1998 in the first half of 2000 cross strait trade increased 29 according to prc data taiwan is chinas largest source of imports taiwanese firms have invested an estimated 40 billion in more than 40000 enterprises on the mainland some analysts report that business interests on both sides of the strait are pursuing greater economic cooperation in preparation for prc and roc accession to the wto11 research trip findings taiwanese leaders explained that growing economic ties with the mainland have created dilemma for the new government on the one hand the mainland economy provides ample opportunities for taiwanese businesses economic interdependence may also discourage the prc from using force against taiwan on the other hand taiwanese officials worried increased investment may cause taiwan to lose jobs and technological knowhow to the mainland furthermore if the taiwanese economy were to become too intertwined with that of the mainland it may become vulnerable to economic shocks on the mainland or taiwan may become beholden to prc political demands nonetheless the dpp has cautiously encouraged greater trade and investment president chen has considered easing existing restrictions on taiwanese businesses which apply to largescale investment construction and high tech manufacturing on the mainland on january 2 2001 the chen administration formally opened two roc offshore islands to trade and travel with the mainland as precursor to broader direct links12 defense issues research trip findings13 officials of the roc government and military establishment discussed military and political solutions to the cross strait tensions officials at the ministry of national defense raised several concerns first they articulate d taiwans requirements for more sophisticated us armaments in general14 second taiwanese military leaders discussed their inability to fully utilize some us hardware because of the need for components military training and joint exercises thirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20798crs6 they expected the prctaiwan dialogue to resume within two years and help diffuse tensions fourth they expressed the desire not to unnecessarily aggravate strains in us prc relations roc defense officials asserted that mainland military attack was possible but not likely in the shortterm they stated on the one hand that the prc still lacked the capability to successfully invade the island furthermore one official contended although the prc carried out military exercises on frequent basis not all of them constituted preparation for an attack an roc general maintained that although the prc white paper of february 2000 added condition for the prcs use of force taiwans refusal to enter into negotiations it did not indicate greater imminence than before of mainland attack on the other hand taiwanese defense leaders argued that currently the mainland could pressure taiwan through conducting missile tests shooting down taiwanese fighters or sinking its ships or taking over offshore islands an american military specialist in taipei concurred that although the rocs equipment and training were still superior to the mainlands prc missile attack could wreak havoc on the island and chinas capabilities were expected to improve substantially over the next five years however ait officials suggested that the mainlands military buildup was not the only factor influencing the prcs actio ns toward taiwan first the prc leadership is likely split between hardline and liberal factions second the prc leadership is torn between conflicting goals the prc governments antipathy toward foreign interference in chinas domestic affairs and frequent exploitation of chinese nationalism may fuel militaristic behavior chinas emphasis on economic development and aspirations for international prestige may discourage military solution thus considerations of coercive actions against taiwan may be checked by their perceived economic and political costs ait officials described the critical us policy objectives as encouraging liberal forces in prc politics and raising the economic and political as well as military costs to the prc of using force against taiwan implications for us policy two trends have helped to stabilize prctaiwan relations in the short term first the development of real political competition in taiwan has encouraged the major parties to appeal to the center of the political spectrum democratic politics has given strong voice since chens election to the current majority view that the status quo in crossstrait relations should be maintained although beijing the dpp and opposition parties may disagree about means and objectives the status quo at least allows for future talks on the issue the timing of negotiations however may depend upon the outcome of the december 2001 legislative elections second crossstrait economic ties which have been bolstered by the prospect of wto membership for both sides have raised the economic and political costs of military conflict for beijing and taipei other factors may add to tensions in the future prc foreign policy mishaps or social unrest stemming from economic reforms may trigger renewed government emphasis on chinese nationalism chinas military modernization also bears watching
