all childre n were consider ed poor under the official us definition in records da ting back to 1959 the incidence of poverty among related children in fa milies has ranged from peak of 269 in 1959 to low of 138 in 1969 poverty affects childs life chances by almost any indicator poor children fare worse th an their nonpoor counterparts family living arrangements indicated by the presence of just one or both parents greatly affect the chances that child is poor in 2007 430 of children in femaleheaded families were poor compared to 85 of children in marriedcouple families in that year 24 of children were living in femaleheaded families more than double the share who lived in such families when the overall child poverty rate was at its historical low 1969 childre n who are racial or ethnic minorities are at particular risk of being poor in 2007 little more than onethird of black children 342 and almost three out of ten hisp anic children 283 were poor compared to about one in ten white nonhispanic children 97 work is the principal means by which families with children support themselves without family earnings child is almost certain to be poor however earnings often fail to overcome poverty in 2007 about onethird 324 of all poor children lived with at least one adult who was fulltime fullyear worker another onethird were in families with worker who either worked partyear or less likely parttime another third lived in families without an adult who worked during the year higher child poverty rates were observed for those whose parents had less rather than more education children of younger parents with less potential time and experience in the workforce were more likely to be poor than children of older parents additionally dramatic gains have occurred in recent years in work by lone mothers especially among those with preschool children employment rates of single mothers with children under ag 3 rose from 351 in march 1993 to 591 in march 2000 but have since remained below their 2000 level standing at 545 in march 2008 nonetheless many of these working single mothers and their children remained poor the social safety net for children consists of 1 earningsbased social insurance programs and 2 needbased transfers of cash and noncash benefits needtested benefits have undergone ra dical transformation during th past 20 years capped by the 1996 welfare reform law cash welf are caseloads have plummeted since the reforms of the mid1990s so that many families receiving needtested aid only receive noncash benefits eg medicai d and food stamps whose value is not reflected in official poverty statistics further th welfare reforms of the mid1990s were accompanied by expansions of the earned income tax credit eitc which supplements the earnings of lowincome fa milies with children the value of the eitc is also not considered in official poverty statistics the result has been to curtail benefit availa bility for nonworking families

official us census bureau definition the child poverty rate the percent of all children considered poor stood at 176 well below the most recent high of 22 in 1993 but still well above its historic low of 138 in 1969 in 2007 18 million more children were counted as poor than in 2000 when 156 of children were poor child poverty reflects both family circumst ances in which children reside and economic conditions and oppor tunities in communities where children live family living arrangements indicated by the pres ence of just one or both parents greatly affect the chances that child is poor children who are racial or ethnic minorities are at particular risk of being poor to avoid poverty most children need an adult breadwinner the economic wellbeing of children usually depends on how well their pa rents fares in the labor market children most at risk of poverty are in families without an earner however some are poor despite the work even the fulltime work of parent they are among the working poor poverty affects childrens life chances their prospects of realizing their full potential and their ability to succe ssfully transition into adulthood1 by almost any indicator poor

related to the household head in march of 2007 there were 740 million persons under the age of 18 with 728 million meeting the definition of related child the remaining 12 million persons under the age of 18 who are not consid ered related children include 1 those who live in families all of whose members are not related to the head of the household 2 children who are not living with relatives eg foster children and 3 persons under the age of 18 who are themselves household he ads or are spouses of household heads child poverty in 2007 in 2007 128 million children2 out of total of 728 million lived in families whose pretax money income that year fell short of the poverty threshold this translates into child poverty rate of 176 as group children are more likely to be poor than are either the aged persons aged 65 or older or nonaged adults persons 18 to 64 years old figure 1 compares 2007 poverty rates of children the aged and nonaged adults it shows that children were 80 more likely to be poor than the aged and that the incidence of poverty among nonaged adults was only slightly higher than that of the aged there are some well known correlates to child poverty childs risk of being poor varies by family structure and size and by raceethnicity further since children primarily rely on adult workers for income child poverty also varies by the educational attainment and age which is related to work experience of the familys head and if present spouse this section provides profile of child poverty in 2007 shown are child poverty rates by characteristic s of the family child or family head and spouse this perspective answers the question among child ren who are most at risk for being in poor families this section also provides the composition of child poverty by those characteristics answering the question who are the poor childrenhow is child poverty measured the census bureau measures poverty by comparing money income of the childs family with income thresholds that vary by family size and composition for this purpose the bureau counts only money income before taxes and any capital gains for 2007 the poverty threshold for single parent with two children was 16705 for two parents with two children it was 21027 the official count of the poverty population takes into account all cash income other than any capital gains before taxes thus it includes social insurance cash payments and cash welfare it excludes noncash aid and tax credits the census bureau also issues alternate poverty counts that assign value to major noncash benefits and tax credits but they are not included in this crs reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32682crs4 3 us census bureau living arrangements of children under 18 years old 1960 to present table ch1 internet

because of the relatively high poverty rate among children in femaleheaded families much of the policy discussion about child poverty centers on this group therefore much of this remaining prof ile provides information on the poverty rate and composition of poverty for children in si ngle parent families as well as for all children among children in femaleheaded families poverty rates vary by whether the single mother had ever been married see figure 3 children with mothers who never married are about twice as likely to be poor 548 poverty rate as children whose mothers divorced poverty rate of 276 moreover the number of all children in families where the single mother never married exceeds the number of children in families where the mother divorced thus children in families with

africanamerican children but higher poverty rates than white children despite the variance in poverty rates by race and ethnicity the populations of poor white africanamerican and hispanic children

children in femaleheaded families have slightly higher poverty rate than africanamerican children in femaleheaded families and also have substantially higher poverty rate than africanamerican child

by the age of the head or spouse child poverty rates are highest in young families with children the poverty rate for preschool children children under th age of six was 208 in 2007 compared with 160 poverty rate for older children this is because in part these children have on average younger parents younger parents who have less job experience in the workforce tend to earn less than older adults with more experience figure 11 shows the child poverty rate by the age of the household head or spouse if present for marriedcouple familie s the age of the older adult was used to determine the age of the head or spouse it shows that child poverty rates tend to mirror the lifecycle pattern of earnings of adults that is earnings tend to be low in the early years peak in middle age and decline as adults approach and reach retirement age this explains some of the pattern shown on the figure however children in families with nevermarried fe male head the group with the highest poverty rate also

role of work and the role of government income supports as factors affecting the official child poverty rate work is the principal means by which families with children suppor t themselves child poverty rates are correlated with factors associated with wa ge rates such as parents educational attainment and work experience the am ount of work done during the year and family type which affects the likelihood that family will have second earner without family earnings child is almost certain to be poor however earnings alone often fail to overcome poverty in 2006 onethird of all poor children lived with at least one adult who was fulltime fullyear worker the economy has many jobs that pay low wa ges parents in such jobs may escape poverty only through job advancement that re sults in higher wages possibly only by upgrading skills and education while working often it takes work of both parents to move their children and fa milies out of poverty this often comes at the cost of arranging child care to permit both parents to work outside of the home additionally work is not always steady with some parents experiencing spells of joblessness for part of the year access to the first tier of the safety net social insurance is restricted to families with current or previous wage earner social insurance benefits are established through work and are character ized as earned rights although these programs are not targeted to the poor per these progra ms which partially replace earnings because of th death old age disability or involuntary unemployment of worker have si gnificant impact on reducing poverty among families with children over the past 20 years the social insurance tier of the safety net has remained relatively static the pr otections of its cash benefit programs have generally been maintained however the social insurance tier has not been revised to take into account changes in the econom family structure and work patterns of parents in contrast the second tier of the safet net programs targeted to lowincome families and persons has underg one radical transformati on over the past 20 years cash welfare for needy families with children has increasingly been tied to philosophy of mutual obligations adult r ecipients have been expected to engage in either work or activities to move them into work in the wake of welfare reforms made at the federal and state levels in the mid1990s the cash welfare rolls plummeted so that children in families r eceiving cash assistan ce represent small and decreasing share of both the overall nd poverty child populations needtested assistance increasingly is paid to familie s only in the form of noncash benefits medicaid and food stamps whose value is not reflected in the fficial child poverty statistics these programs cast an uneven net of basic support to families moreover when parents receiving needtested bene fits go to work benefits are often significantly reduced as earnings increase at times creating perverse disincentive to work for many families with limited earnings capacity the route toward self sufficiency can be steep climb yieldi ng only small economic gain for additional work efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32682crs31 along with the transformation of needtes ted benefits have come expansions of refundable tax credits for fa milies with children particular ly the earned income tax credit eitc as work support the eitc helps offset the financial disincentives relating to work that poor families have traditi onally faced under welfare programs for some families with very low earnings the eitc may supplement up to 40 cents on every dollar parent earns eitc payments either advance payments tax refunds or reductions in tax liabilities that would otherwise be owed are not included in the official poverty statistics however for single parent with two children who works fulltime all year at the 2006 federal minimum wage those earnings combined with food stamps and th eitc are sufficient to lift that family to just above the poverty threshold thus recent changes to taxes and benef its targeted to lowincome families have sought to increase the rewards to work however the world of work does not guarantee steady income working parents face risks to financially supporting their children stemming from job loss associated with either cyclical or structural changes in the economy or interrupted periods of work because of their own or family members illness moreover there remain small but not insignificant group of families with children where parent has an attachment to the labor force this creates series of policy dilemmas which in clude how to balance protections against economic risk while maintaining policy that rewards work and helping children in those families without worker without unde rmining the efforts of working parentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32682crs32 appendix support tables to selected figures in this report table a1 poverty
