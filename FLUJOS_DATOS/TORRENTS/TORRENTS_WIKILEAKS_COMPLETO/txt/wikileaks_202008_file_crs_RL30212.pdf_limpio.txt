that drove consideration of the fy2000 legislative branch appropriations bill were the following what additional staff and funds were necessary to ensure that congress would be year2000 compliant what were the funding and staffing needs for technology development including online information electronic docume nt printing and continued development of legislative information system how could congress assist in supporting the staff succession plans of its support agencies in order to replace employees eligible to retire in the immediate future what additional funds might be needed for security enhancement for the capitol other congressional buildings and adjacent grounds how much should be appropriated for the office of the architects request to undertake capital improvements overall funding level issues each spring as members of the house subcommittee on legislative and the senate subcommittee on legislative branch consider funding requests from legislative agencies they are faced with three options on funding levels to maintain flat budget to provide modest increase or to approve budget decrease statements by subcommittee members during the february and march 1999 hearings suggested support for fairly flat budget for fy2000 with slight adjustment to fund mandatory personnel costs these views were reflected in the budget reported by the house appropriations committee on may 21 which was 1917 billion when excluding from the fy1999 budget the onetime supplemental funding for the capitol visitors center security enhancements and y2k compliancy the increase was 48 to 1917 billion in fy2000 from 1823 billion in fy1999 the fy1999 and fy2000 figures exclude funds for senate items when including the fy1999 supplementals in the fy1999 total the committees

federal employee retirement programflat budget flat budget typically provides new funds for mandatory cost increases but denies additional funding requests10 flat budget can be difficult to achieve due to number of factors such as ongoing and emergency maintenance and repair needs or an effort to keep operations current with recent technology developments the approach of the house and senate appropriations committ ees to the fy2000 budget with recommended increases of 48 and 7 respectively excluding supplementals was close to action taken on the fy1999 budget the fy1999 regular annual legislative branch appropriations act pl 105275 without the emergency supplemental contained 28 increase over fy1998 to 2352 billion from 2288 billion both figures in current dollars the rate of

budget authority which is not included in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill but rather is automatically funded annuallymajor funding trends guide to determining legislative budget trends interpretation of budget trends is determined primarily by three factors 1 selection of current or constant dollars to express budget authority constant dollars reflecting the impact of inflation 2 selection of budget authority contained in annual appropriations bills with or without permanent budget authority permanent budget authority not requiring annual approval by congress and 3 selection of fiscal years to be compared selection of current or constant dollars currentdollar data reflect actual budget authority appropriated each year constantdollar data reflect the conversion of actual budget authority into equivalent 1999 dollars for example congress appropriated budget authority of 41793000 for the senate in fy1968 excluding permanent budget authority converted into 1999
