instead the president made specific requests for funds which congress dealt with through the usua l annual appropriations proce ss supplemental defense appropriations for fy1942 as well as regu lar and supplemental appropriations for fy1943 and later years were provided in the re gular form that is as specified dollar amounts for specified accounts these amounts ranged from very small items tantamount to what would be regarded as line items t oday to much larger amounts that represented the lumpsum approach more commonly used at present for example the regular appropriations act for the na vy department for fy1943 ppropriated 2000 to the naval war college and 39000 for the care of lepers on guam as well as 29 billion for naval ordnance and ordnance stores and 40 billion for construction and machinery costs for the replacement of naval vessels
