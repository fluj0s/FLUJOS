digital audio programming to millions of subscribers who pay monthly fee to enjoy listening to wider variety of entertainment and news than traditional terrestrial am and fm radio stations offer including many genres of music sports broadcasts and talk radio however partly because of the digital nature of satellite radi broadcasts when satellite radio providers transmit copyrighted content to their customers several legal issues potentially arise that may not be present in terrestrial radio broadcasts copyrights in music are held by composers and recording artists or their record labels the rights of these parties under the copyright act to control and financially benefit from thirdparty use of their creative works may affect the music licensing fees paid by satellite radio companies and may limit the manner in which consumers listen to and enjoy music broadcast by satellite this report explains the music copyri ght issues involved in satellite radio services summarizes the

satellite radio operators are obliged to pay licensing fees to copyright holders because of several provisions of the copyright act copyright holders rights in digital music section 106 of the copyright act provides copyrigh t holders with several discrete exclusive rights to among other things6 control7 the reproduction of work meaning copying the work the distribution of work meaning transferring ownership of copy of work to the public by sale rental lease or lending and the public performance of work meaning performing transmitting or otherwise communicating the work to the public8 each of these rights corresponding to th particular use of copyrighted work is distinct and divisible meaning fo r example that copyright holder could authorize third party to distribute work while denying that same party the right to perform it publicly therefore third party interested in doing something with ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33538crs3 9 17 usc 107 10 pl 10439 1995copyrighted work must first obtain the permission of the copyright holder to do anything that implicates any one of the holders exclusive rights eg reproduce distribute or perform the unauthorized use of copyrighted work constitutes an infringement of the particular right at issue unless the action is permitted by statutory exception such as fair us for limited purposes such as criticism teaching comment scholarship or research9 music licensing and satellite radio services as noted above the copyright act distinguishes between two di fferent holders of copyrights in musical content for simplification and convenience this report refers to these two parties as the songwriter musical work compos er or the music publisher and the record label owner of the material object in which the sounds of musical work are recorded music copyright holders usually grant permission to third party through voluntarily negotiated private licensing agreement whereby the third party agrees to pay royalties to the copyright holder in exchange for the right to use the work under the conditions set forth in the contract however copyright law also provides several types of compulsory licenses for certain uses of music in which the third party need not seek authorization of the copyri ghted holder but rather pays statutorily prescribed royalty rate for the privilege of using the work in particular limited ways that are specified by the copyright act the compulsory licenses created by th copyright act are found in 17 usc 112 114 and 115 section 112 involves epheme ral recordings of digital audio transmissions for example entities that webcast transmission of audio through the internet sound recording may pay compulsory license fee under 112 to make temporary reproduction or copy of the recording generally stored in the hard drives of computer servers to facilita the performance section 114 provides compulsory license to certain eligible music providers for the public performance of digitally transmitted s ound recordings section 115 allows user to pay mechanical license to the songwriter for the right to reproduce and distribute the musical composition in manner that may be heard with the aid of mechanical device for songs that have been initially distributed publicly under the authority of the copyright holder the digital performance right in sound recordings act of 199510 amended 115 to include digital phonorecord deliveries or dpds thus ensuring compensation to songwriters for the digital transmission eg digital downloads of their musical compositions the 115 mechanical license does not however authorize reproduction of the s ound recording that is embodied in the digital music file permission to duplicat the sound recording must be obtained through voluntary negotiation and ag reement with the record label the chart below provides summary and comparison of the royalties that are paid by digital music service and the c opyright holders to whom they are owed for music delivered to the public through digital means either by digital downloads of music files implicating the reproduction and distributi on rights or by broadcast implicating the performance right as the chart illustrates both copyright holders the songwriter and record label are entitled to compensation for any reproductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33538crs4 11 while there is general public performance right in sound recordings copyright law provides limited right to sound recording copyright holders for the performance of sound recording by means of digital audio transm ission 17 usc 1066 however terrestrial radio stations am and fm stations that br oadcast through analog means do not need to compensate recording artists or record labels only the

specified on the previous page however in early 2006 xm satellite radio and sirius introduced portable handheld devices that allow their subscr ibers to program in advance the digital recording of up

and sold in the united states alleges that these recording devices hold the potential to infringe their copyright holders rights to control th reproduction and distribution of music summarizing the nature of the complaint the chairman of major record label testified before congress as follows by virtue of the rapid advancements in technology satellite radio services are quickly being transformed into much more than the traditional passive listeningonly experiences from which th eir original compulsory license was derived many of these services have already morphed from listening services into download services satellite services are now offering new devices which can essentially transform satellite servic like xm and sirius into distribution service like itunes16 sirius has reached agreements with the four major record labels emi music group warner music group vivendi univ ersals universal music group and sonybmg to pay fee to the labels for each sale of its s50 recording device in exchange for the right to market the device17 however xm satellite radio has to date been unsuccessful in negotiating similar agreement with the record labels in defense to charges of copyright infring ement xm has asserted the following the recording devices simply enable lis teners to save songs off the radio for playback later the 21st century equivale nt of cassette recorder in the same

transferred to other radios or uploaded to the internet in addition xm subscribers can only listen to recorded xm content as long as they keep an active xm subscription18 litigation against xm in federal lawsuit filed against xm satellite radio on may 16 200619 the major record labels argue that xm has only paid for the right to perform broadcast music under 114 compulsory license but that it has not voluntarily negotiated or paid for the right to reproduce and distribute copy of such music to subscribers section 114 of the copyright act provides that the limited compulsory license available for the pub lic performance of sound recording does not annul limit impair or otherwise aff ect the reproduction and distribution rights of holder of copyright in sound recordings20 under the plaintiffs characterization the defendant xm satellite radio by offering the recording devices is effectively functioning as digital download service rather than solely as satellite radio broadcaster and thus xm should have to pay higher royalties fees for the right to distribute music such as those paid by an online music stores like apple computers itunes service21 xm company officials respond to this allegation by presenting its recording device as lawful digital audio recording device that is fully compliant with the audio home recording act ahra22 congress enacted the ahra23 in 1992 to provide for royalty payment system and serial copyright management system for consumer electronic devices that allow digital copying of sound recordings in exchange for prohibition on copyright infringement lawsuits against the manufacturers of such devices and cons umers who use them for noncommercial purposes in addition or in the alternative xm officials claim th at the

of copyrights available on july 12 2006 at httpjudiciarysenategovtestimonycfmid1566wit_id4446 for various reasons that made sense at one time the domestic music licensing structure for nondramatic musical works has evolved as twotrack system one for licensing public performance rights and the other for licensing the reproduction and distribution rights this worked reasonably well when the two sets of rights rarely intersected but the reality of digital transmissions is that in many situati ons today it is difficult to determine which rights are implicated and therefore whom licensee must pay in order to secure the necessary rights 27 see id there is debate that section 115 needs to be reformed to ensure that the united states vibrant music industry can c ontinue to flourish in the digital age the operative question is not whether to reform section 115 but how to do so it is now time to modernize section 115 holistically not only to address immediate needs but also to establish functional licensing structure for the future 28 see eg consumer electr onics association cea urges congress to reject the perform act may 12 2006 available on july 12 2006 at httpwwwceorgshared_

dispute remains open to question legislation intr oduced in the 109th congress in recognition of the technological adva nces in music delivery methods to the public the potential blurring of distinc tions between reproduction distribution and performance rights when music is transmitted digitally26 and the perception that music licensing laws are antiquated27 several bills have been introduced in the 109th congress that seek to reform the copyright act with respect to the use of copyrightedmusic in digital context among other things the purpose of these bills according to their sponsors is to ensure that music copyright holders are fairly compensated and their works protected against unauthoriz ed further reproduction redistribution or retransmission and to streamline the pro cess through which digital music services obtain permission from music publishers nd record labels to use their songs and recordings critics however raise cerns that the proposed licensing reform legislation may

would give the recording industr unwarranted control over the business of satellite radio and would unfairly change th rules governing our upcoming royalty rate arbitration just as that arb itration is about to begin 30 section 114 currently contains several prec onditions that transmitting entity must satisfy before qualifying for the use of compulsory license the specific details of which are beyond the scope of this report 31 the copyright act defines the term phonorecord to mean material object in which fixations of sound are embodied and from whic h the sounds may be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated either directly or with the aid of machine 17 usc 101 sound recording and musical work ma be embodied in physical phonorecord 32 s 2644 2c bill as intr oduced thus if digital music provider took actions that violate this condition such as by allowing its users to create music libraries it would not be eligible for compulsory license to pe rform the sound recording and must instead voluntarily negotiate licensing agreements with sound recording copyright holders the record labels to gain the right not only to digitally transmit the work but also to reproduce and distribute it as well 33 although the focus of this report is concerned with satellite radio broadcasts it is worth noting that this provision of the perform ac t would likely require webcasters internet radio broadcasters to stream music to the pub lic using digital rights management drm enabled digital music file format such as microsofts windows media audio wma or reals

under the current provision 17 usc 114f2b the copyright royalty judges in setting the reasonable rates and terms of 114 compulsory license are required to base such decision on the following two factors 1 whether use of the digital music service may substitute for or may promote the sales of sound recordings or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the sound recording copyright owners

mark et for sound recordings and the additional fees that are required to be paid by services for compensation companion bill hr 5361 was introduced on may 11 2006 by representative howard berman and referred to the house committee on the judiciary hr 5361 is substantially s imilar to s 2644 in many respects one difference is that the provision of hr 5361 that amends 114f40 qualifies the term transmissions with eligible41 and then provides definition of eligible transmission as it is to be used in 114 f1 as redesignated by the bill to mean the following subscription transmissions by preexisting subscription services subscription transmissions by preexisting satellite digital audio radio serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33538crs11 eligible nonsubscription transmissions nd transmissions by new subscription services throughout the comparable s ection of s 2644 that amends 114f s 2644 does not qualify transmissions with th term eligible therefore s 2644 offers definition for eligible transmissi on because such term is not used under the senate version of the bill without such qualification it would appear that s 2644 potentially would apply to broader range of transmissions whereas h 5361 narrows the type of sound recording tr ansmissions subject to the 114d2 compulsory license to only those that fall within one of the four eligible categories in addition concerning the additional eligibility precondition for 114d2 compulsory license that both versions of the perform act create that the transmitting entity take affirmative steps to authorize enable cause or induce the making of copy or phonorecord by or for the transmission recipient hr 5361 adds at the end of 17 usc 114d2 the following the mere offering of transmission and accompanying metadata does not in itself enable the making of copy or phonorecord s 2644 by comparison adds at the end of 114d2 the following language additions noted through italics the mere offering of transmission and accompanying metadata does not in itself authorize enable cause or induce the making of phonorecord under the house version of the bill it is not as clear as the senate bill whether the mere offering of transmission and accompanying metadata such as text showing song title and artist information constitute s authorizing causing or inducing the making of phonorecord hr 5553 the section 115 reform act of 2006 sira introduced by representatives lamar smith and howa rd berman on june 8 2006 hr 5553 the section 115 reform act of 2006 sira if enacted would am end the mechanical license provision of

pplies to holders of copyright in musical works sira would streamline the process by which digital music providers such as apples itune s obtain permission from music publishers and songwriters to reproduce and dist ribute their musical works siras applicability to satellite radio companies however depends on whether the actions and activities engaged in by those entities come within the scope of the definition ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33538crs12 42 the copyright act currently defines dpd as each individual delivery of phonorecord by digital transmission of sound recording which results in specifically identifiable reproduction by or for any transmission recipi ent of phonorecord of that sound recording regardless of whether the digital transmissi on is also public performance of the sound recording or any nondramatic musical wo rk embodied therein digital phonorecord delivery does not result from realtime noninteractive subscription transmission of sound recording where
