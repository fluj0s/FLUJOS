emergence of competition in what were previously considered to be monopolistic markets although less than decade has passed consensus has grown that existing laws that govern the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors have become inadequate to meet the nations changing telecommunications environment technological changes such as the advancement of internet technology to supply data voice and video the transiti on to digital television as well as the growing convergence in the telecommunica tions sector have according to many policymakers made it necessary to consider another rewrite or revision of the laws governing these markets in the 109th congress efforts to pass co mprehensive telecommunications measure while successful in the house hr 5252 did not make it to the senate

1934 1934 act 47 usc 151 et seq to address the emergence of competition in what were previously consid ered to be monopolistic markets despite its relatively recent enactment however consensus has been growing that the 1996 act fails to adequately address the convergence and technological changes now facing the telecommunications and br oadcasting sectors although many policymakers as well as the popular and trad press have labele d efforts to revise existing telecommunications law the re write or revision of the 1996 act in actuality the revisions being considered ar likely to go beyond

broadband internet access gives users th ability to send and receive data at speeds far greater than conventional dia l up internet access over existing telephone lines broadband technologies cable modem digital subscriber line dsl fiber satellite and wireless internet are currently being deployed nationwide primarily by the private sector while the number of new broadband subs cribers continue to grow some areas of the nation particularly rural and lowincome communities continue to lack sufficient access to highspeed broadband internet service in order to address this problem the 110th congress is considering the scope and effect of federal broadband financ ia1assistance programs includi ng universal service and the broadband loan and grant programs at the u s department of ag riculture and the impact of telecommunications regula tion and new technol ogies on broadband deployment some policymakers believing that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse econo mic and social consequences on those left behind assert that the federa l government should play more active role to avoid digital divide in broadband access one approach is for the federal government to collect better broadband depl oyment data and to provi financial assistance to support broadband in underserved areas others however question the reality of the digital divide and argue that federa l intervention in the broadband marketplace would be premature and in some cases c ounterproductive the regulatory treatment of broadband technologies wh ether offered by traditional or emerging providers or incumbents or new entrants has also become major focal point in the debate whether present laws and subs equent regulatory policies are necessary to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits or are overly burdensome and only discourage needed inve stment in and depl oyment of broadband services continues to be at issue th policy debate focuses on number of issues including the extent to which legacy re gulations should be pplied to traditional providers as they enter new markets the extent to which legacy regulations should be imposed on new entrants as they compete with traditional providers in their markets and the appropriate treatment of new and conve rging technologies what if any role regulators should play to ensu re the internet remain s open to all often referred to as open access requirements or net neutrality is major and contentious part of the dialogue finally emerging broadband technologies such as fi ber wireless including 3g wifi and wimax and broadband over power lines bpl continue to be developed andor deployed and have the potential to affect the regulatory and market landscape of

and other new broadband technologies for further information crs report rl33542 broadband internet regulation and access background and issues by angele gilroy and lennard g kruger broadcast indecency2 two prominent television events placed increased attention on the federal communications commission fcc and the broadcast indecency statute that it enforces the airing of an expletive by bono during the 2003 golden globe awards as well as the wardrobe malfunction that occurred during the 2004 super bowl halftime show gave broadcast indecency prominence in the 108th and 109th congresses and resulted in the enactme nt of pl 109235 2006 which increased the penalties for broadcast indecency by tenfold federal law makes it crime to utter any obscene indecent or profane language by means of radio communication 18 usc 1464 violators of this statute are subject to fines and imprisonm ent of up to two years and the fcc may enforce this provision by forfeiture or revo cation of broadcasters license the fcc has found that for material to be indecent it must describe or depict sexual or excretory organs or activities and must be patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for th broadcast medium the federal governments authority to regulate material that is indecent but not obscene was upheld by the supreme court in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation which found that prohibiting such ma terial during certain times of the day does not violate the first amendment in 1992 congress enacted pl 102356 47 usc 303 note section 16a of which as interpreted by the courts requires the fcc to prohibit indecent material on broadcast radio and broad cast television from 6 am to 10 pm under pl 109 235 indecent broadcasts are now subject to fine of up to 325000 for each violation or each day of continuing viola tion except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed total of 3000000 for any single act or failure to act fines may be levied ag ainst broadcast stations but not against broadcast networks the fcc appears to have the statutory authority to fine performers as well up to 32500 per incident but has taken the position that compliance with federal broadcast decency restrictions is the responsibility of the station that chooses to air the programming not the performers the federal restriction on indecent material applies only to broadcast media and this stems from the fact that there are limited number of broadcast frequencies available and that the supreme court ther efore allows the government to regulate broadcast media more than other medi in addition the court noted in pacifica thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs4 3 lennard g kruger specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry divisionbroadcast media have uniquely pervas ive presence and are uniquely accessible to children since 1978 however when the court decided pacifica cable and satellite media have become more pervasive thereby rendering broadcast media less uniquely pervasive the supreme c ourt however continues to cite pacifica with approval it has held however that cable television is entitled to full first amendment protection so that any governme ntal restrictions on the content of its programming must satisfy the same strict scrutiny by the courts that governmental restrictions on the content of print media must satisfy it therefore seems unlikely that it would be constitutional for cong ress to limit indecent material on cable or satellite media it also seems uncertain whether the fccs application of the indecency restriction to bonos expletive was constitutional as the supreme court in pacifica left open the question whether broadcasting an occasional expletive would justify sanction in 2006 the fcc took action against four other television broadcasts that contained fleeting expletives but on june 4 2007 in fox television stations inc v fcc the us court of appeals for the second circuit found t hat the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives represents significant departure from positions previously taken by the agency nd relied on by the broadcast industry we further find that the fcc has failed to artic ulate reasoned basis for this change in policy accordingly we hold that the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act having overturned the fcc policy on statutory grounds the court had occasion to decide whether it also violated the fi rst amendment it explained however why it was skeptical that the commission can provide reasonable explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster the us supreme court has agreed to hear the case on july 21 2008 the us court of appeals for the third circuit issued unanimous decision invalidating the fccs fine against cbs broadcasting station affiliates for broadcasting janet jacksons exposure of her breast for ninesixteenths of second during the 2004 super bowl lftime show the court found that the fcc had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding the incident indecent the court did not address the first amendment question for further information crs report rl32222 regulation of broadcast indecency background and legal

advent of color television dtv can provide sharper pictures wider scree n superior sound better color renditionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs5 multiple video programming or single program of high definition television hdtv and other new services currently being developed the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 provided that initial eligibility for dtv licenses issued by the federal communications commission fcc would be limited to existing broadcasters becau overtheair dtv signals cannot be received through existing analog televisions the fcc decided to phase in dtv over period of years so that consumers would not have to immediately purchase new digital television sets or converters broadcasters were given new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing spectrum for analog transmission so that they could simultaneously transmit analog and digital signals to their broadcasting market areas initially congress and the fcc set target date of december 31 2006 for broadcasters to cease broadcasting their an alog signals and return their existing analog television spectrum to be auctioned for commercial services such as broadband or used for pub lic safety communications however the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 allowed st ation to delay the return of its analog spectrum if 15 or more of the television households in its market did not subscribe to multichannel digital service and did not have digital television sets or converters given the slowerthanexpect ed pace at which digital televisions were introduced into american homes and given the impetus to reclaim analog spectrum for commercial uses and public safety the 109th congress enacted the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 which established date certain digital transition deadline of february 17 2009 and allocated up to 15 billion for digitaltoanalog converter box subsidy program administered by the national telecommunications and information adminis tration ntia of the department of commerce the preeminent issue for congress is suring that american households particularly those reliant on overtheair broadcasting are prepared for the february 17 2009 dtv transition deadline thereby minimizing scenario whereby analog television sets across the nation go dark specifically congress is actively overseeing the activities of federal agencies responsible for the digital transition principally the fcc and the ntia while assessing whether additional federal efforts are necessary particularly with re spect to public education and outreach the congress is also monitoring the extent to which private sector stakeholders take appropriate and sufficient steps to educate the public and ensure that all americans are prepared for the digital transition for

and telecommunications policy resources science and industry divisionfederal communications commission structure and reform4 the federal communications commissi on fcc an independent federal agency directly responsible to congress is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio levision wire satellite and cable since it was established by the communicati ons act of 1934 cong ress has periodically called for varying degrees and types of fcc reform the fcc has taken internal actions to restructure itself in an attempt to improve its ability to oversee and regulate the changing telecommunications sector however some policymakers believe that the fcc has not met the needs of changing telecommunications industry if congress undertakes significant effort to revise existing telecommunications law it could consider addressing provisions to further modi fy the fccs structure and duties suggestions for reform have ranged from modest reorganization to total agency abolishment other proposals include repl acing the five commissioners with single telecommunications czar and downsizing the agency by eliminating its regulatory functions and transforming it into an enforcement agency more recently the proposals for reform that have been ggested can be broadly grouped into two categories 1 procedural changes made within the fcc or through congressional action that would affect the agencys day today operations or 2 substantive policy changes requiring congressional action that would affect how the agency regulates different services nd industry sectors some experts have suggested number of procedural changes one suggestion is to limit the time between the adoption and actual public release of an order for example the fcc often adopts orders and issues press releases with summary of the order weeks or even months prior to releasing the order itself such delay critics claim often re sults in confusion among the affected industry segments some policymakers are discussing instituting shot clock which would require the fcc to issue the actual order within set time frame once the order is adopted and press release issued another pr ocedural change which has gained support from variety of policymakers calls for the amendm ent of the sunshine act pl 94409 requirements for meetings among commissioners current law limits to two the number of commissioners that may meet outsi the construct of an official open meeting while the intent of the law is to promote open discussion of issues some contend that it may actually hinder discussion and inhibit the ability to forge compromises other procedural changes include limiting the time allowed to complete actions on license transfers for mergerssales and li cense renewals and developing new and stronger enforcement mechanisms even with what appears to be strong congressional interest in fcc reform at this time the substantive changes which some believe are needed to enable the fcc to effectively regulate the converged telecommunications industry may remainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs7 5 charles b goldfarb specialist in telecommunications policy resources science and industry divisiondifficult to achieve without congressi onal mandate for change the fcc may find it difficult to conduct its work under the curre nt structure and restrictions of the 1934 act if congress chooses to revise th 1934 act it may wish to consider what changes if any are needed to enable the fcc to perform its duties in changing telecommunications environment for further information crs report rl32589 the federal communications commission current structure and its role in the c hangi ng telecommunications landscape by patricia moloney figliola media ownership rules5 the federal communications commission s fccs media ownership rules are intended to foster the three primary goals of us media policy competition diversity of voices and localism thes rules set restrictions on the number of broadcast television or radio stations an entity can own or control in single market the crossownership of newspapers and broa dcast stations or of television and radio stations within single market and the number of broadcast levision stations single network can own nationally the assumption underlying these rules is that undue consolidation of dia ownership could harm competition diversity or localism in 2003 the fcc dopted new rules that generally relaxed multi ownership restrictions the 108th congress modified the national television ownership rule reducing the 45 ownershi p cap adopted by the fcc to 39 the us court of appeals for the third circu it stayed and remanded the other fcc rules in june 2005 the us supreme court declined to consider an industry appeal of case that overturned the fccs rules in december 2007 the fcc adopted an or der that modified only one of its media ownership rules the newspaperbro adcast crossownership rule under the new rule it would be presumptively in the public interest in the 20 largest markets for major daily newspaper to own single television or radio station so long as the television station is not among the four high estrated stations in the market and after the transaction there are at least eight independently owned and operating major media voices with several exceptions other proposed newspapertelevision combinations would be presumptively not in the public interest though critics of the order have argued that those exceptions c ould result in crossownership combinations in all markets the new rule which has been appealed both by parties opposing any loosening of the fccs newspaperbroad cast crossownership rule and parties seeking greater loosening of the rule cannot take effect until pproved by the court the fcc also adopted an order imp lementing 12 proposals for increasing minority ownership of broadcast stati ons although eligibility was not limited to minority or socially and economically di sadvantaged businesses but rather washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs8 6 linda k moore analyst in telecommunicati ons policy resources science and industry divisionavailable to all small businesses the fcc also has sought comment on eligibility criteria and on how best to improve fcc collection of data regarding the gender race and ethnicity of broadcast licensees some parties have argued that the rules now in place are not in the public interest because they block mergers that might be beneficial for example there may be situations in which smallmarket levision station could not afford to provide indepth news coverage on its own but coul d do so if it were allowed to combine its news gathering facilities and staff with newspaper in the same market more broadly these parties claim that greater consolidation than is allowed under current rules would yield more financially stable media sector better able to serve local communities they argue that the intern et cable television sa tellite television and satellite radio now provide enough independe nt media outlets in most locations to ensure competition diversity of voices and localism even if further consolidation were to occur others have argued that loosening curre nt media ownership restrictions would result in mergers th at would directly reduce the number of independent voices lessen co mpetition and reduce local programming they claim that the new technologies internet cab and satellite television and radio provide very little local programming for further information crs report rl34416 the fccs broadcast media ownership rules by charles b goldfarb municipal deployment of broadband6 one purpose of the telecommunications act of 1996 was to foster and encourage competition among providers of telecommunications services in the 1996 act congress barred states from prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrasta telecommunications service 47 usc 253 some states have in recent years passed laws that prohibit or limit local governments from providing telecommunications rvices an effort to challenge such law in missouri by municipalities offering local communications services in the state was heard before the us supreme court in 2004 d ocket number 021238 the court ruled that entity was not specific enough to incl ude state political divisions if congress wished to specifically protect both public and private entities they could do so by amending the language of the law this decision combined with the steady improvement in broadband co mmunications technologies has provided fuel for policy debate about access to broadba nd services owned or sponsored by municipalities for the benefit of their communities the central debate is whether municipal broadband services are part of essential infrastructure like electrical power or water with many benefits including stimulus to the local economy or whether they provide unfair competiti on that distorts the marketplace and discourages commercial companies from i nvesting in broadba nd technologies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs9 7 linda k moore analyst in telecommunicati ons policy resources science and industry divisionthe two main broadband technologies that are particularly attractive to communities in part because they suppor t existing community services such as internet access for schools and communicati ons for public safety are fiberoptic based networks and wireless access the sp read of wireless access to the internet commonly referred to as wifi and antic ipated advances in wireless technology are modifying the business case for broa dband networks that depend on fiber optic cable backbone are capitalintensive nd usually most profitable in highdensity urban areas number of rural communities have used their resources to install fiberoptic broadband services in part because they were too small market to interest forprofit companies the tec hnology for wifi costs less and has wider geographic reach broadening the size of potential markets for broadband most of the discussion about the municipal provision of broadband applies generally to all types of broadband services however it is the longterm market potential of wifi and its successor technologies that are pparently spurring commercial wireless service providers to lobby ag ainst municipal competition in particular the fact that municipalities in urban areas are creating wifi networks and providing among other services free access to hot spots wireless links to the internet is viewed as threat to commercial companies nd form of unfair competition many municipalities have installed free wifi zones or citywide coverage the cities argue that generally available access to the internet through wire less connections has become an urban amenity arguably nece ssity in sustaining and developing the local economy municipal wifi also pr ovides the opportunity to improve social services and internet access in disadvantag ed communities that often are not served by fiber optic networks the fierce debate around publicsector provi sion of what some consider to be privatesector service is expected to continue increasingly congress can expect pressure from advocates from both sides to clarify the language of section 243 or to take some other action th at addresses the issue for further information crs report rs20993 wireless technology and sp ectrum demand advanced wireless services by linda k moore public safety communications7 since september 11 2001 successive c ongresses have pa ssed legislation regarding technology funding spectrum acce ss and other areas critical to emergency communications these new laws have nded to address specific issues dealing separately for example with interopera bility for first responders improvements in emergency alerts and 911 call centers when reviewing emergency communications legislation whether for oversight or ne w initiatives congress may review the pace of technological convergence and its impact on policies for emergency communications what once were discrete areas of emergency response arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs10 8 janice rubin legislative ttorney american law divisionincreasingly sharing common technologies first responders and other emergency workers not only have access to better tools but also by adopting new technologies find themselves confronted with the need to rethink their internal organizational structure and the ways that they communicate with external groups most emergency communications in use today have been built on core technologies such as twoway radio for emergency responders telephone line switches for 911 calls and broadcasting for emergency alerts operated independently of each other these th ree pillars of emergency response have developed along separa technology tracks advances in information technology and particularly the ubiquity of the in ternet have laid the groundwork for connecting the functions of communica tions for emergency responders 911 call centers and public alerts for example digital broadcasting used for emergency alerts can also be used to deliver info rmation to emergency responders the use of internet protocols ip provides st andard for networ k interconnectivity interoperable radio networks used by fi rst responders can open channel for real time participation by operators in 911 ca ll centers these same call centers can be used to generate local alerts over all type s of communications media to virtually any enabled device developing communica tions technologies with common elements provide synergies that bene fit both provider and user federal policy and congressi onal action tend to treat these three important areas of emergency communications through different agencies and different committees some observers cite crossagency coor dination at the fede ral level and cross jurisdiction cooperation at the congressional level as areas where rapprochement could facilitate homeland security becau the preponderance of incidents involving emergency workers occurs at the local level local state and regional participation and coordination are included in federal solutions encouraging the right balance of cooperative policy and federal leadership to support both daily operations and national response in catastrophic situations is one of the goals of congress among the implications for the 110th congress in addition to fundamental policy issues such as standards developm ent and funding is the possible need to explore the department of homeland secur itys response to enacted legislation for further information crs report rl33747 emergency communications legislation implications for the 110th congress by linda k moore the savings clause and monopoly issues8 the 1996 telecommunications act contains an antitrust savings clause that specifically states that neither the 1996 act nor any amendment to it should be construed to modify impair or supercede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws section 601bb codified at 47 usc 152 note in verizonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32949crs11 communications inc v law offices of curtis v trinko 540 us 398 2004 the supreme court denied the antitrust claim advanced by consumer of telecommunications services against local exchange carrier verizon that had previously been subject to regulatory discipline by both the federal communications commission and the new york public service commission according to the court the fact that verizon had been found to have breached its duty under the telecommunications act of 1996 to ad equately share its network with telecommunications companies includi ng att which provided service to trinko the consumer plaintiff wishin g to provide competitive local exchange services did not provide sufficient basis fo r finding violation of the antitrust laws despite the existence of the antitrustspecific savings clause the court said the act does not create new claims that go beyond existing antitrust standards trinko was received unfavorably by both the then chairman and ranking minority member of the house judiciary committee and by numerous commentators and members of the soca lled competitive telecom industry the ruling has also led to questions about its impact on th antitrust laws prohibition against monopolization creating partic ular apprehension about th fate of the essential facilities bottleneckwith reference to telecommunications doctrine that doctrine whose validity was seemingly questioned by the trinko court has been thought to require that the proprietor of facility deemed essential to competitors ability to compete share that facility with the competitor assuming that such sharing is feasible and the competitor is not r easonably able to duplicate the facility on the other hand the then chairman of the house energy and commerce committee who at that time was represen tative tauzin received the decision with approval in addition there are those who believe that trinko did violence to the saving clause they reason as the cour t appeared to that absent the 1996 acts imposition on local exchange carriers of the obligation to deal favorably with competitors verizon violated existing obligation under the antitrust laws in statement to the senate judiciary committ ee made just prior to the decision r hewitt pate then assistan t attorney general antitr ust division department of justice noted that passage of the 1996 act did not have the effect of increasing any partys obligations under the an titrust laws and that it is important to preserve the distinction between violation of the tel ecommunications act and violation of the sherman act if congress chooses to address this issue there are at least f our options available congress could choose to allow the current law to remain unchanged with respect to the savings clause it could amend the savings clause to clarify that the phrase the antitrust laws means the literal words of the statutory provisions but excludes any judicial interpretation of them it could amend the enforcement provisions of the act so that even if there had already been re gulatory action certain provisions of the act would remain enforceable by private indi viduals who are not competitors of lecs or it could characterize violation of any or some mandatory competitive obligations of the act as prima faci evidence of violation of the antimonopoly provision of the antitrust laws 15 usc 2 the last three might have the effect of providing the breadth of private action some members apparen tly thought they had

distinction between monopoly and monopolization in antitrust law by janice rubin spectrum auctions9 the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1993 pl 10366 amended the communications act of 1934 with number of important provisions affecting the availability of spectrum licenses the licensing improvement section of the act laid out the general requirements for the fcc to establish competitive bidding methodology and consider in the process objectives such as the development and rapid deployment of new technologies the law prohibited the fcc from making spectrum allocations decisions based solely or predomin ately on the expectation of federal revenues the emerging telecommunications technologies section directed the fcc to assign licenses for frequencies newly released for commercial use over period of at least 10 years as in the requirements for competitive bidding the fcc was instructed to ensure the ava ilability of frequencies for new technologies and services and also the availability of frequencies to stimulate the development of wireless technologies the fcc was furthe r required to address the feasibility of reallocating portions of the spectrum from current commercial nd other nonfederal uses to provide for more efficient use of spectrum and for innovation and marketplace developments that may affect the relative efficiencies of different spectrum allocations the balanced budget act of 1997 p l 10533 also contained spectrum management provisions it expanded and broadened the f ccs auction authority and modified other aspects of spectrum manageme nt the act also planned for the auction of spectrum licenses in airwaves that w ould be vacated by broadcasters as they moved from analog to digital broadcasting technology proceeds from spectrum license sales are presently attributed to general revenue in the us budget in the 108th congress however precedent was established with the creation of spectrum relocation fund to hold proceeds from the auction of specified radio frequencies allocated to federal use federal agencies vacating spectrum to be auctioned for commercial use are being compensated from the fund for costs of

communications commission fcc to establish policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all americans including those in rural insular and high cost areas at reasonable rates the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 not only codified this long standing commitment but also expanded the concept to include among ot her principles that universal service support be made available to qualifying schools libraries and rural healthcare providers and other nontrad itional providers known as ligible telecommunications carriers etcs over the years the universal service concept fostered the development of various fcc policies nd programs and an explicit universal service fund usf was established to provi the necessary funding there is growing consensus however that the usf as presently designed is longer sustainable and universal service policies are threatened absent significant usf reform section 254 of the 1934 communications act requires the fcc to ensure

has ta ken and will continue to take action to sustain the usf there is growing consensus that legislation will be needed to fully address the modifications needed to not only ensure the viability of the usf but also address the myriad issues surrounding usf reform members in both the house and senate have expressed desire to address this issue and it is likely that usf reform will play key role
