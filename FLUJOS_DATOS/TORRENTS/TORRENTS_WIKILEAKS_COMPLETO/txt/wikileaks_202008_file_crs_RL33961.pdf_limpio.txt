arab league member from buying from selling to or entering into business contract with either the israeli government or an israeli citizen the secondary boycott extends the primary boycott to any entity worldwide that does business with israel blacklist of global firms that engage in business with israel is maintained by the central boycott office and disseminated to arab league members the tertiary boycott prohibits an arab league member and its nationals from doing business with company that in turn deals with companies that have been blacklisted by the arab league the boycott also applies to companies that the arab league identifies as having zionist sympathizers in executive positions or on the bo ard of the company according to one analyst the nature and detail of these rules reflect the boycotting countries tolerance for only the most minimal contacts with israel 3 the arab league does not enforce the boycott and boycott regulations are not binding on member states however the regulations have been the model for various laws implemented by member countries the league recommends that member countries demand certificates of origin on all goods acquired from suppliers to ensure that such goods meet all aspects of the boycott overall enforcement of the boycott by member countries appears sporadic some arab league members have limited trading relations with israel the arab league does not formally or publicly state which countries enforce the boycott and which do not some arab league member governments have maintained that only the arab league as the formal body enforcing the boycott can revoke the boycott however adherence to the boycott is an individual matter for each arab league member and enforcement varies by state there are indications that some arab league countries publicly support the boycott while continuing to quietly trade with israel according to doron peskin head of research at infoprod consulting firm for foreign and israeli companies sp ecializing in trade with arab states the arab boycott is now just lip service4 this sentiment has been echoed by arab officials albeit anonymously one official commented to the egyptian newspaper alahram that boycotting israel is something that we talk about and include in our official documents but it is not something that we actually carry outat least not in most arab states 5 others assert that enforcement of the boycott waxes and wanes with the level of intensity of the israelipalestinian issue and that currently intere st in boycott enforcement among arab countries may be increasing due to the ongoing iraq conflict however the arab league has acknowledged that us pressure has affected its ability to maintain the boycott at the may 2006 arab league conference on the boycott one conference participant reportedly said the majority of arab countries are evading the boycott notably the gulf states and especially saudi arabia 6 he added 3 howard n fenton iii united

us pressures in the direction of normalization with the jewish state7 some states and entities have formally ended the boycott or at least some aspects of it egypt 1979 the palestinian authority 1993 and jordan 1994 signed peace treaties or agreements that ended the boycott8 mauritania which never applied the boycott established diplomatic relations with israel in 1999 algeria morocco and tunisia do not enforce the boycott9 in 1994 the member countries of the gulf cooperation council gccbahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emiratesannounced that they would only enforce the primary boycott in 1996 the gcc states recognized that total elimination of the boycott is necessary step for peace and economic development in the region however us companies continue to receive requests to cooperate with the boycott from gcc member countries lebanon enforces the primary secondary and tertiary boycotts 10

denied to israel by companies adhering to the boycott is difficult to measure the effect of the primary boycott appears limited since intraregional trade and investment are small nonetheless there is some limited trade between israel and its arab neighbors in 2004 according to the manufacturers association of israel ima israeli exports to arab countries and entities mainly egypt jordan and the palestinian authority totaled 192 million 11 enforcement of the secondary and tertiary boycotts have decreased over time reducing their effect 1996 study by researchers at tel aviv university looked at the effect of the arab boycott on the israeli economy through the automobile market following relaxation of boycott enforcement in the late 1980s through the early 1990s asian countries began exporting cars to israel the study found that if the boycott had c ontinued to be enforced and these cars did not enter the israeli market the israeli car market would have been 12 smaller leading to 790 price increase per car total welfare loss for the study year 1994 would have been an estimated 89 million 12 thus it appears that since intraregional trade is small and that the secondary and tertiary boycotts are not aggressively enforced the boycott may not currently have an extensive effect on the israeli economy 7 ibid 8 egyptianisraeli peace treaty march 26 1979 article iii paragraph

the boycott remains of strong symbolic importance to all parties many arab countries want to deny normalization with israel until there is final resolution to the conflict in the palestinian territories israel on the other hand asserts that it wants to be accepted in the neighborhood both in political terms and as source of and target for foreign investment13

been included in successive foreign operations appropriations legislation concerning the boycott section 635 of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 states that it is the sense of congress that 1 the arab league boycott is an impediment to peace in the region and to united states investment and trade in the region 2 the boycott should be revoked and the central boycott office disbanded 3 all arab league states should normalize relations with israel and 4 the president and the secretary of state should continue to oppose the boycott vigorously and encourage arab states to assume normal trading relations with israel and 5 the president should report to congress annually on specific steps being taken by the united states to encourage arab league states to normalize their relations with israel to bring about the termination of the boycott the us government also works to end the boycott through bilateral and multilateral trade agreements during fta negotiations with bahr ain oman and the united arab emirates the status of the boycott was an issue of concern and these countries reaffirmed their position not to comply with the boycott 14 however the credibility of their position has been questioned since all three countries outwardly continue to support the boycott in june 2006 an omani customs official reportedly told the jerusalem post products from israel are not permitted because of the boycott if someone brings products from israel they will be confiscated15 in reported remarks before bahrains chamber of commerce bahraini foreign minister sheikh khalid bin ahmed khalifa stated that relations would be normal with israel when the arab league orders the arab countries to end the boycott and until then the kingdom was sticking to the boycott 16 the united states began negotiating an fta with the united arab emirates uae in 2005 and their enforcement of the boycott has been contentious issue during the negotiations in february 2006 at the height of debate in the united states over whether to allow dubai ports world to have control over six us ports muhammad rashid adin staff member of the dubai customs department reportedly told the

usuae fta talks are on hold and it is expected that talks will not resume during the bush administration18 multilaterally the united states has used saudi arabias accession to the world trade organization in return for its agreement in november 2005 that it would cease participation in the boycott despite this concession it appears that saudi arabias enforcement of the boycott is ongoing the bush administration argues in the 2007 national trade estimate report nte that saudi boycott violations appear to reflect outofdate language in recycled commercial and tender documents 19 however in june 2006 the jerusalem post said that saudi arabias ambassador to the united states told luncheon audience at the brookings institution that saudi arabia intends to continue enforcing the primary boycott reportedly prince turki alfaisel stated that he believed the primary boycott is an issue of national sovereignty guaranteed within the makeup of the wto and its rules20 lastly concerns have emerged that iraq has increased its own enforcement of the boycott in the past several years due to increasing frustrati on with the ongoing violence and us presence21 in fy2007 the number of requests from iraq for us companies to comply with the boycott was 72 an increase from 31 in fy2006 and 8 in 2005 the commerce department reports that for all boycott countries during fy2007 us companies

legislation in the late 1970s to discourage us individuals from cooperating with the secondary and tertiary boycotts antiboycott laws apply to us exports and imports financing forwarding and shipping and certain other transactions that may take place wholly offshore23 although us legislation and practices were design ed to counteract the arab league boycott of israel in practice they apply to all nonsanctioned boycotts according to the department of commerces office of antiboycott compliance the legislation was enacted to encourage and in specified cases require us firms to refuse to participate in foreign boycotts that the united states does not sanction they the legislation have the effect of preventing us firms from being used to implement foreign policies of other nations which run counter to us policy 24 us regulations define cooperating with the boycott as 1 agreeing to refuse or actually refusing to do business in israel or with blacklisted company 2 agreeing to
