gschmidtgissnasagov steven sherwood stevensherwoodyaleedu frank wentz frankwentzremsscom ben i support you on this however there is more to be said than what you give below for instance it would be useful to note that in principle an audit scheme could be good thing if done properly but an audit must start at square one your point so one can appear to applaud mcintyre at first but then go on to note that his modus operandi seems to be flawed in this case as you have noted before if mc could not get the data from us then he could have got it from douglass given this it is strange to keep hounding us this would of course raise the issue of whether the douglass data are the same as ours andor the same as in ccsp 11 im not sure whether douglass et actually state that there data are the same as ccsp 11 but it would be good if they did because or ijoc data are the same as ccsp 11 mc could say that douglass already effectively audited our calculations from the raw data which is why he does not want toneed to repeat this step but if he does say this then why not get the data from douglass have go at writing something but try to preempt any come back from mc or others also dont just consider our case but put it as an example of more general issues the issue of auditing is tricky one the auditers must themselves be able to demonstrate that they have ulterior motives one way to do this would be to audit papers on both sides of an issue in other words both us and douglass should be audited together in sense our paper is an audit of douglass and we found his work to be flawed second opinion on this already exists through the refereeing of our paper i suppose third opinion from the likes of mc might be of value in controversial area like this but then is mc the right person to do this is he unbiased does he have the right credentials as statistician one could argue that ipcc had an auditing system in place this is partly through the multiple levels of review but doesnt each chapter have another persons to sign off on the responses to review comments there are some interesting general issues here tom im happy to coauthor anything you write dear folks there has been some additional fallout from the publication of our paper in the international journal of climatology after reading steven mcintyres discussion of our paper on climateauditcom and reading about my failure to provide mcintyre with the data he requested an official at doe headquarters has written to cherry murray at llnl claiming that my behavior is bringing llnls good name into disrepute cherry is the principal associate director for science and technology at llnl and reports to llnls director george miller im getting sick of this kind of stuff and am tired of simply taking it on the chin accordingly i have been trying to evaluate my options i believe that one option is to write letter to nature briefly outlining some of the events that have transpired subsequent to the publication of our ijoc paper nature would be logical choice for such letter since they published brief account of our findings in their research highlights section the letter would provide some public record of my position regarding mcintyres data request and would note that all of the raw gridded model and observational data used in the 2008 santer et international journal of climatology ijoc paper are freely available to mr mcintyre if mr mcintyre wishes to audit us and determine whether the conclusions reached in our paper are sound he has all the information necessary to conduct such an audit providing mr mcintyre with the quantities that i derived from the raw model data spatiallyaveraged time series of surface temperatures and synthetic microwave sounding unit msu temperatures would defeat the very purpose of an audit email from ben santer to tom karl nov 11 2008 i think that some form of public record would be helpful particularly if llnl management continues to receive emails alleging that my behavior is tarnishing llnls scientific reputation since it was my decision not to provide mcintyre with derived quantities synthetic msu temperatures im perfectly happy to be the sole author of such letter to nature your thoughts or advice in this matter would be much appreciated with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence
