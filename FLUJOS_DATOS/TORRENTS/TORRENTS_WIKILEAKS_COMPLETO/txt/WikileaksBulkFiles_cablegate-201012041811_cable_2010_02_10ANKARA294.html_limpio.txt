what next in akpmilitary clash ref ankara 150 b ankara 53 and previous c ankara 107 classified by ambassador james f jeffrey reasons 14 bd 1 c summary on february 22 police detained 47 retired and activeduty military officers including 17 flaggrade officers for according to press reports their alleged involvement in coup plots dating back to 20032004 although coverage of the detentions blanketed the press neither the turkish general staff tgs nor the government appear publicly outraged in the case of tgs or congratulatory the governing justice and development party by the actions there has been official statement from the tgs and pm ergodan took back seat by stating that the police were simply acting on order from the judiciary his attack dog deputy pm arinc was more polemical chod gen basbug announced that he has postponed imminent travel to egypt and late on february 23 called an emergency meeting with his fourstar generals and admirals prosecutors have now detained all of the force commanders from the 20032004 period with the exception of former chod hilmi ozkok and former turkish land forces commander aytac yalman end summary unprecedented arrests 2 sbu on february 22 nearly 50 retired and current military officers and one nco were detained likely for their alleged connections to the sledgehammer balyoz investigations the homes and offices of many retired flag officers were also searched and police seized and removed documents for further inspection among those detained were four active duty admirals and 17 retired generals including ergin saygun former deputy chod 20062008 and 1st army commander 20082009 saygun is very wellknown to the us he was our primary coordinator on antiterrorism issues for many years and had accompanied pm erdogan during his november 2007 visit to washington ibrahim firtina former air force chief from 20032005 firtina was questioned in december 2009 by the ergenekon prosecutors and has been implicated in the press for his role in the sledgehammer operation cetin dogan former 1st army commander 20022004 ozden ornek former navy chief 2003 2005 orneks diary which allegedly details discussions among senior military officers to start coup between 20032005 is being used by prosecutors as their primary source of evidence ornek was also questioned by ergenekon prosecutors in december 2009 engin alan ltg retired suha tanyeli bg retired tanyeli was head of the tgs strategic research center sarem 3 c the operation itself appears to have been well coordinated as detentions and searches took place simultaneously in ankara istanbul izmir bursa diyarbakir hatay kocaeli and bodrum there have been official pronouncements regarding the reasons for the operation although the press widely suspects that the arrests are in connection with the 2003 sledgehammer plan which allegedly included plan to overthrow the akp government ref b and separate plot known as operation cage ref press reports state that many of the detained individuals signatures were found on sledgehammer documents the majority of individuals according to the press are being interrogated in istanbul but so what 4 c despite the press fury reaction from tgs and the government has been minimal tgs has yet to make official statement however tgs chod general ilker basbug postponed his official travel to egypt an extraordinary and ankara 00000294 002 of 003 unprecedented step and late on february 23 called an emergency meeting with his fourstar generals and admirals when asked about the arrests pm erdogan in spain for state visit told reporters that the police were acting on the order of the judiciary although few usual suspects inflammatory statements from the opposition such as republican peoples party chp chairman deniz baykals statement that the arrests made it feel was as if turkey was under occupation made it into the press initially overall press reactions were overshadowed the following day by other news stories markets opened up this morning and business continues as usual bad for tgs good for akp 5 c this is the largest roundup of military officers to date the lack of an immediate reaction from tgs may suggest that the current military leadership is either fully willing to allow this investigation and the democratic process to continue unimpeded or is waiting for akp to hang itself on unfounded allegations the military remains deeply unhappy about akps governance and is enraged at the steady campaign to erode the militarys standing in turkish society to date prosecutors have now detained all of the senior military commanders from the 20032004 period with the exception of former chod hilmi ozkok and former land forces commander aytac yalman and although the tgs seemed to be caught off balance and therefore was unwilling to speak up yesterday in strong opposition to these ongoing investigations it seems unlikely that it will remain silent 6 c akp appears to have concluded that it gains politically from the arrest of military officers having perhaps nevertheless learned from past experiences pm erdogan was shielded from what could have been outraged criticism by secularists by conveniently being outside of the country his absence also did not allow for any publicized urgent meeting with chod basbug as has happened in the past deputy pm bulent arincs statements appeared designed to spin these developments as yet another example of how times have changed in turkey and how the country is merely going through normalization period 7 c the next few days will prove interesting and possibly pivotal the judiciary has four days to either turn the detentions into formal arrests or release the individuals if formal charges are brought tgs will be forced to respond likewise lack of substantive evidence will rebound on the government and will give credence to accusations that the longrunning ergenekon investigation has deeper and more insidious design to undermine akps secular opposition 8 c some knowledgeable embassy officers see this latest step as more serious provocation that could trigger some type of unpredictable military reaction we will see comment 9 c to repeat the facts on this whole ergenekon set of events there is some fire behind the smoke the military obviously has plans to intervene if necessary in political affairs and can cite the 1982 constitution endorsed by the population per referendum which gives the military key role in overseeing democratic governments adherence to ataturkist principles largely defined as by the military and its friends in the bureaucracy and judiciary b pm erdogan supported by the eu and even many antierdogan turkes who want to see the military out of politics legitimately wants to rein in this droit regard status c but pm erdogan realizes that elections are coming up and that he did relatively poorly in last years elections 38 but brilliantly in 2007 47 akp win when he played off the militarys counterproductive threats d thus much of this is electoral poiltics albeit of ankara 00000294 003 of 003 below the belt contact sport variety all this is exacerbated by the thuggish authoritarian behavior of the police and judiciary reflecting prevailing tendencies in this society including in the military in the us prosecutor or detective would simply have visited the generals in question to post questions invites to the precinct reading of rights indictments arrests and detentions follow only after the amassing of evidence and clear indications of case winnable in court not here anyone even suspected of having information is hauled before the police armed with automatic weapons and humiliated before the press its always been that way now its happening also to the top brass and their friends f up to now however most of those so publicly humiliated are eventually released due to patent innocencea lack of evidence as in the recent special forces officers planning arincs assassination caper ref or because the judiciary throws the whole process out ie the law making military officers subject to civilian courts ref c g but every day is new one here and one can be certain where this whole choreography will fall out of whack then look out jeffrey visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwintelinks govgovwikiportalturkey
