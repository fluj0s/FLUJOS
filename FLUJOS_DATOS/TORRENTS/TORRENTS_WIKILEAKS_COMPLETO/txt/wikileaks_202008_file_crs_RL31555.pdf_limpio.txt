us policy advances the national interest in reducing the role of the peoples republic of china prc in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd and missiles that could deliver them recipients of chinas technology reportedly include pakistan and countries that the state department says support terrorism such as iran and north korea this crs report updated as warranted discusses the security problem of chinas role in weapons proliferation and issues related to the us policy response since the mid1990s china has taken some steps to mollify us and other foreign concerns about its role in weapons proliferation nonetheless supplies from china have aggravated trends that result in ambiguous technical aid more indigenous capabi lities longerrange missiles and secondary retransferred proliferation according to unclassi fied intelligence reports submitted as required to congress china has been key supplier of technology to north korea iran and pakistan for use in programs to develop ballistic missiles chemical weapons or nuclear weapons policy issues in seeking prc cooperation have concerned summits sanctions and satellite exports on november 21 2000 the clinton administ ration agreed to waive missile proliferation sanctions resume processing licenses to export satellites to china and discuss an extension of the bilateral space launch agreement in return for another promise from china on missile nonproliferation however ongoing prc proliferation activities again raised questions about sanctions in contrast to the clinton administration the bush administration repeatedly imposed sanctions on prc entities for troublesome transfers on 20 occasions the bush administration imposed sanctions on 34 different prc entities not the government for transfers related to missiles and chemical weapons to pakistan iran or another country including repeated sanctions on some serial proliferators among those sanctions in september 2001 the administration imposed missile proliferation sanctions that effectively denied satellite exports for two years after prc company transferred technology to pakistan despite the november 2000 promise in september 2003 the state department imposed additional sanctions on norinco defense industrial entity effectively denying satellite exports to china however for six times the state department waived this sanction for the ban on imports of other prc government products related to missiles space systems electronics and military aircraft and then issued permanent waiver in march 2007 skeptics question whether chinas cooperation in weapons nonproliferation has warranted the us pursuit of closer bilateral ties even as sanctions were required against some prc supplies of sensitive technology some question the imposition of numerous us sanctions targeting prc entities but not the prc government others question the effectiveness of any stress on sanctions over diplomacy since 2002 the united states has relied on chinas considerable influence on north korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and praised its role but beijing has hosted the sixparty talks with limited results while the united states resumed bilateral negotiations with north korea china has evolved to vote for some security council sanctions against nuclear proliferation but also has pursued balanced positions on north korea and iran including questionable enforcement of sanctions and continued economic and energy deals some call for pressing beijing to use effective leverage against pyongyang and tehran the 111 th congress might reassess us policy to ensure more effective prc cooperation in stemming weapons proliferation in north korea and iran including whether to impose sanctions against foreign enterprises with deals in those countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31555g5g145g146g151g138g561g138g151 g141g561g18g155g152g149g146g143g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 g152g143g561g25g142

other countries concerns by increasing its partial participation in international nonproliferation regimes and issuing export control regulations however questions have remained china first promised tentatively to abide by the missile technology control regime mtcr in november 1991 and february 1992 and later reaffirmed that commitment in an october 4 19 94 joint statement with the united states the mtcr set up in 1987 is not an international agreement and has legal authority leaving issues about us sanctions to shore up the standards unresolved it is set of voluntary guidelines that seeks to control the transfer of ballistic and cruise missiles that are inherently capable of delivering at least 500 kg 1100 lb payload to at least 300 km 186 called category i or mtcrclass missiles it was unclear whether china adhered to the revised mtcr guidelines of 1993 calling for the presumption to deny transfers of any missiles capable of delivering any wmd not just nuclear weapons 1996 state depart ment fact sheet said that china unilaterally committed to controlling exports consistent with the mtcr guidelines and annex with the mtcr consisting of common export control policy guidelines applied to common list of controlled items annex however senate foreign relations committee report of september 11 2000 said the state department had argued to congress that china agreed to the mtcr guidelines but not the annex on november 21 2000 beijing said that it has intention of assisting any other country in developing ballistic missiles that can be used to deliver nuclear weapons missiles with payloads of at least 500 kg and ranges of at least 300 km and promised to issue missilerelated export controls as soon as possible after contentious period that saw new us sanctions the prc finally published those regulations and the control list modeled on the mtcr on august 25 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31555g5g145g146g151g138g561g138g151

policymakers faced the issue of whether to impose sanctions on the prc for technology transfers to pakistans nuclear program and beijing issued another nuclear nonproliferation pledge since then the united states has maintained concernsbut at lower levelabout continued prc nuclear cooperation with pakistan particularly involving the construction of nuclear power plants at chashma the prc government is believed to know about some if not all of the ongoing nuclear cooperation with pakistan nonetheless in 2004 the bush administration supported chinas applicati on to join the nuclear suppliers group nsg despite congressional concerns about chinas failure to apply the nsgs fullscope safeguards to its nuclear projects in pakistan fullscope safeguards apply iaea inspections to all other declared nuclear facilities in addition to the facility importing supplies in order to prevent diversions to any weapon programs

as amended by the nuclear prolifer ation prevention act of 1994 title viii of pl 103236 on february 5 1996 the washington times disclosed intelligence reports that the china national nuclear corporation stateowne d corporation transferred to the aq khan research laboratory in kahuta pakistan 5000 ring magnets that can be used in gas centrifuges to enrich uranium reportedly intelligence experts believed that the magnets provided to pakistan were to be used in special suspension bearings at the top of rotating cylinders in the centrifuges the new york times on may 12 1996 reported that the shipment was made after june 1994 and was worth 70000 the prc company involved was china nuclear energy industry corporation subsidiary of the china national nuclear corporation the state departments report on nonproliferation efforts in south asia issued on january 21 1997 confirmed that between late 1994 and mid1995 chinese entity transferred large number of ring magnets to pakistan for use in its uranium enrichment program the clinton administrations decisionmaking wa s complicated by considerations of us corporations doing business in china official s reportedly considered

roslehtinen asked about prc pressure to accept the deal assistant secretary of state chris hill did not deny that beijing exerted pressure and noted that there were earlier prc drafts that were absolutely unacceptable while the mention of light water reactor was not welcomed he testified nonetheless that the united states benefitted from chinas strong desire to reach deal and we can work

testfiring seven ballistic missiles including the first test of taepo dong2 icbm under development with range perhaps 37 00 miles that could reach alaska 53 after the dprk began preparations in may

members asked about chinas role brigadier general john allen principal director for asian and pacific affa irs at the office of the secretary of defense testified that the prc tried to dissuade north korea from steps that would be destabilizing and run counter to the sixparty talks however the prcs use of leverage including the plas opposition or acquiescence to the dprks missile program was unclear indeed there was high level contact between the militaries of the prc and dprk shortly before the july 2006 missile tests similar to that before the august 1998 missile firing on june 21 2006 the pla chief of general staff general liang guanglie told dprk military visitor that the pla will expand cooperation with the korean peoples army on july 4 2006 washington time north korea fired taepo dong2 icbm that failed in less than 40 seconds after launch and several shortrange scuds and mediumrange nodongs bringing washingtons condemnation for this provocative act threatened by the missiles japan called for security council action the prcs less forceful reaction was to express grave concern about the situation and to call for restraint from all countries on july 5 senator john mccain stated that china and russia have the most leverage over north korea and warned that their posture will have heavy impact on our relations in phone call with president bush on july 6 prc ruler hu jintao expressed deep concerns about the situation but also warned against actions that might aggravate the situation 54 on july 7 with us support japan sponsored unsc resolution that invoked chapter vii of the charter language for sanctions andor force but china countered with nonbinding statement by the president of the security council with mention of chapter vii chinas draft statement

secretary of state chris hill reported from beijing on july 12 that chinas diplomatic mission failed to achieve progress in getting pyongyang back to the talks on july 12 china and russia reportedly dropped their pursuit of draft statement to sponsor draft unsc resolution that countered japans resolution primarily by withholding authority under chapter vii for sanctions or use of force still chinas resolution called for nations to resume the sixparty talks and refrain from supplying technology or funds to the dprks missile program despite similar goals beijings envoy threatened to veto japans resolution ultimately negotiations led to unsc resolution 1695 that was adopted unanimously on july 15 2006 condemning the dprks missile launches demanding that it suspend its missile program requiring all countries to prevent technology transfers to its missile or wmd programs requiring countries to prevent missile proliferation from the dprk and financial transfers to its missile or wmd programs as well as urging the dprk in particular to show restraint and return to the six party talks with implementation of the september 2005 joint statement and abandonment of all nuclear weapons and nuclear programs however chinas statement on the resolution urged all countries to practice restraint still in her public reaction the next day secretary of state rice maintained that north korea was isolated and singled out china for voting affirmatively for the resolution stressing that it requires countries to prevent dangerous technology transfers to north korea while in st petersburg russia the next day for the group of eight summit president bush thanked hu jintao for his leadership on the resolution also on july 26 2006 the white house confirmed reports that in late 2005 china had frozen north korean assets in the bank of china for counterfeiting the prc currency 55 nonetheless at hearing of the senate foreign relations committee on july 20 2006 chairman richard lugar pointed out that china facilitated talks on the dprk while continuing to supply key energy and lifelines into north korea he warned that although china wanted to avoid regional instability the missiles tests were destabilizing chinas ability to secure global benefits for its high economic growth rates depended on continued cooperation with the west and beijing must reassess its regional priorities it remained unclear whether china supported use of chapter vii although assistant secretary hill testified that the resolutions language on international peace and security was reference to chapter vii despite the unsc resolution china criticized japans sanctions on september 19 and refused to attend meeting of eight countries to discuss the dprk at the two days later meanwhile in late september 2006 the house and senate passed the conference report for the national defense authorization act for fy2007 pl 109364 that required the president to appoint north korea policy coordinator

evolution on october 17 rice left fo r japan and south korea allies first china and russia saying she expected every country to fully implement all aspects of resolution 1718 she also defended the administrations approach saying what the president has done in putting together this coalition with china at the center of it willing to go along with chapter 7 is quite remarkable 58 in beijing rice boasted to traveling reporters on october 20 that china is now committed to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula rather than washington dealing bilaterally with pyongyang however chinas enforcement of the resolution was questionable as it called for cooperative action in inspection and not interception or interdiction of cargo also while any prc sanctions under its strict interpretation of resolution 1718 might seek to counter the dprks weaponsrelated activities they might not be sufficiently broad or effective in achieving the ultimate unrealized goal of the dismantlement of north koreas nuclear weapons and programs chinas agreement to ban luxury goods might have indicated its disapproval of the defiance of kims regime but luxury goods were not defined

iaea the state department issued press statement and fact sheet but not the usdprk agreement itself the state department vaguely cited agreement in written joint document and certain other understandings for measures that will serve as the baseline for verification protocol 81 however despite the lack of verification protocol timeline for one or an agreement at the sixparty talks the secretary of state immediately rescinded the designation of the dprk as state sponsor of terrorism this controversial decision was retreat from the earlier us position of first getting dprk acceptance of verification protocol as officials stated even then on november 12 the dprk denied it had agreed to all the us verification measures specifically sampling in the written agreement negotiated with hill after bilateral talks between hill and his dprk counterpart in singapore on december 45 negotiators convened the sixparty talks in beijing on december 811 but failed to get the dprks agreement on an effective verification protocol despite the usdprk agreement in october and what the united states called chinas crucial role critics charged that the sixparty talks saw their final collapse failed even to address the dprks nuclear weapons and drove wedges into the usjapan and ussouth korea alliances in this view the united states could put pressure on beijing to use its leverage more effectively on pyongyang instead of giving concessions to north korea and compliments to china 82

to the dci on iraqs wmd issued on september 30 2004 charles duelfer provided some details about iraqs past procurement efforts from number of countries including china before the war that began in 2003 the top three countries with entities receiving oil vouchers were russia 30 france 15 and china 10 firms in china supplied iraq with limited but critical items including gyroscopes accelerometers graphite and telecommunications in mid2001 an unidentified prc firm reportedly supplied 1020 gyros and 20 accelerometers for use in iraqs samud ballistic missile prc supplies provided iraq with prohibited items mainly telecommunication equipment and items with ballistic missile applications the report referred to unnamed and named entities in china that supplied missilerelated technology including norinco chinese high committee for electron ic warfare ciec company siam premium products and cpmiec the report also noted that from 2002 until the beginning of hostilities in 2003 iraq imported rocket guidance software from china disguised as childrens computer software the software was used to guide the missiles iraq fired at us forces in kuwait during the initial hostilities in 2003 iraq paid for the software with hard currency or oil nonetheless the report contended that there is evidence to suggest chinese government complicity in supplying prohibited goods to iraq it is likely that newly privatized stateowned companies were willing to circumvent export controls and official monitoring to supply prohibited goods the report also alluded to indications that the prc government had intervened in some deals to stop them 83 joby warrick and peter slevin libyan arms designs traced back to china washington post february 15 2004 also see bill gertz chinese documents

proliferation by the prc andor its organizations raises policy issues concerning 1 assessments of the nature and seriousness of the prc governments role in the proliferation threat 2 the priority of this issue relative to other us interests ie other security issues taiwan trade human rights and 3 us leadership and leverage including the use of sanctions and diplomacy and congressional actions to obtain chinas cooperation in nonproliferation g6g142g139g138g157g142g561 successive administrations have pursued policy of engagement with beijing some policymakers and advocates stress cooperative approach in 1998 president clinton issued certifications to implement the 1985 nuclear cooperation agreement the clinton administration also encouraged the prc to join the mtcr and proposed to allow more prc satellite launches in november 2000 the state department agreed to waive sanctions and consider new satellite exports in return for another missile nonproliferation pledge from china some officials and experts cite prc nonproliferation statements as signs that the united states made progress in nonproliferation goals some also say that us sanctions are counterproductive and are too broad rather they assert that china needs to recognize nonproliferation for its own national interests and develop stronger export controls perhaps with us assistance also some stress that china would be more cooperative if brought in to draw up the rules some argue that entities in china largely operate without the prc governments knowledge critics argue that the engagement policy needs tougher approach to counter chinas activities that undermine us security interests they note that prc weapons proliferation activities have continued and repeated prc assurances have proved to be unreliable also they say that us security interests are better served with stronger approach to stigmatize sensitive transfers which would include some sanctions some argue that the united states should not subsidize chinas missile and nuclear industries these proponents tend to see us leverage over china as stronger than chinas influence against the united states some are skeptical that china sees nonproliferation as in its national interest since beijing has made progress in nonproliferation commitments as part of improving relations with washington surrounding summits and tried to use its sales as form of leverage against washington especially on the issue of us arms sales to taiwan they stress that prc export controls are weak even as government repression can be harsh eg against journalists or dissidents they also doubt that trade in sensitive nuclear weapons and missile technology can continue without the knowledge of the prc government andor its military especially given the status of certain stateowned and defenseindustrial enterprises as serial proliferators g22g145g142g561g18g20g5g561g9g152g159g142g155g151g150g142g151g157g514g156g561g20g152g149g142g561 concerning the debate about any knowledge or pproval of the prc government at hearing of the senate armed services committee on march 19 2002 dci george tenet told senator carl levin that while prc firms

president clinton granted jiang zemin summits in washington on october 29 1997 and in beijing on june 29 1998 leading up to the 1997 summit the administration urged china to adopt comprehensive nationwide regulations on nuclear export control china responded by implementing set of regulations on nuclear export controls signed by premier li peng on september 10 1997 the regulations permit nuclear exports to only facilities under iaea safeguards china also joined the zangger committee on nuclear trade on october 16 1997 then china issued new export control regulations on dualuse nuclear items on june 17 1998 the 1998 summit in beijing produced an agreement on nontargeting nuclear weapons and joint statements on south asia and on biological weapons but china refused to join the mtcr saying that it was actively studying whether to join president bush raised the unresolved missile proliferation issue in shanghai in october 2001 and in beijing in february 2002 as deputy secretary of state richard armitage arrived in beijing to discuss the bushjiang summit in crawford tx on october 25 2002 china on august 25 2002 published the missile export control regulations promised in november 2000 along with control list that is modeled on the mtcr in addition on october 14 2002 the prc issued regulations for export controls over dualuse biological agents china continued to approach weapon nonproliferation as more part of the usprc relationship than commitment to international nonproliferation standards at that summit president bush called china an ally in the fight against terrorism with the improvement in usprc relations how ever some observers say that president bush has not forcefully pressed chinas leaders on weapons nonproliferation as priority issue even

nonproliferation and response the first pillar counter proliferation included interdiction deterrence and defense including preemptive measures and missile defenses some say that missile defense plays critical role in the strategy to counter the proliferation threat others say the september 2001 attacks increased doubts about the likelihood of terrorists using missiles for weapons delivery china has opposed us deployment of missile continued criticized the bush administration saying that sanctions are used but they are usually simply imposed rather than used as vehicle for trying to leverage

often centered on the questions of whether to impose unilateral sanctions under us laws to enact new legislation to tighten mandates for sanctions or reports or to integrate the multiple laws also there have been the issues of whether to target the prc government or prc entities usually stateowned defense industrial organizations like cpmiec or norinco and whether the prc government lacks the will or the capability to enforce its stated nonproliferation policy decisions on sanctions impact us credibility and leverage on the nonproliferation issue while certain prc transfers may not violate

question of whether sanctions should be used are disagreements about the most effective approach for curbing dangerous prc sales and promoting us interests and leadership some argue that cooperative approach rather than sanctions is more effective others say that current sanctions are not effective in countering the prcs proliferation practices especially with certain entities being repeatedly sanctioned negligible penalties and sanctions targeting companies but not the government and that legislation requiring sanctions should be toughened still others say sanctions stigmatize countries signal us resolve and shore up us credibility on this important security issue another option is to use seniorlevel diplomacy to achieve goals along with sanctions to deter proliferation

strengthen the in ternational nonproliferation regimes there are two prongs in such efforts 1 encouraging p rc support for strengthening the regimes eg the iaeas verification authority to enforce compliance and 2 filling gaps in chinas participation some say that efforts to include china would capitalize on its desire to be treated as great power and to be perceived as responsible world leader in addition they stress that china would be more cooperative if it helped to draw up the rules others argue that chinas participation would risk its obstruction of tighter export controls possible derailing of arms control efforts linkage of nonproliferation issues to the taiwan issue and access to intelligence sharing one basis for this view is the experience with the arms control in the middle east effort in the early 1990s in which china refused to cover missiles in the effort and later suspended its participation after president george hw bush decided in 1992 to sell taiwan f16
