ronald orourke specialist in naval affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the fy2006 budget completed the funding required in the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn account for the navys program to refuel and convert four trident ballistic missile submarines ssbns into cruisemissilecarrying and special operations forces sof support submarines ssgns initial operational capability ioc for the program was declared on november 1 2007 the total estimated cost of the program is about 40 billion this report will be updated as events warrant background trident submarines the navy procured 18 ohio ssbn726 class nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines ssbns between fy1974 and fy1991 to serve as part of the us strategic nuclear deterrent force they are commonly called trident submarines because they carry trident submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms the first trident entered service in 1981 the 18th in 1997 the first 8 ssbns 726 through 733 were originally armed with trident i c4 slbms the final 10 ssbns 734 through 743 were armed with larger and more powerful trident ii d5 slbms the boats were originally designed for 30year life but were later certified for 42year life composed of 20 years of operation twoyear midlife nuclear refueling overhaul and then another 20 years of operation origin of ssgn conversion concept the clinton administrations 1994 nuclear posture review npr recommended strategic nuclear force for the start ii strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty that included 14 tridents all armed with d5 missiles rather than 181 this recommendation prompted interest in congress and 1 consistent with this recommendation the 5th through 8th tridents were converted to carry the same d5 missiles carried by the 9th through 18th tridents these trident d5 conversions are not continued crs2 elsewhere in the idea of converting the first 4 trident ssbns ssbns 726 through 729 into nonstrategic submarines called ssgns2 so as to make good use of the 20 years of potential operational life remaining in these four boats and bolster the us attack submarine ssn fleet which has been significantly reduced in recent years the bush administrations 2002 npr retained the idea of reducing the trident ssbn force to 14 boats some observers supported the ssgn conversion concept3 while few others questioned it4 the navy in the late 1990s generally supported the concept in principle but also expressed concern over its ability to finance all four conversions while also funding other priorities congress as part of its action on the proposed fy1999 defense budget directed the secretary of defense to report on the issue to the congressional defense committees by march 1 1999 the report was delivered to congress in classified and unclassified form in june 1999 the bush administration highlighted the program as an example of defense transformation the bush administration in its amended fy2002 defense budget submitted to congress in june 2001 requested funding to begin the refueling and conversion of ssbns 727 and 729 and additional funding to begin the inactivation and dismantlement of ssbns 726 and 728 since the bush administration prior to submitting this budget had highlighted the trident ssgn concept as an example of defense transformation it came as somewhat of surprise particularly to supporters of the ssgn concept that the bush administration requested funding to convert only two of the four tridents navy officials said the decision was driven in part by navy budget constraints and that the deadline for 1 continued to be confused with the separate trident ssgn conversions discussed in this report the recommendation for 14boat force was made in expectation that the start ii treaty would enter into force the treaty has not entered into force section 1302 of the fy1998 defense authorization act prohibited us strategic nuclear forces from being reduced during fy1998 below start i levels including 18 trident ssbns until the start ii treaty entered into force this prohibition was extended through fy1999 by section 1501 of the fy1999 defense authorization act and was made permanent by section 1501 of the fy2000 defense authorization act the latter provision however also contained section that would permit reduction to 14 trident ssbns even without start ii entering into force if the president certifies to congress that this reduction would not undermine the effectiveness of us strategic nuclear forces for further discussion see crs report rl30033 arms control

submarine review january 1997 pp 79 crs3 committing to the refueling and conversion of ssbns 726 and 728 on timely basis5 had passed some time between late 2000 and june 2001 this also came as surprise to some observers since the navy during the intervening months had not done much to publicize the impending deadline the navy later explained however that refueling and converting ssbns 726 and 728 would still be possible if funds were provided in fy2002 though the schedule for planning and carrying out the operation would now be less than optimal congress in marking up the fy2002 budget increased funding for the program to the level the navy said was needed to support fourboat conversion program the bush administration subsequently pursued the program as fourboat effort description of the conversion the tridents as converted can carry up to 154 tomahawk cruise missiles or other nonstrategic land attack missiles and 66 navy seal special operations forces sof personnel6 each boat retains its 24 largediameter slbm launch tubes but the boats have been modified as follows slbm tubes 1 and 2 were altered to serve as lockout chambers for the sof personnel each chamber is equipped to connect to an advanced seal delivery system asds or dry deck shelter dds7 other spaces were converted to berth and support 66 sof personnel tubes 3 through 24 were modified to carry 7 tomahawks each for total of 154 tomahawks alternatively tubes 3 through 10 can be used to carry additional sof equipment and supplies leaving tubes 11 through 24 to carry 98 missiles the trident slbm fire control systems were replaced with tactical missile fire control systems and certain other systems aboard the boats were modernized in addition to these changes each boat underwent midlife engineering nuclear refueling overhaul ero without eros the boats would have exhausted their nuclear fuel cores and been inactivated in the fy2003fy2005 time frame missions and concept of operations each ssgn is to deploy for period of more than year during which time it is to be operated by dual blue and gold crews rotating on and off the ship every three or four months the aim is to have two of the four ssgns continuously forward deployed until the ships are decommissioned in the late 2020s as of september 30 2007 ssbns 726 and 727 were homeported in puget sound at bangor wa while ssbns 728 and 729 were homeported at kings bay ga the report of the 2001 quadrennial defense review submitted to congress in september 2001 directed the secretary of the navy to explore options for homeporting ssgns in 5 as matter of policy for ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear propulsion nuclear powered ships with exhausted nuclear fuel cores are not permitted to wait any significant time between the exhaustion of their nuclear fuel cores and the completion of preparations to refuel them if ship cannot go immediately into refueling operation it is instead permanently inactivated decision to refuel ship must therefore be made by certain date prior to the refueling so that the fuel cores and other equipment needed can be ordered and manufactured in time to be ready for installation when the ship comes into dry dock 6 the navys sof personnel are called seals which stands for sea air and land 7 the asds is new minisubmarine for navy seals the dds is lesscapable predecessor crs4 the western pacific8 ssbns 726 and 727 though homeported at bangor are operated out of the us territory of guam in the western pacific9 the ssgns are to operate as covert platforms for conducting strike ie land attack and sofsupport missions in the covert strike role the boats can fulfill substantial portion of the intheater tomahawk missile requirements that are established by regional us military commanders and thereby permit forwarddeployed multimission navy surface combatants and ssns to concentrate on other missions in their sofsupport role the ssgns can be viewed as functional replacements for the james k polk ssn645 and the kamehameha ssbn642 two oldergeneration ssbns that were converted into ssns specifically for supporting larger numbers of sof personnel the polk was retired in 1999 at age 33 the kamehameha was retired in 2002 at age 36 trident ssgns and navy transformation the bush administration and other supporters of the trident ssgn program highlighted the program as an example of defense transformation citing the conversion of strategicnuclearforces platform into nonstrategic platform the large number of cruise missiles that an ssgn will carry which is several times the number that can be carried by standard navy attack submarine and the large payload volume of the boats for carrying future advanced payloads others observers demurred arguing that navy has converted older ssbns into sofsupport submarines in the past that the larger number of cruise missiles that the ssgns carry is more of quantitative difference than qualitative one and that funding the trident ssgn program may actually have slowed the transformation of the navys submarine force by reducing the amount of funding available for research and development efforts supporting more radical and transformational changes to the virginiaclass attack submarine design the submarine community intends to maximize the transformational value of the ssgns by using them as atsea test beds for new ideas such as using submarines to deploy largediameter highly capable unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs even if one judges the program not transformational one might still judge it cost effective in terms of the capabilities it provides and in realizing full 42 year return on the original procurement cost of the boats program cost as shown in table 1 the navy estimates the total cost for refueling and converting four tridents including both research and development as well as procurement costs at about 40 billion or about 1 billion per boat this figure represents substantial increase over earlier estimates for fourboat program of about 24 billion in 19992000 and 33 billion to 35 billion in 20012002 refueling and converting four tridents avoids nearterm expenditure of about 440 million to inactivate and dismantle them the estimated net nearterm additional cost to the budget to convert the 4 boats rather than inactivate and dismantle them is thus 356 billion 40 billion less 440 million or about 890 million per boat dod estimated in 1999 that the operating and support cost for two ssgns over 20 years would be 16453 million in constant fy1998 dollars which equates to 17779 million in constant fy2005 dollars or an average of about 444 million per boat per year in constant 8 us department of defense quadrennial defense review report september 30 2001 p 27 9 sources oyaol

construction activities arms control and phantom warhead issue on may 13 2002 the administration announced that it had reached an agreement with russia on new strategic nuclear arms treaty that would require each side to reduce down to 1700 to 2200 strategic nuclear warheads by 2012 the agreement appears to resolve from the us perspective at least potential issue regarding the counting of phantom strategic nuclear warheads on converted trident ssgns11 10 associated press submarine ohio underway in pacific navytimescom october 23 2007 the conversion of ssbn726 began in november 2002 and was completed in december 2005 the ship reentered service in february 2006 the conversion of ssbn728 began in august 2003 and was completed in april 2006 the ship reentered service in may 2006 the

the ship reentered service in march 2008 11 under the previous start strategic nuclear arms reduction treaties the ssgns would remain accountable as strategic nuclear launch systems because they would retain their largediameter slbm launch tubes four ssgns even though they carried slbms would be counted as continued crs6 potential oversight issues for congress potential oversight questions for congress include the following why did the estimated cost of fourboat conversion program increase by more than 60 since 1999 2000 is the navy adequately funding programs for unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs and other advanced payloads so as to take full advantage of the ssgns large payload capacity if decision is made to reduce the trident ssbn force from 14 boats to 12 what would be the potential costs and merits of expanding the ssgn conversion program to include two additional trident boats since the navys plan for maintaining fleet in coming years of 313 ships includes 4 ssgns why does the navys 30year shipbuilding include replacements for the 4 ssgns resulting in the disappearance of ssgns from the fleet by 202812 how would continuing shortage of advanced seal delivery systems asdss affect the operational utility of the ssgns legislative activity for fy2009 the fy2009 defense appropriations act division c of hr 2638pl 110329 of september 30 2008 approved the navys fy2009 request for 3 million in other procurement navy opn funding for the ssgn program 11 continued carrying 96 trident slbms each with 4 nuclear warheads for total of 384 warheads having to include 384 phantom warheads within the allowed start ii us strategic nuclear force of 3500 warheads was viewed as problematic from us perspective since it would deprive the united states of about 11 of its permitted warheads the alternative of asking russia to exempt ssgns from the counting scheme was also viewed as problematic since russia would likely either refuse or ask for something significant in return the phantom warhead issue would have been even more pronounced under potential start iii treaty that might have limited the united states to 2500 or fewer nuclear warheads the phantom warhead issue appeared to have receded for time due to the administrations originally stated intention to not complete ratification of start ii and to instead reduce us strategic nuclear forces unilaterally without the use of new treaties this would leave only the older start i treaty with its much higher permitted nuclear force levels as an inforce treaty against which the ssgns could be counted on february 5 2002 however secretary of state colin powell announced that the united states was seeking legally binding agreement with russia on future levels of strategic nuclear weapons this created potential for the phantom warhead issue to once again become potentially relevant the new usrussian arms treaty announced on may 13 2002 resolved the issue from the us perspective by counting only operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads and not strategic nuclear launch systems since the ssgns will not deploy strategic nuclear warheads the administration is excluding them from the treatys limit of 1700 to 2200 operationally deployed warheads russia to date has not publicly objected to this interpretation 12 for more on the 313ship fleet and the 30year shipbuilding plan see crs
