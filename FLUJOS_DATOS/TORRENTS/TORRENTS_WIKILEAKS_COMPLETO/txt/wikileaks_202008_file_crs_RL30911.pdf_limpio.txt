supporters of the uk system maintain that it has improved the living standards of the elderly lessened the role of government in private lives increased saving and investment reassured workers that retirement benefits will be available to them and forestalled the large tax increases that would be needed to pay benefits under the old system they contend that its structure could be particularly instructive for the us because it is gradual process that maintains basic protection while slowly shifting part of the responsibility for retirement income to the private sector rather than undergoing potentially wrenching transition problems the process has built upon the existing public and private pension structure facilitated by the provision of incentives for workers to switch to private arrangements detractors say that the system has adverse social effects because it is disadvantageous for lower paid workers parttime workers and women they maintain that company pensions are not available to many workers and primarily benefit fulltime well paid employees furthermore if the pension is based on the workers own contributions they are forced to bear the risk of inadequate income in retirement due to poor investment performance or because the market dipped when they retired opponents also claim that these workers do not fare well with personal pensions because they carry high fixed administrative costs that continue in periods of unemployment when there is opportunity to contribute more to the pension have been poorly regulated leading to the misselling of pensions to workers who would have been better off staying in serps or an employer plan and provide inadequate retirement income given insufficient contributions or investment returns currently the uk system is undergoing further reforms that aim to make private pension coverage accessible to broader segment of the working population and improve benefits for lower paid workers who remain in the second tier of the public retirement system major changes include the introduction of stakeholder pension schemes and the new state second pension to replace serpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911contents

currently exceeds outgo it is generally recognized that the system will face financial problems in the next several decades due to the aging of the population and the retirement of the postworld war ii baby boom generation the ratio of workers to recipients is projected to fall from 34 to 1 today to 20 to 1 by 2050 the social security board of trustees projects that the systems expenditures will exceed its income in 2025 and do so until the social security trust funds are exhausted in 2038 on average over the next 75 years expenditures are projected to exceed income by 14 this phenomenon is not unique with few exceptions life expectancies are increasing throughout the world and the ratio of workers to retirees is shrinking in response other countries have undertaken various reforms one approach has been to switch greater responsibility for providing retirement income from state sponsored systems to workers own savings process commonly referred to as privatization the experiences of these countries especially chile have been cited as examples of how to change from traditional social insurance system in which workers receive retirement benefits that are defined by law and paid through the government to one in which workers receive retirement benefits from their own accumulated savings critics however maintain that circumstances in many of these countries were very different from those prevailing in the us such as being in earlier stages of economic development or in the case of chile under the control of military government that could replace failing social security system as part of wholesale economic reform designed to roll back socialism given this criticism it is logical to ask what other countries privatized in situations that are more similar to ours the social security system in the united kingdom uk is partially privatized in that workers can opt out of the part of the state provided pension program that is earningsrelated it has been suggested that the uk is especially relevant for the united states because it is similar to the us culturally economically politicall and demographically the uk and the us have industrial economies stable democratically elected governments aging populations and in many respects common heritage as in the us the uk population is aging although this is worldwide phenomenon it appears to be somewhat advanced in the uk for example in 1990 the population age 65 and older was equal to 24 of the working age population in the us the figure was 19 however by 2030 it is projected the figures will be much closer 39 and 35 respectively while the demographic trend is worrisome for uk policymakers it is not as acute as for most other european countries some of which are projected to have these ratios increase to almost 50 by 2030httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs2 1in defined benefit plan formula determines benefits eg 1 of final pay per year of service that the sponsor is obligated to honor ie the

accounts iras in the ushistory of social security in the uk government support for the elderly in the uk began in 1908 with the old age pensions act benefits were paid by the government and were limited to poor people over age 70 contributory program was introduced in 1925 with the widows orphans and old age contributory pensions act participation by workers was voluntary except for manual laborers and others with earnings under specified amount in 1942 economist sir william beveridge wrote report that urged the government to provide reliable retirement pension for all workers up to that time social insurance programs for the elderly had been limited to those whose family income was below certain thresholds this means testing carried such stigma that some who qualified for benefits preferred destitution to the indignity of being labeled poor beveridge proposed universal nonmeanstested program supported by the contributions of virtually all workers that would ensure minimum level of income for every citizen the beveridge report led to passage of the national insurance act of 1946 which created the current compulsory social insurance program responding to concerns that the basic pensio n under national insurance provided inadequate income in 1959 the government created secondtier benefit supplemental earningsrelated plan called graduated pension effective in 1961 this program also was criticized for providing inadequate income particularly since the amount of the additional pension was fixed at the time of retirement and declined in value thereafter due to inflation it was also becoming clear that the workers most likely to have adequate retirement income were those who also had pensions provided by their employers known as occupational pensions in part to narrow the gap between workers with and without employer pensions the 1975 social security pensions act replaced the graduated pensio n with more generous supplemental earningsrelated pension plan the state earningsrelated pension scheme serps effective in 1978 because serps was intended as backup for workers without employer pensions the act gave workers and private companies the option of leaving serps if they had defined benefit employer pension1 that offered retirement benefits equal to or greater than those provided by serps soon afterward projections of future costs grew rapidly leading to action by the government to curtail future serps benefits and provide workers not covered by an employer defined benefit plan the alternative of opting out of serps into an employer defined contribution plan2 or an appropriate personal pension3 app effective in 1988httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs3 4uk department of social security new contract for welfare partnership in pensions

system came under increasing criticism incentives were provided for employees to opt out of serps but the private alternatives to serps proved impractical for many workers employer plans were not availabl to many workers and personal pensions were disadvantageous for workers with low or unsteady earnings in widely publicized misselling cases many workers purchased personal pensions when it was not in their best interest to do so in december 1998 the uk government outlined its proposal for new pensions framework4 calling for the creation of stakeholder pension plans flexible feelimited defined contribution plans and the state second pension to replace serp s the proposal made changes to the basic state pension the uk government enacted legislation creating stakeholder pension

employees have the option of contracting out of serps if they have an employersponsored personal or stakeholder pension available starting in april 2001 changes in the serps benefit formula included in the social security act of 1986 resulted in lower benefits for workers who reach state pension age after april 5 1999 in the absence of recent policy changes see section on the state second pension below serps benefits would decline gradu ally from 25 of the highest 20 years of earnings to 20 of lifetime average indexed earnings in addition serps benefits are based on the portion of employee earnings between the lower and upper earnings limit the upper earnings limit is indexed to prices if wage growth exceeds price growth in the future as projected smaller proportion of earnings would be credited under serps and the value of serps benefits as proportion of earnings would decline for many workers options for contracting out of serps were expande d at the same time that serps benefits were reduced for future retirees employers have had the option to contract out of the second tier of the public system since 1961 if they offer qualified defined benefit plan in 1988 contractingout options were expanded to include employersponsored defined contribution plans and qualified personal pensions known as appropriate personal pensions increasing the private sectors role in the provision of retirement income see figure 1 despite the increased options for contracting out of serps choices remained limited for certain types of workers especially low to moderate earners who lacked access to an employersponsored plan more than onethird of employees do not have this option and persons with low or unsteady earnings do not fare well with personal pensions because high

involved older and lower paid workers given the effects of compounding personal pensions are more advantageous for younger higher paid workers who have longer periods to invest and can make regular contributions in amounts large enough to counteract high administrative fees charges can erode the value of an individuals account10 to address secondtier coverage gaps further changes are being made to the uk system reforms currently underway are designed to allow more individuals to replace serps with private arrangements and enhance benefits for lower paid workers and those with breaks in

frequently or work intermi ttently because they are not tied to single employer the ceiling on administrative charges is designed to benefit workers without an employer plan who find existing personal pensions too costly starting as early as april 2002 serps will be replaced with the state second pension designed to improve secondtier benefits for lower paid workers especially female parttime workers who lack private pensions and extend secondtier coverage to persons who leave the labor force for extended periods due to disability or family caregiving responsibilities caring for children or sick family members under the state second pension workers with annual earnings below specified amount the new low earnings threshold will be credited with earnings equal to the low earnings threshold which will be indexed to average wage growth in addition qualified caregivers and disabled persons with little or earnings for the year will be treated as if they had earnings equal to the low earnings threshold to protect their entitlement to benefits initially the state second pension will provide an earnings related benefit after stakeholder pensions have become established it will be converted to flatrate benefit providing an incentive for workers who earn more than the low earnings threshold to opt out of the state second pension in favor of private arrangements table 1

systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs10 adopting the uk approach to social security arguments for proponents of the uk system tout its beneficial effects at both the national and personal level they argue that the reform of the national pension system in large measure rescued the uk from the financial straits currently facing other european countries because it has fostered both lower government spending on entitlements and increased national savings without such reforms they say forecasts showed that to support the old system payroll taxes would have had to double in the 21st century they point out that the assets of employer pensions have grown from 36 of the uks gross domestic product gdp in 1983 to 77 of gdp in 1994 they attribute recent forecasts of the uks eventual retirement of its national debt to the savings fostered by the current design of the national pension system this forecast of low debt also allows the uk to easily meet the requirements under the european monetary union agreement that participating countries must have budget deficit of more than 3 of gdp proponents acknowledge that the uk system is hybrid rather than fully privatized system but they maintain that this is one of its strengths making it an appropriate model for the us system the system is balanced with the government still providing some benefits and continuing oversight and regulation to ensure that workers are protected from some of the dangers of marketplace risk this continued government involvement and oversight makes the system amenable to change when necessary for example since contracting out was enacted the government has ordered that private providers pay restitution to workers whom they misled into purchasing personal pensions in addition the government has required that employers provide protection against inflation both for annuitants and for accrued pension rights for workers who leave the firm another measure of balance is the diversification of risk between political and market forces provided by the mixture of public and private pensions recently in response to criticism that the current mix of pension provision is inadequate the uk government enacted legislation creating stakeholder pension schemes and the new state second pension to replace serps in an effort to improve retirement income for workers at all levels of income proponents contend that the transition made to the current system should serve as an example to other countries and effectively invalidates the argument that switching to privatized systems causes inordinately difficult transition problems among the lessons they cite are the use of the existing framework employerprovided pensions and private savings arrangements the provision of incentives for workers to voluntarily contract out of the earningsrelated state plan and the continuing existence of basic safety net to ensure level of protection for all workers they argue that intergenerational equity has been maintained by providing acceptable tradeof fs for younger workers to help bear the costs of continuing to maintain the benefits of current recipients while they move from financia lly and therefore politically insecure public retiremen t system vulnerable to benefit cuts andor contribution increases to portable system of privat pensions whose assets they believe to be more real and which they effectively ownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs11 11the investment company institu reports that one in three us households owned individual retirement accounts as of june 1999at another level proponents laud the beneficial effects of the uk reforms on individuals during the 1980s and 1990s the income of pensioners in the uk grew proportion ately faster than any other demographic group and the percentage of pensioners living in poverty fell dramatically during the period the income of pensioners increased by twothirds in real terms compared to twofifths increase in real avera ge wages proponents say that younger workers and future generations have been spared the crushing burden of what would have been huge unfunded liabilities had the system not been reformed proponents further contend that the standard of living for future retirees will be higher than if the old system had remained in force because of the higher rate of return inherent in private investments they state that because serps is payasyougo system as is social security in the united states it can at most pay the average worker rate of return equal to the rate of growth of average wages whereas the rate of return on the equity of funded occupational or personal pension plan historically has been considerably higher from 1986 to 1995 the annual gross rate of return for median private pension funds in the uk was 133 they argue that the enormous popularity of personal pensions illustrates this point when workers in the uk were first allowed to opt out of serps using personal pensions in 1988 the department of social security predicted that about half million workers would do so initially demand turned out to be much greater than projected by 1995 almost 6 million people had taken out personal pensi on many american workers already have individual retirement accounts iras whic h are very similar to uk personal pensions11 given the familiarity americans have with supplementary private retirement programs and the high rates of return the equity markets have provided to such plans over the past 20 years proponents say it seems likely that move to semiprivatized system would be popular among us workers arguments against critics of the uk system tend to focus on what they consider to be its adverse social effects including growing disparities in retirement income between low and high paid workers full and parttime workers male and female workers and informed and uninformed work ers they are concerned that the features of the system tend to create more unequal society in which some people win and some people lose and by increasing margins while conceding that pension income has risen on average during the past 2 decades critics point out that the increase was not equally distributed for example between 1979 and 1997 the median income of the wealthiest pensioners increased 80 in real terms compared to 34 for the poorest pensioners critics contend that these disparities will only worsen as the new pension system matures several reasons are cited for this forecast first due to the various deliberalizations mentioned earlier the lowest paid workers who probably will be totally reliant on national insurance benefits will have their standard of living steadilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs12 12the new stakeholder pension scheme is designed to alleviate these problemseroded second the most reliable predictor of adequate income in retirement is eligibility for an employer pension demographically employersponsored pension coverage is more concentrated on male higher paid fulltime fullcareer workers third the adequacy of personal pensions depends heavily on the ability of the workers to make regular contributions over lifetime with particular premium on contributions at earlier ages in amounts large enough to minimize administrative costs which are fixed and continue through periods of unemployment for lower paid workers these administrative charges may be quite high up to 30 of the total investment it is said that it is possible for worker with discontinuous employment to lose all of his or her contributions to administrative charges12 fourth government regulators have confirmed that personal pensions have been marketed and sold to many people who lack investment expertise and would be better off financi ally had they stayed in their employer pensions or in serps the selling of personal pensions is said to have affected 15 million workers mostly older and lower paid who were persuaded by overzealous sales agents to switch to risky inappropriate plans based on unduly optimistic estimates of rates of return the government has ordered companies to reimburse these workers at an estimated cost of 32 billion to date with total costs projected to reach 20 billion fifth critics argue that many people choose to contract out essentially because the government bribed them to do so through rebates and tax incentives as mentioned above many workers were induced to opt out when it was not to their advantage but critics contend that for many others the incentives were windfall and very costly to the taxpayer also higher paid workers are said to be particularly advantaged becau they receive more benefit both in money amounts and in proportion to their earnings from the preferential tax treatment given to pension contributions and income ie the tax preferences are regressive sixth critics maintain that the current system is particularly disadvantageous for women because they tend to have lower earnings shorter careers and longer lifespans employer pensions are of most benefit to employees who have lifelong record of fulltime employment in well paid occupation among married mothers who work large proportion do so in parttime labor only 12 of parttime workers were members of an employer pension in 1987 in addition uk actuarial tables use gender based life expectancy tables in computing annuities resulting in lower pension payments for women due to the longer period over which they are expected to receive benefits critics are also uncomfortable with the displacement of risk from the government and the employer to the individual worker under defined contribution and personal pension plans the value of the pension depends on the cost of annuities at the time of retirement and the performance of the stock market during the period of investment they point to the example of how worker retiring and buying an annuity on october 23 1987 would have received pension 30 lower than if he had retired week earlierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs13 13liu lillian retirement income security in the united kingdom social security bulletin v 62 n 1 1999although much of their concern is directed at personal pensions critics also warn that reliance on employer pensions presents problems as well much of their appeal is the provision of predictable practically inflationproof benefit of which the employer bears the investment risk these features exist largely because of governmentimposed requirements and employers are starting to compl ain about their onerousnes s although not widespread there is evidence that there is strong tendency for employers to choose defined contribution design when given the opportunity such as the creation of new plan critics are concerned that in the future workers will be increasingly uncertain of their eventual benefits and bear more investment risk they say it is unlikely that us employers would be willing to accept such degree of regulation and oversight critics also complain about the features of some defined benefit employer plans that can lead to maldistribution of benefits the design of employer pensions in the uk is gener ally free from legislative restrictions most defined benefit plans are based on final salary which critics say give an incentive to managers to award themselves large salary increases in their last year of empl oyment such plans also disadvantage workers whose earnings peak at midcareer or who retire or leave the firm early for workers who change employers currently the terms of transfer do not ensure that person with given number of years of service in defined benefit plan will carry that same number of years into new plan older workers for whom employer benefit costs are higher may run the risk of involuntary employment termination as for the effects on the economy critics say that claims of increased national savings ignore the substantial transition costs of providing incentives to contract out of serps according to government estimates the costs in terms of foregone revenue associated with the contracting out of serps into personal pensions were three times greater than the savings13 furthermore critics are concerned that the growing discrepancies in retirement income and the erosion of the floor of protection provided by national insurance may lead to increased welfare costs to the government in the long runhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs14 appendix detailed description of the uk social security system the uk social security system is twotiered semiprivatized

drawn criticism from some policymakers concerning the limitations associated with existing contractingout options particularly given the reduction in serps benefits for future retirees many workers do not have access to employersponsored plans and personal pensions are impractical for those with low earning s or unsteady work patterns some policymake rs expressed concern that without further adjustments to the public retirement system the income gap between the wealthiest and the poorest pensioners would continue to widen currently the uk government is phasing in series of new reforms including the introduction of stakeholder pensions and the new state second pension that aim to make private pensions accessible to broader segment of the working population and improve secondtier benefits for those who remain in the state system especially lower paid workers financing the basic state pension and serps are financed on payasyougo basis from contributions paid by workers and

retirement beyond the state pension age basic state pensions have been indexed since 1950 during the 1950s and 1960s pensions were indexed on an ad hoc basis between 1975 and 1981 pensions were automatically adjusted by the growth in either prices or earnings whichev er was greater since that time they have been indexed automatically to price growth resulting in decline in pension values relative to average earnings in 1978 the maximum basic state pension replaced about 25 of the average wage in 1998 it replaced 16 of the average wage if earnings continue to rise faster than prices as projected the value of the maximum basic state pension as percentage of average wages is projected to fall to 10 by 2030 and 75 by 205014 the basic state pensio n provides only minimal level of

security act of 2000 established the state second pension as replacement for serps the earliest implementation date for the state second pension is april 2002 the actual implementation date depends on

replacement rate of about 40 combined benefits replaced about 40 of workers earnings in the year before retirement serps benefit formula changes included in the social security act of 1986 as means to reduce future public pension costs resulted in lower benefits for workers who reach pensionable age after april 5 1999 in the absence of policy changes described below serps benefits would decline gradually from 25 of the highest 20 years of average indexed earnings to 20 of lifetime average indexed earnings16 furthermore benefits are based on workers earnings between the lower and upper earnings limit the upper earnings limit is indexed to prices if wages grow faster than prices as projected smaller proportion of earnings would be credited under serps and the value of serps benefits as proportion of earnings would decline over time as of march 1999 the average serps benefit was 2968 per week 43 for men 1685 per week 24 for women the maximum serps benefit was 12530 per week 180 currently serps spending is an estimated 47 billion 68 billion as early as april 200217 serps will be replaced with the state second pension the state second pension is designed to benefit primarily lower paid workers by providing higher benefit than serps18 and persons whose careers are interrupted by periods of disability or caring for children or sick family members by providing earnings credits during nonwork periods to protect their entitlement to benefits under the state second pension workers with earnings between the annual lower earnings limit the level of earnings at which individuals are automatically covered under the system and new higher low earnings threshold will be treated as if they had earnings equal to the low earnings threshold19 similarly caregivers and

social security the changing welfare state pensioner incomes march 2000 22employers are permitted to contract out employees who are members of an employer pension plan that meet the qualifying criteria in effect the option of contracting out is the employees as they decide whether to join or remain in such plans if they do not they must participate in serps or an appropriate personal pensionthe state second pension will be implemented in two stages in the first stage it will provide benefit based on earnings different accrual rates 40 10 and 20 will apply to three bands of earnings such that persons who have annual earnings between the lower earnings limit and an upp er threshold of 21600 31104 will receive benefit higher than they would have received under serps with the largest proportional increases going to the lowest earners persons with earnings of 21600 and higher will receive benefit equal to what they would have received under serps in the second stage which is to be implemented after stakeholder pensions have become established an estimated 5 years the state second pension will be converted to flatrate benefit based on the low earnings threshold for persons who have significant number of working years left at that point everyone who remains in the state second pension will be treated as if they had earnings equal to the low earnings threshold regardless of actual earnings the conversion to flatrate benefit is designed to encourage moderate and higher earners to make private secondtier arrangements such as an employer plan if available or stakeholder pension the government estimates that 18 million people will benefit from the state second pension including 14 million low and moderate earners 2 million caregivers and 2 million disabled persons the majority of low earners expected to benefit are female parttime workers who do not have private pension arrangements21 contracting out of serps currently workers may opt out of serps through membership in their employers pension plan or an appropriate personal pension22 starting in april 2001 employees will have the option to contract out of serps using newly established stakeholder pensions most workers who contract out of serps join an employersponsored defined benefit pension plan in which case their contributions and their employers contributions to the social security system are reduced by the equivalent of the estimated amortized cost of the pension originally the plan had to offer guaranteed minimum pension roughly equivalent to what serps would have

1999structure of the plan effective april 1997 since 1988 workers have had the option of choosing an employersponsored defined contribution plan or an appropriate personal pension in either case the contribution rate must at least equal the contractingout rebate or the amount that would produce the minimum pension requirements employees can make additional voluntary contributions to increase the value of the pension for the first 5 years the government encouraged workers without an employer pension to opt out of serps into an app by providing rebates on part of their national insurance contributions plus 2 bonus and the option to reenter serps from 19931994 through 19961997 the 2 bonus was reduced to 1 for those age 30 and over initially the government estimated that about 500000 people would contract out of serps in favor of personal pensions with the number eventually expected to reach 2 million by 1995 almost 6 million workers had opted for personal pensions 54 million having left serps and the remainder having left occupational pension plans23 the tax system provides another incentive to contract out of serps worker and employer contributions to both employer and private pensions are tax deductible and tax is payable on income or capital gains of the pension funds pension benefits are fully taxabl although the tax code provides additional tax breaks for retirees the governme nt requires that except for civil service and military pensions employer pensions must be fully funded for workers to be allowed to contract out of serps all but 5 of the investments of the pension fund must be outside the company and can revert to the company only in limited circumstances unlike employersponsored defined benefit plans in the us they must preserve the value of the benefits of employees who leave the firm before retirement by indexing the final salary by the rate of inflation up to 5 per year in addition unlike in the us the government requires that employer defined benefit pensions provide beneficiaries annual increases in benefits indexe d to inflation up to 5 per year in the us there is government requirement that employerprovide d pensions must index benefits to inflation most plans do not adjust benefits after retirement and those that do usually do so at rate well below that of inflation currently there are two types of personal pensions an appropriate personal pension is personal pension taken out in place of serps an ordinary personal pension is an individuallyarranged person pension usually taken out by the self employed who are not covered under serps or as an addition to serps or an employer pension with either type of personal pension worker may withdraw up to 25 of assets as taxfree lump sum upon retirement otherwise the assets must be used to purchase an annuity from life insurance company which pays the retiree an agreed upon income for the rest of his or her life flat payment annuities or annuities indexed to inflation are available the part of the personal pension that replaces serps however must be indexed to inflation up to 5 per year because some workers retire at time when annuities are very expensive rules allow them to defer their purchase until age 75httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30911crs20 24in november 1999 stakeholder pension schemes were established by the welfare reform and
