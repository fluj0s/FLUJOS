operation in chad as seriou sly deficient lack of the application of internal controls was found to be so widespread as to undermine the overall system of internal control this failure of the co ntrol infrastructure has had or is likely to have significant implications on the use of unhcr funds and on the achievement of programme objectives it should be taken into accou nt however that the situation in chad during 2003 was marked by the emergency nature of t he operation urgent attention by management and intervention by unhcr headquarters i s required to implement effective controls programme management for the main partner reviewed msfbelgium which ccounted for over 60 percent of the programme funds reasonable assurance could be take n that unhcr funds were properly accounted

cash up to us 100000 wer withdrawn from the bank and disbursed without adequate controls ocm informed that the documentation supporting expenditures of some us 90000 had now been submit ted leaving some us 95000 still unsupported monitoring of the operations in chad by the unhcr r epresentation in central african 3 republic was less than satisfactory to provide f inancial and administrative support to the chad operation unhcr bangui sent an associate prot ection officer with relevant experience in this area and with expertise to with an emergency operation of such magnitude many of the problems disclosed by the au dit could have been identified and corrective actions taken timely had proper financi monitoring been carried out supply management procurement activities were marked by serious defic iencies and noncompliance with unhcr procurement procedures purchases of signi ficant value were made without spending authority albeit much of the procurement exceeded the threshold of us 100000 approval of the headquarters committee on contracts was not sought ocm explained that the ert leader in charge of the management of the operations during the period under reviewed had been asked to comments oios has not yet received those comments the implementing partner msf levied operating margi ns of up to 25 percent on international procurement carried out on behalf of unhcr oios stimated that margins totalling some us 160000 were thus charged to the project witho ut legal basis in the subagreement in the view of oios excessive charges should be recov ered from msf records were kept of unhcrs assets with an esti mated value of several millions of us dollars this included light vehicles trucks and telecommunication equipment the assettrak system was only recently installed but w as not operational for fuel ocm paid 25 percent higher price than ther agencies since exemption from value added tax vat had been arranged base d on unhcr projected needs of fuel in 2004 oios estimated that some us 138000 could be saved yearly if the tax exemption was obtained ocm indicated that the vat exemption had now been btained security and safety security matters were not given the necessary atten tion and number of mandatory security requirements were not complied with ocm indicated that security measures had now been taken and would be further reinforced

the representation in bangui 2 oios previous audit of unhcr in chad was c onducted in february 2001 the review focused on 1999 and 2000 project and administrative expenditures totalling us 18 million the main issues pertained to unsatisfactory project monitoring inability to reconcile spmrs to partners books of accounts and significant unauth orized budgetary overruns serious deficiencies were also noted in the area of procure ment which had resulted in loss of us 80000 to unhcr 3 in early 2003 following the fighting in th darfur region of western sudan and in central african republic car tens of thousands f civilians were displaced in darfur while an estimated 110000 took refuge in neighbouring ch ad living in extremely precarious situations unhcr deployed an emergency response t eam to chad under the overall responsibility of the representation in bangui to deal with major influx of refugees and subsequently reestablished its presence in the cou ntry unhcr focussed its efforts on providing lifesaving assistance to vulnerable refu gees through number of implementing partners 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activities du ring the exit conference held on 7 april 2004 audit observations detailing the audit findings wer issued directly to the office of the chief of mission in may 2004 the replies which were recei ved in june 2004 are reflected in the audit report the chief of mission has accepted most of the audit recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets and compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subagreements 2 iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2003 programme activit ies under projects 03sbchdem130 and 03sbchdem133 with expenditure of us 64 millio n our review concentrated on the activities implemented by médécins sans frontières belgium msfb expenditure of us 2 million and croix rouge tchadienne crt expendi ture of us 04 million we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr w ith expenditure of us 4 million including procurement by sms 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th office of the chief of mission in ndjamena and its suboffice in abeche with adminis trative budgets totalling us 16 for 2003 record of the acquisition and current value of the assets purchased and used in the operation was available an issue addressed in the report th number of staff working for the unhcr operation in chad was 15 this included staff on re gular posts staff on temporary assistance united nations volunteers and staff on mission 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations supply management procurement 9 until late in 2003 in the absence of unh cr representation in chad the unhcr representation in car was responsible for the monit oring of the emergency operations implemented in chad by an emergency relief team therefore the approval for the procurement of goods or services was to be sought f rom the lcc in bangui or the hcc as appropriate since such committee was establishe d in ndjamena 10 oios noted serious deficiencies and nonco mpliance with unhcr procurement procedures purchases of significant value were made without any evidence that goods and services were procured competitively and without d ue regard to spending authority limits in effect much of the procurement exceeded the thresh old of us 100000 and should have been submitted to the headquarters committee on contract s in some instances the representation in bangui provided specific guidanceinstructions which the emergency relief team ert chose to ignore 11 for example in october 2003 the ert proc ured buckets at cost of some us 113000 although the procurement exceeded the threshold of us 100000 approval of the chairperson of the headquarters committee on contracts was not sou ght instructions from the representation in bangui to limit the purchase to less than us 5000 0 were disregarded in another example in august 2003 mats and soaps were procured locally at cost of some us 127000 without adherence to procurement procedures there were nu merous other examples of noncompliance 3 12 also suppliers were selected without ensu ring their ability to supply the goods or services at the required deadline for instance s teel buckets were procured for some us 103000 from local supplier on the basis of thre pro forma invoices the goods which were supposed to be delivered within 15 days were actua lly delivered more than two months later given the emergency nature of the operation adhere nce to delivery time was essential 13 in 2003 the office paid some us 138000 to clearing agent who had been selected without competitive bidding written contract w as awarded and the amount involved largely exceeded the spending authority and should have be referred to the hcc oios recommended that the office issue tender for clea ring services and ensure that the selection is made on competitive basis 14 ocm explained that the current management team was not involved in the 2003 financial management of the operations they furthe r indicated that copy of the audit observation had been sent to the former ert leader for him to comment on the supply chain system put in place during his management period so far oios has not received those comments ocm also explained that clear instructions had now been given to all staff members to adhere to rules and regulations for procurement 15 there was signed lease agreement for th unhcr office premises in ndjamena and despite this ocm undertook additional construction work on the premises without written understandingacceptance from the landlord oios wa s concerned with the fact that unhcrs interests had not been protected ocm explained that the office lease agreement has n ow been signed with the landlord after the endorsement by the legal affairs section at hqs procurement by msf 16 unhcrs main implementing partner msfbel gium was not prequalified for procurement on behalf of unhcr yet they were entru sted with the procurement of goods and services of over us 14 million oios did not obt ain any evidence that as an alternative msf had made written commitment to apply unhcr ip pro curement guidelines further most of the items procured internationally drugs mosquito nets etc were available under unhcr frame agreements and could have been directly proc ured by unhcr 17 msf made their procurement internationally through their subsidiary called transfer with leadtime of 30 days except for medical ite ms already in msf stocks oios found that msf levied operating margins ranging from 15 up to 25 percent on their international procurement while similar purchasing centres in eu rope only charged between five and 10 percent for example 3200 tents were procured fo r some us 317000 while the amount charged to unhcr was some us 396000 margin of u s 79000 25 percent also medical kits were procured for us 61000 while the cost to unhcr came to us 71500 margin of us 10000 165 percent 18 for 2003 msf spent total of some us 80 4000 on international procurement therefore oios estimated that at an average opera ting margin rate of 20 percent msf had levied margin of some us 160000 on their intern ational procurement mfs explained that the margin levied was required to cover their procu rement costs bidding process cost of stocking transfers etc in oios view however while it is justified to cover such costs the margin rates applied were by far higher than those charged by similar purchasing centres in 4 europe such as gts in italy which charged only be tween 5 and 10 percent oios therefore considers the cost charged as excessive and not eli gible for unhcr funding 19 in oios view written authorisation shoul d have been sought and obtained from unhcr prior to charging these margins to the spmrs given that these were not foreseen and agreed to in the relevant subagreements signed wit h unhcr oios recommended that unhcr negotiate with msf and reduce the margin leve l to mutually acceptable level with any excess reimbursed to unhcr ocm did not address this issue in their replies recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission ndjamena should consult with dos and sms and negotiate expostfac to with msf mutually acceptable operating margin for the 2003 procurement excessive charges estimated at least u s 100000 should be recovered from msf rec 01 20 msf s procurement procedures in the field were deficient and the documentation supporting the expenditure was often inadequate in some instances the validity of the payments made was questionable as the receipt of the goods was not evidenced msf acknowledged the weaknesses noted and explained that this was due t the then prevailing conditions on the field msf also indicated that they would ensure in the future that the documentation supporting the expenditure is kept on file asset management 21 considerable work was required from ocm in the area of asset management oios could not find any records of unhcrs assets albei t large quantities of assets including light vehicles heavy trucks office and telecommunicatio n equipment etc estimated at several millions of us dollars were procured both locally and internationally not even an excel table was maintained to keep track of the assets procured and copies of the receiving reports for incoming shipments from sms were available the ssettrak system was not installed during 2003 and at the time of oios review in 2004 the system was still not operational due to the lack of trained staff oios regrets to see such pr oblems recurring in many emergency operations also records were available for th unhcrmanaged warehouse in ndjamena which meant that shortages if any could go undete cted despite the assistance received from visiting staff member to design and compile an asse t database this task was only partially carried out because of his other priorities 22 at the time of the review only one inexpe rienced logistics assistant on temporary assistance was trying to cope with tremendous task s of procurement warehousing custom clearance fleet management etc in oios view ch responsibilities would represent very difficult challenge even for an experienced logisti cs officer unless he is seconded by an adequate number of logistics staff 23 ocm acknowledged the shortcoming and explained tha t these were due to the lack of professional staff in the logistics unit they also indicated that the office planned to bring in qualified staff from other offices for assistance 5 recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission ndjamena should undertake comprehensive physical inventory of its assets with an estimated value of several million us dollars and ensure that the assettrak system is fully operational and uptodat rec 02 fuel management 24 unhcr had formal arrangement with any s uppliers despite its need of significant quantities of fuel consequently higher prices we re paid for the purchase of fuel including value added tax vat which unhcr should have been exempted from request for vat tax exemption had been made oios found that ot her agencies including undp had requested and obtained the taxexemption and were therefore paying at least 25 percent less than unhcr 25 in 2003 the total amount of fuel purchase d for the programme could not be determined given that the various payments were recorded under various budget lines and locations and that some payments made in the field had not been r ecorded at all under the administrative budget however unhcr spent some us 40000 inclu sive of us 10000 for vat which could have been saved for 2004 unhcr estimated t hat some 60000 litres of diesel would be needed monthly which meant that if the vat exempti on is obtained some us 138000 could be saved yearly 26 oios found that controls were deficient ov er the management of fuel ocm procured fuel in the form of fuel booklets blank forms va lidated by the only signature of new local staff on temporary assistance with further veri fication or supervisory approval this is spending authority that should not be delegated to staff at this level further the average fuel consumption per vehicle was not trackedmonitored which gives rise to potential misuse 27 ocm explained that due to the lack of professional staff in the logistics section there was mismanagement of the office assets they cla rified that the situation had now changed with main tasks and responsibilities given to profe ssional staff newly appointed regarding the vat on fuel ocm indicated that arrangements had w been made and that the office was longer paying the vat tax they also explained that fuel coupons were now signed by professional staff b other programme issues 28 prior to reestablishing the unhcr office in chad unhcr emergency operations were implemented by an ert under the overall monitoring and assistance by the unhcr representation in car however in light of the var ious shortcomings noted in chad oios assessed that programme monitoring was less than sa tisfactory many of the problems disclosed by the audit could have been identified and dealt w ith had proper financial monitoring been carried out 29 oios found that the staff member sent by t he representation in bangui to provide financial and administrative support was an associa protection officer with proven 6 expertise to deal with an emergency operation of ge neral scale according to the representation in bangui overseeing the operations in chad was ve ry difficult due to limited flights unreliable telecommunication system lack of securi ty for travel by road etc c review of implementing partners 30 for unhcr main partner médécins sans fro ntières systems and procedures were in place and reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements for croix rouge tchadienne oios could not reconcile the spmrs due to the lack of ac counting system and records therefore assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were prop erly controlled managed and reported on 31 the 2003 audit certificates for both partn ers were not yet due at the time of the review but oios understands that an external audit of impl ementing partners will be soon carried out croix rouge tchadienne 32 oios found that crt local implementing partner had accounting system in place for the recording and reporting on unhcr project ex penditures bank and cash transactions were not tracked and there was evidence to show how the expenditures reported onto the spmrs were arrived at this practice did not leav any audit trail and was contrary to sound financial management and to generally accepted acco unting principles in addition the spmrs showed significant unauthorised budgetary overruns both at the budget line level from 50 to over 480 percent and at the overall budget level 33 the review of the expenditure under some s elected budget lines disclosed several discrepancies with the spmr figures and more sign ificantly crt could not substantiate expenditure totalling some us 185000 which repre sented about 50 percent of their 2003 budget according to crt the money was withdrawn f rom the bank and sent to the field for construction activities that had not yet taken plac in oios view since the expenditure was not incurred and payments had taken place at the d of the subproject liquidation date the unspent amount should not have been included oios recommended that an effective accounting system be implemented and that correc ted financial spmr reflecting actual disbursements be submitted 34 ocm explained that crt admitted the weaknesses note d and stated that project expenditure and budget monitoring is now being reco rded on excel tables on the issue of the unjustified expenditure totalling some us 185000 ocm explained that this amount was budgeted only in december 2003 for the construction of schools an emergency unhcr was faced with they also clarified that the funds were transferred with some delay to crt in order to avoid direct implementation while at the same time ensuring that the funds allocated for this activity remained available to the 2003 bproject 35 ocm also indicated that the documentation supportin g about half the amount some us 90000 had now been received and that these w ould be verified oios takes note of the explanations provided but wished to stress that fi nal spmr should only include payments made until the end of the liquidation period if an acti vity cannot take place within the agreed implementation period ocm should consider amending the subproject to extend its duration 7 or alternatively include the activity as part of bsequent year projects recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission should obt ain from its implementing partner croix rouge tchadienne documen tation properly supporting expenditures totalling some us 95000 and recover any amounts that cannot be accounted for r ec 03 36 significant amounts of cash up to us 100 000 were regularly withdrawn from the bank for use in the field despite this practice crt did not establish any petty cashbook to record cash movements and cheque counterfoils were not properly filled out consequently discrepancies were noted with the relevant bank sta tements given the complete lack of accounting records we could not reconcile the amou nt of cash in hand nor could we evidence any supervisory controls oios made number of re commendations to address the various shortcomings noted 37 ocm explained that on the basis of additional docu mentation produced by crt the bank discrepancies noted had now been reconciled nd that the postings would be further verified they further stated that actions would b taken to address the weaknesses noted in the internal controls of crt b médecins sans frontièresbelgium 38 msf did not always comply with the subagr eements signed with unhcr despite being unhcr main implementing partner with over us 2 millions of expenditures in 2003 msf did not prepare and submit any performance moni toring reports msf explained that narrative report for 2003 was drafted for the activ ities carried out in the two camps they also explained that the draft was being finalised at the time of the review and that it was subsequently submitted to unhcr in april 2004 oios wished to point out that according to the subagreement the first performance monitoring report part 2 of the spmr was due by 10 june 2003 while the final one was to be submitted not later than 15 february 2004 none of these reports had been submitted to unhcr at the of our review in april 2004 39 msf needed to strengthen their internal co ntrols incompatible functions were exercised by one person responsible for authorizingapprovin g payments signing purchase orders and cheques recording financial transactions and prep aring bank reconciliations also as msf did not introduce the use of payment voucher authorisa tion and approval of the expenditure could not be evidenced in their replies msf indicated that the finance of ficer did not issue purchase orders but only approved it to certify ava ilability of funds however msf did not comment on other incompatible functions identified recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission ndjamena should request its implementing partners to submit their p erformance monitoring reports in accordance with subproject greements and to ensure adequate segregation of duties rec 04 8 d administration 40 in the areas of administration and finance ocm did often not comply with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures key f inancial controls were not functioning the medical insurance plan was not operational albeit the system was in place delegation of authority chart not available 41 the unhcr delegation of financial signing authority iom 672000 fom 692000 dated 9 september 2000 had not yet been implemented oios recommended that proper administrative and financial procedures be implemen ted to strengthen internal controls the delegation of authority chart has now been establis hed b unrecorded expenditures and commitments 42 oios found that the expenditure incurred d uring 2003 was only partially recorded and reported on and therefore the administrative budge t control sheet abcs was understated the unrecorded expenditure amounted to some us 73 000 the abcs is an important tool for the monitoring of the budget obligation and disbur sement levels and for ensuring that expenditure does not exceed the obligated amount in the abod according to ocm the problem arose because the fmis system was not insta lled at field offices and this had created an overwhelming flow of payment documents originating from those offices which they had been unable to cope with 43 in addition the 2003 yearend commitments were understated by over us 72000 which meant that ocm had lost its overview over com mitments entered and outstanding obligations further these obligationscommitment s had not been recorded in the fmis system using notional vouchers and could therefore not be reconciled ocm would need to create and record the 2003 notional vouchers under the new msr p system oios estimated that ocm would need additional funds totalling some us 145 000 to honour the outstanding obligations ocm explained that the 2003 commitments would be ch arged against the 2004 abod which had been submitted to hqs for revision c outstanding receivables vf 44 better monitoring and timely settlement of advances was required at the time of the audit advances totalling some us 05 million had been outstanding for several months many of these receivables pertained to official travel with the travel claims either not submitted or not processed in some instances the advances were mad to staff on mission who had left the country without submitting their travel claims thi s was the case for instance for two staff members with advances totalling some us 36000 wh had departed chad without settling their advances 45 ocm indicated that many efforts had been made to re concile all outstanding payable and receivable accounts they further explained th at for staff members who already left the country their current duty stations had been conta cted and the amounts due would be recovered immediately 9 d communications 46 in 2003 over us 60000 was spent for com munications the controls over the usage of telephone equipment were found to be weak the est ablished logbook was actually not use and the switchboard was bypassed by direct calls made f rom any of the five telephone lines with direct international access the concerned staff d id not maintain any logbook to track their private calls despite the fact that during 2003 telephone bills were periodically circulated to staff so they can identify their private calls in general such calls were identified and refunded 47 moreover staff members were provided with sat phones but again proper controls over their usage had not been established many interna tional calls were made from these phones but in the absence of appropriate tracking mechanism p rivate calls if any were not identified for recovery ocm did not even maintain comprehensiv list of the sat phones and the name of the holders and the whereabouts of most of the set s were unknown to the office which made accountability difficult to establish in case of ss or damage 48 according to ocm access to international lines wer now restricted to senior staff only with other staff making their calls from the radio room and that recovery of previous private calls by staff members on mission was being made through their current duty station regarding the inventory of telecom equipment ocm xplained that regional telecom officer had assisted in carrying out physical inv entory and in implementing proper system for recording them medical insurance plan mip 49 the mip system was still not operational albeit the software had been installed several months before as result medical claims submitt ed by staff members could not be processed nor any reimbursements made while at the same time contributions to mip system were deducted from staffs salaries oios recommended th at immediate attention be given to this issue ocm explained that the computer on which the mip sy stem was installed was not functioning for sometime but that the problem has now been fixed and that the processing of medical claims would soon start they also indicat ed that proper control mechanism of medical claims have been put in place review of suboffice abeche 50 the suboffice generally complied with unh cr rules and regulations as the sub office did not operate on separate abod funds we re received from ocm through bank transfers oios noted that the fmis system was t installedoperated despite the fact that the office had to cope with significant level of fina ncial transactions including those from field offices in adre and iriba the expenditure was summ arized on excel tables and did not allow proper monitoring and accountability of subadvanc made by the suboffice to the two field offices this situation significantly contrib uted to the backlog of outstanding operational advances noted at ocm ndjamena oios recommended that the fmis be installed to lower the risks associated with the delayed recording of transactions 51 oios found that for 2003 the suboffice still owed daily subsistence allowance dsa totalling some us 27000 to local staff whi ch had been omitted in the 2003 list of 10 commitments prepared by ocm ocm explained that hqs had approved the installati on of the fmis system and that the outstanding issues ted by the audit were being solved security and safety 52 security issues were not given the necessa ry attention and number of mandatory security requirements were not complied with only some few international staff had completed the mandatory basic security training further n one of the staff interviewed were aware of the existence of and familiar with the field securi ty handbook nor were they briefed on security matters upon their recruitment according to iomfom 172003 dated 14 march 2003 the security course is mandatory for all unhc r staff regardless of their contractual status also the course is to be completed by new staff within one month of their recruitment 53 oios noted that procedures were in plac to evacuate the premises in case of emergency and that badges were available to ide ntify staff and visitors while radio security checks were carried out weekly most of the unhcr s taff did not have handsets including the chief of mission further compliance by unhcr wi th the minimum operational security standards moss was only achieved at some 70 perce nt the ocm explained that report of the assessment was made available to the office 54 the country security plan was drafted and finalised but not tested according to the fso the designated wardens did not even know which areas they were responsible for the unhcr fsa explained however that full operation security plan is available to unhcr staffs and that the plan would be incorporated int the more comprehensive country plan at the time when the undp fso is ready 55 ocm explained that the improvement of staff and off ice premises security remained one of their objectives and that much efforts had been made to respond to unsecoord recommendations on moss they also indicated that security at the office gates had been reinforced and that the necessary communication eq uipment had been ordered from hqs ocm said that security training would be organised for all staff while the fso would provide basic security briefing to newly arrived staff and added that during various meetings with undp the wardens had been informed of their respon sibilities and areas of activities v acknowledgement 56 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of unhcr and its implementing partners
