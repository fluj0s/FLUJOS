endangered species act in the 109th congress conflicting values and difficult choices summary the 109th congress considered numerous pr oposals to amend the endangered species act pl 93205 16 usc 15311543 major issues in recent years have included changing the role of science in decisionmaking modifying critical habitat ch procedures incorpor ating further protection and incentives for property owners and increasing protecti on of listed species among others in addition many have advocated enacting as law some regu lations promulgated during the clinton administration the has been one of the more cont entious environmental laws this may stem from its strict substantive provisions which can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and res ources under the species of plants and animals both vertebrate and invert ebrate can be listed as endangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extincti on once species is listed powerful legal tools are available to aid its recovery and protect its habitat the may also be controversial because dwindling species are usually harbingers of broader ecosystem decline the most common cause of listing species is habitat loss the authorization for spending under the expired on october 1 1992 the prohibitions and requirements of the remain in force even in the absence of an authorization and funds have been appr opriated to implement the administrative provisions of the in each subsequent fiscal year in the 109th congress hr 3824 and s 2110 proposed to extensively ame nd and reauthorize the the house passed hr 3824 amended on september 29 2005 proponents of both bills argued that they were designed to make the more effective by redefining the relationship between private and public property uses and species protection implementing new incentives for species c onservation and removing what some see as undue land use restrictions however critics argued that proposed changes created gaps in the safety net of protections and prohibitions the 109th congress enacted legislation that 1 established pilot project in wyoming montana colorado utah nd new mexico to better coordinate consultations

at risk of extinction and to consider habitat protection as an integral part of that effo rt stated purpose of the is to protect the ecosystems of which listed species are part under the species of plants and animals both vertebra and invertebrate may be listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction more flexible management can be provided for species lis ted as threatened distinct population segments may also be listed as threaten ed or endangered but only of vertebrate species consequently some populati ons of chinook coho chum and sockeye salmon in washington oregon idaho and california are protected under the even as other healthy populations of these same species in alaska are not listed and may be commercially harvested more limited protection is available for plant species under the once species is listed powerful legal tools including penalties and citizen suits are available to aid species recovery and protect habitat

were 279 species on the list of candidate species7 critical habitat with certain exceptions if species is listed the secretary must designate critical habitat ch in ar eas where the species is currently found or which might provide additional bitat for the species recovery8 however if the publication of this information is not prudent eg might encourage vandals or collectors the secretary may decide not to designate ch the secretary may postpone designation for up to one year after listing if the information is not determinable 16 usc 1533 as of june 16 2006 fws had designated ch for 36 of listed domestic species as practical matter ch has not been designated for most listed species largely because fws prefers to allocate its limited resources to listing new species based on its regulation 50 cfr 40202 that ta kes away much of the legal value of designating ch to the recovery of the species yet fws consistently loses legal challenges for failure to designate ch nd several courts have found the regulation in question to be an erroneous interpretati on of the law because it does not take into account the duty to avoid adverse modification of ch9 others have asserted the value of ch for example scientists with the center for biological diversity published study in april 2005 concluding that ch designation enhances species recovery10 on april 28 2006 the keystone centers working group on habitat released report on bitat protection and the esa11 one of the conclusions of participants in this study was that identification of the habitat that species require to recover is better done in the context of recovery planning after more rigorous analysis and deliberation have been completed rather than at the time of listing ch is frequently misunderstood by the

controversy over the extent to whic h habitat modification is prohibited 1995 supreme court decision held that the inclusion of significant habitat modification was reasonable interpretation of the term harm in the esa12 the provides civil and criminal penalties for violations permits and consultation proposed actions that may have adverse impacts on listed species may be permitte d in two ways first under 7 of the if federal agency actions or actions of nonfederal party that require an agencys approval permit or funding may affect listed speci the federal agency must ensure that those actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species nor to destroy or dversely modify ch to review the possible effects of their actions on listed species and ch federal agencies must consult with the appropriate secretary if the secretary finds that an action would jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify ch the secretary must suggest reasonable and prudent alte rnatives that would avoid these harms pending completion of the consultation process agencies may not make irretrievable commitments of resources that would foreclose any alternatives the secretary issues written statement called biological opinion that may allow the agency or the applicant to take individuals of species incidental to otherwise lawful activities without triggering the penalties s ubject to terms and conditions specified in the opinion 16 usc 1536 or may concl ude that jeopardy ca nnot be avoided in which case the agency may seek an exemption for the action from the endangered species committee for actions without federal nexus ie federal funding permit or license the appropriate secretary may issue pe rmits under 10 of the to allow the incidental take of species during otherwise lawful actions13 an applicant for permit must submit habitat conservation plan hcp that shows the likely impact of the planned action steps to be ta ken to minimize and mitigate the impact funding for the mitigation alternatives that were considered and rejected and any other measures that the secretary may require the use of this section has been vastly expanded and streamlined procedures are provided for activities with minimal impacts 50 cfr 1722httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33468crs5 exemptions proponents of federal action may apply for an exemption from the prohibition against jeopardy for that action not for species under the highlevel endangered species committee commonly called the god squad decides whether to allow project to proceed despite likely harm to species to date this process has been little used and only one exemption grayrocks dam wy has been granted and carried out the co mmittee is required to accept the presidents determination under specified circumstances on an exemp tion in declared disaster areas the committee must grant an exemption if the secretary of defense determines that an exemption is necessa ry for national security 16 usc 1536 dod has claimed that requi rements under the conflict with its readiness activities but dod has not requested any exem ptions to date see also issues in the 109th congress below other statutes may provide for waivers of provisions for example 102c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 provides for wa iver of the

cfr 40205 provides for procedures in case of emergencies basically requiring only very informal consultations during an emergency with more complete consultation after the emergency has passed according to fws any hurricanerelated federal activities in presidentially declared disaster areas would trigger the emerge ncy consultation provisions of the specifically for the 2005 gulf of mexico

consideration of unilate ral economic sanctions against foreign nations such as could be imposed in relationship to cites hr 3469 would have provided measures to improve the conservation of coral reef species and further the obligations of the united states under cites is species protection and restoration working the answer to this question depends on what is measured since major goal of the is the recovery of species to the point at which protection is longer necessary this seems good star ting point since the was enacted in 1973 40 us and foreign species have been delisted the reasons cited by fws are recovery 17 b extinction 9 but some may have been extinct when listed c new understanding of the taxonomy of the sp ecies making some ineligible for listing under current law 7 and d new info rmation including determination that erroneous data were provided to fws at the time of listing 7 recovered species include alligators peregrine falcons two subspecies and three species of kangaroos extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow guam broadbill bird and two small fish living in desert springs however it can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simp ly that or in fact are already extinct for example rare shorebird thought by many to be extinct was rediscovered in remote area of canada few years ago it might just as easily have quietly gone extinct without being redisc overed rare species are by definition hard to find some have asserted that the is failure since only 17 species have been delisted as recovered as of january

noecker available from lcorncrslocgov 20 available at httpresourcescommitteehouse govissuesmoreesaesa_implementation_ report51705pdf 21 in their report gao acknowledges that results from nonprobability samples cannot be used to make inferences about population ie all esalisted species however review of the selected species provides valuable caselevel insights into their progress toward recovery and the role that recovery pl ans have played in that progress relatively few because the two principal causes of extinction habitat loss and invasive nonnative species are increasing in addition some scientific studies have demonstrated that most species are listed only after they become very depleted eg median population of 407 animals for endangered vertebrates according to one study thereby making recovery difficult another measure of success might be the number of species that ve stabilized or increased th eir populations even if the species are not actually delisted if th is standard is used the could be considered success since large number 41 according to one study of listed species have improved or stabilized thei r population levels after listing other species eg red wolves and california c ondors might not exist at all without protection and this too might be consider ed measure of success although these species are still rare19 on may 17 2005 the house committee on resources released an oversight report entitled implementation of the endangered species act of 1973 20 it reviewed and critiqued various ways that recovery might be measure d one approach is to look at what proportion of the recovery objectiv identified in species recovery plans have been achieved table 1 indicates how recovery s progressed related to the length of time since species were listed on september 8 2006 gao released report gao06730 titled endangered species many factors affect the length of time to recover select species this report examined federal efforts to rec over nonprobability sample of 31 species gao determined that while many factors ffected the recovery of species recovery plans played an important role in the recovery of all but one of the species examined critics claimed the gao study was biased by the selection of species examined21 table 1 percent recovery achieved versus time listed data as of september 30 2002 recovery plan

species recovery agency use of scientific information specific regional resource c onflicts and other ma tters below are descriptions of some of the issues that were most commonly raised22 critical habitat designation with limited exceptions fws or nmfs must designate ch at the time species is listed however some critic s argue that ch designation places undue burdens on landowners or that it has l ittle conservation benefit others argue and the courts have largely agreed that fws and nmfs have misinterpreted and failed to enforce the current statute there are also disagreements over the value and timing of ch designation see critical habita t above and listing caps new and old below in the 109th congress 5 of hr 3824 would ve repealed the designation of ch and labeled current areas of ch as areas of special value for recovery planning purposes the house committee on resources reported this bill amended on september 27 2005 hrept 109237 and the house passed it amended on september 29 2005 hr 1299 would have m odified the ch definition as well as the process for determining and design ating ch hr 1837 would have limited ch designation for some aquatic habitats s 2110 would have designated any habitat of an endangered species or threatened sp ecies that is considered to be ch in accordance with the priority system sound science and the the requires that deter minations of species status be made solely on the basis of the best sc ientific and commercia l data available 23 in several recent situations legal economic and social di sputes have resulted from actions under the examples of these controversies in clude the canada lynx florida panthers and klamath river basin suckers and coho sa lmon critics in some of these disputes suggest that the science supporting ac tion has been insufficiently rigorous or mishandled by the agencies many rare and endangered species are little studied because they are hard to find or because it is difficult to locate enough of them to support scientific researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33468crs10 24 available at httpwwwnmfsnoaago vprpdfslawsesa_section7_handbookpdf 25 67 fed reg 8452 26 for example see httpwwwfwsgo vstandstandardsprocess_wwwhtml 27 59 fed reg 34271 july 1 1994there may be little information on many species facing extinction and only limited personnel or funds availabl to conduct studies on many of the less charismatic species or those of little known economic import what should be done in such instances some suggest that considerati ons other than species conservation should prevail others seek to change the current posture of the law by changing the role of science these considerations are complicated by the costs and time required to acquire more complete data particularly in connec tion with many lesserknown species the does not elaborate on this ques tion but some assert that given the protective purpose of the to save and recover species and the wording of best data available arguably dwindling species are to be given the benefit of the doubt and margin of safety provided this is the positi on taken on page 17 of the endangered species consultation handbook which states that efforts should be made to develop information but if biological opinion must be rendered promptly it should be based on the available inform ation giving the benefit of the doubt to the species with consultation possibly being reinitiated if additional information becomes available24 this phrase is drawn from hrept 96697 p 12 1979 which states that the best information available language was intended to allow fws to issue biological opinions even when information was incomplete rather than being forced to issue negative opinions the report also states that if biological opinion is rendered on the basis of inadequate information the federal agency proposing an action has the duty to show its actions will not jeopardize species and continuing obligation to make reasonable effort to develop information and that the statutory language continues to give the be nefit of the doubt to the species information quality section 515 of pl 106554 known as the information quality act or the data quality act directs the office of management and budget omb to issue governmentwide guidelines to federal agencies to ensure and maximize the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies omb published final guidelines on february 22 200225 the department of the interior and fws have both issued add itional guidelines that are available through their websites26 and process is establis hed for interested persons to seek correction of information even before these latest guidelines fws had promulgated guidance on information quality and peer review procedures issues that also have been addressed in recent legislation fws and nmfs developed an interage ncy cooperative policy on information standards

the listing of all threatened and endangered species moredifficult or less likely expanding 10 permits allowing inci dental take which could incur greater need for agency ove rsight and enforcement
