stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20717crs2 3 for detail on the jacksonvanik amendment see crs report 98545 jacksonvanik amendment survey by vladimir n pregelj 4 although the proclamation is issued at the time of transmittal of the agreement to congress ie well in advance of the eventual enactment of the approval resolution and its implementation its entry into force is specifically delayed to the date of the exchange of notices of acceptance of the agreement by its two partiesintellectual property rights trade in services and investment such as the united states already has in force as matter of general trade policy to enter into force the agreement must be approved by the enactment of joint resolution of congress restoration of ntr treatment to vietnam as an nme country is also contingent on vietnams compliance with the freedomofemigration requirement of the jacksonvanik amendment section 402 of the trade act of 19743 in the case of vietnam such compliance is achieved by an annual presidential waiver of full compliance under specified statutory conditions such waiver may be disapproved by the enactment of joint resolution of congress the president has issued such waivers for vietnam since mid 1998 but in instance has disapproval resolution if introduced been passed by congress allowing the waiver to continue in force implementing procedure the statutory requirement s and legislative procedure leading to the enactment and entry into force of trade agreement with nonmarket economy nme country including vietnam are set out in detail in sections 151 404 405 and 407 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended section 151 has been enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house and supersedes its other rules to the extent that they are inconsistent with it its provisions can be changed by either house with respect to its own procedure at any time in the same manner and to the same extent as any other rule of that house section 151a 19 usc 2191a all alphanumerical statutory references cited in this report are to sections of the trade act of 1974 while care has been taken to reflect accurately the meaning of the statutes consulting the actual language of any statute is recommended in case of any ambiguity functionally the consideration and enactment of the approval resolution and the implementation of the agreement follow specific expedited fasttrack procedure explained below additional information based on past practice of implementing trade agreements with nme countries in general but applicable also to vietnam is provided in footnotes 1 enactment necessary the agreement can take effect only if approved by enactment of joint resolution section 405c 19 usc2435c 2 transmittal of the agreement by the president to congress the text of the bilateral trade agreement with vietnam must be transmitted by the president to both houses of congress together with proclamation4 extending nondiscriminatory treatment to vietnam and stating his reasons for it section 407a 19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20717crs3 5 trade agreement with vietnam and other required documents were transmitted by the president to congress on june 8 2001 they have been published as house document 10785 6 sjres 16 and hjres 51 to approve the trade agreement with vietnam were introduced respectively on june 11 and 12 2001 7 committee consideration in the house as described in the body of this report differs from that in the senate see item 9 this is due to the treatment in this report of the approval resolution as revenue measure an implementing revenue resolution which it is widely presumed to be since it would affectadversely customs revenues due to the significantly lower ntr tariff rates assessed on imports from vietnam after the agreement enters into force cf sec 151b2 19 usc 2191b2 but see also footnote 11 as such the resolution is required by the us constitution to originate in the house this origination provision however does not mean that companion resolution may not be introduced and considered in the senate but only that the measure eventually passed by both houses and submitted to the president for signature has to be house measure 8 in computing the number of days in either house any day on which that house is not in session is excluded sec 151e3 19 usc 2193e3usc 2437 while there is statutory deadline for the transmittal of the proclamation and the agreement to congress after its signing the law requires that the transmittal take place promptly after the proclamation is issued5 3 mandatory introduction of approval resolution on the day the trade agreement is transmitted to the congress or if the respective house is not in session on that day the first subsequent day on which it is in session joint resolution of approval sec 151b3 19 usc 2191b3 must be introduced by request in each house by its majority leader for himself and the minority leader or by their designees sec 151c2 19 usc 2191c26 4 language of approval resolution the language of the resolution is prescribed by law sec 151b3 19 usc 2191b3 to read in this particular instance after the resolving clause that the congress approves the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to the products of vietnam transmitted by the president to the congress on june 8 2001 5 committee referral the resolution is referred in the house to the committee on ways and means and in the senate to the committee on finance sec 151c2 19 usc 2191c2 6 amendments prohibited amendment to the resolution and motion or unanimousconsent request to suspend the noamendment rule is in order in either house sec 151d 19 usc 2191d 7 committee consideration in the house 7 if the ways and means committee has not reported the resolution within 45 days8 after its introduction the committee is automatically discharged from further consideration of the resolution and the resolution is placed on the appropriate calendar sec 151e1 19 usc 2191e1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20717crs4 9 this statutory deadline has in past practice often been reduced by floor action 10 computed as in footnote 8 11 this item describes the procedure for enacting revenue joint resolutions approving trade agreements with nonmarket economy countries ambiguity in the applicable statutory language however has engendered controversy as to whether they are to be considered as revenue or nonrevenue measures which may eventually have to be resolved by parliamentarian ruling 12 although joint resolution of approval must be introduced in both houses see item 3 section 151 contains specific provisions regarding the considerati on of senate revenue approval resolution situation presumed in the procedure as described in this report the reason for this omission appears to be in that revenue measure can be enacted only as house measure see footnote 7 13 both computed as in footnote 8 8 floor consideration in the house motion to proceed to the consideration of the approval resolution is highly privileged and nondebatable an amendment to the motion or motion to reconsider the vote whereby the motion is agreed or disagreed to is not in order sec 151f1 19 usc 2191f1 b debate on the resolution is limited to 20 hours9 divided equally between the supporters and opponents of the resolution motion further to limit debate is not debatable motion

and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business are decided without debate sec 151f3 19 usc 2191f3 d all appeals from the decisions of the chair relating to the application of the rules of the house of representatives to the approval resolution are decided without debate sec 151f4 19 usc 2191f4 in all other respects consideration of the approval resolution is governed by the rules of the house of representatives applicable to other measures in similar circumstances sec 151f5 19 usc 2191f5 f the vote by simple majority on the final passage of the approval resolution must be taken on or before the 15th day10 after the ways and means committee has reported the resolution or has been discharged from its further consideration sec 151e1 19 usc 2191e1 9 committee consideration in the senate 11 an approval resolution adopted by the house of representatives and received in the senate is referred to the finance committee sec 151c2 and e2 19 usc 2191c2 and e212 if the finance committee has not reported the resolution within 15 days after its receipt from the house or 45 days13 after the introduction of its own corresponding resolution whichever is later the committee is automatically discharged from further consideration of the resolution and the resolution is placed on the appropriate calendar sec 151e1 19 usc 2191e1 10 floor consideration in the senate motion to proceed to the consideration of the approval resolution is privileged and nondebatable an amendment to the motion or motion to reconsider the votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20717crs5 14 computed as in footnote 8 15 see item 8e 16 see footnote 4whereby the motion is agreed or disagreed to is not in order sec 151g1 19 usc 2191g1 b debate on the approval resolution and on all debatable motions and appeals connected with it is limited to 20 hours equally divided between and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees sec 151g2 19 usc 2191g2 c debate on any

such motion or appeal the time in opposition is controlled by the minority leader or his designee such leaders may from time under their control on the passage of the resolution allot additional time to any senator during the consideration of any debatable motion or appeal sec 151g3 19 usc 2191g3 d motion further to limit debate on the approval resolution is not debatable motion to recommit it is not in order sec 151g4 19 usc 2191g4 the vote by simple majority on the final passage of the approval resolution must be taken on or before the 15th day14 after the finance committee has reported the resolution or has been discharged from its further consideration sec 151e2 19 usc 2191e2 f although unlike in the case of the house procedure15 this is not specifically mentioned in section 151 the rules of the senate govern the consideration of the approval resolution in the senate in all aspects not specifically addressed in section 151 g if prior to the passage of its own approval resolution the senate receives the approval resolution already passed by the house it continues the legislative procedure on its own resolution but the vote on the final passage is on the house resolution 11 presidents implementing authority after the joint resolution approving the trade agreement with vietnam is passed by both houses and signed by the president it becomes public law in effect authorizing the president to put into effect the already issued proclamation16 implementing the agreement extending nondiscriminatory treatment to vietnam secs 404a and 405c 19 usc 2434a and 2435c b application of nondiscriminatory treatment is limited to the term during which the agreement remains in force sec 404b 19 usc 2434b see also footnote 16 and text which it accompanies c the president may at any time suspend or withdraw nondiscriminatory treatment of vietnam sec 404c 19 usc 2434c and thereby subject all imports from that country to column 2 tariff rates ie full rather than ntr rates 12 approval by vietnam the agreement also must be approved by vietnams national assembly 13 entry into force after the joint resolution of approval is enacted and the agreement is approved by vietnam the proclamation see item 2 becomes effective the agreement enters intohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20717crs6 17 one such circumstance would arise if vietnams waiver under the jacksonvanik amendment see p 12 were longer in force either by the presidents failure to renew it annually or through the enactment of joint resolution disapproving its annual extension enactment of such resolution hjres 55 to disapprove the extension of vietnams waiver introduced on june 1 2001 but defeated in the house on july 26 2001 would have prevented the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to vietnam or if already in force nullified it 18 the latter provision reflects the fact that by being granted nondiscriminatory treatment by the united states an nme country would benefit from us concessions extended to third countries without itself theoretically having to extend any concessions specifically to the united states it would merely have to apply to the united states the same concessions that it has granted to third countries in the case of vietnam however the bilateral agreement does provide for comprehensive usspecific concessions in addition to those applicable merely on mfn basisforce and nondiscriminatory treatment is extended to vietnam on the date of exchange of written notices of acceptance of the agreement by the united states and vietnam notice of the effective date of the agreement is published by the us trade representative in the federal register 14 maintenance in force according to its own terms article 8 of chapter vii general articles the agreement with vietnam remains in force for period of three years and is automatically renewable for successive threeyear terms unless either party to it at least 30 days before the expiration of the then current term gives notice of its intent to terminate the agreement if either party ceases to have domestic legal authority to carry out its obligations under the agreement it may suspend the application of the agreement or with the agreement of the other party any part of the agreement17 in addition section 405b1 19 usc 2435b1 limits the life of trade agreements restoring nondiscriminatory treatment to nme countries to an initial term of three years agreements may be renewable for additional threeyear terms if satisfactory balance of trade concessions has been maintained during the life of the agreement and the president determines that actual or foreseeable us reductions of trade barriers resulting from multilateral negotiations are satisfactorily reciprocated by the other country18
