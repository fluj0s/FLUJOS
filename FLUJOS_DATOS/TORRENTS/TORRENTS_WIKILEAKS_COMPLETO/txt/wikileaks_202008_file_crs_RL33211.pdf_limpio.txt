relating to the issue of medical marijuana are discussed below in greater detail background medical marijuana prior to 1937 the cannabis sativa plant has been used for healing purposes throughout history according to written records from china and india the use of marijuana to treat wide range of ailments goes back more than 2000 years ancient texts from africa the middle east classical greece and the roman empire also describe the use of cannabis to treat disease for most of american history grow ing and using marijuana was legal under both federal law and the laws of the indi vidual states by the 1840s marijuanas therapeutic potential began to be recogniz ed by some us physicians from 1850 to 1941 cannabis was included in the united states pharmacopoeia as recognized medicinal3 by the end of 1936 however all 48 st ates had enacted laws to regulate marijuana4 its decline in medicine was hast ened by the development of aspirin morphine and then other opiumderived drugs all of which helped to replace marijuana in the treatment of pain and other medical conditions in western medicine5 federal medical marijuana policy all three branches of the federal government play an important role in formulating federal policy on medical marijuana significant actions of each branch are highlighted here beginning with the legislative branch congressional actions the marihuana6 tax

anslinger commissioner of the recently established federal bureau of narcotics the act imposed re gistration and reportin g requirements and tax on the growers sellers and buyers of marijuana although the act did not prohibit marijuana outright its effect was the same because marijuana was not included in the harris on narcotics act in 19148 the marihuana tax act was the federal governments first attempt to regulate marijuana dr william c woodward legislative counsel of the american medical association ama opposed the measure in oral testimony before the house ways and means committee he stated that there are evidently potentialities in the drug that should not be shut off by adverse legislation the medical profession and pharmacologists should be left to develop th use of this drug as they see fit9 two months later in letter to the senate finance committee he again argued against the act there is evidence however that the medicinal use of these drugs cannabis and its preparations and derivatives has caused or is causing cannabis addiction as remedial agents they are us ed to an inconsiderable extent and the obvious purpose and effect of this bill is to impose so many restrictions on their medicinal use as to prevent such use altogether since the medicinal use of cannabis has not caused and is not causin g addiction the prevention of the use of the drug for medicinal purposes can accomplish good end whatsoever how far it may serve to deprive the public of the benefits of drug that on further research may prove to be of subs tantial value it is impossible to foresee10 despite the amas opposition the mari huana tax act wa s approved causing all medicinal products contai ning marijuana to be withdrawn from the market and leading to marijuanas removal in

and the department of health and human services found little evid ence of illicit abuse of the drug in schedule iii marinol is now subject to fewer regulatory controls and lesser criminal sanctions for illicit use administrative law judge ruling to reschedule ma rijuana 1988 congressional passage of th controlled substances act in 1970 and its placement of marijuana in schedule i provoked controversy at the time because it strengthened the federal policy of marijuana prohibition and forced medical marijuana users to buy marijuana of uncertain quality on the black market at inflated prices subjecting them to fines arrest court co sts property forfeiture incar ceration probation and criminal records the new bureaucratic controls on schedule i substances were also criticized because they would impede research on ma rijuanas therapeutic potential thereby making its evaluation and rescheduling th rough the normal drug approval process unlikely these concerns prompted citizens petition to the bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs bndd in 1972 to resche dule marijuana and make it available by prescription the petition was summarily rejected34 this led to long succession of appeals hearing requests and various court proceedings finally in 1988 after extensive public hearings on marijuanas medicinal value francis l young the chief administrative law judge of the drug enforcement administration the bndds successor agency ruled on the petition statin g that marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutica lly active substances known to man35

this record judge young found that the provisions of the controlled substances act permit and require the transfer of marijuana from schedule i to schedule ii which would recognize its medicinal value

san francisco agreed ruling 21 that states are free to dopt medical marijuana laws so long as the marijuana is not sold transported acr oss state lines or used for nonmedical purposes58 federal appeal sent the case to the supreme court the issue before the supreme court was whether the controlled substances act when applied to the intra state cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal use under state law ex ceeds congresss power under the commerce clause the supreme court in june 2005 reversed the nth circuits decision and held in 63 decision that congresss power to regu late commerce extends to purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have substantial effect on interstate commerce59 raich does not invalidate state medical marijuana laws the

patients suffering from intermittent or chronic pain p 15 the iom report expressed concerns about smoking p 126 smoked marijuana is unlikely to be safe dication for any chronic medical condition

antiemetic drug delivery systems there will likely remain subpopulation of patients for whom standard antiemetic therapy is ineffective and who suffer fro m debilitating emesis it is possible that the harmful effects of smoking marijuana for limited period of time might be outweighed by the antiemetic benefits of marijuana at least for patients for whom standard antiemetic therapy is in effective and who suffer from debilitating emesis such patients should be evalua ted on casebycase basis and treated under close medical supervision the iom report makes another exception for terminal cancer patients p 159 terminal cancer patients pose different issues for those patients the medical harm associated with smoking is of little consequence for terminal patients suffering debilitating pain or

preferred dr ug delivery system for patients whose nausea prevents them from taking anything orally such patients need to inhale their antiemitic drug other patients prefer inhaling because the drug is absorbed much more quickly through the lungs so that th beneficial effects of the drug are felt almost at once this rapid onset also gi ves patients more control over dosage for certain patient subpopulation then these dvantages of inhala tion may prevail over both edible marijuana preparations and pharmaceutical drugs in pill form such as marinol moreover medical marijuana advocates argue that there are ways to lessen the risks of smoking any potential problems ssociated with smoking they argue can be reduced by using higher potency mar ijuana which means that less has to be inhaled to achieve the desired therapeutic effect furthermore marijuana does not have to be smoked to be used as medicine it can be cooked in various ways and eaten98 like marinol however taking mariju ana orally can be difficult for patients suffering from nausea many patients are turning to vaporizers which offer the benefits of smoking rapid action ease of dose titration without having to inhale smoke vaporizers are devices that take advantage of the fact that cannabinoids vaporize at lower temperature than that required for marijuana to burn vaporizers heat the plant matter enough for the cannabi noids to be released as vapor without having to burn the marijuana preparation patients can thereby inhale the beneficial cannabinoids without also having to inha the potentially harmful

congress could achieve the same effect by leaving marijuana in schedule i but removing criminal penalties for the medical use of marijuana commonly called decriminalization congress could also opt for legalization by removing marijuana from the csa entirely and subjecting it to federal and state controls based on the tobacco or alcohol re gulatory models or by devising regulatory scheme unique to

legitimacy it does not deserve americas youth are especially vulnerable it is sai d and state medical marijuana programs send the wrong message to our youth many of whom do not recognize the very real dangers of marijuana studies show that the use of an illicit drug is inversely proportional to the perceived harm of that drug that is the more harmful drug is perceived to be the fewer the number of people who will try it107 opponents of medical marijuana argue that surveys show that perception of harm with respect to marijuana has been dropping off annually since the renewal of the drive to legalize marijuana as medicine which began in the early 1990s when legalization advocates first gained significant increase in funding and bega n planning the state ballot initiative drive to legalize

in 1999 as shown in table 3 it is at least possible however that this analysis confuses cause with effect it is logical to assume that the states with the highest prevalence of marijuana usage would be more likely to approve medical marijuana programs because the populati ons of those states would be more knowledgeable of marijuanas effect s and more tolerant of its use it is also the case that

doctors can prescribe cocaine morphine amphetamine and methamphetamine but this is not seen as weakening the war on drugs why would doctors recommending dical marijuana to their patients be any

serves as gateway drug the iom report offered the following p 6 in the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use it is indeed gateway drug but because underage smoking and alcohol use typically precede marijuana use marijuana is not the most common and is rarely the first gateway to illicit drug use there is conclusive evidence that the

illegal drugs with impunity california medical marijuan information dea web page114 it is argued by many that state medical marijuana laws weaken the fight against drug abuse by making the work of

enforcement priorities to diverge from federal priorities and by complicating the job of law enforcement by forcing officers to distinguish medical users from recreational users diversion marijuana grown for medical purposes according to dea and other federal drug control agencies can be diverted into the larger illegal marijuana market thereby undermining law enforcemen t efforts to eliminate

oral argument on this datewith its position affirmed by raich however dea continues to investigate and sometimes raid and shut down medical marijuana distribution operations in california and other

likewise does not so distinguish in carrying out its duty to enforce the csa and investigate possible violations of the act rather consistent with the agencys mandate dea focuses on largescale trafficking organizations and other crim inal enterprises that warrant federal scrutiny if investigating csa viola tions in this manner leads the agency to encounter persons engaged in cr iminal activities involving marijuana dea does not alter its approach if such persons claim at some point their crimes are medically justified to do so would be to give legal effect to an excuse considered by the text of federal law and the united states supreme court to be of moment129 because nearly all arrests and prosecutions for marijuana possession are handled by state and local law enforcement

drug schedu ling processes which congress has authorized in order to create uniform and reliable system of drug approval and regulation this system is being intentionally undermined by the legalization proponents through use of medical marijuana initiatives the organizers of the medical marijuana state initiatives deny that it was their intent to undermine the federal drug appr oval process rather in their view it became necessary for them to bypass the fda and go to the states because of the federal governments resistance to mar ijuana research reque sts and rescheduling

marketed some be lieve that doctors and patients should still not be criminalized for recommending and using the natural substance the new england journal of medicine has editorialized that federal policy that prohibits phy sicians from alleviating suffering by prescribing marijuana for seriously ill patients is misguided heavyhanded and inhumane marijuana may have longterm adverse effects and its use may presage serious addictions but neither longterm side effects nor addiction is relevant issue in such patients it is also hypocritical to forbid physicians to prescribe marijuana while permitting them to use morphine and meperidine to relieve extreme dyspnea and pain with both of these drugs the difference between the dose that relieves symptoms and the dose that hastens death is very na rrow by contrast there is risk of death from smoking marijuana to demand evidence of therapeutic efficacy is equally hypocritical the noxious sensations that patients experience are extremely difficult to quantify in controlled experiments what really counts for therapy with th is kind of safety margin is whether seriously ill patient feels relief as result of the intervention not whether controlled trial proves its efficacy145 some observers suggest that until the federal government relents and becomes more hospitable to marijuana research proposals and more willing to consider moving marijuana to less restrictive schedule the medical marijuana issue will continue to be fought at state and local vels of governance as one patient advocate has stated as the months tick away it w ill

path newsweek february 3 1997 p 27legalize the recreational use of marijuana for all they see it as devious tactic in the more than 30year effort by marijuana proponents to bring an end to marijuana prohibition in the united states and elsewhere they point out that between 1972 and 1978 the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml succe ssfully lobbied 11 state legislatures to decriminalize the drug reducing penalties for possession in most cases to that of traffic ticket also in 1972 norml began the first of several unsuccessful attempts to petition dea to reschedule marijuana from schedule i to schedule ii on the grounds that crude marijuan had use in medicine148 later beginning with california in 1996 drug legalizers pushed successfully for passage of medical marijuana voter initiatives in several states prompting thendrug czar barry mccaffrey writing in newsweek to warn that were on perilous path i think its clear he wrote that lot of the people arguing for the california proposition and ot hers like it are pushing the legalization of drugs plain and simple149 is it cynical or smart for norml and other drug reform organizations to simultaneously pursue the separate goals of marijuana decriminalization for all on the one hand and marijuana resc heduling for the seriously ill on the other it is not unusual for political activists tactically to press for and accept halfmeasures in pursuit of larger strategic goal pro life activists work to prohibit partialbirth abortions and to pass parental notification laws gay rights activists seek limited domestic partner benefits as stepping stone to full marriage equality thus is the tactic used on both sides of the cultural di vide in america to the alarm of those opposed it is certainly true that the medical cannabis movement is an offshoot of the marijuana legalization moveme nt many individuals and organizations that support medical marijuana also support broader progra m of drug law reform it is also true however that many health professionals and other indi viduals who advocate medical access to marijuana do not support any other ch anges in us drug control policy in the

grinspoon and bakalar in the journal of the american medical association advocates of medical use of marihuana are sometimes charged with using medicine as wedge to open way for recreational use the accusation is false as applied to its target but expresses in distorted form truth about some opponents of medical marihuana they will not admit that it can be safe and effective medicine largely because they are stubbornly committed to exaggerating its dangers when used for nonmedical purposes150 the authors of the iom report were aware of the possibility that larger ideological positions could influence ones stand on the specific issue of patient access to medical marijuana when they wrote that it is not relevant to scientific valid ity whether an argument is put forth by someone who believes that all marijuana use should be legal or by someone who believes that any marijuana use is highly damaging to individual users and to society as whole p 14 in other words it is widely believed that science should rule when it comes to medical issues both sides in the medical marijuana debate claim adherence to this principle the house government reform committees april 2004 hearing on medical marijuana was titled marijuana and medicine the need for sciencebased approach and medical marijuana advocates plead with the federal government to permit scie ntific research on medical marijuana to proceed rescheduling marijuana and making it available for medical use and research is not necessarily step toward legalizing its recreational use such move would put it on par with cocaine methampheta mine morphine nd methadone all of which are schedule ii substances that are not close to becoming legal for recreational use proponents of medical marijuana ask why marijuana
