also asserts that egypt is not adequately sealing its side of the borderciting the recent breakthrough of hundreds of thousands of palestinians who rushed into egypt on january 23 2008 after hamass takeover of the gaza strip in june 2007 israeli officials adamantly asserted that egypts security presence along the philadelphi route an 82mile strip of land in egypt immediately adjacent to the gaza strip was inadequate and was allowing smugglers to bring advanced weaponry into the gaza strip and thereby threaten israeli national security israel has claimed that smuggling tunnels which have been used for over two decades to bring arms commercial goods and people from egypt into gaza are now being used to ship antitank weapons katyusha rockets and shoulderheld antiaircraft missiles weapons

egypt has taken concrete steps to detect and destroy the smuggling network and tunnels that lead from egypt to gaza this withholding of fmf represents the first time that congress has successfully

parties in the fall of 2007 department of defense delegation toured the gazaegypt border and the us army corps of engineers drafted geological assessment of the underground smuggling tunnels as result the us government has offered to allocate 23 million of egypts annual foreign military financing fmf toward the procurement of more advanced detection equipment such as censors and remotecontrolled robotic devices it is uncertain when this new equipment will be purchased and delivered the smuggling tunnels 1982present the divided border city of rafah has been the epicenter of smuggling for decades2 rafah was divided under the terms of the 1979 israelegypt peace treaty which placed the more densely populated rafah city in the then israelioccupied gaza strip and much smaller town in egyptian controlled territory in 1982 as israel was in the midst of its phased withdrawal from the sinai under the terms of the peace treaty with egypt former israeli prime minister and then defense minister ariel sharon reportedly requested that egypt make alterations to its international border with israel to keep rafah whole and under israels control sharon asserted that if divided rafah could become focal point for terrorist infiltration and arms smuggling3 egypt refused 2 observers note while smuggling between gaza and egypt has received the bulk of recent international scrutiny there is flourishing illegal trade in arms drugs prostitutes and foreign workers over the israelegypt border as well according to one account in 2002 alone signs of over 400 incidents of smuggling were detected along the israeliegyptian border approximately 3000 people mainly from eastern europe crossed into israel illegally and over fifty tons of narcotics mainly locally produced marijuana and hashish entered israel from the sinai peninsula see doron almog tunnelvision in gaza middle east quarterly summer 2004 3 israelis ask to redraw border bit new york times january 19 1982 crs3 figure 1 the egyptgaza border palestinian families divided by the partition of rafah in 1982 appear to have been the first to construct underground tunnels linking gaza and egypt to foster communication amongst extended family members over time rafah residents developed an economic rationale for tunneling as smugglers could resell subsidized egyptian gasoline at high profit in gaza other smuggled items included us dollars for money changers wedding dowries mail cartons of cigarettes drugs marijuana and heroin gold and spare car parts israel became aware of the security dimension of smuggling tunnels during the first palestinian intifadah uprising which began in 1987 after series of attacks by palestinians along the gazaegypt border in the late 1980s and early 1990s israeli officials began to consider that palestinian militants were using the tunnels to both smuggle weapons and their own fighters out of gaza to allude capture with the creation of the palestinian authority pa in 1994 under the terms of the oslo peace process israeli concerns that pa police who were responsible for uncovering arms smuggling were either at best ineffective or at worst complicit with the tunneling activities of their conationalists became more strident during the second more violent palestinian intifadah beginning in september 2000 the demand for weapons skyrocketed and tunneling activity increased israeli egyptian and pa forces confiscated dozens of rocketpropelled grenade launchers explosives thousands of kalashnikov rifles and tons of ammunition israel also constructed 25foot concrete or iron wall along the border that extended 10 feet underground it used sonar to detect tunnels occasionally setting off charges in the crs4 ground to collapse the tunnels nevertheless the economic and strategic incentives for smuggling grew substantially according to one report the profits are huge kalashnikov sells for 200 on the egyptian side but fetches 2000 on the gaza black market good nights delivery is 1200 kalashnikovs profit of more than 2 million bullets 50 cents in egypt 8 wholesale in gaza are even more profitable standard onenight delivery returns profit of 7500004 the mechanics of the tunnels the mechanics of smuggling arms into gaza have been documented widely at any one time there are between 10 and 30 main tunnel shafts underneath the border5 wealthy families in rafah called snakeheads finance tunnel openings to these main shafts in either their private homes or rented properties6 the snakeheads then rent their tunnel openings to independent gunrunners or members of hamas palestinian islamic jihad and fatah affiliated militias who are then responsible for moving guns and goods from egypt into gaza when tunnel is completed the primary investor and hisher relatives are entitled to percentage on every shipment passing through it packages of arms and ammunition are pulled by cables and electric motors through the tunnels which in some places reportedly reach depths of between 50 and 60 feet in order to avoid detection7 although there is definitive proof as to the origins of the small arms egypt and israel believe that many of the weapons are from yemen sudan darfur egypt sinai and israel proper israeli countermeasures prior to israels unilateral withdrawal from gaza the israel defense forces idf carried out several operations to stem the flow of weapons however due to rafahs urban terrain israeli military operations there drew widespread international and israeli leftwing condemnation because of the destruction of homes and loss of civilian life during operation rainbow in 2004 in which israel used caterpillar d9 armored bulldozers to destroy homes suspected of concealing tunnels dozens of palestinian protestors were killed and several hundred homes were demolished one aim of operation rainbow which was launched after 11 israeli soldiers were killed in several attacks was to create buffer zone adjacent to the philadelphi route to protect israeli soldiers and prevent palestinians from digging underground tunnels in 2004 the israeli army reportedly planned on digging ditch or moat 49 to 82 feet deep to prevent digging8 the moat plan was abandoned due to humanitarian reasons waterfilled moat could have further contaminated the gaza water table with seawater 4 into the underworld the sunday times uk july 17 2005 5 crs

august 2005 it negotiated new security arrangement with egypt to bolster efforts to secure the egyptian side of rafah after extensive israeli egyptian talks egypt deployed 750 border guards to secure the philadelphi route the memorandum of understanding between israel and egypt delineated the type of equipment the egyptians may use small arms and jeeps heavy armor and the length of the patrol area 14km on the ground and 3 km into the sea9 israeliegyptian tensions over smuggling hamass subsequent takeover of the gaza strip first through its victory in the 2006 pa legislative election and then through internecine fighting with fatah appears to have caused significant tension in israeliegyptian relations with idf forces longer posted on the gaza side of the border and with the demand for weapons skyrocketing due to both intrapalestinian fighting and resumption in israelipalestinian violence smuggling activity underneath the gazaegypt border is said to have reached an alltime high10 the allure of smuggling has been further abetted by rising poverty rates among gazans due to both the international aid boycott of the palestinian authority that followed the formation of hamasled government in 2006 and israels 2007 closure of the gaza strip following the hamas takeover israels accusations some israeli lawmakers and intelligence officials blame egypt for the increased tunnel traffic in september 2006 the director of the shin bet israels counterintelligence and internal security service yuval diskin reportedly stated that the egyptians know who the smugglers are and dont deal with them they received intelligence on this from us and didnt use it11 after the 2006 israelhezbollah war israel began claiming that palestinian terrorist groups were smuggling advanced weaponry such as katyusha rockets shoulderfired antiaircraft missiles and antitank guided missiles through the tunnels miri eisin the spokeswoman for prime minister ehud olmert was quoted saying whats happened now is that theyre trying to smuggle in more advanced weapons we mean antitank weapons of the sort which were used against us in lebanon some of them 9 for the details on the 2005 mou see brooke

weapons which weve been worried about in the past but now its much more concrete12 one israeli lawmaker yuval steinitz member of the opposition likud party and former chairman of the knessets foreign affairs and defense committee has accused egypt of among other things allowing hamas to obtain 20000 rifles 6000 antitank missiles 100 tons of explosives and several dozen katyusha rockets and shoulderheld antiaircraft missiles13 in november 2007 steinitz wrote letters to members of congress asking them to support proposals to freeze us military aid to egypt in his letters steinitz stated that it is almost ridiculous for the egyptians to focus on finding the tunnels since it would be much easier for them to intercept the smugglers before they get anywhere near the border also in november 2007 israeli public security minister avi dichter asserted that egypt could deploy to stop the smuggling within an hour what we previously perceived as weakness or inability to act may be egyptian policy14 in december 2007 israeli accusations against egypt reached crescendo israeli foreign minister tzipi livni stated in her testimony before knesset committee that the egyptian failure to secure the border with gaza is terrible problematic and damages the ability to make progress in the peace process following her statement the new york times reported that israeli officials had sent videotapes to us officials showing egyptian border guards not only ignoring smuggling but in at least one case aiding it15 however an unnamed israeli security official stated that the accusations about egyptian collaboration with arms smuggling were meant to sabotage an upcoming meeting between israeli defense minister ehud barak and egyptian president hosni mubarak16 egypts reaction foreign minister livnis comments when coupled with the withholding of us military aid to egypt in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl110161 brought strong and harsh reaction from egypt in one interview president hosni mubarak remarked that tzipi livni crossed red line with its very easy to sit in an office and criticize our performance on the ground this works to dampen the atmosphere relations with israel are very important to do not ruin themif you disapprove of the way we handle arms smuggling youre welcome to do the job yourselves17 egyptian leaders also have accused some

adequate resources and manpower to effectively patrol the gazasinai border egypts 2005 memorandum of understanding mou with israel specifies in great detail the precise numbers of troops and equipment that can be deployed on their side of the border the egyptian defense ministry claims that at any one time up to third of their 750troop regiment is offduty or is on leave leaving fewer troops to protect the border and stop smuggling egypt also claims that while israel has provided it with intelligence on known smugglers the information is often imprecise and not actionable19 egypt reportedly has asked israel to renegotiate either the 2005 mou or the camp david peace treaty itself to allow for the deployment of additional 12 regiments in rafah israeli leaders have responded by insisting that rather than send more egyptian troops to the border egypt should make better use of the soldiers already on patrol however on january 31 2008 the jerusalem post reported that israel and egypt are in advanced talks over possible deployment of additional egyptian troops in sinai in an effort to seal the border with gaza20 tensions abated somewhat after israeli defense minister ehud baraks trip to egypt in late december 2007 after his meetings barak stated that peace with egypt is strategic asset to both sides and as in the past when there have been disputes they had to be worked out prime minister ehud olmert followed these conciliatory remarks stating that egypt has peace agreement with us and i think that with all the difficulties in the relations they are very satisfied with the

unmanned ground vehicles and acoustic sensors to improve egypts tunnel detection capability egypt construct canal along the border an idea that israel had proposed two years earlier new physical barriers be erected with piles driven deep into the earth and the united states egypt and israel establish trilateral security commission that would deal with all the issues related to the gazaegypt

2007 and offered to assist egypt by providing technical advice and training according to us secretary of state condoleezza rice we think that egypt has to do more those tunnels need to be dealt with the egyptians have said that they want some perhaps technical help were prepared obviously to give that but its also you know the will to do it is very important here23 us representative steve israel who visited rafah egypt in january 2008 reportedly remarked that with the army corps equipment with the sustained us technical advice this should make big difference in closing these tunnels and take

according to the last eubam factsheet since corporal gilad shalit was captured by hamas on 25 june 2006 the rafah crossing point rcp has been closed for normal operations and open on an exceptional basis only considerable efforts were made to mediate the resumption of normal operations and to at least ensure that the crossing was open as often as possible eubam efforts resulted in rcp being open for 83 days between 25 june 2006 and 13 june 2007 allowing nearly 165000 people to cross25 there have been some notable exceptions to rafahs total closure in january 2008 egypt allowed approximately 2200 palestinians several of whom were hamas leaders to exit and reenter gaza for the annual haj pilgrimage to mecca saudi arabia both israel and palestinian authority president mahmud abbas had expressed frustration with egypts decision charging that it had undermined the pas authority26 egypt reportedly permitted about 85 hamas members and other militants wanted by israel to enter gaza via rafah in october 2007 in exchange for wanted qaeda militant27 several months earlier prior to the hamas takeover of gaza israel and egypt had permitted 500 fatah loyalists to cross into gaza from egypt where they reportedly had received us training28 january 23 gaza breach after weeklong israeliimposed total closure of gaza which was put in place to compel hamas to halt its rocket attacks into israel hamas supporters blew several holes in the border fence on the palestinian side of rafah allowing perhaps as many as 200000 gazans to enter egypt reportedly the breach had been carefully planned by hamas for over month as militants used blowtorches to weaken the structural integrity of the corrugatediron fence since 2005 there have been several other hamasplanned breaches of the border according to initial reports the outpouring of individuals into egypt overwhelmed egypts forces and with the exception of some arrests the egyptian border guard force did not use force against

gaza breach puts mubarak on spot wall street journal january 24 2008 crs10 questions for congress could the gazaegypt border be completely resealed in the days following hamass breach of the border many observers have begun to question whether the gazaegypt border will ever be completely resealed while as of late january 2008 the flow of palestinians streaming into the sinai peninsula had been considerably reduced nevertheless thousands of palestinians remained in egypt proper and two border crossings remained open egypt has deployed thousands of police in the sinai peninsula to keep palestinian from reaching cairo and other areas further inside egypt on january 30 2008 one senior israeli security official remarked that there has been dramatic progress made with the egyptians with regards to sealing the open border in rafah30 in an ironic twist of fate smugglers have been quoted in the press indicating that the open border has cut into their profits one smuggler interviewed by reuters stated that people bought all they needed by crossing the border in daylight and for free we have had business for week if rafah crossing would open properly for trade i may quit tunnelling31 the egyptian government is seeking to restore the palestinian authoritys presence along with european union monitors along the border so far hamas has appeared unwilling to relinquish its presence there many analysts believe that even if the pa were to regulate the border hamass control of the gaza strip would allow it to retain influence along the border an israeli newspaper featured quote from one senior israeli political source stating that anyone who thought that an addition of 750 egyptian border policemen would solve the problem now realizes that this will not help much broader solution is needed and israel has to formulate new strategy32 are advanced weapons being smuggled through the tunnels israel claims that antitank weapons katyusha rockets and shoulderheld antiaircraft missiles are being smuggled into gaza on january 3 2008 hamas or palestinian islamic jihad pij fired standard russianmade 122mm gradseries katyusha into israel the rocket achieved range of 108 miles qassam rockets which are manufactured in gazan metal shops have maximum range of 6 miles according to janes defence weekly israeli intelligence had warned in 2005 that the pij had received shipment of 20 gradseries rockets which were smuggled into the gaza strip from egypt33 however the israeli newspaper yediot aharonot quoted an unnamed israeli security official who claimed that the rocket fired on january 3 was produced in iran and had been smuggled into gaza from egypt by sea34 overall 30 israeli official dramatic progress with egypt on sealing open border in rafah tel aviv ynetnews open

while most experts agree that advanced weapons could easily find their way to palestinian terrorist groups in the gaza strip there is real consensus concerning the scale of smuggled advanced weaponry in addition many analysts believe that egypt has underreported the amount of arms coming into gaza while israel has exaggerated the threat these arms pose to its overall security some observers state that hamass arsenal is not as sophisticated as hezbollahs in lebanon nevertheless israeli military officials appear to have concluded that hamas is gradually adopting hezbollahs military doctrine one report suggests that hamas has organized along the lines of conventional army with companies and battalions assigned to defense of specific sectors fixed chain of command and teams attempting to stage ambushes of israeli forces as they enter and leave the strip35 is egypts physical presence on the border sufficient israel and egypt differ fundamentally over the size of egypts border guard force egypt has repeatedly requested that israel amend their agreement to allow for an additional regiment to deploy in rafah raising the total number of soldiers to 1500 israel has responded that egypt lacks the political will to stop smuggling or stop palestinians from breaching the border however as previously mentioned israel may now be seriously considering an egyptian proposal to allow the deployment of additional forces along the egyptian gaza border while the smuggling issue has worsened in recent years at time has any one government israeli egyptian or palestinian pa been able to fully stop the movement of goods and arms under the border while egypt has uncovered numerous tunnel openings on its side of the border it reportedly lacked the capacity or the will to destroy the tunnel shafts that remain open even when an entrance is sealed furthermore as long as tunnels remain open on the palestinian side the egyptians have not been able to fully destroy them with the recent us pledge to reallocate 23 million in fmf for new equipment and training egypts record on destroying tunnels may improve moreover the border guard forces rules of engagement against palestinians crossing the border are deliberately ambiguous due to domestic popular sensitivities in egypt its leaders seek to avoid the appearance of harming palestinian civilians based on the events of january 23rd egypt is clearly not going to shoot either hamas members or civilians who breach the border fence unless it is in selfdefense hamas deftly exploits this situation to the detriment of egypts military according to mouin rabbani an analyst at the international crisis group think tank in jordan egypt is confronted with what for them is nasty dilemma put in the position of being cojailer of

for over three decades while many experts agree that ultimately both sides are committed to upholding the camp david agreement further public disagreements over managing the gaza border run the risk of poisoning relations and negatively affecting cooperation on issues of critical importance to us national security such as countering islamist extremism and fostering israelipalestinian peace indeed at time when the administration has committed itself to reaching peace deal by the end of 2008 the current israeliegyptian dispute could prove to be an unwelcome distraction to followup negotiations after the annapolis peace conference looking ahead israeliegyptian tensions over border security are likely to continue one day after the border breach israeli deputy defense minister matan vilnai stated that we need to understand that when gaza is open to the other side we lose responsibility for it so we want to disconnect from it hamas itself has expressed desire to see the border reopened and managed by the palestinian authority ironically both of these positions pose challenges for egypt which wants to keep hamas isolated but not be held solely responsible for failing to do so by either israel or the united states nevertheless as violence between israel and hamas and other palestinian factions in the gaza strip continues these issues will continue to fester with hamas showing indication that it is ready to renounce its stated goal of israels destruction all parties would appear to be long way from seeing the gazaegyptisraeli region at peace for other versions of this
