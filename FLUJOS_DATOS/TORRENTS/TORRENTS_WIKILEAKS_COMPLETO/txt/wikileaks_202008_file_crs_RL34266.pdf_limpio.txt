continued re lease of new scientif ic findings on various aspects of climate change the ipcc fourth assessment report ar4 critically reviewed the research on science impacts and mitigation stra tegies and underscored large areas of agreement on climate issues as well as some important uncertainties and disagreements the ipcc concluded that the earths climate unequivocally has warmed over the past century and that wh ile natural factors including changes in solar irradiance and volcanoes have played roles in the observed changes most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations1 additional research published in 2007 showed continuously rising concentrations of

additional research indicated several ecological risks including mortality of the eastern pacific gray whale and lower survival rates among young polar bears linked to climate change concerns about climate change are base d both on observed changes to date and projections of what is likely to occu r in the future the ipcc concluded that greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations in the atmosphere could be expected to grow through the 21st century in the absence of concerted climate change mitigation policies for wide range of plausible ghg scenarios to 2100 the ipcc projected best

solar variab ility and land cover change have undoubtedly influenced the obs erved climate change but the dominant driver of change since the 1970s is estima ted to be the increase of greenhouse gases

influence during nonsummer seasons on the arctic climate than carbon dioxide and other longlived ghg9 carbon dioxide co2 concentrations have grown from preindustrial concentration of about 280 parts pe r million volume ppm to 379 ppm in 200510 the ipcc found that atmospheric concentrations of co2 379ppm and methane 1774 parts per billion ppb in 2005 exceeded by far the natural range over the last 650000 years11 global average co2 concentrations reached 381 in 2006 and are very likely to exceed the maximum again in 2007 the ipcc found that the increases in co2 concentrations since the industrial revolution are due primarily to human use of fossil fuels with landuse change s primarily deforestation making significant but smaller contribution while over the past few decades countries have trended towards using cleaner lower carbon fuels such as natural gas instead of coal the ipcc noted that the longterm trend of declining co2 emissions per unit of energy supplied reversed after 200012 methane concentrations also grew fro m preindustrial value of about 715 ppb to 1774 ppb in 200513 the rate of methane growth slowed and has been negative in several years since about 1992 for

seasonal melting of sea ice triggers positive feedback that increases ocean warming further increasing sea ice melting and so on22 some scientists have expressed concern that recently observed sea ice

sheet the expanse of melting was twice the size of the united states24 however recent observations for example the high melting rates in 2005 that startled many scientists have exposed greater variability and complexity in ice dynamics than previously understood as melting rates in 2006 returned cl oser to the average nonetheless 2007 reanalysis of surface melting of the gr eenland ice sheet over the past 25 years found that the rate of acceleration of melting was about double previous estimates the melting is closely correlated with summer temperatures between 1979 and 2005 the area of greenland affected by melt on at least one day per year grew by 42 while the mean temperature rose by 24oc25 melting and thickening of ice in antarctica satellite observations analyzed in 2007 indicate that the antarc tic ice sheet is losing mass overall the losses are mainly from the western antarctic ice sheet nasa satellites revealed that snow is melting farther inland at higher altitudes than before and increasingly on the ross ice shelf which buffers landbased glaciers from the warmer ocean air26 some high elevation regions of the antarc tic ice sheet do not show significant rate of change or show less melting researchers identified link between changes in temperatures and the duration and area of melting in antarctica suggesting connection to global climate

through the 20th century others at high ltitude above 4200 meters have changed very little in the same period so melting did occur however during the 2003 extreme heat wave melting of glaciers and ice nd contribution to sea level rise of the global melting of ice contributing to observed sea level rise about 60 is currently coming from relatively small landbased glaciers and only about 28 is coming from melting of the greenland and an tarctic ice sheets one report published in 2007 concl uded that the net amount of melting ice from glaciers and ice caps flowing to the oceans each year is about 100 cubic kilometers or about the volume of lake erie28 according to the report the rate of melting has increased dramatically and demonstrates the poor understanding researchers have regarding the dynamic instability of snow and ice due in part to this poor understanding the ipcc did not include any potential acceleration of melting from greenland and antarctica when it estimated potential sea level rise through the 21st century of between 7 to 23 inches with further warming the acceleration of dynamic ice melt could raise the estimates of sealevel ri by an additional 4 to 10 inches by 210029 weakened uptake of carbon in the southern ocean research published in 2007 concluded that net removal of co2 from the atmosphere by the southern ocean sink has weakened over the past 25 years the researchers say this is due to higher winds caused by the elev ated levels of ghg in the atmosphere and longterm depletion of stratospheric ozone the greater storminess enhances mixing and upwelling of ocean waters and in creases the rate of release of co2 to the atmosphere more than the increase in photosynthetic removals due to higher atmospheric co2 concentrations30 this finding raises concern among some scientists about whether hum anrelated ghg emissions will continue to be removed from the atmosphere by natural sinks at historic rates which are assumed in many projections

in the reference scenarios39 economic and energy growt h combined with continued fossil fuel use lead to changes in the earths radiation balance that are three to four times that already experienced since the beginning of the industrial age40 this research also explored scenarios aimed at stabilizing the growth of ghg concentrations in the atmosphere at four increasingly stringent levels roughly

ice biome because of sensitivity to warming water resources in some dry regions at midlatitudes and in the dry tropicsdue to changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration and in areas dependent on snow and ice melt agriculture in lowlatitudes due to reduced water availability lowlying coastal systems due to threat of sea level rise and increased risk from extreme weather events human health in populations with low adaptive capacity p 11 more extensive adaptation than is cu rrently occurring is required to reduce vulnerability to climate change there ar barriers limits and costs which are not fully understood p 14 international cooperation will help to reduce global costs for achieving given level of mitigation or will improve environmental effectiveness efforts can include emissions targets sectoral local subnational and regional actions rdd programmes adopting common policies implementing development oriented actions or expanding financing instruments p 19 decisions about macroeconomic and other nonclimate policies can significantly affect emissions adaptive capacity and vulnerability p 19 determining what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system in relation to article 2 of the unfccc involves value judgements p 19 limited and early analytical results from integrated analyses of the costs and benefits of mitigation indicate that they are broadly comparable in magnitude but do not as yet permit an unambiguous determination of an emissions pathway or stabilisation level where benefits exceed costs p 23 many impacts can be reduced delayed or avoided by mitigation p 20there is high agreement and much evidence that all stabilisation levels assessed can be achieved by deployment of tfolio of technologies that are either currently available or expected to be commercialised in coming decades assuming appropriate and effective incentives are in place p 22 an effective carbonprice signal could realise significant mitigation potential in all sectors modelling studies show global carbon prices rising to 2080 ustco 2eq by 2030 are consistent with stabilisation at around 550 ppm

scenarios i ndicate that 6080 of the reductions would come from energy supply and use and industrial processes with energy efficiency playing key role in many scenarios including nonco2 and co2 landuse and forestry mitigation options provides greater flexibility and costeffectiveness low stabilisation levels require early investments and substantially more rapid diffusion and commercia lisation of advanced low emissions technologies without substantial inve stment flows and effective technology transfer it may be difficult to achieve emission reduction at significant scale mobilizing financing of incremental costs of lowcar bon technologies is important p 22 the macroeconomic costs of mitigation generally rise with the stringency of the stabilisation target p 22 impacts of climate change are very likely to impose net annual costs which will increase over time as global temperatures increase peerreviewed estimates of the social cost of carbon in 2005 average us12 per tonne of co 2 but the range from 100 estimates is large 3 to 95tco2 this is due in large part to differences in assumptions regarding climate sensitivity response lags the treatment of risk and equity economic and noneconomic impacts the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses and di scount rates aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors regions and populations and very likely underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many nonquantifiable impacts p 23 choices about the scale and timing of ghg mitiga tion involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions now against the corresponding mediumterm and longterm climate risks of delay p 23
