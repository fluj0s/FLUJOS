legislation domestic social policy division health care spending past trends and projections summary this report focuses on trends in personal health care spending which includes spending on health care goods and services provided to individuals and excludes expenditures for administrative costs research and public health activities personal health care expenditures have grown considerably over the past 40 years between 1960 and 2003 the most recent year available personal health care spending increased from 234 billion to 14 trillion it is estimated that personal health spending will exceed 31 trillion in 2014 data on health expenditures suggest four important trends first during the 1990s health spending has grown at lower rates than in the past however from 2000 to 2003 health spending grew at higher rates than the previous decade second health care spending as percent of gross domestic product gdp was relatively constant between 1992 and 2000 health spending as percent of gdp increased in 2001 2002 and 2003 indicating that health expenditures are growing faster than the overall economy third four types of health services consistently compose the bulk of health care expenditures hospital care physician and clinical services nursing home and home health care and prescription drugs spending on prescription drugs has grown since 1980 and is projected to continue growing during the next decade fourth over the past 40 years the primary financing of health care has shifted from outofpocket payments to payments by private insurance and the federal government

spent on health care and healthrelated activities1 table 1 indicates how this amount was spent data on national health expenditures include spending on broad range of health related activities small portion of 2003 health expenditures about 238 billion or 14 was spent on administrative costs net cost of private health insurance2 government public health activities research3 and construction however the vast majority of 2003 health expenditures was spent on personal health care personal health care includes goods and services provided to individuals to treat or prevent medical conditions the remainder of this report will focus on personal health care expenditures spending on personal health care continues to increase every year between 1960 and 2003 expenditures for personal health care grew from 234 billion to 14 trillion in 2014 personal health care spending is projected to exceed 31 trillion figure 1 tracks past and projected growth rates of personal health care spending in nominal terms ie not adjusted for inflation from the beginning of 1994 to the end of 1999 health spending increased at an average annual rate of 54 this low growth is attributable to changes in both the private and public sectors in the private sector the increased use of managed care limited cost growth during the mid1990s vigorous fraudandabuse investigation and the balanced budget act of 1997 which slowed growth in hospital home health and nursing home payments constrained health expenditures in the late 1990s4 the effects of these changes in public and private sector have subsided personal health expenditures have increased at an average annual rate of 82 from 2000 to 2003 yet looking from broader 1 all dollar figures cited in this report were obtained from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms office of the actuary all percentages were calculated by congressional research service crs using data from cms 2 net cost of private health insurance is equal to the difference between all premiums paid to insurance providers minus what insurance providers must pay for the provision of health care to its members 3 research excludes amounts spent by pharmaceutical manufacturers medical equipment suppliers and other companies expenditures on research and development by such entities are implicitly included in the spending figures for other categories eg prescription drugs and durable medical equipment 4 levit katharine cynthia smith cathy cowan helen lazenby and anne martin inflation spurs spending in 2000 health affairs vol 21 1 janfeb 2002 crs2 historical perspective spending growth in 2002 was still much lower than that in most years since 1960 see figure 1 in particular the years 1979 through 1981 experienced growth rates between 138 and 161 between 2004 and 2014 personal health care spending is projected to increase at an average rate of about 77 per year table 1 2003 health expenditures increase percent over 2002 increase

can cause nominal spending to increase rising prices population growth increases in the quantity of medical services each person receives advances in medical knowledge and technology and other factors expenditures attributable to nonprice factors are often referred to as real spending growth in real spending represents quantitative and qualitative increase in the level of medical care that individuals are receiving and can indicate an improvement in the populations standard of living5 conversely increases in health care expenditures attributable to higher prices represent only pecuniary transfer from the payer to the providers and manufacturers of medical goods and services figure 2 depicts the share of nominal spending growth attributable to increases in medical care prices increases in population and increases in per capita real health expenditures what some experts describe as the intensity of care for much of the time period shown in figure 2 prices played larger role in nominal spending increases than population or nonprice factors eg improved medical technology or higher utilization during the late 1990s medical care prices constrained by managed care grew at lower rates than in any other year shown price growth is projected to increase during the next decade though not to the high levels experienced during the 1970s and 1980s 5 in general higher consumption of goods and services medical and nonmedical alike is usually viewed as improving the standard of living for an individual however some experts might argue that higher utilization is not always indicative of higher standard of living for example an outbreak of contagious disease would increase the utilization of health services yet one would claim that those infected would have higher standard of living crs4 figure 2 factors influencing growth in nominal personal health expenditures 18 16 14 actual projected 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010

service crs calculations using data from the us census bureau and the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary note to make component factors additive percentages in this figure represent continuous growth rates rather than discrete annual changes continuous growth rates can be converted to discrete yearly changes using the formula annual changeexpcontinuous rate1 however currently available price indexes may not accurately reflect changes in medical care prices ideally price index would measure only how much must be paid this year to receive the same level of care as that received in some base period holding quality constant but it is difficult to hold the quality of care constant over time considering the rate of medical advances for example heart surgeries today are of higher quality than those performed in the past as measured by survival rates yet price indices tend to treat both procedures as equal in quality thus measures of increases in the price of heart surgeries capture both pure price increases as well as quality increases which violates the basic principle of price indexes by including quality effects in price measures price indexes tend to overstate true increases in medical prices6 6 for more information see ernst r berndt et price indexes for medical care goods and services an overview of measurement issues in david m cutler and ernst r berndt medical care output and productivity chicago the university of chicago press 2001 crs5 health spending and gross domestic product personal health expenditures as percent of gdp have risen since 1960 this trend has two implications 1 personal health care spending is growing faster than the overall economy and 2 larger share of the nations economic resources is being devoted to providing medical goods and services to the population figure 3 depicts past and projected personal health care spending as percent of gdp in 1960 personal health care expenditures were about 4 of gdp in 2003 they were 13 much of this growth occurred between 1960 and 1991 between 1992 and 2000 personal health expenditures as percent of gdp remained between 115 and 117 this relative constancy indicates that expenditures were growing at about the same rate as the overall economy in 2001 however personal health care expenditures grew to 123 of gdp an indication that personal health care spending grew faster than the overall economy in that year it is projected that personal health care spending will continue to grow faster than the overall economy accounting for almost 16 of gdp in 2014 figure 3 personal health care spending as percent of gross domestic product gdp 18 actual projected 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 year source the congressional research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary crs6 spending on specific categories of health care of the total amount spent on personal health care the largest categories of expenditures tend to be hospital care physician and clinical services nursing home and home health care and prescription drugs the contribution of these four categories to personal health spending has remained fairly constant averaging 84 of total personal health care spending over the last four decades however the relative sizes of these categories have changed over time figure 4 depicts past and projected spending on each of these categories as percent of personal health care spending expenditures on hospital care as percent of personal health spending have decreased from 47 in 1980 to 36 in 2003 they are projected to decrease further in the future this trend indicates that spending on hospital care is growing at slower rate than spending on other categories of personal health care spending on prescription drugs as percent of personal health care spending has increased from 6 in 1980 to 12 in 2003 it is projected to continue increasing through the next decade such trend indicates that spending on prescription drugs is rising faster than other categories of personal health care figure 4 probably underestimates the impact of prescription drugs on personal health care expenditures data on drug spending reflect prescription drugs obtained from retail pharmacies but it excludes drugs provided by institutional pharmacies drugs dispensed to patients from hospital or nursing home pharmacy are excluded from the prescription drug category instead spending on drugs dispensed from institutional pharmacies is implicit in the amount spent for services at the respective institutions eg hospital services or nursing home care figure 4 major categories of personal health care spending as percent of total

care prescription drugs source the congressional research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary crs7 who pays for health care direct payments for personal health care come from five general sources consumer payments outofpocket payments by private insurance companies federal funds state and local funds and other private funds outofpocket payments include payments by those without health insurance outofpocket payments also include payments by the insured for deductibles coinsurance and costs not covered by insurance excluding premiums other private funds consist mostly of philanthropic contributions to the health care system ultimately all health care spending is paid for by individuals through direct payments costsharing insurance premiums7 taxes and charitable contributions however most of these payments are redistributed what person pays does not necessarily reflect how much health care that person receives one who pays relatively high taxes might not have any of their health care financed by the government similarly there are some people who pay health insurance premiums yet use less care than the sum of the premiums paid only when individuals pay directly for the cost of treatment either because they are uninsured or because they have not met their deductible do personal expenditures directly reflect the amount of care received figure 5 shows the percent of personal health care spending attributable to each source in 1960 55 of all personal health care was financed outofpocket whereas private insurance paid for 21 and the federal government paid for 9 in 2003 only 16 of personal health care was paid outofpocket while private insurance paid for 36 and the federal government paid for 33 much of the increase in the federal governments share of health spending occurred during the 1960s when the medicare and medicaid programs were introduced the increase in the federal governments share of payments during the 1990s is likely due to the ability of private insurance to reduce its share of expenditures through managed care furthermore during this period there was dramatic increase in the quality and cost of health services 7 even if the employer is contributing all or portion of the insurance premium individual workers generally accept lower wages in exchange for this benefit thus they pay for employer contributions to health care in the form of reduced wages that are lower than what they would otherwise be paid if the employer offered health benefits crs8
