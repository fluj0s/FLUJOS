the 107th congress introduction federal policy toward veterans recognizes the importance of their service to the nation and the effect that service may have on their subsequent civilian lives the department of veterans ffairs va administers directly or in conjunction with other federal agencies programs that provide compensation for disabilities sustained or worsened as result of active duty military service pensions for totally disabled poor war veterans cash payments for cer tain categories of dependents andor survivors free medical care for conditions sustained during military service and medical care for other conditions much of which is provided free to low income veterans education traini ng rehabilitation and job pl acement services to assist veterans upon their return to civilian life an guarantees to he lp them obtain homes life insurance to enhance financial secu rity for their depe ndents and burial assistance flags gravesites and headstones when they die the veteran population there were about 253 million veterans as of sept ember 30 2001 of whom 191 million had served during at least one period defined as wartime family members and survivors of veterans totaled about 414 million thus va is potential source of benefits for almost onef ourth of the population of the united states onethird of veterans live in 1 of 5 states california florida texas new york pennsylvania the number of veterans is declining and their average age increasing during the fiveyear period from 20002005 the number of veterans is projected to decline by 92 while the number of veterans 80 nd older is expected to go up by 834 at the end of fy2000 the median age of veterans was 574 year s 36 were over 65 years of age about 55 were female va projects decline of about 26 in the number of veterans betw een 1990 and 2010 down from one of four men in 1995 to one of eight in 2010 half of whom will be over age 62 decline in the size of military forces nd the corresponding effect that decline has had on the number of persons entering veterans status means relatively stable numbers of compensated veterans and fe wer veterans seeking readjustment for postservice education and training th number of disabled wartime veterans receiving pensions is declining because of the deaths of existing beneficiaries and because veterans who might once have pended on va pensions as social safety net now have other sources of social insura nce primarily social security that bring their incomes above the va pension eligib ility levels however the increasing average age of veterans means additional demands for medical services from eligible veterans as aging brings on chronic co nditions needing more frequent care and lengthier convalescencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs2 1 final

groups and some health care professionals advocated an ggressive response by va to combat thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs7 contagious threat the administration s budget estimated that funding for the diagnosis and treatment of infected ve terans would rise to 340 million in fy2001 up from 195 million in fy2000 and 46 million in fy1999 however va analysts were concerned that comprehensive system was in place to collect informa tion about actual workloads nd costsfor the hepatitis c program because the projections for them were based on formulas that relied on untested assumptions and actual perform ance particularly for fy2000 did not bear out projections while hepatitis c continues to be serious health issue in need of dedicated attention to its causes prevalence diagnosis treatment management and possible cure it does not appear as if th dire predictions about its effect on the veteran population has occurre d actual costs for hcv related medical services during fy2001 are estimated to have been 98 million and for fy2002 are projected to reach 105 million with 111 million expected to carry out diagnosis and treatment during fy2003 veterans housi ng benefits the va program to guarantee home loans for veterans has made significant contributi on to the national goal of increasing the number of families who own their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans were obligations of the federal government that constituted mandatory spending administrative expenses are disc retionary appropriati ons transferred from the home loan programs to the ge neral operating expenses account va construction the administration has requested 194 million for major construction projects for fy2003 and requested the same

va has developed comprehensive planning approach to constructing altering extendi ng or otherwise improving facilities in part this new planning pproach called capital asset realignment for enhanced services cares is the departments reaction to th criticism it has received from areas of the country in which hospital re sources have been cut back in order to redirect those resources to outpatient care usually in ot her geographical areas while va has been successful in expanding th number of patients it serves conflict continues between advocates of more efficient use of resources who advocate reducing hospital space and closing or lling superfluous inpatie nt facilities and veterans groups who see any reduction in i npatient care as threat to the medical care needs of the veteran population the cares effort is an attempt to make the planning process by which the capital assets are develope d used modified or reli nquished open to veteranshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs8 groups often the fears about reductions in health care to veterans are based on an inadequate understanding of the improvements in care for more veterans that such realignment of resources ma kes possible and the cares approach may lessen those misunderstandings some veterans have expressed the belief that over time moving resources from an inpatient facility in one area to outpatient access in nother yields an unacceptable rate of deterioration in the former facility as the commitment to maintain the building is diminished as the department moves toward its eventual abandonment burial

from an average 205896 during fy2001 which was up from an average of 202621 during fy2000 and 205547 in fy1999 much of the decline will be in medical staff which va projects will average 179300 during fy2002 currently va projects that va medical care slots will average 181500 in fy2001 va originally estimated that 179206 medical care slots were needed for fy2001 compared to an 179520 in fy2000 and 182661 in fy1999 accrual accounting part of the 44 billion increase in total va spending for fy2003 does not reflect expanded prog ram costs for add itional benefits or medical services to veterans but rather change in methods by which future compensation for va employees who will eventually retire is attributed to current service those employees pe rform this new accounting method would result in the transfer of 892 million to central account s in the treasury to fund the accruing future cost of retirement and retiree health benefits for va employees because the accrued funds would be retained in g overnment fund this new accounting practice does not affect employees benefits in an way nor does it have direct impact on taxpayers however to cover the accrual payments the changing practice makes the apparent current cost of va employment somewhat higher especially in the labor intensive medical programs as appropriations to fund re quested program levels must be higher than would otherwise be required to maintain the same level of services although there is necessary reason for accrual accounting to make any difference in total government expenditures the appa rent higher personnel costs for individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs9 agencies may act as ps ychological impetus to reduce personnel expenditures if congress requires the agency to absorb the accrual transfer within an appropriation that does not increase to meet the new requirement closer look at ongoing issues medical care in recent years congress has invested substantial resources to improve the efficiency quality and breadth of va medical care and to make that care more accessible to more veterans the va medical care system has been transformed from hospitalbased program providi ng most of its services to inpatient treatment of relatively small percentage of veterans who tended to be older sicker poorer and more frequently minorities than the ge neral population wh ile va continues to provide inpatient treatment to its traditional clientele the va system is increasingly emphasizing outpatient care administe red through regional va health plans organized around managed primary care prin ciples and provided in an increasing number of outpatie nt clinics the number of individual veterans rved by va medical care staff has increased by 65 in the last seven years and nearly all of that increase has been in primary care provided thr ough outpatient clinics in fy1996 va medical care resources were split evenly between inpa tient and outpatient services by fy2003 inpatient care will consume less than onethird of the resources as the average age of the veterans popul ation rises more attention is being directed toward the additional medical issues pertinent to older aged patients the 106th congress enacted legislation directing va to expand its geriatric services including nursing home care and other ex tended care capacity and to develop more assisted living arrangements and practices consistent with an evolving medical view about improving the lives of elderl people at the same time an increasing reliance on outpatient services has increased the importance of vas pharmacy program in its role implementing outpatient treatment plans the increasing awareness of va pharmacy benefits has magnified the relative absence of similar benefits under medicare th primary federal medical program serving people over the age of 65 veterans are not denied care currently va medical personnel can be expected to provide medical services to all veterans who appear at va medical facilities seeking care veterans seeking appointments may sometimes be discouraged by va administrative staff from having their medical needs served through va and encouraged to seek health care services elsewhere in the community in practice however all veterans presenting health complaints to va medical facilities are sc reened to determine their dical condition the disposition of most cases occurs simultaneously with that screening for instance veteran complaining of sore throat asks to see doctor va medical staff examine the patient diagnos an infection prescribe an appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs10 3 although the law specifies that veterans with 50 or greater disability ratings are assurred free va medical care in practice va generally does not seek costsharing payments from veterans with serviceconnected disability ratings of 10 or greaterantibiotic which is then filled at an onsite va pharmacy if during this screening patient is discovered as having an emergent condition condition that left untreated could threaten the health of the patient the medical staff can be expected to initiate an appropr iate course of trea tment without regard to eligibility status in the event that the medical staff commitment to address all complaints was to come into conflict with resource limitations vas medical care professionals would allocate the services they could provide according to the traditional triage model applicants would be given access to care ba sed on the urgency nd type of conditions presented and those veterans most in need of care would be given high priority for services regardless of those veterans overall place in the priority schedule administered by va health care resource management this potential sharp contradiction between medical and administrative priorities has not occurred appropria ted resources and the shift of more services from inpatient to outpatient settings has allowed va to serve all veterans applying for care without denying care to any particular vete ran with medical need identified by va medical professionals while some veterans have complained that services are not given to them in the same manner or locati on as they had previously experienced this change is not itself denial of care but rather byproduc t of the efficiency efforts yet some areas of the country continue to feel the pinch of reduced va medical resources as programs dependent upon i npatient capacity give way to outpatient services shifting resources from underutiliz ed inpatient care to outpatient clinics increases the number of veterans who can be served by the same number of va medical personnel 75 of the va medi cal care budget funds medical care personnel either as federal employees or through contract ed care at the same time this shift in resources can result in the rmination of programs that often rely upon inpatient capacity especially those concerned with mental health and substance abuse programs costsharing for veterans medical care for the treatment of service connected conditions is free to veterans care for nonserviceconnected conditions is also free for veterans rated at 50 or greater for purposes of va compensation for serviceconnected conditions3 the largest category of other veterans eligible for free nonserviceconnected care have limited assets

priority 7 veterans can recei ve va care but are obligated for share of the costs of such care in the past va patients tended to be lder sicker poorer and more likely to have social problems and ntal illness than persons using private health care facilities4 increasingly va patients are drawn from cross section of the population that more closely resembles th general public after considering the differences in demographics between the ve teran population and othe rs indeed the administration reports that the largest growth in veterans seeking va care are veterans who do not have serviceconnected condition do not have incomes that fall below vas income test and do not meet any other criterion warranting free va care under current law these priority 7 ve terans have climbed from about 2 of the patients seen in 1986 to about 33 currently and are projected to climb to 42 of the patients va provides services to by 2010 according to va documents supporting the administrations request for fy2003 for inpatient care copayments are quivalent to the medicare costsharing schedule for 2002 veterans pay 792 for th first 90 days of hospitalization during any 365 day

veterans are obligated for 20 of the projected average cost of an outpatient visit this formula yields copayment of 50 for outpatient visits in 2001 veterans single dependents with incomes above 9304

would establish deductible for priority 7 veterans of 1500 per year assignable at rate of 45 of the cost of each visit until the maximum level is reached thus under the administra tions plan veterans who have had their copayment redu ced from 50 per visit under provisions engendered by pl 106117 would have th eir copayments increased to about an average of 95 per visit until the maximu m of 1500 is reached in calendar year in part the basis for the administrations request is to discourage the rise in the rate at which priority 7 veterans are enrolling in va health care plans copayments are generally not thought of as ways of raising money from the population of patients affected but as way of discouraging t hose persons from seeking care through that system of services va projects that th imposition of their proposal would yield 260 million in copayments and reduce rvices by 885 million by discouraging priority 7 enrollees from seeking services for which the copayment is applicable the va pharmacy formulary va does not operate pharmacy in the same sense in which drugstore can be expect ed to fill prescriptions across the full spectrum of available medical supplies va operates

mental health services especially such services applicable to posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse the act also authorized va to pay for emergency care on behalf of uninsured enrolled

ineligible for free prescriptions establish maximum monthly and annua l amount for veterans with multiple prescriptions and revise out patient care copayments for higher income veterans pl 106117 gave high priority acce ss to va medical services for military retirees which had the effect of placing priority access for military retirees ahead of veterans who do not qualify for free relatively highpriority care because they do not meet the standards for serviceconnected free care and they do not have incomes and assets below vas meanstest ed threshold also vetera ns awarded purple heart are now to be given access to free higher pr iority health care it should be noted however the priority access has not had the effect of denying care to any veterans as the va health plan enrollment system has remained open to all veterans who enroll medicare subvention work will likely continue on rationalizing the relationship between the va and medicare programs many veterans advocates have suggested that va should also be reimbursed for nonserviceconnected care va provides veterans who are also covered by medicare medicare subvention meaning transfer or subsidy from the medicare trus t funds is the term by which this proposal is known if medicare were to transfer funds to cover the cost of vas services to its existing caseload of patients who are also covered by medicare medicare program outlays could increase and va would experience an increase in spending authority on the other hand if va served additional veterans whose care is currently paid by medicare and if va provided that care ss expensively than providers who would otherwise be reimbursed throug h medicare then real savi ngs could be possible both to taxpayers and to medicare offset against this potential savings would be any costs accrued by va for services to additional patient s and for benefits that va provides that medicare does not cover for its participants such as pr escription drugs if subvention caused the government to provide more in total rvices than would otherwise have been provided overall federa l spending would increase unless savings in the cost ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs14 providing those services through va inst ead of through medicare reimbursement of private health care providers equals or ex ceeds the cost of the additional services however the real stumbling block to s ubvention appears to be the fact that va already serves medicare patients for which it is not reimbursed by medicare and that will continue without change in law under any scenario medicare would transfer funds to va for services va provided to medicarecovered vete rans and for which medicare would otherwise be obligated to pa to private providers thus there is real incentive for medicare advocates to support plan which transfers medicare funds to va to pay for services that dicare would not otherwise pay for at all subvention recent proposals one approach receiving attention in the last two congresses would have permitted veterans with medicare eligibility whose va eligibility requires them to share in the cost of their medical care to enroll in va plan and have their medicar benefits provided through that plan medicare would then pay va the same rate per covered person that it would pay for those persons to enroll in similar private prepaid plan approved by medicare medicare subvention would require va nd the department of health and human services hhs to coordinate the co llection of data which would be analyzed to make sure that medicareeligible veteran receives less in medical benefits through va than would be received directly through medicare and that reimbursements to va from medicare do not exceed established limits under legislation deliberated in the previous two congresses the medicare trust fund would have been authorized to reimburse va for medicare services it provides to these duallycove red veterans by up to 50 million annually va would serve the medicarecovered veterans in th plans in the most appropriate venue whether in va facility or through contracts with private health care providers late in the 2nd session of the 106th congress an amended version of the evolving medicare subvention proposal wa s deliberated during the development of legislation to enact comprehensive changes to medicare various participants including the house ways and means committee the house commerce committee the senate finance committee together w ith house and senate leadership proposed an agreement called the medicare medicaid and schip benefits and improvement and protection act of 2000 which was then attached to hr 2614 bill to amend the small business investment act th agreement passed the house on october 26 2000 but the provisions to establish medicare subvention pilot program were dropped from the bill befo re action was taken another approach deliberated during the 106th congress that addressed some of the same issues in dual medicareva medical coverage would have permitted va to pay some of the costs associated with treatments given to veteran in nonva medical facility when va determined that it is in the veterans medical interest to provide such care outside va for practical reasons such as the distance veteran might need to travel to reach an appropriate va medical facility four pilot projects were to be authoriz ed and the projects selected were to be located in such way as to limit the number of veterans participating to more thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs15 15 of those living in the area 70 of the veterans in the area must have travel of more than 2 hours to reach facility and th total that could be spent on the projects in any fiscal year was to be limited to 50 million the pilot projects were to expire in 2005 and any adverse effects on va dical facilities would have prompted changes in projects proponents of these provisions pointed to the increased access that would result from veterans becoming able to seek care cl oser to their homes and noted that the number of veterans seeking care from va is increasing fast enough to compensate for diminished demand at the facilities affected in effect the provisions would have allowed va to pay costs including copaym ents and deductibles for veterans in va plans who were also covered by ot her plans including medicare opportunities for veterans to seek car elsewhere alarms some veterans organizations which believe it could lead to an erosion of va specialization in veterans disability services and declines in the number of veterans seeking services at va medical facilities they conclude that such changes when combined with va efficiency moves shifting care from inpatient facilities to outpatient clinics would mean the eventual closing of va hospitals the ongoing issue of presuming service connections the relationship between risk exposure and subsequent disabilities introduction some veterans and their dvocates believe that exposure to environmental toxins or unknown and mysteri ous diseases during military service has left many veterans vulnerable to an array of disabilities ter in life in recent times congress has considered the concerns of ve terans with claims arising from service in nuclear testing areas vietnam and the persian gulf authority for va to provide medical treatment for diseases presum ed linked to radiation has been made permanent similar authority to receive hi gh priority medical treatment for diseases presumed related to exposure to agent or ange and other herbicides in vietnam expires at the end of 2002 authority for pr iority medical treatme nt for veterans who may have been exposed to toxic substan ces or environmental hazards during the persian gulf war expired at the end of 2001 authority to evaluate the health of spouses and children of persian gulf war ve terans expires at the end of this year although major legislation has not been considered in the 107th congress the issue of presuming disabilities to be serv iceconnected and the implications of such presumptions is of ongoing concern to congress and to veterans service organizations the following discusses the history and current status of this issue giving veterans the benefit of the doubt the nation has accepted an obligation to veterans who incur injury disease or aggravate an existing condition va law calls all of these disabilities while in service to the country health services cash payments and other benefits may be given to veterans who experience disabilities traceable to peri od of military service these disabilities need not have occurred in the line of duty or even be re lated to active duty for condition to be regarded as serviceconnected veterans need show only that the condition occurred or was aggravated as result of military service or arose during that periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs16 to receive benefits for serviceconn ected disability vete rans are required to document that their condition is related to their service the claim is often clearly documented by pertinent military records however with some disorders evidence of serviceconnection is inconclusive congress has sometimes granted presumption of serviceconnection so that veterans can be treated and given appropriate compensation while scientific studies attempt to determine whether correlation can be found between risk s the veteran encountered during military service and the subsequent ma nifestation of disorder early in the 20th century these presumed serviceconnections permitted va and its administrative forerunners to treat veterans for variety of little understood ailments that they might have contracted during duty in faroff lands while many tropical diseases long defied routine diagnosis more familiar diseases such as malaria were diagnosed accurately and the sporadic recurrence of its symptoms over time were well known the pa ssage of time between ve terans exposure to risk and onset or recurrence of specific di sease made the use of presumptions an attractive alternative to protracted exa mination of claim that was necessarily difficult to validate or rebut recent presumption issues current concern that latent illnesses could be related to toxic exposure during gulf wa r service was preceded by similar concern that certain diseases could be related to exposure to agent orange or other herbicides in vietnam that concern was preceded by concerns that certain diseases could be related to exposure to nuclear radiation during world war ii or during atomic testing in the 1950s in these cases policy objec tives were based on the rationale that veterans should be given th benefitofthedoubt as to the treatment of illnesses potentially traceable to military service 1 these veterans were sick with serious diseases needing treatment 2 they di d serve their country often in war time combat zone and 3 capacity to provide the services existed if they were given high priority access from scientific standpoint the eviden ce necessary for va to conclude that particular presumption shoul d be expanded to include dditional diseases is not particularly high thres hold generally speaking the law excludes extending presumptions to disorders in which sc ientific evidence has found correlation between exposure to risk and the contracti on of disorder or when the disorder is attributable to another cause yet other scientific evidence even when inconclusive may be enough for the list of disorders with presumptive service link to be expanded presumptions and exposure to nuclear radiation from 1945 until 1963 the us exploded approximately 235 nuclear devices in the atmosphere potentially exposing an estimated 220000 military personnel to unknown levels of radiation some of these ve terans later claimed that low level radiation released during the testing may be cause of certain adverse health consequences they had experienced in addition so veterans who had been among occupation forces in hiroshima and nagasaki after the atomic bomb attacks on those cities also claimed that they had experienced adverse health effects because of that occupation servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs17 6 hrept 100235 report from the house committee on veterans affairs to accompany the atomic veterans compensation act of 1987 pl 100321 7 ibid p 1011while carcinogenic and other health eff ects of high radiation doses was well known scientific evidence about the longt erm health consequences of exposure to low levels was inconclusive in 1987 congress chose not to abide by its longstanding tradition that benefits shoul d be paid only where substantive evidence is clearly available to establish that the disabling conditions existed while on active duty or are clearly related to such period of service instead congress accepted the conclusion that because the evidence of expos urelevel risk could not be verified it should depend instead on correlation of vari ous diseases with radiation exposure pl 100321 included language establishing presumption that 13 diseases would be presumed to be serviceconnected if th ey manifested in veterans whose service histories included active duty in radiationrisk activity6 the va opposed passage of the bill arguing that existing law was sufficient to permit awarding benefits in cases in which the evidence linking diseases to radiation exposure was conclusive at the heart of the objection to the bill was the administrations claim that the overw helming majority of veterans covered by the bill received very low doses of radi ation whether they participated in the weapons tests or the occupati on of hiroshima or nagasaki va examined scientific data on correlations between various cancers and radiation exposure at the level that had been experienced by the veterans and projected that of the 32000 to 34000 deaths from cancer that would otherw ise occur among the 200000 veterans made eligible for the presumption under the law the additional exposure from their service experience would lead to 10 additional deaths the administration concluded that the issue really becomes whether the federal government should presume that all 32010 eventual cancers among atomic veterans are serviceconnected in order to assure that the 10 possible excess cases related to service are covered or whether it is better public policy to look at each case individually to separate the more deserving claims from those less deserving7 in spite of the va opposition the bill passed nd subsequently has been amended to include additional diseases expanding presumptions to include exposure to agent orange congress also granted priority medical tr eatment to veterans who had been exposed to the defoliant agent orange the active ingredient in that defoliant is the chemical dioxin for which there is some evidence of diseasecausing potential by the time that congress enacted legislation authoriz ing the treatment of diseases possibly linked to radiation exposure increasing numbe rs of veterans of service in vietnam were claiming serviceconnection for disa bilities that they belie ved were related to exposure to agent orange when concern mounted that exposure to herbicides in vietnam could have posed health risk the department of defense examined its records to determine which personnel may actually have been ex posed and what level of exposure they may have experienced however depl oyment records and troop movement datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs18 8 the dod medical registry and the va pers ian gulf health registry have had some clinical evaluation contact with about 100000 of the nearly 700000 gulf war veteranscould not pinpoint exposure with accuracy congress drew the conclusion that exposure to agent orange or to other herbicides regardless of their toxicity at sufficient levels to be potentially diseas ecausing had to be presumed given the widespread use of herbicides because exposure to toxic herbicides was presumed for any military personnel who served in vi etnam during the period in which agent orange was used science need only find so evidence suggestive of an association between particular disease and exposure to herbicides at any level in order to validate presumption that the disease is serviceconnected presumption for spina bifida in 1996 congress amended va law to grant the presumption of serviceconnection to claims on behalf of children stricken by the disease spina bifida who are born to vi etnam veterans spina bifida is birth related disease that can entail intensive and expensive assistance to the child for years the basis for this expansion wa s national

of illnesses that they thought mig ht be attributable to their service there commonly reported symptoms included fatigue muscle and joint pain severe headaches and memory loss media reports began to characterize the array of symptoms as the gulf war syndrome although single illness with the multitude of symptoms has been diagnosed and common characteristics of the veterans circumstances have been

war the benefitofthehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30803crs20 doubt that their ailments may be connected to their military service however the basis for establishing scientifically link between an exposure to risk and the incidence of disease could be further eroded persian gulf war veterans were potentially exposed to large number of toxins and were authorized to receive priority treatment for virtually unlimited list of symptoms researchers caution that it may be impossible to identify the causes of illness in many gulf war veterans because of the absence of baseline data on the health of military personnel and the lack of reliable data on levels of exposure to potential risks in their wartime environment in effect because both exposure to toxic risk and the presence of disorder are presumed the statistical rela tionship between the risk level for one and the incidence of the othe r may be indeterminable overcoming presumed serviceconnection tobacco related illnesses in the 105th congress action was taken to prevent serviceconnection to toxic risk after several years of study in 1997 va had concluded that nicotine addiction is disease that could be li nked to tobacco use that began during military service thus if nicotine addiction has its origins in military service then secondary diseases linked to tobacco use were arguably serviceconnected while there are actual data on the number of total possible claims the potential number of claims was in the millions moreover the echo of serviceconnected claims could have continued for decades through compensation automatically paid to the dependents and survivors of veterans who die from rviceconnected conditions at issue was the governments res ponsibility when its military personnel made unwise health choices which were at least facilitated if not openly encouraged by government actions some argued that am erican taxpayers should not be held liable for illnesses caused by veterans decisi ons to use harmful tobacco products however as former va official pointed out during recent hearing our veterans were in many cases provided that first ciga rette by our government as part of their daily food ration or as part of comfort pack clearly the government was the agent that ultimately gave those cigarettes to our veterans while some veterans advocates vigor ously opposed changing the law others focused on securing some of the saving s for veterans benefits provision restricting va from paying compensation to veterans for adverse effects of tobacco use was included in pl 105178 the tr ansportation equity act for

periodically through various forms of informal media for nearly 50 years defying vigorous attempts by va and congress to eradicate it from the common sense origin of the dividend rumor in 1950 va paid 27 billion in special dividends to 16 million world war ii veterans who had national service life insurance policies with pr emiums paid to 1948 the 1948 special dividend from that point forward the possibility of dividends has led to periodic rumors that congress has again passed such bene fit or is considering doing so for instance in 1965 for unknown reasons some newspapers published stories reporting of the special dividends that had been paid in the early 1950s as if the dividends were being paid at the time the stories were published while va attempted to squash the misinformation w ith factual stories each time the false reports surfaced the stories w ould take on local circula tion life gradually drifting to more marginal print media such as newsletters flyers and local bulletins and sometimes accompanied by bogus application forms at some points va received as many as 20000 inquiries per week about this supposed dividend and in 1970 the volume of requesters prompted congress to enact legislation declaring steps to be taken whenever va was presented with such bogus applications the stories are false there has been recent legislation that would authorize special
