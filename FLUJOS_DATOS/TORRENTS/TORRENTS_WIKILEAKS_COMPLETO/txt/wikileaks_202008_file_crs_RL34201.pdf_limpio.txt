water act sdwa selected regulatory and legislative issues summary much progress has been made in assuri ng the quality of public water supplies since the safe drinking water act sdwa was first enacted in 1974 public water systems must meet extensive regulations and public water system management has become much more complex and prof essional endeavor the environmental protection agency epa has regulated so 91 drinking water contaminants and more regulations are pending in 2005 ep reported that the number of systems reporting violations of drinking water standards reached new high of 94 in 2003 despite such progress however an rray of issues and challenges remain in the 110th congress key issues have invol ved infrastructure funding needs related compliance issues and concerns caused by detections of unregulated contaminants in drinking water such as perchlorate and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps another i ssue involves the adequacy of existing regulations such as trichloroethylene tce and epas pace in reviewing and potentially revising older standards c ongress last reauthorized sdwa in 1996 although funding authority for most sd wa programs expired in fy2003 congress continues to appropria funds annually for these prog rams broad reauthorization bills have been proposed as epa states and water systems continue efforts to implement and comply with the requirements of the 1996 law and new regulations longstanding and overarching sdwa i ssue concerns the cumulative cost and complexity of drinking water standards and the ability of water systems especially small systems to comply with standards the issue of the affordability of drinking water regulations such as those for arseni c radium and disinf ection byproducts has merged with the larger debate over what is the appropriate federal role in assisting communities with financing drinking water infrastructure water infrastructure financing legislati on has been offered in recent congresses to authorize increased funding for the dwsrf program and to provide grant assistance for small communities in the 110th congress bills were offered to provide technical financial and other compliance assistance to small communities the senate environment and public works committee reported several drinking water bills including broa d water infrastructure financ ing bill s 3617 none of the legislation was enacted and the debate continues over the federal role in the funding of projects needed for sdwa co mpliance and for water infrastructure improvement in general several bills have

water act sdwa selected regulatory and legislative issues introduction the safe drinking water act1 sdwa is the primary federal law for protecting public water supplies from harm ful contaminants first enacted in 1974 and broadly amended in 1986 and 1996 the sdwa is administered through programs that regulate contaminants in public water s upplies provide funding for infrastructure projects protect underground sources of dri nking water and promote the capacity of water systems to comply with sdwa regulations the environmental protection agency pa is the federal agency responsible for administering sdwa however the 1974 w established federalstate structure in which epa may delegate primary enforcement and implementation authority primacy for the drinking water program to states and tribes the stateadministered public water supply supervision pwss program remains the basic program for regulating public water systems and epa has delegated primacy for this program to all states except wyoming and the district of columbia which sdwa defines as state epa has responsib ility for implementing the pwss program in these two jurisdictions and throughout most of indian lands2 since the law was first enacted much progress has been made in assuring the quality of public water supplies epa has re gulated some 91 drinking water contaminants and more re gulations are pending in 2005 epa reported that the number of public water system s reporting violations of the healthbased standards reached 94 in 20033 however drinking water sa fety concerns and challenges remain epa and state enforcement data indicate that water systems still incur tens of thousands of violations of sdwa requirements each year although these violations primarily involve monitoring nd reporting requirements they also include thousands of violations of standards and treatment tec hniques moreover monitoring and reporting violations create uncertainty as to whether systems actually met thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs2 4 us environmental protection agency fy2009 annual performance plan and congressional justification program performance and assessment p 795applicable healthbased standards while noting increased compliance levels in the 2005 report epa estimated that only 65 of violations of healthbased standards and 23 of violations of monitoring and reporting requirements we re reported to the epa database thus increasing uncertainty as to the quality of water provided by many systems epa and the states have resolved some data quality and reporting problems and efforts continue to addr ess this issue in 2008 epa reported that 915 of the total population served by co mmunity water systems received drinking water that met all healthbased st andards during fy2007 up from 894 in fy20064 concern also exists over the potential health effects of drinking water contaminants for which standards have not been set such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe the act requires epa to tinually evaluate contaminants that may be candidates for regulation however epas perceived lack of action on contaminants of concern has generated criticism in congress and elsewhere last major reauthorization and amendments congress last broadly revised the act with the safe drinking water act amendments of 1996 p l 104182 these changes resulted from mu ltiyear effort to amend statute that was widely criticized as having too little flexibility too many unfunded mandates and an ar duous but unfocused regulatory schedule among the key provisions the 1996 amendments author ized drinking water state revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help public water systems finance projects needed to comply with sdwa regulations the amendments also established process for selecting contaminants for regulation based on health risk and occurrence gave epa some added flexibility to consider costs and benefits in setting most new standards and established schedules for regula ting certain contaminants such as cryptosporidium disinfection byproducts arsenic and radon the 1996 law added several pr ovisions aimed at building the capacity of water systems especially small systems to comply with sdwa regulations it imposed many new requirements on the states for example the amendments require state programs for source water assessment operator certification and training and compliance capacity development the law also requires community water systems to provide customers with annual consumer confiden ce reports that contain information on regulated cont aminants found in the local drinking water congress authorized appropriations for most sd wa programs through fy2003 and although most funding authorities have expired br oad reauthorization bills have not been proposed as epa states and public wate r systems remain focused on meeting the requirements of the 1996 amendments in 2002 drinking water security provisi ons were added to the sdwa through the public health security and bioterro rism preparedness nd response act of 2002 pl 107188 t itle iv of that act included requirements for community water systems serving more than 3300 people to conduct vulnerability assessments andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs3 5 for more information see crs report rl31294 safeguarding the nations drinking water epa and congressional actions by

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs4 safe drinking water act issues current drinking water quality issues include the gap between infrastructure funding needs and spending the capacity of public water systems especially small systems to comply with growing set of complex standards and contamination of water supplies by unregulated contaminants such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe an emerging issue concerns proposals for largescale storage of carbon dioxide deep underground to mitig ate greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impacts this activity might have on groundwater quality in july 2008 epa proposed regulations to manage geologic sequestration under the authority of the safe drinking water acts gr oundwater protection provisions in the 110th congress bills were offered to address drinking water issues such as small system infrastructure funding needs s 1933 and s 199 and compliance problems facing small communities s 1429 and hr 2141 various bills

of appropriations for water and wastewater grants for alaskas rural and native villages none of the bills was enacted in the 1996 sdwa amendments congress authorized appropriations for most sdwa programs through fy2003 however broad sdwa reauthorization efforts were not on the agenda in the 110th congress as with other epaadministered statutes having expired funding author ity congress has tinued to appropriate funds annually for sdwa programs regulating drinking water contaminants contaminant candidate list the sdwa amendments of 1996 directed epa to publish every five years list of unregulated contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public water sy stems and that may re quire regulation epa published contaminant candidate lists ccls in 1998 ccl 1 and in 2003 ccl 2 in february 2008 epa published for public co mment draft ccl 3 that contains 93httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs5 6 information on the ccl2 and the rationale behind epas regulatory determinations are available at h ttp wwwepagovsafewa tercclreg_determine2htmlfr 7 january 4 2007 72 fed reg 367398chemicals or chemical groups and 11 microbiological contaminants 73 fed reg 9627 the list includes commercial and agri cultural chemicals biological toxins disinfection byproducts and pathogens 16 chemicals including perchlorate were carried over from ccl 2 epa screened some 7500 chemicals and microbes and selected 104 candidates for the draft ccl 3 however as discussed below the list does not include any pharmaceuticals and epa is now reviewing the adequacy of its screening process which was recommended by the nati onal academy of sciences regulatory determinations starting in 2001 and every five years thereafter the epa is required to determine whether or not to regulate at least five of the listed contaminants the act requires the epa to evaluate contaminants that present the greatest health concern and then to regulate those contaminants that occur at concentration levels and freque ncies of public hea lth concern where regulation presents meaningful oppor tunity for health risk reduction in july 2008 epa published final re gulatory determinations for 11 contaminants from the ccl 2 all of the determinations were decisions not to regulate in making these determinations epa noted that the data indicated that the contaminants either did not appear to occu r in public water systems or had low levels of occurrence at levels of health concern and that regulating the contaminants did not present meaningful opportunity for hea lth risk reduction for those contaminants with low occurrence frequencies epa is updatin g the health advisories to reflect new information or to include info rmation on degradation byproducts6 the agency did not make determinati ons for two chemicals that have been detected in numerous water supplies and have received considerable congressional attention perchlorate and mtbe epa noted that regulatory determination will soon be published for perchlorate and that decision was not made for mtbe because the health risk assessment for mtbe is being revised unregulated contaminant monitoring the 1996 amendments directed epa to establish criteria for program to monitor unregulated contaminants this monitoring program enables epa to collect data for contaminants that are not regulated but are suspected to be present in drinking water every five years epa is required to identify as many as 30 contaminants to be monitored this list is largely based on the contaminant ca ndidate list all systems serving more than 10000 people and sample of smaller systems must monitor for the contaminants the resulting data are added to the national contaminant occurrence database ncod epa published the first unregul ated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 1 in 1999 requiring monitoring for 26 chemicals in january 2007 epa issued the second rule ucmr 2 requiring systems to monito r for 25 chemicals over 12month period between 2008 through 20107 epa had included perchl orate on the draft ucmr 2 list but deleted it from the final list epa stated that it has sufficient perchlorate occurrence data but some advocates of perc hlorate regulation were critical of epas decision not to require further monitoring httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs6 8 for more detailed discussion see crs report rl31243 safe drinking water act summary of the act and its major requirements by mary tiemannstandardsetting as amended in 1996 the act directs epa to promulgate national primary drinking water regulation for contaminant if the administrator determines that the following three criteria are met the contaminant may have adverse health effects it is known or there is substan tial likelihood that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with frequency and at levels of public health concern and its regulation presents meanin gful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems drinking water regulations generally incl ude numerical standards that establish the highest level of contaminant that may be present in water supplied by public water systems where it is not economically or technically feasible to measure contaminant at very low concentrations epa may establish treatment technique in lieu of standard developing drinking water regulati on is complex process and epa must address technical scientific and economic issues the agency must 1 estimate the extent of occurrence of contaminant in sources of drinking water nationwide 2 evaluate the potential human exposure and risks of adverse health effects to the general population and to sens itive s ubpopulations 3 ensure that analytical methods are available for water systems to use in monitoring for contaminant 4 evaluate the availability and costs of treatment techniques that can be used to remove contaminant and 5 assess the impacts of regulation on public water systems the economy and public health regulation development ty pically is multiyear process epa may expedite procedures and issue interim st andards to respond to urgent threats to public health after reviewing health effects studi epa sets nonenforceable maximum contaminant level goal mclg at leve l at which known or anticipated adverse health effects occur and that allows an adequate margin of safety epa also considers the risk to sensitive subpopulati ons such as infants and children for carcinogens and microbes epa generally ts the mclg at zero because mclgs are based only on health effects and not on analytical detection limits or the availability or cost of treatment technologie s they may be set at levels that are not technically feasible for water systems to meet once the mclg is established epa then sets an enforceable standard the maximum contaminant level mcl the mcl generally must be set as close to the mclg as is feasible using the best t echnology or other means available taking costs into consideration sdwa 1412b8 the act does not discuss how epa should consider cost in determining f easibility consequently epa has relied on legislative history for guidance congress last addressed this issue in the senate report accompanying the 1996 amendments wh ich stated that f easible means the level that can be reached by large regi onal drinking water sy stems applying

available at httpwwwepagovsafewaterlcrmrindexhtmlavailable treatment technology the nate committee report explained that this approach is used because 80 of the population receives its drinking water from large community water systems and thus sa fe water can be provided to most of the population at very affordable costs9 however because standards are based on cost considerations for large systems congress expected that standards could be less affordable for smaller systems in 1996 congress expanded the acts variance nd exemption provisions to give small systems some added compliance flexibility see the discussion below on small system issues congress further revised the act to require epa when proposing standard to publish determin ation as to whether or not the benefits of proposed standard justify the costs if epa determines that the benefits do not justify the costs epa in certain cases may promulgate standard that is less stringent than the feasible level and that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at cost that is justified by the benefits10 epa used this authority to establish new standards for arsenic and radium recent and pending rules epas rulemaking activities include january 2006 rule package that expanded existin g requirements to control pathogens especially cryptosporidium and disinfectants eg chlorine and their byproducts eg chloroform these

impose increasingly strict controls on the presences of pathogens and disinfectants and their byproducts in water systems11 epa promulgated re lated ground water rule to establish disinfection requirements for sy stems relying on ground water in the past several years epa also issued standards for several radionuclides including uranium and radium and revised sta ndard for arsenic these rules are expected to reduce an array of health risks for consumers but they have potentially significant costs for the communities that must expand treatment facilities to comply with the standards in september 2007 epa completed targeted revisions to the lead and copper rule lcr the revisions are intended to address weaknesses identified during nationwide review of the rule following the discovery of high lead levels in washington dc tap water in 200412 the changes involved regulatory requirements for monitoring treatment customer notif ication and lead rvice line replacement more

tiemannperchlorate in drinking water perchlorate is the explosive component of solid rocket fuel fireworks road flares and other products used heavily by the department of defense dod and related industries pe rchlorate also occurs naturally including in areas of the southwest and is present in some organic fertilizer this compound has been detected in sources of drinking water for more than 11 million people usually at low levels it also has been found in milk fruits vegetables and bread perchlorate is known to disrupt the uptake of iodine in the thyroid potentially affecting thyroid function key concern is that if suffi ciently severe impaire d thyroid function in pregnant or nursing women may impair br ain development in fetuses and nursing infants because of this concern bills ve been repeatedly introduced in recent congresses to require epa to set dri nking water standard for perchlorate13 over the past decade epa has been evaluating perchlorate to determine whether federal drinking water standard is warranted regulatory issues have involved the relative risk re duction benefits and costs of federal regulation including environmental cleanup and water treatment costs both of wh ich are driven by federal and state standards another question s concerned the amount of perchlorate exposure that is attributable to food comp ared to drinking water under sdwa epa must regulate contaminant if the administrator determines that the contaminant occurs at frequency and vel of public health concern and that its regulation presents meaningful opportunity for reducin g health risks uncertainty about the health risks associated with exposure to perchlorate at low levels slowed epa efforts to determine whether to establish sta ndard and relatedly environmental cleanup standards for use at superfund and other contaminated sites in the absence of federal standard states have begun to adopt their own measures massachusetts blished drinking water sta ndard for perchlorate of 2 ppb in 2006 and california adopted standard of 6 ppb veral states have issued health goals or advisory levels ranging from 1 ppb in maryland advisory level and new mexico drinking water screening level to 4 ppb in texas residential groundwater cleanup level epa identified perchlorate as candida for regulation in 1998 but concluded that information was insufficient at that time to make regulato ry determination the agency listed perchlorate as priority fo r further research on health effects and treatment technologies and for collecting occurrence data in 1999 epa required water systems to monitor for perchlorate under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr to determine the frequency and levels at which it is present in public water supplies nationwide in monitoring conducted under the ucmr perchlorate was detected in 153 public wate r systems in 25 states out of 3600 water systems sampled nationwide in augu st 2005 epa proposed second ucmr that included perchlorate for additional monitoring between 2007 and 2011 most commentors did not support nother round of perchlorate monitoring many felt that further monitoring would impose costs but would not likely yield much beneficialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs10 14 national research council health implications of perchlorate ingestion board on environmental studies and toxicology na

that further monitoring was not needed 72 federal register 367 january 4 2007 the health effects assessments surrounding epas efforts to regulate perchlorate have been controversial in 2002 epa issued draft risk assessm ent that concluded that potential human health risks of pe rchlorate exposure include effects on the developing nervous systems and thyroid tumors the findings were based on rat studies that observed tumors and adverse effects in fetal brai n development this controversial draft ssessment included revised draf t reference dose rfd intended to protect the most sensitive groups agai nst these effects that dose roughly translated to drinking water standard of 1 part per billion ppb epas 1999 draft level had translated to standard of roughly 32 ppb because the reference dose provides the ba sis for determining the level at which drinking water standard is set and because these standards are in turn the basis of environmental cleanup standards dod and other perchlorate users and manufacturers have followed ep as perchlorate risk asse ssment efforts closely as result of interagency debate over th draft assessment in 2003 epa the dod nasa the office of management and budget and other federal agencies asked the national research council nrc to review the science for perchlorate and epas draft risk assessment the nrc released its study in january 200514 the nrc committee broadly agreed with several of epas findings but suggested several changes to the draft risk assessment among other findings the committee concluded that rat studies are of limited use for assessing human health risk associated with perchlorate exposure and the committee recommended that epa base its assessment on human data the nrc calculated an rfd for perchlorate that incorporated an uncertainty factor intended to protect the most sensitive populations epa adopted the nrcs recommended rfd which translates to drinking water quivalent level of 245 ppb if epa were to develop an mcl it would adjust this number to take into account the amount of perchlorate exposure that comes fro m other sources especially food despite the nrc recommendations substantial disagreement has persisted regarding what level of exposure is safe pecially for fetuses and infants and what drinking water standard is appropriate seve ral studies have indicated that thyroid changes occur in humans at significantly higher concentrations of perchlorate than the amounts typically observed in water supplies15 however 2006 study by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of representative

federal assistance for water infrastructure epa states communitie s and utilities have been examining alternative management and financing strategies to address sdwa compliance costs and broader infrastructure maintenance and repair costs such strategies include establishing publicprivate partnerships p rivatization options range from contracting for services to selling system assets improving asset management and adopting fullcost pricing for water services still these strategies may be of limited use to many small andor economically disadvantaged communities and stakeholders are likely to continue to urge congress to increase funding for water infrastructure26 small systems issues an issue that has received considerable attention concerns the financial technical and managerial capacity of small systems to comply with sdwa regulations roughly 84 44000 of th nations 52800 community water systems are small serving 3300 persons or fewer and 57 30000 of the community water systems serve 500 persons or fewer many small systems face challenges in complying with sdwa rules and more f undamentally in ensuring the quality of water supplies major problems include deteriorated infrastructure lack of access to capital limited customer and rate base inadequate rates diseconomies of scale and limited managerial and technical capabilities because of these same characteristics the dwsrf program has not been as successful for small systems compared to larger systems although these systems rve just 9 of the population served by community water systems the sheer number of small systems has created challenges for policymakers and regulators in the earliest sdwa debates congress recognized that setting standards based on technologies affordable for large citie s could pose problems for small systems during the reauthorization debate lead ing up to the 1996 amendments policymakers gave considerable attention to the ques tion of how to help small systems improve their capacity to comply with sdwa mandates the 1996 amendments added provisions aimed at achieving this goal incl uding requirement th at states establish strategies to help system s develop and maintain the technical financial and managerial capacity to meet sdwa regu lations congress also revised provisions on standardsetting 1412b variances 1415e and exemptions 1416 to increase consideration of small system concerns exemptions the acts exemption provi sions are intended to provide compliance flexibility in certain cases states or epa may grant temporary exemptions from standard if due to certain compelling factors including cost system cannot comply on time for example all systems are required to comply with the new arsenic standard five years after its promulgation date an exemption would allow three more years for qualified syst ems small systems serving 3300 persons or fewer may be eligible for up to three additional twoyear extensions for total exemption duration of nine years and fo r total of up to 14 years to achievehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34201crs18 compliance in the preamble to the arsenic rule published in january 2001 epa noted that exemptions will be an important tool to help states address the number of systems needing financial assistance to comply with this rule and other sdwa rules 66 federal register 6988 however to grant an exemption the law requires state to hold public hearing and make finding that the extension will not result in an unreasonable risk to health because of the administrative burden to the states the acts exemption authority has seldom been used approx imately 13 states had indicated that they would likely use the exemption process for the arsenic rule but it appears that many states have not exercised this option small system varian ces and affo rdability in contrast to exemptions variances offer more permanent form of compliance flexibility for small systems since 1996 sdwa has required epa when issuing regulation to identify technologies that meet the standard and that are affordable for systems that serve populations of 10000 or fewer if epa does not identify affordable compliance technologies then the agency must iden tify small system variance technologies variance technology need not meet the standard but must protect public health states may grant variances to systems serving 3300 persons or fewer if system cannot afford to comply with rule through treatment an alternative source of water or other restructuring and if the system installs variance technology with epa approval states also may grant vari ances to systems serving between 3300 and 10000 people regulations addressing micr obial contaminants are not eligible for variances under the statute in 1998 epa published affordability crite ria to establish guidelines for determining whether regulation is deemed affordable for small systems and whether small system variances would be available under the criteria epa evaluates the affordability of regulation by determining whether the compliance cost would raise the total water cost bove 25 of annual dian household income mhi in the three categories of small systems using this approach epa has determined that affordable compliance t echnologies are available for every drinking water regulation consequently the agen cy has not identified any small system variance technologies and thus sm all system variances are available several recent regulations such as the re vised arsenic and radium standards and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule have heightened concern particularly among rural communities that epa has not used the tools congress provided to help small syst ems comply with sdwa regulations affordability criteria review prompted by debate over the revised arsenic standard and its potential cost to small communities the conference report for epas fy2002 appropriations hrept 107272 di rected epa to

cautioned that significant practical logistical and ethical issues mitigate against the use of variances27 the national rural water associ ation member of the ndwac work group dissented and issued separate repor t urging epa to adopt sa fe and affordable variance approach that would make variances available to small communities as authorized by congress the science advisory board concluded that epas basic approach was justified on the basis of equity efficiency and administrative practicality but recommended ways to improve the criteria the sab suggested that epa consider lowering its affordability threshold noting that the national affordability threshold has never been exceeded but some small water systems appear to have genuinely struggled with costs suggesting that the 25 rule is too high28 the sab also encouraged epa to develop clear guidelines about when variances should be granted and recommended that epa consider measures other than median income to better capture impacts on disadvantaged households in march 2006 epa proposed three options for revising its affordability criteria for determining whether compliance tec hnology is unaffordable for small systems 71 federal register 10671 epa currently assumes that treatment technology costs are affordable to the average household if they do not cause median annual water bills to exceed about 1000 this threshold is calculated by taking 25 of median household income among small systems based on this approach epa has determined that affordable technologies ar available for all standards the three proposed options are well below that level 025 050 and 075 epa also requested comment on whether or not the agency should evaluate affordab ility strictly on national level or use twostep process th at would include evaluations of affordability first at the national level nd then at the county level county level analysis would be performed only when st andard was found to be affordable at the national level the revise d criteria are further intended to address the issue of how to ensure that variance t echnology would be protective of public health an issue that has historically hamp ered the use of variances epa is evaluating comments on its pr oposed revisions and has noted its intention to apply the revised criteria only to the recent stage 2 dbp rule and future rules states could use the criteria to gr ant smallsystem variances on casebycase basis when systems cannot afford to co mply with standard if these variances become available it is not clear how ofte n they might be used key issue is that variances allow systems to provide lowerquality water in lowerincome communities and this could raise issues for states communities and consumers small system legislation during the

injection received attention primarily regarding its role as potential means for sequestering carbon dioxide co2 emissions in geologic formations to control greenhouse gas emissions geologic sequestra tion gs is the process of injecting co2 captured from large stationary sour ce such as coalfired power plant through well deep into the earth for longterm storage research indicates that numerous

its use is increasing carbon capture and storage ccs is attracting growing num ber of proponents who believe that with proper site selection and management geol ogic sequestration could play an important role in controlling co2 emissions although considerable interest has emerged for the rapid commercialscale development of carbon sequestration projects questions exist regarding the longterm safety and effectiven ess of sequestration of large volumes of co2 issues include how sequestration activities might affect underground sources of drinking water what local health and environmental
