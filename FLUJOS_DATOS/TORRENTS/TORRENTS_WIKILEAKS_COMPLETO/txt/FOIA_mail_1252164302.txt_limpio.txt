mannpsuedu d et please write all emails as though they will be made public i would not rush and i would not respond to any of them until the best strategy is developed dont want to waste anyones time including yours or mcs since the recon in science has an error i think you do need to publish correction in science in that you can very briefly not it didnt affect the calibration nor the final result i dont think you have choice here and i dont think realclimate alone is the place for this although rc could be good for the bigger list of issues dont do it on mcs blog but it would be good to hear from ray and mike since they have the most experience in getting it right here are some other quick thoughts dont count on for the next week proposal hell and traveling make sure you have keiths feedback before saying anything about the dendro aspects dont know about dye3 issue error analysis should be done and be the topic of another paper it wasnt included in this paper so its something that should be done outside the peerreview process there is lots of new research to be done and someone should do it as time allows dont get pushed into something too rushed or preliminary and your defense is that you wrote paper that reviewed well and was published the goal wasnt to do everything in this paper 4 your are absolutely right and that could be in blog someplace or just let them go ahead and do stupid thing if this was climate field recon it would be different 5 is tricky giving him the data would be good but only if it is yours to give you cant give him data that you got from others and are not allowed to share but it would be nice if he could have access to all the data that we used thats the way science is supposed to work see what mike and ray say be careful very careful but now you know why i advocated redoing all the analyses few months ago to make sure we got it all right we knew wed get this scrutiny this paper has had great impact so far so thats something to remember its good work thanks peck on 9509 844 am darrell kaufman 1darrellkaufmannauedu wrote all i received my first hate mail this am which helped to realize that i shouldnt be wasting time reading the blogs regarding the upside down man as nicks plot shows when flipped the korttajarvi series has little impact on the overall reconstructions also the series was not included in the calibration nonetheless its unfortunate that i flipped the korttajarvi data we used the density data as the temperature proxy as recommended to by antii ojala coauthor of the original work its weakly inversely related to organic matter content i should have used the inverse of density as the temperature proxy i probably got confused by the fact that the 20th century shows very high density values and i inadvertently equated that directly with temperature this is new territory for but not acknowledging an error might come back to bite us i suggest that we nip it in the bud and write brief update showing the corrected composite nicks graph and post it to realclimate do you all agree theres other criticisms that have come up by mcintyres group 1 we cherrypicked the treering series in eurasia apparently this is old ground but do we need to address why we chose the yamal record over the polar urals apparently theres also record from the indigirka river region which might not have been published and doesnt seem to be included in keiths recent summary if we overlooked any record that met our criteria i suggest that we explain why keith are you back can ray or mike provide some advise 2 the correction for dye3 was criticized because the approachrationale had not been reviewed independently on its own bo has this procedure now been published anywhere 3 we didnt publish any error analysis eg leaveoneout but i recall that we did do some of that prior to publication would it be worthwhile including this in our update the thresholdexceedence difference obstyle does include bootstrapped estimate of errors that might suffice but is not the record we use for the temperature calibration 4 we selected records that showed 20th century warming the only records that i know of that go back 1000 years that we left out were from the gulf of alaska that are known to be related strongly to precipitation not temperature and we stated this upfront do we want to clarify that it would be inappropriate to use record of precip to reconstruct temperature or do we want to assume that precip should increase with temperature and add those records in and show that the primary signals remain 5 mcintyre wrote to to request the annual data series that we used to calculate the 10year mean values 10year means were up on the noaa site the same am as the paper was published the only nonpublished data are the annual series from the ice cores agassiz dye3 ngrip and renland we stated this in the footnote but it does stretch our assertion that all of the data are available publicly bo how do you want to proceed should i forward the annual data to mcintyre please let better yet the entire group know whether you think we should post revision on realscience and whether we should include reply to other criticism 1 through 5 above im also thinking that i should write to ojala and tiljander directly to apologize for inadvertently reversing their data other thoughts or advise darrell on sep 4 2009 at 524 pm nick mckay wrote the korttajarvi record was oriented in the reconstruction in the way that mcintyre said i took look at the original reference the temperature proxy we looked at is xray density which the author interprets to be inversely related to temperature we had higher values as warmer in the reconstruction so it looks to like we got it wrong unless we decided to reinterpret the record which i dont remember darrell does this sound right to you this dataset is truncated at 1800 so it doesnt enter the calibration nor does it affect the recent warming trend the attached plot same as before shows the effect of reorienting the record on the reconstruction it doesnt change any of our major or minor interpretations of course nick on thu sep 3 2009 at 445 pm nick mckay 2nmckayemailarizonaedu wrote hi all i havent checked the original reference for its interpretation but i checked the code and we did use it in the orientation that he stated hes also right that flipping doesnt affect any of the conclusions actually flipping it makes it fit in better with the 1900year trend ive attached plot of the original and another with korttajarvi flipped nick
