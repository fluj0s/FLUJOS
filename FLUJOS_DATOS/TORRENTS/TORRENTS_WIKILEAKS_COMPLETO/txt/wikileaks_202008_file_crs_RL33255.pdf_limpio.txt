divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255legal developments in international civil aviation summary much of the law regarding civil av iation has been veloped through combination of domestic laws and international agreements between the united states and other nations in 1992 the unite d states department of transportation dot introduced the open skies initiative and began negotiating and entering into modern civil aviation agreements with foreign countries as well as individual members of the european union eu as result of 2002 european court of justice ruling that several portions of these open skies agreements violated eu law the united states and the eu have been negotiating new open skies agreement tentative agreement appears to exist between the parties that if enacted would among other things allow every eu and us airline to fly between every city in the european union and every city in the united states and would permit us and eu airlines to determine the number of flights their routes and fares according to market demand despite this development there appears to remain several areas of international civil aviation law that the tentative agreement does not address among them are the issues of foreign ownership and control participation in the civil reserve air fleet program and cabotage presently us law requires that to operate as an air carrier in the united states an entity must be citizen of the united states to be considered citizen for civil aviation purposes an entity must be owned either by an individual us citizen partnership of persons who are each us citizens or corporation 1 whose president and at least twothirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are us citizens 2 that is under the actual control of us citizens and 3 has at least 75 percent of its stock owned or controlled by us citizens recently however the dot released notice of proposed rulemaking nprm that would change its interpreta tion of what constitutes actual control if adopted this new interpretation could have major implications for us and international civil aviation several issues relating to th is nprm are currently being debated including the consistency with the operative statutes and the viability of the civil reserve air fleet program craf should more extensive foreign ownership be permitted in addition mbers of congress have take n significant interest in this dot rulemaking both through direct participation in the rulemaking process and by introducing legislation hr 4542 and s 2135 that would prohibit the adoption of final rule for one year and require the dot to submit reports and analysis on the impact of the new interpretation on the domestic industry and national security concerns furthermore both the house and senate have adopted amendments to the proposed transportation treasury housing and urban development the judiciary the district of columbia and independe nt agencies appropriations act of 2007 hr 5576 that would effectively forest all the dot from adopting final rule us law also contains general re striction on cabotage defined as the transportation of passengers or cargo by foreign air carriers from

rights dates back to the 1919 convention for the regulation of aerial navigation paris convention which was part of the paris peace conference1 the hallmark aviation principle recognized by the paris convention is that every nation s absolute and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its defined territory2 this principle was reaffirmed in 1944 at the chicago international civil aviation conference which produced the chicago convention3 the chicago convention resulted in an internationa l framework based largely on national interests favoring bilateral air transport agreements over multilateral accords with respect to issues such as routes frequency and capacity4 the chicago conventions accomplishmen ts included an agreement by the signatories to grant each other two of the socalled five freedoms of air transport5 specifically the right to fly across other st ates without landing and the right to land for nontraffic purposes in addition th chicago convention established the international civil aviation organization icao to regulate the safety communications and technological asp ects of international civil aviation6 since the chicago convention international civil

entity must be us citizen and must be judged by the secretary to comply with the statute and any other applicable regulations in addition to the citizenship requirements us law also contains general prohibition against cabotage activity generally speaking the term cabotage is defined as the right of foreign airlin to carry passengers andor cargo between airports of the same country15 the

intended to continue the trend of liberalizing international civil aviation as defined by the dot open skies consists of the following 11 principles 1 open entry on all routes 2 unrestri cted capacity and frequency on all routes 3 the right to operate between any poi nt in the us and any point in the european community without restriction including service to intermediate and beyond points and the

ability of carriers to convert earnings into hard curre ncy and return those earnings to their homelands promptly and without restriction 8 open codesharing opportunities 9 the right of carrier to perform its own ground handling in the other country 10 the ability of carriers to freely enter into commercial transactions related to their flight operations and 11 commitment for nondiscriminatory

because open skies is an executive branch initiative policies that require legislative changes to us law such as foreign owne rship and control and cabotage23 are not included within its principles24 currently the united states is party to 74 open skies agreements worldwide25 in europe the first open skies ag reement was reached in october of 1992 with the netherlands and over the next several years similar agreements were reached with other european countries in cluding austria czech republic belgium denmark finland germany luxembour g norway sweden switzerland and iceland26 as result of these agreements the united states enjoys what can be characterized as quasicabotage rights within the european union eu in other words although us carriers still cannot ope rate truly domestic r outes eg paris to marseille they have created socalled hub and spoke ne tworks within europe for example hub in frankfurt germany with spokes to paris and marseille on the other hand it should be noted that us w currently prevents european carriers from enjoying any type of cabotage rights within the us domestic market27 the combination of the number of pen skies agreements between the united states and individual eu members and the growing dominance of us air carriers throughout europe led the eur opean commission to seek mandate to negotiate bilateral aviation agreement between the united states and the eu the commission however was unable to obtai n such broad mandate and in 2002 decided to bring legal action against thos member states that had independently negotiated and entered into open skies agreements with the united states while the european court of justice appeared to stop well short of invalidating the existing open skies agreements it did hold that certain specific provisions were discriminatory and therefore contrary to eu law these included provisions relating to the allocation of airport slots and those g overning pricing fares and rates of intra european air services agreements on computer reservation systems and the nationality clauses which permit the unite d states to deny access to carriers whose home state has not signed an agreement28

the acquisition of northwest airlines by wings holdings inc 1989 wl 256026 dot 1989according to some commentators who appear to have seen version of the text as comprehensive as the draft agreement appears to be there cannot be meaningful reform in the international aviation market until congress repeals the socalled citizenship test which limits foreign ownership and control of us air carriers35 based on the information currently available regarding the draft agreement it doesnot appear that the proposed agreement addr esses foreign ownershi p or control thus it appears to be left to each party to determine its own rules and regulations independently air carrier citizenship current law and legal precedent as previously mentioned us law requires that all air carriers be citizens of the united states before they are granted certificates to operate between domestic locations the federal aviation act specifically defines the phrase citizen of the united states as the following an individual who is citizen of the united states b partnership each of whose partners is an individual who is citizen of the united states or c corporation or association organized under the laws of the united states or state the district of columbia or rritory or possession of the united states of which the president and at least twoth irds of the board of directors and other managing officers are citizens of the united states which is under the actual control of citizens of the united states and in which at least 75 percent of the voting interest is owned or controlled by persons that are citizens of the united states36 this statutory language has existed in various forms since the civil aeronautics act of 193837 in 2003 congress amended the statut so as to codify the department of transportations dots longstanding precedent with respect to requiring actual control of an air carrier for citizenship purposes38 developed prima rily through its administrative decisions the dot and its predecessor the civil aeronautics board cab have long interpreted the air carrier citizenship definition to include requirement of actual control by us citizens even though the specific statutory language has only recently been added39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255crs7 40 specifically 113c of the civil aeronau tics act of 1938 stated that corporation or association created or organized under the ws of the united states or of any state territory or possession of the united states of which the president and twothirds or more of the board of directors an other managing fficers thereof are such individuals and which at least 75 per centum of the voting interest is owned or controlled by persons who are citizens of the united states or one of its possessions civil aeronautics act of 1938

and other managing officers of interamerican are us citizensone of the oldest and most frequently cited citizenship determinations occurred in 1940 when the cab was asked to review urbana medellin nd central airways application for certificate of public conve nience and necessity this review was conducte d pursuant to the civil aeronautics act of 1938 which contained citizenship requirement that was nearly identical in legislative language to the current statute40 after reviewing the corporate structure of the airlines who the various stock holders were and the citizenship of the corporate officers the cab turned its attention to the phrase two thirds or mo re of the board of directors and other managing officers contained in the statutory requirement for citizenship41 in its interpretation of this phras the cab concluded that the apparent general intent of the statut is to insure that air carriers receiving economic s upport from the united states and seeking certificates of public convenience and necessity under section 401 of the act shall be citizens of the united states in fact in purpose and in management the shadow of substantial foreign influence may not exist42 the cab further stated that it may be permissible to look behind the form to the substance of the management to determine whether in fact as well as in law it is under the control of citizens of the united states 43 this interpretation expanded the scope of the cabs inquiry beyond an entitys apparent compliance with the language of the statute and the agency announced its intention to conduct close examination of the internal structure and operation of an airline seeking certification of us citizenship to determine where actual control is vested the cabs holding and reading of the citizenship definition established framework for future board decisions with respect to the concept of cont rol by foreign citizen in 1971 the cab was asked to determine whethe r interamerican airfreight qua lified as citizen of the united states pursuant to the federal avia tion act although interamerican met the formal requirement s of the statute44 at issue in the proceeding was whether wille peter daetwyler swiss citizen exercised sufficient control over the operations ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255crs8 45 id while the cabs decision does not fully explain mr daetwylers relationship with respect to interamerican the decision does c onclude that the daetwyler control is reflected by the fact that the corporation i nteramerican is the direct successor of the daetwyler

block amendments to the certificates of incorpor ation that would allow for changes in stock continuedthe airline such that it would not qualify for us citizenship45 the cab expanded on the statutory interpretation in uraba medellin and central airways and despite close examination of the transaction rema ined concerned that future corporations would attempt to mask foreign control by arranging corporate structures simply to meet the statutory requirements46 in response the cab st ated that in cases where an applicant has arranged its affairs so as to meet the bare minimum requirements set forth in the act it is the boards view that the transaction must be closely scrutinized and that the applicant bear s the burden of establishing that the substance of the transaction is such as to be in accordance with the policy as well as the literal terms of the specific statutory requirements47 in this case the cab determined that mr daetwyler was in position to exert significant amount of control over the operations of interamerican48 the cab found significant the fact that the company was created wholly at mr daetwylers insistence and that mr daetwyler reta ined 25 percent stock ownership and represents onethird of the board of di rectors the maximum amount of control allowed under the statute49 in addition the cab conc luded that foreign control existed because interamerican was to c ontinue to do business under the daetwyler system of companies and there was evidence of close personal relationships between mr daetwyler and the inte ramerican stock holders50 in 1989 the dot was asked to review the merger between northwest airlines and wings holdings inc51 although both companies were us controlled and operated citizenship issue existed because the mergers largest equity holder with approximately 400 million or 5674 percent was klm inc dutch company and foreign air carrier52 in addition klms interest provided it with substantial power with respect to numerous

traditionally been complex matter in past cases54 the dot declined to enumerate specific factors to determine the existence of control saying instead that the analysis with respect to control has always necessarily been on casebycase basis as there are myriad potential avenues to control55 the dot pointed to three specific factors that led it to conclude that this merger resulted in company that was not us citizen first was the equity interest in the new company held by klm although ma jority of klms in terest was held in nonvoting stock the dot concluded that it represented genuine ownership interest and therefore significantly increased klms incentive to participate in northwests business decisions56 second the corporate structure of the new company according to dot would have allowed klm to exert influence even without voting rights57 finally the dot pointed to the fact that klm was an actual competitor with northwest in various markets and had stated an intention to become involved in the decisions of the new corporation58 taken together these factors resulted in finding that as presented at the time wings holdings inc was not us citizen as defined by the federal aviation act59 upon review of this decision the dot commented on an additional foreign control factor with respect to equitydebt relationships the dot held that absent default unless the loan agreement provides special rights to the debt holder that imply control we do not anticipate treating debt as foreign control issue60 in sum these precedents establish dot s methodology of looking behind the corporate structure or transaction for the purpose of determining whether actual control is held by us citizens with respect to factors that can be utilized in determining actual control

recently the issue of foreign owne rship and control was considered in case involving dhl airways also known as astar air cargo at issue in this case was whether the level of control exerted by dhl worldwide express foreign company owned in part by deutsche post germanys national postal service was sufficient to consider astar not us citizen the specific mechanism through which it was alleged that dhl worldwide exercised control was an agreement between astar and dhl worldwide express known as an aircraft crews maintenance and insurance agreemen t acmi broadly defined the acmi agreement was wet lease in which astar agreed to provide dhl worldwide express with aircraft crews maintenance and insurance for the purpose of allowing dhl worldwide to legally transport air cargo within the united states62 according to the challengers of astars citizenship status the acmi agreement provided for more than 90 of astars revenues contained payment provisions that were integral to both astars financing and wo rking capital and shifted all of astars risks to dhl worldwide63 in addition the acmi agreement allegedly gave deutsche postdhl worldwide the power to veto changes in corporate control limit thirdparty business and aud it astars financial records64 the astar case was decided by an administrative law judge alj who concluded that from the record taken as whole astar is c itizen of the united states65 specifically with respect to the fact that the acmi agreement produced approximately 90 of astars revenues th alj provided twostep analysis for determining if in fact such control exists according to the alj it must first be established that the predominant customer is in position to control the carrier by threatening to withdraw their business and then that the carrier would believe the threat to be creditable66 in astar the alj concluded that because the threats were only available in very limited circumstances and most were controlled by astar the second prong of the test credibility of the threats could not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255crs11 67 id at 24 68 id at 25 69 id 70 id stating that the guaranteed payment ncourages the carrier to pursue opportunities and take chances it might not otherwise take including exposing itself to downside risk by way of enlarging the business 71 id at 28 stating that astar would be in better position if dhl worldwide elected to take its business elsewhere astar could th charter the formerly dedicated aircraft to other air freight forwarders and still collect on the dhl worldwides guarantee 72 id at 30 holding that the structure of astar is cons istent with an independent enterprise it controls all employment d ecisions the carrier hires and fires its own employees executive managerial and otherwise and sets their responsibilities and compensation 73 see 70 fed reg 67389 nov 7 2005satisfied therefore control by dhl wo rldwide on the grounds that they are predominate customer can not be established67 regarding whether astar is captiv supplier because of the acmis restrictions on pursuing thirdparty business the alj held that while the success of astars expansion of thirdparty business is not relevant to its citizenship astars ability to pursue such business independent of its agreement with dhl worldwide is crucial68 the alj concluded that the agreement provided astar with significant incentives to expand it business69 for example the alj cited the guaranteed payment of 15 million from dhl worldwide to astar70 which arguably put astar in better position th an if it were to do business elsewhere71 finally with regard to dhl worl dwides alleged veto power over administrative and operational functions as well as the ability to perform audits with respect to reimbursable costs the alj concluded that while there were administrative provisions in the acmi astar retained control over all the carriers essential decisions as well as the daytoday operations72 the department of transportations proposed actual control rule on november 7 2005 the dot publishe d notice of proposed rulemaking nprm seeking comments on proposal to clarify the policy with respect to when actual control rests with citizen of the united states73 the dot has proposed that the actual control requirement be interpreted in two ways the first interpretation involves cases where the fo reign investors home country provides us citizens reciprocal investment access and us air carriers full and fair market access as evidenced by having entered into an open skies agreement with the united states or where it is necessary for compliance with us international obligations in these situations air carriers seeking to be considered us citizens will have to demonstrate that us citizen s exercise actual control only with respect to 1 organizational documentation including such things as incorporation chartershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255crs12 74 see id at 67396 75 see id at 67395 76

carriers and there are other relevant international obligations in these cases the traditional casebycase actual control anal ysis as determined by dot precedent would control the citizenship inquiry75 in asserting justification for its new interpretation of the actual control requirements the dot relie s primarily on nonlegal or policy grounds for example the dot asserts that the present interpretation of the actual control requirement has failed to keep pace with changes in the global economy and evol ving financial and operational realities in the air line industry itself to the determent of us carriers76 as result of these changing global economic demands us air carriers seeking to enter the market should similarly be able to obtain the financial capital necessary to launch their businesses we tentatively do not believe that actual control should be interpreted in way that needlessly restri cts the commercial opportunities of us air carriers and their ability to compete legally it appears that the dot recognizes that congress has established objective statut ory requirements that an air carrier must satisfy to be considered us citizen however they assert that nothing in this nprm would alter or in any way circ umvent those stat utory requirements77 given dots assertion that this new interpretation of the actual control requirement is legitimate ex ercise of its legal authority it would appear that should challenge be brought against this proposal becoming final rule reviewing court would likely address the issue pursuant to the standards delineated by the supreme court in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council chevron 78 in chevron the supreme court established twopart test for judicial review of agency statutory interpretations first reviewing court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue79 if court finds that there has been an express congressional statement th inquiry is concluded as the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress80 in the event that congress has not unequivocally addressed the issue reviewing court must respect an agencys interpretation so long as it is permissible81 the court further stated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255crs13 82 chevron 467 us at 84344 83 chevron 467 us at 865 in cablevision sys dev v motion

mentioned that the supreme court revisited chevron in fda v brown williamson tobacco corp 529 us 120 2000 declaring that th food drug administration lacks jurisdictional authority to regulate tobacco pr oducts in reaching this determination the court discussed the first prong of chevron declaring that the proper analysis is to focus not only on the statutory clause but rather to consid er the structure func tion and history of all relevant provisions interpreting statute as symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme id at 1294 upon concluding that congress squarely rejected proposals to give the fda jurisdiction over tobacco the court stat ed that it was obliged to defer not to the agencys expansive construction of the statute but to congress consistent judgment to deny the fda this power id at 1315 this reasoning center s on an analysis of the unique regulatory scheme created for tobacco products under the first prong of the chevron test and as such does not appear to impact the traditional inquiry as it applies to the issue at hand the supreme court further clarified the limits of the chevron standard in united states v mead corp 533 us 218 229 2 001 ruling that deference applies only in instances when congress has delegated authority to an agency to make rules carrying the force of law and when the agency interp retation claiming deference was promulgated pursuant to that authorityif congress has explicitly left gap for the agency to fill there is an express delegation of authority to that agency to elucidate specific provision of the statute by regulationsometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on particular question is implicit rather than explicit in such case court may not substitute its own construction of statutory provision for reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency82 the court went on to note that judges are not experts in the technical field and are not part of either political branch of the government while agencies as part of the executive branch appropriately make policy choices resolving the competing interests which congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve or intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities83 thus the rationale for this deference is predicated on the notion that it is not the role of the judiciary to assess the wisdom of policy choices and resolve the struggle between competing views of the public interest as well as an agencys greater expertise regarding the subject matter of the regulations84 the dot received numerous comments to its nprm representing almost every segment of the aviation industry many of the comments have focused specifically on the dots legal authority to reinterpret the actual control requirement supporters of the dots action generally assert that the phrase actual control though it appears in the statute is vague and undefined as result the language is arguably ambiguous and therefore subject to departmental in terpretati on thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33255crs14 85 see comments of united airlin docket ost200315759 79

latitude and is entitled to substantial deference when rendering an interpretati on provided that it does so reasonably and in manner that is consistent with the plain meaning of the statute85 conversely opponents of the nprm asse rt that when congress specifically added the phrase actual control to the statute they were in effect codifying the dots longstanding precedent and not gr anting any additional authority over the interpretation of the phrase than previously existed86 in addition opponents of the nprm assert that the dots interpretation is contrary to the express language of the statute specifically they argue that unlike the four narrow areas of control defined by the dot actual control of an air carrier rests with the entity that makes the fundamental economic decisions that termine the nature of the airlines operations87 these decisions include but are not limited to the types of airplane flown markets to be served flight schedules fares nd aircraft maintenance and other services88 thus according to opponents of the nprm relinquishing control over these elements of an air carrier renders any other st atutory requirements pointless89 finally opponents of the proposed nprm cite the militarys continued reliance on the civil reserve air fleet program cra f under this program domestic air carriers supply aircraft on voluntary basis to increase the militarys airlift capacity craf allows the us military in times of need to demand access to selected percentage of the civil ai rcraft fleet to deliver troops and equipment to the battlefield90 concern with

least one commentator has questioned how the dot will ensure that us citizens are not pressured by their foreign partners to either modify or eliminate their participation in this voluntary program92 i n addition both continental airlines and delta airlines noted that new foreign owners might as result of their control over othe r commercial aspects of an airline divest the use upkeep and

especially with respect to the agencys legal authority to adopt such an interpretation of the underlying statute the dot in making its arguments appears to rely on wellestablished principl of administrative law especially with respect to its ability to effectively interpret and administer the statute98 dot argues that they have often interpreted the citizenship statute and in fact developed the actual control test prior to its inclusion in the statute by congress99 in addition dot asserts that congress in adopting the actual control language into the statute recognized the need for continued agency interpretation and did not direct us to follow the past interpretations100 dots position appears to be that the amendment to the federal aviation act which inserted the phrase actual control did not in any way amend or alter the agencys discretionary authority to modify its interpretation as appropriate101 in support of its position the dot ex tensively cites the amendments legislative sponsor and floor manager who at the time the vision 100 legislation102 was being considered stated that the amendment leaves the interpretation of effective control up to dot but the department can draw upon its decades of precedents to reach these conclusions103 further dot cites to the floor managers assertion that the amendment was simply reflection of existing law and that the inclusion of the actual control language will not in any way affect the departments determination of what constitutes citizen of the united states104 in addition to addressing the numerous other legal and po licy arguments made by opposition comments the snpr specifically addressed the concerns raised with respect to craf commitments first dot clarifies and expands its proposal to require that not only craf commitments be actually controlled by us citizens but also that overall airline participation in national defense airlift operations be in the actual control of only us citizens105 according

carrier could not allow foreign investors to make decisions that would make participation in craf or other national defens airlift operations impossible as practical matter106 moreover if there wa s suspicion that national defense airlift operations were precluded or impaired by decisions of the foreign investors the spnr indicates that dot would investigate to determine if the requirements for the actual control test was being satisfied by the carrier107 the dot responds to the concerns about th proposals potential negative impact on craf commitments by noting that participation in the craf is voluntary commercial arraignment in wh ich the airlines commit aircraft in return for access to us government contracts according to the dot because nothing in the nprm changes or alters that dynamic dod can adjust the economic incentives of the program in order to better ensure suffi cient military airlift capacity and thus maintaining adequate participation levels108 finally in direct response to some of the commentators concerns about fleet divestment dot argues that because domestic carriers make their fleet decisions based on what is best to ensure successful commercial operation foreign owners would be motivated by the same commercial incentives and therefore in dots opinion there should be significant changes to craf commitment levels109 the dot and dod have entered into memorandum of understanding mou that appears to be intended to provi procedural framework for dods participation in dots consideration of air carrier citizenship issues as they relate to craf commitments110 this mou will become effective on the date that the final actual control rule goes into effect111 the mou applies in situations that involve 1 citizenship issues in which the

proposed rule on various aspects of domestic and international aviation law121 in addition both the house and senate attempted to address this issue by adopting language in their respective versions of the 2006 emergency supplemental appropriations bill122 while the house of representatives version did not contain any legislative language with respect to the dot rulemaking the committee report

international civil aviation law is cabotage as previously mentioned cabotage is the right of foreign airline to carry passengers andor cargo between airports of the sa country eg from new york to angeles129 currently the federal aviation act contains general prohibition against cabotage activity by foreign air carriers the prohibition states that aircraft may take on for compensation at place in the united states passengers or cargo destined for another place in the united states only if 1 specifically authorized under section 40109g of this title or 2 under regulations the secretary prescribes authorizing air carriers to provide otherwise authorized air transportation with foreign registered aircraft under lease or charter to them without crew130 if neither of those situations exists foreign aircraft are not permitted to perform cabotage within the united states in addition the secretary of transportation has general discretionary authority to waive other economicrelated statutory provisions listed in section 40109c when the secretary deci des that the exemption is consistent with the public interest131 the cabotage prohibition however is not among the regulations listed in section 40109c132 congress last amended the cabotage laws as part of the vision 100 century of aviation authorization act133 the enacted changes permit eligible cargo to be removed from aircraft including foreign aircraft in alas ka and not be deemed to have broken its intern ational journey in be taken on in or be destined for alaska134 the statute defines eligible cargo as cargo

cabotage activities while it does not appear that the current draft open skies agreement with the european union requires the granting of mo re cabotage rights to foreignowned or controlled carriers it appears to remain major issue in international civil aviation it appears however that statutory chan ges would be required before the executive branch can enter into any sort of agreement purporting to liberalize the cabotage rules although foreign aircra ft are allowed to navigate within us airspace unless specifically authorized either by statute or dot regulations they are not permitted to perform any form of cabotage within the united states136 while it is unclear what if any economic effect more liberal cabotage policy would have on the domestic airline industry only congress has the legal authority to amend the federal aviation act and permit foreign carriers to have cabotage rights
