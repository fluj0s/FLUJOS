september 1014 2003 at this meeting trade negotiators were unable to reach agreement on the course of future multilatera l trade negotiations negotiations at cancún were particularly stymied over agriculture and the singapore issues of investment government procurem ent competition policy and trade facilitation the breakdown of the ministerial has led to some recriminations over blame for the negotiating deadlock but it also provoked trade fficials to reflect on how to get the talks moving again and it has cast doubt over the ab ility of negotiators to meet the january 1 2005 deadline to complete the current round of negotiations for some the outcome has called into question the future of multilateral trade negotiations and of the wto itself background the new round of trade negotiations the doha development agenda dda was launched at the 4th wto ministerial at doha qatar in november 2001 it is known as the doha development agenda because of its emphasis on integrating

proceeded at slow pace several deadlines for agreement on negotiating modalities i methodologies by which ne gotiations are conducted were missed in the agriculture and industrial market access talks without agreement negotiators looked toward the cancún ministerial to resolve the modalities in the weeks before cancún negotia ting documents to achieve this re solution were criticized by all sides and expectations of the ministerial were reduced to achieving an agreement on the framework for the modalities to be used in future negotiations access to medicines negotiators did resolve the access

developing countries to issue compul sory license to thirdcountry producer to manufacture generic drugs to combat hiv aids malaria tube rculosis and other epidemics while the agreement contained several restrictions to protect the patent rights of pharmaceutical manufacturers the agreement was designed in part to reaffirm the importance of developing country i ssues to the wto in time for cancún1 at the cancún ministerial negotiators b ecame embroiled in disputes over agriculture and the singapore issues the negotiations were characterized by the emergence of the g 20 an informal group of developing countries2 which demanded subs tantial concessions from developed countries in the agriculture ne gotiations some developing countries also refused to countenance the beginning of nego tiations over the singapore issues which had been championed by the european union eu in the end the singapore issues broke up the talks before agriculture issu were even formally discussed reaction subsequent to the collapse of the talks us and eu negotiators criticized both the substance and tactics of the g20 group us negotiator claimed that developing country rhetoric was more suited to the united nations while others claimed that the g20 lacked negotiating strategy other than making demands on developed countries however one g20 trade minister has suggested that the position of the g20

their g20 activities4 the european union has undertaken revi ew of its policy towards the wto and multilateral trade negotiations one issue that may be discussed in this review is the future emphasis that the eu places on the singapore issues while eu negotiators agreed to drop demands that negotiations proceed on all but the trade fac ilitation issue at cancún the lack of agreement on that agenda may result in renewed eu insistence on the full singapore agenda the eu may also decide to play the regional card by placing renewed emphasis on ongoing negotiations with mercosur or with former colonies in the african caribbean and pacific group eu officials have also made public statements on the need to reform various aspects of th wtos decisionmaking process5 some participants from g20 countries returned from cancún claiming the outcome was victory for developing c ountries to them the lack of agreement was evidence that they had successfully defended their national interests in demanding changes in the agricultural policies of devel oped countries however ma ny of these countries have subsequently expressed an interest in returning to wto negotiations some g20 members possibly under pressure from the ited states have announced that they will longer attend g20 meetings these defec tions have called into question the future of this group as negotiating entity as well as underlying differences between the trade policies of some of its members most notably brazil and india the derbez draft during the course of th cancún ministerial draft declaration6 was written by the ministerial chairman luis ernesto derbez the mexican foreign minister crafted as framework for future negotiations to which all parties could agree it was criticized by most parties and wa s not adopted at the ministerial the derbez text principally modified the agricultural language of draft negotiating text circulated and widely criticized prior to the negotiations it did call for the start of negotiations on two of the singapore issues trade facilitation and government procurement while relegating the issues of investment and competition policy to further clarification in the aftermath

magic dust has been shaken over text so roundly rejected in september to find it so roundly ndorsed in november7 only india has rejected the text outright as basis for negotiation8 while the derbez draft provides the advantag of readymade template to restart the negotiations this approach also has potential shortcomings as compromise text that essentially revised previous compromise text the language is highly general and in many respects represents lowest common denominator of agreement many of the previous disagreements could reemerge if negotiations commence ba sed on this text the derbez text also reflects the joint negotiating positions worked out between the united states and the eu in agriculture and indus trial market access postcancún some us commentators have suggested that these positions do not serve us interests and that the united states would be better served by re verting to its previous more ambitious negotiating proposals sectoral perspectives agriculture9 agriculture negotiations are part of the ongoing negotiations built in agenda of talks that were incorporat ed into the launch of the doha round the negotiations involve the three pillars of agriculture support market access tariffs export subsidies and producti on subsidies the emphasis of the us negotiating position has been market access the initial us agri culture proposal included significant tariff reduction based on nonlinear formula that w ould cap individual tariff lines at 25 the proposal also called for complete elimina tion of export subsidie s and harmonization of tradedistorting domestic support to 5 of countrys total agricultural product the initial european union proposal adopt ed linear formula approach to tariff reductions and subsidies used in the urug uay round the linear approach would reduce tariffs and subsidies by fixed percentage cut thus leaving the relative subsidy and tariff rates unchanged between tradin g partners the eu also s ought to trade concessions on export subsidies which it heavily utilizes for concessions on export credit and food aid programs which are utilized by the united states in june 2003 the eu announced series of reforms to its common agricu ltural policy cap including the partial decoupling of most production from subsidie s by 2007 however the eu did not revise its agriculture offer based on these reformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21664crs5 10 claude barfield and james k glassman the real cancún the weekly standard october 6 2003 in august 2003 the united states and the eu adopted joint negotiating framework to spur negotiations in the leadup to the cancún ministerial the compromise text blended various aspects of the us and eu proposals it provides for combination of harmonized and linear tariff reduction formulas tradedistorting domestic support would be reduced by percentage formula nd productionlimited suppor t would be allowed up to 5 of the value of the countrys to tal agricultural production export subsidies would be phased out for products of inte rest to developing countries and wto disciplines would be developed for state trad ing enterprises export credits and food aid programs special and differe ntial treatment sd was recognized for developing countries but not necessarily for developi ng countries that are net food exporters some observers have criticized the united states for moving away from its initial trade liberalizing stance to compromise with the eu claiming that the initial us position had been more compatible with certa in developing country proposals10 however others contend that coherent useu position would help facilitate negotiations in response to the us eu proposal th g20 group advocated proposal to cut us and eu domestic subsidies more drasti cally than the useu proposal to eliminate export subsidies and to provi sd treatment for all deve loping countries in terms of tariff reduction and other market access in addition group of four african nations benin burkina faso chad and mali proposed the elimination of tradedistorting domestic support and export subsidies for cott on coupled with transitional compensation mechanism for cotton exporters affected by th subsidies in response the united states proposed wto sectoral initiative to exa mine trade distortions for cotton manmade fibers and textile and apparel with multila teral assistance to help these countries diversify their economies away from cotton african count ries refused to nego tiate on this basis the derbez draft tried to reconcile thes different positions by advocating deeper cuts in tradedistorting domestic subsidies bringing under review nontradedistorting subsidies and by negotiating date for the elimination of export subsidies positions that reflect previous developing country negotia ting positions it followed the useu tariff formula which blended harmonized and linear tariffs but allowed developing countries to identify items for minimal tariff cuts it so largely adopted the us position paper on the cotton issue singapore issues the singapore issues refer to four issues investment competition policy trade facilita tion and government procuremen t that were offered for the negotiating agenda of the wto by the european union at the 1st ministerial held in singapore in 1996 the 2001 doha ministeria l declaration called for decision on negotiating the issues by explicit consensus at the 5th ministerial the 5th ministerial at cancún did not provide explicit consensus to negotiate these items according to reports it was an impasse over these issues that finally caused the talks to collapse the european union along with japan s outh korea and taiwan have been the principal proponents of the

ngapore issues for two reasons first they foresee the implementation of multilateral rules on these issues as an infringement of their sovereignty second many veloping countries claim not to have the institutional capacity or resources to undertake the nego tiation of additional issues whatever the merits the derbez text proposed the in clusion of trade fac ilitation and government procurement in

strategy in the industria l market access talks in december 2002 the united states proposed the comp lete elimination of tariffs by 2015 this proposal would have eliminated nuisance tari ffs tariffs below 5 and cer tain industrial sector tariffs by 2010 and would have remove d remaining tariffs in 5 equal increments by 2015 the initial eu tariff reduction propos relied on compression formula one in which all tariffs are compressed in four bands with the highest band being 15 like the us position this proposal applied to all countries and did not contain sd language the united states generally
