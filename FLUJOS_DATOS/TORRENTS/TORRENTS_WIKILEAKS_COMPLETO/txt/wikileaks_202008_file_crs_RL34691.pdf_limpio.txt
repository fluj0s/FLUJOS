disabilities act ada1 is broad civil rights act prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities as stated in the act its purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities2 the threshold issue in any ada case is whether the individual alleging discrimination is an individual with disability several supreme court decisions have interpreted the definition of disability generally limiting its application3 since these supreme court interpretations lower court decisions also interpreted the definition of disability strictly congress responded to these decisions by enacting the ada amendments act pl 110325 which rejects the supreme court and lower court interpretations and amends the ada to provide broader coverage two of the major changes made by the ada amendments act are to expand the current interpretation of when an impairment substantially limits major life activity rejecting the supreme courts interpretation in toyota and to require that the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity must be made without regard to the use of mitigating measures rejecting the supreme courts decisions in sutton murphy and kirkingburg g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the original ada definition of disability was based on the definition of disability used for section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 19734 the term disability with respect to an individual was defined as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment 5 the ada amendments act essentially keeps the same language but rejects the interpretation given to the language by the supreme court three supreme court decisions in 1999 addressed the definition of disability and specifically discussed the concept of mitigating measures sutton v united air lines involved sisters who were rejected from employment as pilots with united air lines because they wore eyeglasses the supreme court in sutton examined the definition of disability used in the original ada and found that the determination of whether an individual has disability should be made with reference to measures that mitigate the individuals impairment the sutton court stated disability exists only where an impairment substantially limits major life activity not where it might could or would be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken the court also emphasized that the statement of findings in the ada that some 43000000 americans 1 42 usc 12101 et seq for more detailed discussion of the ada seecrs report 98921 the americans

conclusion that congress did not intend to bring under the statutes protection all those whose uncorrected conditions amount to disabilities similarly in murphy v united parcel service inc the court held that the fact that an individual with high blood pressure was unable to meet the department of transportation dot safety standards was not sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding whether an individual is regarded as unable to utilize class of jobs the court in murphy found that an employee is regarded as having disability if the covered entity mistakenly believes that the employees actual nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities and in the last of this trilogy of 1999 cases the court in kirkingburg v albertsons held that trucker with monocular vision who was able to compensate for this impairment was not person with disability in the 2002 case of toyota motor manufacturing v williams the meaning of substantially limits was examined and justice oconnor writing for the unanimous court determined that the word substantial clearly precluded impairments that interfere in only minor way with the performance of manual tasks the court also found that the term major life activity refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life finding that these terms are to be interpreted strictly the court held that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most peoples daily lives since these supreme court decisions lower cour ts applied these holdings in various factual situations for example in orr v walmart stores inc 6 the eighth circuit found that pharmacist with diabetes who takes insulin and eats special diet was not an individual with disability because with the medication and diet the diabetes did not substantially affect major life activity similarly in mcclure v general motors corp 7 the fifth circuit found that an electrician with muscular dystrophy who could lift his arms only to shoulder level did not have disability the eleventh circuit examined what are major life activities in littleton v walmart8 the plaintiff 29yearold man who was diagnosed with mental retardation as child was not hired for position as cartpush associate with walmart the court found that it was unclear whether thinking communicating and social interaction are major life activities under the ada and noted that even if thinking communicating and social interaction were found to be major life activities the plaintiff did not show that he was substantially limited in these activities 9 6 297 f3d 720 8th cir 2002 cert

now renamed the ada amendments act of 2008 hr 3195 as reported out of committee was significantly different from hr 3195 and s 1881 as introduced14 those bills would have eliminated the phrase substantially limits from the definition thereby broadening the definition of disability to cover the majority of the population the house passed hr 3195 on june 25 2008 by vote of 402 to 17 the housepassed bill would have kept the term substantially limits and defined it as materially restricts the senate health education labor and pensions committee held hearing on july 15 2008 where testimony was heard on several issues including the impact of the ada amendments act on education15 on july 31 2008 senator harkin with 55 original cosponsors introduced s 3406 the ada amendments act

respect to an individual as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph 3 17 although this is essentially the same statutory language as was in the original ada pl 110325 contains new rules of construction regarding the definition of disability which provide that the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act the term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the ada amendments act an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities to be considered disability an impairment that is episodic or in remission is disability if it would have substantially limited major life activity when active and the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures except that the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered 18 the findings of the ada amendments act include statements indicating that the supreme court decisions in sutton and toyota as well as lower court cases have narrowed and limited the ada from what was intended by congress pl 110325 specifically states that the current equal employment opportunity commissi on eeoc regulations defining the term substantially limits as significantly restricted are inconsistent with congressional intent by expressing too high standard the codified findings in the original ada are also amended to delete the finding that 43000000 americans have one or mo re physical or mental disabilities this finding was used in sutton to support limiting the reach of the definition of disability the ada amendments act states that the purposes of the legislation are to carry out the adas objectives of the elimination of discrimination nd the provision of clear strong consistent enforceable standards addressing discrimination by reinstating broad scope of protection available under the ada pl 110325 rejected the supreme courts holdings that mitigating measures are to be used in making determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity as well as holdings defining the substantially limits requirements the substantially limits requirements of toyota as well as the eeoc regulations defining substantially limits as significantly restricted are specifically rejected in the new law 17 pl 110325 4a amending 42 usc 121023 18 low vision devices are not included in the

interpreted the term substantially limits in the manner congress had intended and discussed the methods congress had considered in order to express its intent the house of representatives had defined the term substantially limits as materially restricts in order to convey that congress intended to depart from the strict and demanding standard applied by the supreme court in sutton and toyota 19 however the senate rejected the use of the term materially restricts concluding that adopting new undefined term that is subject to widely disparate meanings is not the best way to achieve the goal of ensuring consistent nd appropriately broad coverage under this act20 in passing the senate bill house debate indicated that although the term materially restricts was not ultimately adopted the intent was the same as that of the senate language thus house debate stated that the descriptions of the changes intended by the term materially restricts in the house committee reports should be read as what is intended by the language of pl 110325 21 the ada amendments act specifically lists examples of major life activities including caring for oneself performing manual tasks seeing hearing eating sleeping walking standing lifting bending speaking breathing learning reading concentrating thinking communicating and working the act also states that major life activity includes the operation of major bodily function the house judiciary committee report indicates that this clarification was needed to ensure that the impact of an impairment on the operation of major bodily functions is not overlooked or wrongly dismissed as falling outside the definition of major life activities under the ada 22 there had been judicial decisions which found that certain bodily functions had not been covered by the definition of disability for example in furnish v svi sys inc23 the seventh circuit held that an individual with cirrhosis of the liver due to infection with hepatitis b was not an individual with disability because liver function was not integral to ones daily existence the house debate contains colloquy between representatives pete stark and george miller on the subject of the meaning of substantially limits in the context of learning reading writing thinking or speaking the colloquy finds that an individual who has performed well academically may still be considered an individual with disability representative stark stated the following specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia are neurologically based impairments that substantially limit the way these individuals perform major life activities like reading or learning or the time it takes to perform such activities often referred to as the condition manner or duration this legislation will reestablish coverage for these individuals by ensuring that the definition of this ability is broadly construed and the determination does not consider the use of mitigating measures 24

the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this act because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit major life activity however impairments that are transitory and minor are specifically excluded from the regarded prong transitory impairment is one with an actual or expected duration of six months or less the ada amendments act also provides in rule of construction in title v of the ada that covered entity under title i25 public entity under title ii or person who operates place of public accommodation under title iii need not provide reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification to policies practices or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disabili ty solely under the regarded as prong of the definition26 the senate statement of managers notes that there were some reservations about this change but that it was included given our strong expectation that individuals who had been given reasonable accommodations under the regarded as prong by courts would now be covered under the first prong of the definition properly applied27 the house debate echoed the senate interpretation and expanded on congressional intent stating the following we and the senate expressed our confidence that individuals who need accommodations will receive them because with reduction in the burden of showing substantial limitation those individuals also qualify for coverage under prongs 1 or 2 where accommodation still is required of course our clarification here does not shield qualification standards tests or other selection criteria from challenge by an individual who is disqualified based on such standard test or

the nondiscrimination protection provision in title vii of the civil rights act of 196429 the act strikes the prohibition of discrimination against qua lified individual with disability because of the disability of such individual and substitutes the prohibition of discrimination against qualified individual on the basis of disability the senate managers statement noted that this change ensures that the emphasis in questions of disability discrimination is properly on the critical inquiry of whether qualified person has been discriminated against on the basis of 25 title i of the ada covers

to title v of the ada the act states that the ada does not alter eligibility standards for benefits under state workers compensation laws or under state or federal disability benefit programs pl 110325 also states that nothing in the act alters the provision of section 302b2aii 31 specifying that reasonable modifications in policies practices or procedures shall be required unless an entity can demonstrate that making such modifications in policies practices or procedures including academic requirements in postsecondary education would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations involved the senate statement of managers notes that this provision was added at the request of the higher education community and is included solely to provide assurances that the bill does t alter current law with regard to the obligations of academic institutions under the ada which we believe is already demonstrated in case law on this topic 32 the managers statement also noted that this provision is unrelated to the purpose of this legislation and should be given meaning in interpreting the definition of disability33 the ada amendments act specifically prohibits reverse discrimination claims and states that nothing in the act shall provide the basis for claim by person without disability that he or she was subject to discrimination because of lack of disability the senate statement of managers observes that the intent of this provision is to clarify that person without disability does not have the right under the act to bring an action against an entity on the grounds that he or she was discriminated against on the basis of disability 34 as was discussed previously the rules of construction provide that covered entity under title i public entity under title ii or person who operates place of public accommodation under title iii need not provide reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification to policies practices or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the regarded as prong of the definition

of transportation under this act includes the authority to issue regulations implementing the definitions contained in sections 3 and 4

senate statement of managers noted the importance of maintaining uniform definitions in the two statutes so covered entities will generally operate under one consistent standard and the civil rights of individuals with disabilities will be protected in all settings 35 the senate statement of managers also stated the following we expect that the secretary of education will promulgate new regulations related to the definition of disability to be consistent with those issued by the attorney general under this act we believe that other current regulations issued by the department of education office of civil rights under section 504 of the rehabilitation act are currently harmonious with congressional intent under both the ada and the rehabilitation act 36
