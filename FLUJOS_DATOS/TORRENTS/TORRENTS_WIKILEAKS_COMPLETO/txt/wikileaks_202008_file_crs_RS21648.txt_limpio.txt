the term refugees from burma will include the different ethnic groups 3 christian solidarity worldwide factfinding visit to the thaiburmese border november 2002 crs3 depopulation of the border areas those further inland have been said to be located too far from the border to attempt the journey4 camps were first established in thailand in 1984 thailand has been cooperative in helping refugees but does not want to become an indefinite host nor does it want to absorb those burmese who do not qualify as refugees moreover the camps were intended for temporary use and are not considered suitable for permanent habitation however the scale of the problem for thailand goes beyond the refugee camps along the thaiburmese border or the resettlement camps just inside burma thousands of refugees are living elsewhere in thailand the country was previously the recipient of large numbers of refugees from indochina currently the thai government views burma as presenting the most immediate source of refugee problems in 1999 the thai government began implementing new procedures at the border for registration and determination of status while thai willingness to work on the refugee issue was widely applauded implementation proved problematic partly because authorities insisted on group screening rather than working with refugees on casebycase basis the unhcr and refugee representatives have been actively involved in addressing border issues and the problems of repatriation5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21648 the thai government is not signatory to the 1951 convention on refugees or the 1967 protocol6 the term refugee and the protections mandate recognized under international law are not formally recognized in thailand asylum seekers are technically viewed as illegal immigrants although the legal issues are circumvented through the use of informal references ie temporary shelters instead of refugee camps or displaced persons fleeing fighting rather than refugees until an agreement can be reached with burma and it is safe for the refugees to return thailand has basically accepted the influx of asylum seekers on humanitarian grounds7 in october 2002 unhcr discussed the possibility of presence inside burma if repatriation agreements were reached but efforts have gone without success human rights watch identifies two refugee groups border refugees and urban refugees border refugees are typically permitted to stay in camps for humanitarian reasons urban refugees are thought to be mostly political dissidents although this group includes some refugees who did not feel safe at the border if considered person of concern by unhcr then the refugee is supposed to return to and register at one of the refugee camps unhcr divides this urban group into two subcategories those refugees who would have protection in camps at the border and those refugees who flee 4 christian solidarity worldwide factfinding visit to the thaiburmese border november 2002 5

and search for hazel long crs4 because of secondary fear of persecution by the burmese army and other armed insurgent groups at the border itself for the past several years thailand has been tightening the restrictions on urban refugees and defining anyone living outside the camps as an illegal immigrant the refugees are afraid of arrest and forced repatriation in july 2003 unhcr and the thai government reached an agreement regarding the 1500 burmese residing in bangkok the thai government wanted to control the number of refugees in bangkok and their involvement in illegal political activities or crimes such as drug dealing it also thought that unhcr had too much decisionmaking authority to issue person of concern identity cards these issues of security and sovereignty were addressed in an agreement the highlights of which are listed below decisions about persons of concern would be more transparent system to send 1500 refugees from burma to camps would be implemented with the support of unhcr unhcr would encourage refugee compliance with thai laws and regulations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21648 any refugee refusing to move would have hisher status as person of concern revoked and an additional 300 persons would be resettled in third countries8 us assistance the united states has been providing assistance for refugees along the burmese border since the mid

refugee camps along the border where movement and opportunity are very limited usaid is also concerned about the humanitarian needs of those who live outside the confines of the refugee camps in thailand but recognizes the difficult first step of identifying this population which is vulnerable to thai government sanctions if discovered10 in fy2002 usaid spent 65 million on such programs estimates for fy03 were slightly higher 695 million while the request for fy04 is 65 million it should be noted also that some funds 15 million in fy2003 and 25 million requested in fy2004 are also available to help combat infectious disease for vulnerable populations along the thai border through other usaid regional programs recent us legislation and issues for congress in addition to the consolidated appropriations resolution of 2003 pl1087 which limits us foreign assistance to the types of projects and recipients outlined above congress passed the burma freedom and democracy act pl 10861 hr 2330 july 28 2003 the measure places sanctions on the ruling burmese military junta by banning httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21648 the import of goods and freezing government assets in the united states it continues the ban on visas to burmese leaders and restricts loans and technical assistance the united states hopes to strengthen burmas democratic forces and through this legislation again recognizes the nld as the legitimate government of burma the burmese government has apparently condemned the us legislation and appealed to president bush through petition signed by burmese textile workers11 congressional action on burma through the appropriations process continues mainly to support the current objectives consistent with funding levels in fy2003 in the regular fy2004 foreign operations appropriation hr 2800 the house recommends 6 million to support democratic activities along the burmesethailand border and assistance to displaced burmese12 the senate measure s 1426 as amended and passed as hr 2800 puts forward plans to increase democracy aid up to 15 million in addition the senate recommends that humanitarian assistance for displaced burmese be supplemented by 10 million from the mra it also highlights burmas refugee and other problems such as hivaids and drugs the senate also calls for the european union and regional actors to take decisive measures in support of democracy in burma and suggests the possibility of restrictions on foreign aid to those states providing 9 continued department of state fiscal year 2003 interview with pam lewis united

specifies that funds appropriated in the bill for thailand will only be available if the thai government 1 supports democracy in burma and places sanctions on the military junta in rangoon 2 does not impede delivery of humanitarian assistance to those individuals who flee burma and 3 does not forcibly repatriate burmese to burma any differences in the provisions put forward by the house and senate must be resolved by the conferees current challenges for us and international policymakers according to usaid the policy of the united states towards burma has three main aims first to make progress towards democracy second to improve human rights and third to reduce and eliminate the human costs of the conflict observers maintain that the effectiveness of us and international policies toward burma could be enhanced in three areas first to increase the impact of sanctions it is seen as important that burmas neighbors to participate in the sanctions regime the measures put forward in pl 10861 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21648 represent shift in bush administration policy from one of engagement with the spdc and active encouragement for dialogue between the suu kyi and burmese minorities to one of tougher sanctions and isolation of the country which it hopes will be supported by burmas neighbors european nations have also imposed sanctions japan has suspended aid to burma through the united nations and other avenues the international community regularly expresses its views condemning burmas human rights abuses use of forced labor and poor idp living conditions so far however china thailand india and other asian countries have continued normal relations and opposed policies of isolating burma second while the refugee situation continues access for unhcr other international observers and reporters is generally seen as critical to assessing the problem and situation accurately observers believe that accurate information would be helpful in anticipating the needs of the populations on both sides of the border in the short term and they point out that in the long term if any repatriation is to occur arrangements for resettlement of refugees returning home will need to be determined before any agreement can be put in place the thai government has long been host to refugees from burma and by all indications will continue to be for the time being however most observers believe that an eventual longterm solution must be found for these refugees third others maintain that the international community could consider ways to influence burmas longterm political development and encourage equal rights and autonomy under federal system that incorporated the different ethnic and religious groups within broader framework increased us and international sanctions reveal shift towards greater isolation of the spdc however developing framework and outlining options for eventual discussion is seen as useful to the larger process of reconstruction and reconciliation in burma 13 senate report 108106 foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriation bill 2004
