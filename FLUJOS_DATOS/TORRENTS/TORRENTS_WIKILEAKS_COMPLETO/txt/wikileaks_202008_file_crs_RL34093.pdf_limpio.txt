ko rea lowering labor costs for south korean businesses and providing possibl beachhead for market reforms in the dprk the future course of the kaesong industrial complex could undergo some changes as result of the december 2007 victory of lee myungbak in south koreas presidential election lee who w ill take office at the end of february 2008 has indicated he generally will seek more reciprocity from pyongyang in non humanitarian interkorean cooperation progra ms and that he will link future large scale economic programs to progress on the north korean nuclear issue and will also weigh heavily the financial costs of these programs statements from his transition team members indicate that the new administration plan to continue projects that are commercially viable both presidentelect lee and his transition team have been somewhat vague on what these principles would mean for the kic however the incoming administration has indicated it will not suspend the kic4 if this proves to be the lee governments policy major question for the future will be whether the lee government would support major expans ion of the kic one policy shift that may occur according to some south korean s who have contacts with the transition team is that lee may seek to raise the commercial focus of the kic by reducing the governments involvement in running the complex5 us policy options include maintain ing the status quo of supporting but not actively promoting the kic using the debate over the korus fta to focus attention on labor and other conditions in the kic encouraging

with 700 million derived directly from the operation of the kic 25 billion from sales of raw mate rials and other industrial products and 14 billion from corporate taxes42 considering that in international trade in goods in 2005 north korea exported 18 billion and imported 36 billion the estimated total gains of 955 b illion over nine years associated with the kaesong industrial complex

continue with these plans54 longterm geopolitical and economic issues the kaesong industrial complex sits at the hub of spreading concentric sets of economic and geopolitical interests and concerns at its narrowest sense the kic is business venture in which participants are seeking profits and business advantages on the south korean side the kic provides small and mediumsized companies with manufacturing platform and opportunity to access lowcost labor without having to go overseas to establis h subsidiaries or to outsource the assembly of their products to china or other market s on the dprk side the kic provides jobs for workers who can earn relatively hi gher wages without crossing their borders illegally or working under contract in labo rscarce countries such as those in the russian far east or in middle eastern countries at somewhat wider set of intere sts the kic provides channel for rapproachment between the dprk and south korea kaesong developed partly from south koreas sunshine policy of economic engagement with the north it can be viewed as confidencebuilding meas ure between two countries whose hostility toward each other has lingered since the 1950 52 korean war as has been the case with the extensive economic interchange between china and taiwan55 the kic may provide bridge for communication and catalyst for cultural interaction and it can create

according to the economist intelligence unit the decrepit north korean economy has three crying needs deeper market reforms greater openness and above all massive investment to modernize decr epit plant and infrastructure57 the kic potentially addresses all three of these needs to limited extent however reports from north korea indicate that the economic reforms there currently are stalled even being reversed unlike chinas reforms moreover the initiative for the kic came from abroad is viewed with suspicion by many and is an isolated case although pyongyang seems to be attempting to revive the sinuiju special administrative region similar free trade zone along the border with china58 in sum it is still too early to tell if kaesong will succeed much less have large effect on the rest of the north korean economy at geopolitical level kaesong is one part of the standoff between the dprk and the united states china south kor ea japan and russia over north koreas nuclear weapons program under the rubr ic of the sixparty talks lie bundle of strategic issues such as the ability of north korea to finance its nuclear program the need for humanitarian and energy aid the stability of the kim jongil regime and the enforcement of various economic sanctions being applied to north korea major goal of the united states in the sixparty talks is to halt and verifiably dismantle north koreas capability to produce nuclear fu and nuclear bombs or to proliferate nuclear material or technology to potentia lly hostile countries or groups the us strategy to accomplish this is combination of sticks sanctions diplomatic isolation name calling and carrots promises of aid diplomatic recognition security guarantees conveyed to north korea through the sixparty talks bilateral meetings and occasional media blasts under this st rategy there is little reason to provide the dprk with any financial reward even if it is to the benefit of south korea unless it shows significant progress in its commitments under the sixparty talks the south korean goals with respect to north korea however not only include the denuclearization of the korean pe ninsula but eventual reunification and reconstruction of the dprks economy major south korean concern is the potential cost of reunification either in the form of flood of economic emigrants to the south or in actual budgetary outlays to help rebuild the norths civilian economy the high cost to west germany of the in tegration of east germany after the fall of the berlin wall has provided little comfort to the policy makers in seoul

although incoming rok president lee myungbak has said he will seek more reciprocity in seouls dealings with py ongyang and he has been somewhat vague about how he will treat the kic his statemen ts to

north korea raise per capita income to 3000 in ten years lee has made this policy contingent upon progress in the denuclearization of north korea for south korea not only does kaesong provide entry into the decrepit dprk economy but it is key factor in buildin g up and reforming the economy in the north with an eye toward eventual reunification beijings stra tegy before the return of hong kong in 1997 has been instructive to seoul major reason that many of the first economic reforms in china occurred in nearby guangdong province particularly just across the border from hong kong in shenzhen city was that beijing tried to stem pressures to immigrate to hong kong by raising the standard of living and industrial development in th region abutting the returnin g territory this strategy has been so successful that some immigration pa rticularly of hong kong retirees has been going from hong kong to guangdong province and not the other way around likewise beijing has broadened ties with taiwan through allowing cross strait investments travel business visa s communication and other businessbased activities in some sectors particularly in the manufacture of computers and other electronic products taiwan and the east coas t of china have become one integrated economy kaesong arguably could begi n similar process with north korea south korea also aims to become hub of east asia in order to accomplish this it would like to be connected to china russia and to europe via railways that pass through north korea as part of the kic project north and south korea have reconnected railroad line connecting the north and south and have conducted test run on it second line on the opposite side of the peninsula also was connected in terms of logistics shipment by rail

options the three national interests of the united states that form the basis of all policy discussion are security ec onomic wellbeing and value projection these three national interests all play into consideration of the kaesong industrial complex the main security concern for the united states is the location of the kic in the dprk us security concerns with respect to north korea center on two major considerations 1 the dprks nuclear pr ogram and 2 potential conflict across the dmz separating north korea and south ko rea the kic has opposing effects upon these security considerations on one hand since income in any country is fungible anything that increases revenue to the pyongyang regime has the potential to contribute to the dprks military including its missile and nuclear program it is likely however that the dprks nuclear program has assured funding from the government also given kim jongils military first policy the north korean military has top priority in th allocation of scarce economic resources it also has call on certain economic activities and government subsidies for them it is not clear how much if any income over that used to pay for expenses related to kaesong for pyongyang from the kic currently is directed toward the dprk military or nuclear program since the kic land formerly wa s military base that had to be vacated60 some arrangement may have been made to compensate the military for relinquishing strategically important piece of ground even if the income from the kic does not figure 3 kaesongs potential logistical rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34093crs20 go directly into military purposes it may bol ster funds for civilian purposes that had been cut because of the budgetary demands of the military the kim regime

prohibits any member state from providing funds that go to support north koreas nuclear weapons program the resolution states in section 8d that all member states shall in accordance with their resp

or for the benefit of persons or entities enga ged in or providing support for the dprks programs related to nuclear weapons other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile related programs as for tensions across the dmz the kic already has played an important role in increasing the level of engagement between the dprk and south korea and in raising the priority of econo mic activity relative to secur ity concerns even though the border between north korea and south korea is heavily guarded and crossings had been rare the military on both sides have acquiesced to the daily traffic on the northsouth highway to kaesong and the reconnection of two railways across the dmz along with limited tourist visits and family reunions in terms of the second us national in terest of economic wellbeing the kic currently has little relevance although it has some effect through us trade and investment relations with south korea us companies have investments in kaesong and us trade with north korea in 2007 was virtually nonexistent south korea however is the seventh largest trad ing partner of the united states and the united states is south koreas third largest trading partner if the sixparty talks on the denuclearization of the korean penins ula were to progress far enough the united states could reestablish diplomatic relations with the dprk lift economic sanctions and eventually grant that c ountry normal trade relations mostfavored nation status if so trade with north ko rea could be done on the same basis as trade with most other countries of the world absent that development south koreas request to treat products made in the kic as south korean in origin would seem to be the only way to bring the kic into the set of industrial loca tions open to normal or preferential trade with the united st ates meanwhile south korean companies exporting kic products likely will continue to avoid the us market rather than face economic sanctions and high u s tariffs this may give countries that include the kic in their ftas with south korea s uch as asean and efta and possibly the european union possible small diplom atic advantage over the united states in dealing with seoul moreover south korea is likely to press the united states to change its kic policy this could be s ource of future usrok tension even if the korus fta is passed the third us national interest is projecting us values such as marketbased economy representative government and na tions adhering to world standards for working conditions environmental regulation and other

too few and the project too small to have significan t impact on the development of the north korean middle class factor in the development of more representative society and the number of the elites in the dprk w ith an economic interest in the complex probably is still relatively small if the project continues to develop and the dprk opens other freetrade zones however something akin to the economic reforms in china or the economic transformation that is now occurring in vietnam61 could occur in north korea this could weaken the hold by pyongyang on the daily lives of citizens and bring the country more into the globalized world such economic liberalization also could reduce pressures on north korea to engage in illicit trade in order to cover its trade deficit62 and diminish the need for pyongyang to saber rattle in order to divert atten tion from its domestic problems in the short run however increased reve nues strengthen the regimes hand and make it less vulnerable to outside pressure also spillover effects will depend on north korea adding much more value to the production processes which it has yet to do finally there is some question about the extent to which kic is commercially viable or whether incentives and supports given to south korean firms are critical as opposed to marginal in their profit and loss calculations trade between the dprk and south korea tends to be govern mentbased in contrast to trade between china and north korea this may blunt the lessons learned by pyongyang the united states currently has mixed policy with respect to the kic since south korea is close ally of the unite d states washington has been supportive of efforts by south korea to engage the rth in interkorean projects that benefit south korea on the other hand the united states has been firm in predicating any economic or other concessions on actions by the dprk to curtail or eliminate its nuclear program major policy considerations and options for congress given the above us interests include the following in considering whether or not to approve the korus fta congress may express its support or nonsupport of the exclusion of the kic from the fta as negotiated congress may also specify the conditions under which the kic can or can not be brought under the provisions of the proposed fta congressional di sapproval of the proposed korus fta likely
