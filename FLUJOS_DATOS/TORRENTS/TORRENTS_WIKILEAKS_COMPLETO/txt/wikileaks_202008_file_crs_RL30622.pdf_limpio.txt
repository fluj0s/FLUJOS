use on its planned nextgeneration dd21 landattack destroyer and is considering it for use on other kinds of navy ships as well electric drive poses issues for congress concerning its costs benefits and risks and how the technology should be integrated into the dd21 program or other shipacquisition programs several foreign countries are developing or using electric drive in commercial or naval ships the us navys electricdrive development effort centers on the integrated power system ips program several privatesector firms in the united states are now pursuing electric drive for the us navy market electric drive offers significant anticipated benefits for us navy ships in terms of reducing ship lifecycle cost increasing ship stealthiness payload survivability and power available for nonpropulsion uses and taking advantage of strong electrical power technological and industrial base potential disadvantages include higher near term costs increased technical risk increased system complexity and less efficiency in fullpower operations the current scarcity of precise and systematic estimates of the costs and benefits of electric drive makes it difficult for policymakers to assess the relative costeffectiveness of differing technical approaches to achieving electric drive some of the risks involved in developing electricdri ve technology have been mitigated by the successful development of electricdrive technology for commercial ships estimates of the amount of remaining risk vary the navy has stated that developing common electricdrive components is feasible for several kinds of navy ships and that pursuing electric drive technology in the form of common family of components could have advantages for the navy the potential savings associated with common system are difficult to estimate but could be substantial the concept of developing common system or family of components poses issues for policymakers concerning the extent of commonality across electricdriveequipped navy ships and the use of competition in the development and procurement of electricdrive technology much of the debate over electric drive concerns electric motors the five basic types in question synchronous motors induction motors permanent magnet motors superconducting synchronous motors and superconducting homopol ar motors differ in terms of their technological

and discusses issues for congress regarding the use of electricdrive propulsion technology as opposed to traditional mechanicaldrive technology on us navy ships as result of technological developments over the last few years electricdrive technology has matured to the point where the navy has selected it for use on its planned nextgeneration dd21 landattack destroyer and is considering it for use on other kinds of navy ships as well electricdrive technology would change the way that us navy ships transmit power from their engines to their propellers as well as the way that they manage and distribute electrical power to both propulsion and nonpropulsion systems electric drive would not require the ships engines to be changed ships could continue to be powered by diesel engines gas turbines or steam turbines the navys decision to use electricdrive propulsion technology represents technological shift for the navy arguably comparable in significance to the navys shift from sail to steam power in the latter 1800s or the navys development of nuclear propulsion in the 1950s electricdrive technology is being pursued by several foreign navies most notably in europe and is being incorporated into numerous commercial ships especially cruise ships electricdrive propulsion particularly when installed as part of shipwide integrated electrical power system could generate substantial capability and lifecycle cost benefits for us navy ships electricdrive technology however still requires development work and integrating it into nearerterm us navy ship acquisition programs particularly the dd21 program involves degree of technical risk the debate over whether when and how to incorporate electricdrive technology into navy shipacquisition programs has developed rapidly over the last three years key developments over this period include the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs2 1national research council naval studies board technology for the united

for new navy destroyersin 1997 the naval studies board of the national research council included substantial discussion of electricdrive technology in major 9volume report on key technologies for the navy and marine corps for the period 200020351 in 1998 us firms involved in developing electricdrive technologies began to intensify their efforts and publicize them to both policymakers and the two shipyardled industry teams that are competing for the right to design the dd 21 destroyer these teams began to more intensively explore the potential for equipping the dd21 with electric drive in june 1998 the senate appropriations committee directed the secretary of the navy to provide report to the committee on the idea of common electricdrive system for the dd21 and later ships in the virginia ssn774 class attack submarine program in march 1999 the navy delivered the report to congress the report stated that developing common electricdrive components is feasible for several kinds of navy ships and that pursuing electric drive technology in the form of common family of components could have advantages for the navy in may 1999 the navy completed and began testing its fullscale landbased electricdrive demonstration system in philadelphia in january 2000 the navy announced that the dd21 class would be equipped with electric drive and that proposed funding for development of electricdrive technology was being increased by about 250 million over the period fy2001fy20052 electricdrive propulsion poses number of issues for congress concerning its potential costs benefits and risks and how the technology should be integrated into the dd21 program or other shipacquisition programs although congress has approved funding for navy research and development work on electricdrive in prior years the navys plan to expand the scope of its electricdrive development effort and apply electric drive to at least one new class of navy ships may require congress in coming years to make significant decisions relating to the technology the decisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs3 3letter from senator trent lott to congressional research service january 31 1999that congress reaches could have profound affect on future navy capabilities navy research and development funding requireme nts and the us marine propulsion technological and industrial base congressional request this report is the result of january 31 1999 request to crs from senator trent lott for analysis and conclusions concerning electric drive senator lott requested that the study examine the application of electric drive to civilian cruise ships commercial cargo ships surface combatants submarines and aircraft carriers the request stated that the report not be limited to us developments3 sources of information in response to senator lotts request crs in march 1999 circulated 5page list of questions on electric drive to navy offices the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the national academy of sciences us shipbuilding firms firms involved in the development of electricdrive technology and other organizations recipients were invited to respond in writing to any or all of the questions as appropriate to supplement their written responses with inperson briefings if they so desired and to distribute the list of questions to other potentially interested parties written responses some quite extensive were received in march and april 1999 from the us navy the united kingdoms royal navy numerous industry sources and additional respondents respondents included most of the parties to whom the list of questions was originally sent by crs plus additional parties that received the list of questions indirectly several respondents supplemented their written responses with inperson briefings some quite extensive after reviewing these materials crs posed some specific followon questions to some of the respondents to help clarify or elaborate certain points these inquiries resulted in some additional written responses and telephone conversations these written responses inperson briefings and telephone conversations constitute the primary sources of information for this report these sources were supplemented with additional file materials that crs has collected on the topic since the late 1980s when crs began to track developments relating to electricdrive propulsion for navy ships key findings the key findings of the report are presented below they can be divided into two groups findings relating to electricdrive technolo gy in general and findings relating to the potential application of electric drive to specific us shipacquisition programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs4 4a basic description of electricdrive as opposed to mechanicaldrive technology can be found in the background section of this report 5as discussed in the background section of the report five kinds of electric motors are discussed in connection with electricdrive technology for ships synchronous motors induction motors permanent magnet motors superconducting synchronous motors and superconducting homopolar motorselectric drive in general4 current status of electric drive several foreign countries particularly in europe have developed are developing or are using electricdrive technology in commercial ships naval ships or both much of the development work is governmentfinanced the british navys electricdrive program is particularly significant the electricdrive systems used today in cruise ships and other commercial ships are generally made overseas primarily in europe the three primary europeanbased electricdrive suppliers are alstom previously known as cegelec asea brown bovieri abb and siemens electricdrive technology is used on few us government ships and is being developed in the united states by both the us navy and private industry the navys effort centers on the integrated power system ips program which was established in 1995 as mentioned above the ips program recently completed construction of fullscale landbased electricdrive demonstration system testing of this system located in philadelphia began in may 1999 the navys prime contractor for this system is lockheed martin but much of the actual equipment was provided by alstom several other firms are also involved the navy is proposing total of more than 300 million for research and development on electric drive during the period fy2001fy2005 several privatesector firms in the united states are now pursuing electricdrive technology for the us navy market at least three privatesector entities are offering complete electricdrive systems to the navy alstom which has marine operations in britain france germany and the united states in pittsburgh and philadelphia the company supplies electric drive systems featuring synchronous motors and is also developing systems featuring induction and permanent magnet motors an industry team led by general dynamics corporation leading designer and builder of us navy ships this team is developing an electricdrive system featuring permanent magnet motor5 an industry team led by newport news shipbuilding nns another leading designer and builder of us navy ships this team is also developing an electricdrive system featuring permanent magnet motor in addition to these three entities other us firms are also involved in developing electricdrive technologies or components these include among othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs5 american superconductor which is developing superconducting synchronous motor and general atomics which is developing superconducting homopolar motor that was previously under development for many years by the us navy anticipated benefits and disadvantages electricdrive technology offers significant anticipated benefits for us navy ships in terms of reducing ship lifecycle cost increasing ship stealthiness payload survivability and power available for non propulsion uses and taking advantage of strong electricalpower technological and industrial base electric drive has potential disadvantages in terms of higher nearterm costs increased program risk increased system complexity and less efficiency in full power operations electric drive as technology area although electric drive is often discussed as specific system that could be available in the near future for the dd21 program many elements of electricdrive technology have the potential to evolve and improve over time this suggests that policymakers might consider addressing electric drive as not simply proposal for specific system that might require few nearerterm acquisition decisions but as broader technology area that might require longerterm management and oversight and series of research development and procurement decisions stretching over the course of several years if conducting longerterm management and oversight of electric drive is considered appropriate it might be assisted by developing an electricdrive technology development roadmap or master plan extending perhaps 10 to 25 years into the future nearterm costs pursuing electricdrive will incur higher nearterm costs than strategy that places continued emphasis on mechanicaldrive technology developing electricdrive technology for warships would require hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development funding in coming years particularly if the technology is developed for submarines as well as surface ships and if development of more advanced electricdrive technologies is pursued several but not all sources for this report stated that electricdrive systems initially would be more expensive to procure than mechanicaldrive systems the cost premium for commercial electric drive system which might be suitable for use in navy auxiliary ships could be less these sources however agreed that the procurement cost of electricdrive systems would come down over time and that the higher initial costs of electricdrive systems would be more than offset over the longer run by reduced ship lifecycle operating and support costs measuring and assessing cost effectiveness several sources agreed that the costeffectiveness of electric drive should be examined not by focusing on the electric drive system or any of its components in isolation but rather by examining the effect that electric drive has on overall ship cost and capability in an expanded version of this perspective the costeffectiveness of electric drive might also be measured in terms of its effect on total fleet costs and capabilities estimates of the costs and benefits of electricdrive technology should arguably include measures that examine not just shorter but also longerterm ie lifecycle or total ownership costs and warfighting effectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs6 although electricdrive technology offers numerous potential cost and warfighting benefits for navy ships relatively few precise estimates are available on the magnitude of these benefits if not redressed the scarcity of precise and systematic estimates will make it difficult for policym akers to assess with any precision the potential costeffectiveness of electricdrive technology in general and probably more significant the relative costeffecti veness of differing technical approaches to achieving electric drive the navys interest in electricdrive technology is consistent with the decisions of commercial ship operators especially cruise ship operators and other navies in recent years to move to electricdrive technology for their own ships the strong interest in electric drive by other navies particularly the british navy suggests that electric drive offers variety of warfighting and lifecycle cost advantages for naval ships the interest shown by other navies in electric drive however also demonstrates that there are multiple technical approaches to electric drive that should be assessed technical risk incorporating electricdrive technology into navy ship acquisition programs could add technical or schedule risk to those programs the potential amount of risk varies depending on the exact configuration of the system in question more advanced approaches to electric drive present greater potential technical or schedule risk but also promise greater potential cost effectiveness electricdrive components presenting potential technical or schedule risk include motor drives motors generators the electrical distribution system advanced propellerstern configurations and overall system design and integration issues to be addressed include demonstrating at full scale technologies that to date have been demonstrated at partial scale improvin g thermal performance achieving desired levels of acoustic quieting and shock resistance and designing overall system interfaces controls and module specifications some of the risks involved in developing electricdrive technology have been mitigated by the successful development of electricdrive technology for commercial ships some industry sources argue that the amount of remaining risk involved in developing electric drive for navy use is low to moderate other sources suggest that the degree of risk may be higher particularly if the technology is developed on an aggressive schedule technical risk involved in developing electric drive might be mitigated through more intensified research and development common system the navy stated in its march 1999 report to congress that developing common electricdrive components is feasible for several kinds of navy ships and that pursuing electric drive technology in the form of common family of components could have advantages for the navy the navy and the other military services have used commonality in numerous acquisition programs over the years and navy leaders are now placing increased emphasis on the concept potential advantages of common electricdrive system or family of common components include nearerterm cost savings due to streamlining of research and development costs both nearer and longerterm savings due to greater efficiencies in procurement and longerterm savings due to the streamlining of fleet traininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs7 operation and support efforts potential savings are difficult to estimate but could be substantial the concept of developing common system or family of components poses issues for policymakers concerning the extent of commonality across electricdrive equipped navy ships and the use of competition in the development and procurement of electricdrive technology past acquisition experience clearly suggests that designing unique electricdrive system for each kind of ship would not result in the most costeffect ive application of electric drive across the fleet past experience however does not prove conclusively that it would be achieved by an approach that would install common system or family of components on every kind of ship that is scheduled to be powered by electric drive commonality is not an end in itself but rather would be strategy for policymakers to consider in seeking the most cost effective path to apply electricdrive technology across the fleet policymakers might wish to assess the relative merits of both maximally common approach and more mixed approaches that combine elements of commonality with elements of ship specific solutions pursuing common electricdrive system or family of components could in theory lead to the emergence of dominant or monopoly supplier to the navy of electricdrive technology components and systems in light of this possibility policymakers who place high value on the use of competition in defense development and procurement might consider taking actions aimed at ensuring that any navy acquisition strategy for electric drive makes maximum use of competition between competing industry approaches prior to selecting the approach that would form the basis for the common system from this perspective it may also be appropriate to aim at ensuring that nearerterm acquisition decisions preserve as much as possible potential for employing competition in the eventual development and procurement of followon electricdrive technologies components and systems one possible approach would be to require the common electricdrive system to be designed to socalled open architecture another possible approach would be to provide continuing funding to firms other than those who supply the current electric drive system to finance continued development of potential competing technologies or components motors much of the debate since 1998 over the application of electricdrive technology to us navy ships concerns the type of electric motor that should be used the issue is highly charged because specific motor types are associated with specific firms competing for part of the navys prospective electricdrive program the electric motors associated with electricdrive systems for large ships can be divided into five basic categories synchronous motors induction motors permanent magnet motors superconducting synchronous motors and superconducting homopolar motors the synchronous motor can be considered the most mature technologically in application to large ships there is consensus among both naval and industry sources that the synchronous motor if scaled up to the higher horsepower ratings needed to move surface combatants and submarines at high speeds ie 30 knots would be too large and heavy to be suitable for use on these ships the most likely apparent opportunity for incorporatin g electricdrive systems using synchronoushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs8 motors presumably commerci ally available systems into the navys electricdrive effort would be to install them in large navy auxiliary ships the induction motor is generally considered the secondmost mature motor type for application to large ships after the synchronous motor it is the type of motor used in the navys fullscale landbased electricdrive demonstration system most of the sources consulted for this report argue or do not contest that it can be sufficiently powerdense to be suitable for use on us navy surface combatants by the same token however most sources including the us navy in its march 1999 report to congres s also argue or do not contest that the induction motor is not sufficiently compact or quiet to be suitable for use on us navy submarines using an electricdrive system with an induction motor rather than the currently less mature permanent magnet motor might help mitigate the risk of integrating electricdrive technology into the dd21 program but would preclude achieving motor commonality across surface ships and submarines the permanent magnet motor can be made quieter and significantly more power dense than the induction motor enough so that it is consequently considered suitable for use on submarines as well as surface combatants sources generally agree that the permanent magnet motor can be used in common electric drive system for navy surface ships and submarines the navys march 1999 report to congress focuses on the permanent magnet motor as the motor available in the nearer term that would be suitable for common electricdrive system the permanent magnet motor is less mature technologically than the induction motor and consequently at this point may pose more development risk to incorporate into nearerterm shipacquisition program such as the dd21 destroyer sources differ regarding the amount of technical risk involved in scaling up the permanent magnet motor to full size some argue that the basic technological issues in permanent magnet motors have been resolved and that scaling up the technology will not pose any new issues others demur arguing that scaling up is never riskfree the navys decision announced in february 2000 to delay the procurement of the first dd21 by one year to fy2005 will other things held equal reduce the risk associated with equipping the first dd21 with an electricdrive system using permanent magnet motor the superconducting synchronous motor if successfully developed could be more powerdense and quieter than permanent magnet motor the superconducting synchronous motor is less mature technologically than the permanent magnet motor and was not discussed in the navys march 1999 report most sources argue or do not contest that it cannot be matured quickly enough to be installed at acceptable risk on the first dd21 advocates of the superconducting synchronous motor while not necessarily disagreeing argue that the technology for this kind of motor has progressed in recent years and that the time needed to mature the technology may be less than others estimate the firm developing this motor says that with adequate funding it could be developed and completed by 2009 making it possible to have the motor enter service with the fleet in 2012httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs9 6the term homopolar ie unipolar refers to the fact that this motor uses direct current rather than alternating current electricity and does not require either reversal of current or electrical commutation as result the magnetic field and the electrical current in the armature of homopolar motor are constant over time and space ie unvaryingthe superconducting homopolar motor 6 if successfully developed could similarly be more powerdense and quieter than permanent magnet motor the navy worked on developing the homopolar motor for many years starting in the mid1970s the homopolar motor like the superconducting synchronous motor is less mature technologically than the permanent magnet motor and was given little emphasis in the navys march 1999 report advocates of this motor like those of the superconducting synchronous motor argue that the technology for this kind of motor has progressed in recent years and that the time needed to mature the technology may be less than others estimate the firm now developing this type of motor says that with adequate funding it could be developed and completed in 5 or 6 years other nonmotor components there is considerable potential for evolution and improvement in the nonmotor elements of electricdrive technology this is potentially significant because with the partial exception of the motor drive there has been relatively little discussion of how these other components could or should evolve or be improved application of electric drive to specific shipacquisition programs dd21 landattack destroyers given the possibility that the dd21s system might become the basis for common electricdrive system for the navy the economic stakes for firms competing to build the system are potentially very high the navys acquisition strategy for the dd21 program gives the two industry teams that are competing for the right to design the dd21 wide latitude in selecting the type of electricdrive system the ship would use this approach is consistent with navy and department of defense acquisition reform efforts the potential for the dd21s electricdrive system to become the basis of common electricdrive system together with the navys acquisition strategy for the program raise several potential issues for congress these issues concern the dd 21 program schedule and its effect on the technical risk in developing electric drive the adequacy of dd21 program funding for development of electric drive the achievability of the dd21 ship procurement cost goal the potential for evolving the dd21s electric drive system over time the appropriateness of the latitude given to the two dd21 industry teams in determining the ships propulsion system and how to reconcile the potentially conflicting goals of optimizing electric drive for dd21 and optimizing it for application to multiple navy ship types given the competing motor technologies now being pursued there are numerous potential strategies that can be pursued concerning the type of motor used in the dd 21 electricdrive system sources differed regarding the amount of technical risk associated with incorporating different versions of an electricdrive system into the first dd21 the lowestrisk option would appear to be system using an induction motor connected by traditional horizontal shaft at the stern of the ship to fixedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs10 7see figure 3 in the background section page 18 for an illustration of podded propellerpitch propeller with some added risk the lead ships system could include permanent magnet motor rather than an induction motor eventually an advanced propellerstern configuration such as podded propeller7 could be developed for the dd21 on june 14 2000 ingalls shipbuildi ng the leader of one of the two industry teams competing for the dd21 announced that it had selected the nnsled electric drive industry team for the preliminary design of an electric drive propulsion system and will incorporate the nnsled teams permanent magnet motor design into its initial system design proposal for the dd21 virginia ssn774 class submarines electricdrive technology in some form could be installed on followon virginiaclass submarines navy officials testified in june 2000 that nearerterm electricdrive system could be ready for virginiaclass boat procured in fy2010 some industry sources suggested that it could be ready for boat procured in fy2007 if decision were made in the near term to pursue the option and adequate development funding was provided some industry sources have suggested and the navy did not disagree that electricdrive technology for submarines if pursued ambitiously has the potential for altering the stern of virginiaclass submarine in way that could reduce the procurement cost of the submarine currently 19 billion to 20 billion by as much as 100 million pursuing electricdrive technology for submarines this ambitiously however would be very expensive it could easily require hundreds of millions of dollars or even more than billion dollars in research and development funding beyond the funding that the navy has already programmed for development of electricdrive technology tadcx auxiliary dry cargo ships the navys planned tadcx class of auxiliary dry cargo ships the first of which was procured in fy2000 is nearterm candidate for electricdrive propulsion as large slowerspeed noncombat ship now in procurement that is somewhat similar to commercial cargo ship it might be feasible and costeffective to equip the tadcx with currently available european commercial electricdrive system similar to those now being used for cruise ships jccx joint command and control ships electric drive might similarly be candidate for the joint command and control jccx ships that the navy plans to begin procuring in fy2004 if these ships are built to commercialship standards the jccx might be candidate for commercial electricdrive system the operational requirements of the jccx however might require navydeveloped electricdrive system with better quieting and shock resistance lha replacement ships lhd8 modified wasp lhd1 class ship that will be the first lha replacement ship is to be equipped with hybrid propulsion plant consisting of lowpower electricdrive system for lowspeed operations and mechanicaldrive system for higherspeed operations the navy is now assessinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs11 whether the second through fifth lha replacement ships should be additional and furthermodified lhd1 class ships or newdesign amphibious assault ship known as the lhx the furthermodifiedlhd option might and the lhx option more certainly could include full electricdrive system cvn x aircraft carrier the navys march 1999 report to congress on electric drive states that while electric drive is feasible for future aircraft carriers mechanical drive would be more appropriate for cvnx1 the first of the navys planned class of nextgeneration aircraft carriers which is to be procured in fy2006 the navys conclusion contrasts with 1997 naval research advisory committee nrac report on the cvnx that strongly endorsed equipping the cvnx with electricdrive technology policymakers may review the navys 1999 conclusion periodically eg with the procurement of each carrier to determine whether it remains valid coast guard deepwater cutters the 1998 navycoast guard national fleet concept with its emphasis on commonality raises the possibility of using electric drive on the new cutters that are to be procured under the coast guard deepwater project equipping these cutters with electricdrive could produce ship capability and lifecycle cost benefits for the coast guard similar to those that electricdrive technology is expected to produce for the navy and potentially improve economies of scale for both the navy and coast guard in the production operation and life cycle support of ship propulsion systems incorporating electric drive into the deepwater program however would pose several significant issues in terms of feasability cost and program disruption particularly since the first cutter is to be procured in 2002 and competing deepwater industry teams have already completed much of their design work for the ship background basic description of electric drive electric vs mechani cal drive ships drive system is the equipment that transmits power from the ships engines to its propellers it is roughly analogous to the transmission and drive shaft in car which transmit power from the cars engine to its wheels most of the worlds larger civilian and military ships today use mechanical drive system in very simplified form with mechanicaldrive system the higher speed revolutions per minute rpms produced by ships engine also known as the prime mover are transmitted by rigid shaft to set of gears known as reduction gears that convert ie reduce these higherspeed rpms to the lowerspeed rpms that are more appropriate for larger ships propeller second rigid shaft then transmits these lowerspeed rpms from the reduction gears to the propeller ships with multiple propellers have multiple engines reduction gears and sets of shafts with an electricdrive system in contrast generator converts the engines higherspeed rpms into electricity this electricity is then transmitted by an electricalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs12 cable toward the stern of the ship to device called motor drive or motor controller which modifies the voltage and frequency of the electricity as needed for the ships electric motor to operate properly and at the desired speed the electric motor then converts the electricity into lowerspeed rpms that turn the propeller ships with multiple propellers have multiple electric motors and motor drives figure 1 depicts the basic arrangements of mechanical and electricdrive systems integrated electric drive integrated power system ships with mechanical drive systems actually have two sets of engines one set is used for ship propulsion as described above second and separate set connected to electrical generators is used to generate electricity for all of the electrically powered equipment on the ship us navy arleigh burke ddg51 class destroyer for example has set of four large gaspowered turbine engines for propulsion and second set of three smaller gas turbines that produce electrical power for the ship in ship with mechanicaldrive system the powerproducing capability of the ships propulsion engines typically represents 75 percent to 85 percent of the ships total powerproducing capability this powerproducing capability is devoted exclusively to ship propulsion and is not available for nonpropulsion uses even when the ship is stationary or traveling at low speed ships with an electricdrive system in contrast can be designed so that single set of engines produces common pool of electricity that is used for both ship propulsion and the ships nonpropulsion electrical loads such system is known as an integrated electricdrive ied system or integrated power system ips in ships with integrated electric drive the electricity produced by the engines and generators is sent by cable to an electric switchboard that divides the electricity into two flows one for the ships propulsion needs and one for the ships other electrical loads the switchboard can alter the distribution of power between these two uses on momenttomoment basis as needed to meet the ships propulsion and non propulsion needs with an integrated electric drive the large amount of power needed to propel the ship at high speeds is thus available if needed for other uses even when the ship is traveling at high speed power can be momentarily diverted away from the propulsi on system to nonpropulsion system that needs short burst of high strength power without appreciably slowing the ship down an integrated electric drive is roughly analogous to the arrangement in the star trek science fiction television series in which the captain of the star ship can order the ships engineer to divert power from the ships engines to its weapons or other systems all current proposals for using electric drive propulsion on us navy ships envisage an integrated electric drive system consequently in this report the term electric drive is used to refer to integrated electric drive figure 1 shows the basic arrangement of an integrated electric drive systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs13 engine generator short shaftcablemotor drive cablemotor shaft propeller basic electricdrive system not to scaleengine shaft shaft propellerreduction gears basic mechanicaldrive system not to scalefigure 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs14 key components as shown in figure 2 an integrated electric drive system includes the following major elements engines also known as prime movers on us navy surface combatants the engines are gas turbines modified versions of jet engines used on commercial airliners that burn jet fuel on us navy submarines and most us navy aircraft carriers the engines are steam turbines whose steam is created using heat produced by nuclear reactor on other ships particularly those with lower maximum speeds the prime movers can be diesel engines generators which convert the mechanical energy produced by the engines higherspeed rpms into electricity electric switchboard which distributes the electricity to propulsion and non propulsion needs motor drives also known as motor controllers which modify the voltage and frequency of the electricity as needed for the ships electric propulsion motors to operate properly and

element in discussions of electric drive concerns the type of motor to be used the motor types associated with electricdrive systems for large ships can be organized into the five general categories shown in the table below they all convert electrical energy into mechanical energy rpms they differ however in certain key characteristics including the type of electrical current used alternating current ac or direct current dc the source of the magnetic field that is combined with the flow of electrical energy to create mechanical energy and whether the motors conduct the electrical energy

motor dc superconducting homopolar motor homopolar motor in addition it should be noted that three versions of the permanent magnet motor have been discussed in connection with electricdrive systems for ships the radialgap radialflux version the axialgap axial flux version and the transverse flux version these versions differ in the design and orientation of their fixed and rotating elements their stators and rotors and consequently in how electromagnetic lines of flux in the motors work to create mechanical movement in short radial gap motor can be described as cylinder rotating within another cylinder the axial gap motor can be described as disk spinning between two other disks and the transverseflux motor can be described as rimmed disk whose rim spins inside slotted rings anticipated benefits and potential disadvantages anticipated benefits8 electricdrive technology offers significant anticipated benefits for us navy ships in terms of reducing ship lifecycle cost increasing ship stealthiness payload survivability and power available for nonpropulsion uses and taking advantage of strong electricalpower technological and industrial base reduced ship lifecycle cost depending on the kind of ship in question and its operating profile the amount of time that the ship spends traveling at various speeds navy ship with an integrated electricdrive system may consume 10 percenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs17 9a podded propulsor is streamlined roughly cylindrical pod with propeller attached to one end usually the front end that is suspended from the bottom of the ship the pod which contains the electric motor driving the propeller can be designed to swivel in circle so as to direct the propellers thrust in any direction and thereby steer the ship podded propulsor eliminates the need at the stern of the ship for lengthy exposed horizontal shaft leading to the propeller and rudder for steering the ship with podded propulsor there are fewer exposed components to create drag ie resistance to forward movement and the propeller encounters more uniform ie less disturbed water flow increasing its efficiency ie its ability to use its rpms to create thrust using podded propulsors can improve ships maneuverability by permitting tighter turning radius and by giving it the ability to change the ships direction of movement or its orientation even at very low speeds podded propulsor might also offer certain advantages in terms of maintenance and repair since the pod can be detached and quickly repaired or replaced by like unit without need for cutting an opening into the ships hull and working around other equipment for an article discussing podded propulsion systems see bonner kit naval propulsion for the 21st century the azipod system us naval institute proceedings august 1999 7476to 25 percent less fuel than similar ship with mechanicaldrive system the navy estimates savings of 15 to 19 percent for ship like surface combatant in addition electric drive makes possible the use of new propellerstern configurations such as podded propulsor see figure 3 that can reduce ship fuel consumption further due to their improved hydrodynamic efficiency estimates of additional savings range from 4 percent to 15 percent depending on the ship type and the exact propellerstern configuration used9 for fossilfueled ships fuel consumption is major contributor to annual ship operating and support costs over the life of the ship the savings from reduced fuel consumption promise to significantly outweigh the potential increase in initial procurement cost associated with electric drive thus significantly reducing the ships total lifecycle cost also known as total ownership cost toc the navy is now placing increased emphasis on lifecycle cost in the acquisition process so as to more effectively capture the longterm cost consequences of its acquisition decisions in addition to savings on fuel it is anticipated that electricdrive systems may require less maintenance and fewer crew members to operate than mechanicaldrive systems electricdrive systems can be designed to be highly automated and self monitoring reductions in maintenance and crew size would further reduce ship life cycle cost increased stealth electric drive promises to be significantly quieter acoustically than mechanical drive since

endurance rangethe significantly improved quieting promised by electric drive may be the single most important benefit of electric drive to the navys submari ne community stealthiness is fundamental to submarines survivability and effectiveness and acoustic noise remains the most reliable method by which submarines can be detected and tracked at longer ranges the navy has expended significant resources over the last few decades on making its submarines increasingly quiet so as to stay ahead of increasingly capable adversary submarinedetection equipment and has stated that electric drive is needed to provide the next significant improvement in acoustic quieting on submarines10 although traditionally not as critical for surface warships stealthiness including acoustic quieting is becoming increasingly important as contributor to surface warship survivability and effectiveness the improved acoustic quieting promised by electric drive thus promises to be of benefit to surface ships as well in addition electricdrive by permitting reduction in the volume devoted to air intakes and exhaust ducts can reduce surface ships infrared signature and radar cross section new propellerstern configurations made possible by electric drive might reduce the wake signature of surface ships which could reduce their detectability by remote overhead sensors and improve their chances of defeating muchfeared wake homing torpedoes increased payload in surface combatant electric drives reduced fuel consumption can translate into reduction in the amount of space aboard ship required for fuel storage11 in addition by eliminating the socalled tyranny of the shaft line the need in mechanical drive system to install the engines reduction gears shafts and propellers in long line running along the bottom of the ship electric drive makes it possible to install the various parts of surface combatants drive system in positions that may use space aboard ship in more efficient manner for example it may permit the ships turbine engines to be located higher in the ship reducing the amount of interior space required for the ducts that are needed to take air down into the engines and to carry exhaust gases away from the engine in both these ways electric drive may free up space aboard the ship that can be used to carry additional payload eg weapons or sensors freedup space can also be used for other purposes such as increasing the size of staterooms for members of the ships crew so as to improve their quality of life aboard ship an objective which has recently emerged as navy priority increased survivability electricdrive can improve ship survivability in several ways eliminating mechanical drives tyranny of the shaft line can improve ship survivability by eliminating the possibility that one or more of the ships long shaft lines will be thrown out of alignment and rendered useless by nearby weapon explosion eliminating the requirement to locate elements of the ships

also facilitate the replacement of todays prime movers eg diesel engines gas turbine engines or steam turbines and generators with more efficient powerproducing technologies including direct energyconversion devices such as fuel cellsall in straight line along the bottom of the ship makes it possible to place them in locations where they may be better protected from attack by certain weapons eg mines electric drive makes it possible to more widely distribute elements of the propulsion system around the ship making it less likely that single weapon might disable the entire drive system with an integrated power system the flow of power from distributed power sources can be rapidly reconfigured in the event of damage to the ship to ensure continued supply of electricity to vital systems past experience with battle damage to naval ships suggests that this could be very significant benefit and for surface ships electric drive permits smaller propulsion machinery spaces which could facilitate damage control and permit greater use of automated damagecontrol technologies increased power availabl for nonpropulsion systems as mentioned earlier electric drive makes large amounts of power available for nonpropulsion uses such as powerful radars and sonars laser weapons highpower microwave weapons electromagnetic rail guns electrothermal guns electromagnetic aircraft launch and recovery systems ie electromagnetic catapults and arresting wires or rapidly charging the batteries of unmanned air vehicles uavs unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs and highenergy undersea sensor networks12 some of these functions particularly the weapons may require peak power levels measured in tens of megawatts and adding this much electricalgenerating capacity to mechanical drive ship would incur substantial additional costs13 strong technological and industrial base some elements of the navys current mechanicaldrive systems particularl reduction gears that have been specially engineered for quiet operations are generally not found in commercial application limiting economies of scale in their production and support advocates of electric drive argue that as commercial ships shift to greater reliance on electric drive mechanicaldrive technology will experience declining economies of scale that will not only increase its production and support costs but also possibly reduce the incentive for manufacturers of mechanicaldrive components to invest in further improvement of mechanicaldrive technology in contrast advocates of electric drive argue electricdrive propulsion will benefit from increasing production and support economies of scale and will also be able to take advantage of rapid technological advances in the large and vibrant commercial electricalpower and electronics industries potential disadvantages electric drive has potential disadvantages in terms of higher nearterm costs increased program risk increased system complexity and less efficiency in fullpower operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs21 14some sources disagreed with this saying that when auxiliary systems are taken into account electricdrive systems can be made less complex than mechanicaldrive systems 15this is why electric drive is viewed as not necessarily better than mechanical drive for commercial cargo ships that sprint between ports at consistently high speedshigher nearterm costs pursuing electricdrive technology would incur higher nearterm development costs than strategy that places continued emphasis on mechanicaldrive technology most sources also stated that electricdrive systems would initially be more expensive to procure than mechanicaldrive systems increased program risk sources for this report acknowledged that incorporating electricdrive rather than mechanicaldrive technology into navy ship acquisition programs could add technical or schedule risk to those programs since electricdrive technology is less mature than mechani caldrive technology for application to naval ships areas of potential technical risk in developing electric drive technology depending on the approach taken include motor drives motors generators the electrical distribution system advanced propellerstern configurations and overall system design and integration increased system complexity electric drive can add complexity to the ships design both in the number of major elements involved in the drive train14 and in the complexity of the ships electrical system added complexity in general can raise potential concerns regarding issues such as overall system reliability and maintainability proponents of electric drive argue that the technology has shown itself to be highly reliable and maintainable after extensive use in cruise ships and other commercial ships less efficiency at full power electricdrive systems can be less efficient than mechanicaldrive systems for fullpower ie maximumspeed operations due to the energy losses involved in converting rpms into electricity and electricity back into rpms15 naval ships however typically spend only small fraction of their time at full power typically most of their time about 80 percent by one estimate is spent at halfspeed roughly oneeighth power or less as result for naval ships losses due to the somewhat lower efficiency when operating at full power will likely be more than offset by gains due to higher efficiency when operating at partial power brief history of electric drive electricdrive technology dates to about 1910 following the development of the first large electric motors and generators at that time electricdrive systems developed by the united states and mechanicaldrive systems employing reduction gears developed by the british were both being perfected and competed against one another by the 1920s the british developed lightweight highefficiency mechanicaldrive system and mechanical drive emerged as the predominant ship propulsion technology as summarized by one naval writer the history of electric propulsion in naval vessels began in 1912 with the us navys fleet collier jupiter ac3 successfully powered by melvillemcalpine turboelectric system and prototype for future capital ship installations in 1919httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs22 16wood geoffrey electric propulsion in warships then and now naval forces 3 1995 20 another naval analyst has written that major us navy success story of the early part of the 20th century was turbo electric drive for capital ships five battleships and the battle cruisers completed as the carriers lexington cv2 and saratoga cv3 turboelectric power was abandoned only because the postworld war i naval arms treaties made it vital to save weight geared turbines used in mechanicaldrive systems were far lighter the us navy was unique in adopting turboelectric power for major warships some cruise liners built after world war i also were turbo electric probably because the pre1914 united states had the worlds most advanced electric power industry the us navy revived turboelectric plants during world war ii for destroyer escorts because us gearcutting capacity was insufficient as in capital ships turboelectric machinery carried considerable cost in weight and volume as it turned out however the necessary lengthening of the ships hulls reduced hydrodynamic wavewaking resistance enough to balance off the extra weight and the resulting buckley de51 and rudderrow de224class escorts were as fast as the geared turbine design would have been which was not in the event built as planned these ships apparently proved entirely satisfactory friedman norman navy commits to electric drive us naval institute proceedings april 2000 4 6 see also eisman dale advantage of electric ships hasnt changed much since 1900s continuedthe us congress still refusing funds for aircraft carrier construction as such made an allocation for the conversion of the jupiter to the navys first albeit experimental aircraft carrier langley cv1 which entered service in 1922 three 32000 shaft horsepower new mexico class turbine powered mechanical drive battleships were ordered in 1914 but in build during construction it was decided to install turboelectric ie electricdrive system in the lead ship while this was heavier drive system installation than those of the two sister ships the new mexico proved more economical flexible and provided better manoeuverability nevertheless during major refits over 1931 1933 all three ships were given new 40000 shp shaft horsepower straight turbine mechanical drive installations for an extra 075 kts knots in 1915 two tennessee class battleships similar to the new mexico were ordered these were immediately followed by three almost identical coloradoclass ships also with turboelec tric propulsion the foregoing five battleships were survivors of the 1922 washington naval treaty under which 11 further projected electricdriven capital ships were cancelled two further products of the treaty were the lexington cv2 and saratoga cv3 survivors of class of six battle cruisers ordered over 19161919 and on which work was stopped on the slip work on the named ships restarted in 1922 to complete them as aircraft carriers the us navys first real two ships of the type during wwii the us produced numbers of turboelectric vessels due to some extent to shortage of reduction gearcutting capacity in those years 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs23 16continued virginianpilot february 11 2000 17in dieselelectric submarine diesel engine using air drawn down from the surface through snorkel is used to generate electricity that is stored in batteries this stored electrical power is then drawn from the batteries to power the ship during submerged operations 18see for example lipscomb exit may have lessons for burke electric drive navy news undersea technology january 29 1990 2 19torque is the twisting power of the motor on the shaft measured in foot pounds of force an everyday analogue can be found in doorknobs stiff or heavy doorknob requires the hand and arm to generate more torque to operate than does light or loose doorknob for motors horsepower is the product of rpms times torque divided by 5252after world war ii mechanicaldrive technology continued to be improved and remained the dominant approach among warships electricdrive technology was widely adopted only for submarines where the dieselelectric power plant became the standard system because it permitted the submarine to propel itself submerged for limited periods of time on battery power without need for access to the atmosphere as source of oxygen for use in burning fossil fuel17 in the years after world war ii electricdrive technology was occasionally reexamined for use on ships other than smaller dieselelectric submarines the united states for example built two oneofakind nuclearpowered attack submarines to experiment with the technology the tullibee ssn597 which entered service in 1960 and was decommissio ned in 1988 and the glenard p lipscomb ssn685 which entered service in 1974 and was decommissioned in 1990 electric drive was also used in some large commercial ships such as the cruise ships normandie in 1936 and canberra in 1960 these periodic experiments however tended to confirm that electricdrive technology while promising was not competitive with modern mechanicaldrive technology for large submarine s and surface ships the tullibee and glenard p lipscomb for example were significantly slower than other navy attack submarines due to limits on the power of their electric motors and their drive systems were very maintenanceintensive18 the postworld war ii dominance of mechanical drive began to be challenged starting in the mid1970s when technological developments in motors and particularly motor drives made electric drive potentially more costeffective than mechanical drive for larger naval ships with regard to motors large warships require highhorsepower motors that are reliable powerdense ie compact shockresistant and quiet and that deliver their horsepower in the form of slow rpms suitable for slowly revolving ship propellers but high torque19 highhorsepower electric motors have existed for many years but they tend to be highrpmlowtorque machines rather than lowrpmhightorque machines in the 1980s moderatehorsepower lowrpmhightorque electric motors were developed but their horsepower was still not sufficient to move large warshipshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs24 20distortions in the electrical power that is delivered to the motor can lead to noise producing irregularities in the motors performance 21some electric motors are designed to use ac current others are designed to use dc current it was not practical to make conventional dc motors with ratings of more than about 10000 or 15000 horsepower that was large enough to power small nonnuclearpowered submarines where dc motors are widely used but not enough to power large surface ships at higher speeds electricdriveequipped surface ships thus tended to use ac motors 22for discussion see preston christopher novel electric drive for the rns type 23 asw frigates janes defence weekly september 7 1985 473 475 477at high speeds only in the last several years has development work progressed on highhorsepower lowrpmhightorque electric motors that are sufficiently power dense and quiet for use on surface combatants and submarines with regard to motor drives only within the last few years has it been possible to develop devices that could handle the high amounts of electrical power associated with highhorsepower motors and convert it efficiently into the kind of highquality ie almostdistortionfree power needed to ensure that an electric motor engineered to operate quietly will in fact operate quietly20 developments in the last couple of years in power electronics semiconductorbased electronic devices that are capable of handling large flows of power as opposed to the much smaller flows of energy handled by the semiconductor chips in computer have progressed to the point where it is now possible to build highcapaci ty motor drives that can operate efficiently and deliver veryhighquality power to highhorsepower electric motors the development of semiconductorbased powerconversion devices also made integrated electric drive possible because these devices can efficiently convert large amounts of electrical power into differing forms needed for propulsion and non propulsion uses electricdrive systems using ac motors21 control the speed of the motor by varying the frequency of the electric power fed from the motor drive this made the electrical power unsuitable for other electrical systems on the ship which require electric power at stable frequency as result older ac electric drive systems could be used only for ship propulsion and could not be integrated with other systems aboard the ship to produce an integrated electric drive in 1985 the united kingdom took advantage of these developments and began building new class of frigates known as the duke class or type 23 ships which employ combined dieselelectric and gas turbinemechanical drive propulsion plant the ships use lowerpower dieselelect ric drive system for quiet sonartowing operations at speeds of up to about 15 knots and gas turbinemec hanical drive system for higherspeed operations up to the ships maximum sustained speed of about 28 knots22 the first type 23 frigate entered service in 1990 and their drive systems have been favorably received the ships use much less fuel than comparably sized mechanicaldrive ships such as the us navys oliver hazard perry ffg7 class frigates have demonstrated high reliability and are very quiet compared to earlier ships when operating at lower speeds in 1987 the cruise ship queen elizabeth ii underwent an

the following is the executive summary of the navys march 1999 report to congress on prospects for common electric drive system for navy ships as reprinted on pages 9 and 10 of the april 12 1999 issue of inside the navy 49 the navy evaluated electric drive alternatives for future submarines surface combatants and aircraft carriers team of naval sea systems command technical experts studied the feasibility of common electric components for integrated power electric drive systems on dd21 cvn x and virginia class nssn variant and concluded the following common motor or multiples of common motor could accommodate the range of main engine horsepower and shaft speeds for surface combatants aircraft carriers and submarines generator commonality is limited to surface combatants and submarine s due to size and power requirement incompatibility between these platforms and aircraft carriers and common motor controller for all applications is not practicable however common subcomponen ts for all three applications is feasiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs35 for future aircraft carriers there will be need for an increased electric generation capacity for loads such as an electric catapult and recovery system future electrically powered weapons and countermeasures with this in mind the naval sea systems command has studied options for electric drive and increased electric generation capacity these studies concluded that while electric drive was feasible mechanical drive is more appropriate at this time for ship the size of an aircraft carrier electric drive did not offer space or weight savings over steam driven mechanical drive design with appropriatel sized turbine generators in addition the studies found that the most affordable method to achieve the objective of increased electric generating capacity was to use mechanical drive with larger turbine generators navy integrated power systems development program which demonstrates full size induction motor and other components for potential use in future surface ships is entering the fullscale system test phase this motor would not be appropriate for submarine use because it does not have the power density or acoustic performance needed for submarine applications the navy has done extensive work to assess the viability of superconducting direct current dc homopolar motors for electric drive however there are significant technical challenges associated with homopolar motors while come progress has been made in overcoming these challenges more work is required as result superconducting homopolar motors are not considered viable option for electric drive at this time the navy has concluded that the radialgap permanent magnet motor possesses the power density acoustic performance and maturity of technology to be viable propulsion motor common to the broadest range of ships we believe that this is now possible due to the recent advancements in technology which are being pursued by industry in developing propulsion motors based on permanent magnet motor technology the navy recognizes that common development program would benefit both future surface combatants and submarines such corporate program would allow the navy to maximize life cycle cost reductions while satisfying performance needs of the broadest range of platforms common technology presents an opportunity for common support structure such as personnel training and maintenance facilities navy corporate integrated power system development program will benefit future ships and allow horizontal integration of technology components and training across the broadest range of ships therefore the navy is currently considering an expansion of its integrated power systems development to corporate navy program including stateoftheart permanent magnet motor technology our plan includes an aggressive evaluation of the application of these technologies and the benefits associated for each type of platform including life cycle cost logistics and training reductions summary comparison of mechanical drive versus an integrated power system electric drive is provided in table

house armed services committee stated the following in reaction to the navys march 1999 report the committee notes the navys increased interest in the development of electric drive propulsion technology and the potential use of electric drive propulsion in future surface combatants and submarines including insertion of an electric drive propulsion system in the dd21 land attack destroyer and in the new attack submarine nssn programs common integrated electric drive system appears to offer significant advantages however implementation of such system has been limited by the technology needed for reliable electric motors of the power approximately 30000 to 50000 shaft horsepower shp required the committee is aware that several alternative electric propulsion motor concepts have been proposed that are of varying degrees of technical maturity the statement of managers accompanying the conference report on hr 4103 hrept 105746 directed the secretary of the navy to provide report to the congress which evaluates the installation of common integrated electric drive system for dd21 nssn variant and also evaluates designs for the next generation cvx aircraft carrier with both common integrated electric drive system and conventional mechanical drive system the secretarys report dated march 1 1999 states that the navy has concluded that the radialgap pm permanent magnet motor possesses the power density acoustic performance and maturity of technology to be viable propulsion motor common to the broadest ranges of ships and that the navy is currently considering expanding its ips integrated power systems development program to corporate navy program that will include stateoftheart permanent magnet motor technology the committee will consider recommendations by the secretary for further development and demonstration of electric drive propulsion technology for navy ships which identify necessary funding and provide program plan for development50 the senate armed services committee in its markup stated that the navys integrated power systems development effort is designed to explore technologies required to develop power systems that could provide innovative means of generating controlling distributing and using electricity in future ships propulsion motor development is central focus of these explorations by the navy and independently by commercial entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs38 51srept 10650 of may 17 1999 senate armed services committee report on s 1059 the fy2000 defense authorization bill p 232233a recent navy report entitled report to congress on navy common integrated electric drive systems addressed electric drive alternatives for future submarines surface combatants and aircraft carriers the study reached several conclusions to include 1 the radialgap permanent magnet motor has the power density acoustic performance and maturity of technology to be viable propulsion motor common to the broadest range of ships and 2 superconducting homopolar motors are not considered viable solution for electric drive at this time the committee believes that broad application is an important aspect of reducing life cycle costs to make the fleet of the future more affordable the committee understands that the navy is considering an expansion of the integrated power system program to include permanent magnet motor technology the committee encourages the navy to take this step however the committee also expects the navy to continue the technology base investment in superconducting alternatives as well despite the fact that these technologies will not be mature enough for immediate applications such as dd2151 issues for congress electricdrive presents several potential issues for congress that can be divided into two groups those relating to electricdrive technology in general and those relating to the potential application of electric drive to specific shipacquisition programs each of these is discussed below electric drive in general elect ric drive as technology area although electric drive is often discussed as specific system that could be available in the near future for the dd21 program many elements of electricdrive technology have the potential to evolve and improve over time this suggests that policymakers might consider addressing electric drive as not simply proposal for specific system that might require few nearerterm acquisition decisions but as broader technology area that might require longerterm management and oversight and series of research development and procurement decisions stretching over the course of several years given the many and in some cases competing possibilities for evolving and improving electricdrive technology over time conducting longerterm management and oversight of electric drive as technology area might be assisted by developing an electricdrive technology development roadmap or master plan extending perhaps 10 to 25 years into the future such roadmap updated periodically could help place nearerterm investment decisions regarding electricdrive technology in the context of potential longerterm opportunities risks benefits and implicatio ns in recent years congress has called for and dod has provided master plans or roadmaps in other naval technologydevelopment areas such as mine warfare and antisubmarine warfare that present multiple development opportunities stretching out over period of several yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs39 52an exception would be if decision were made to attempt to achieve significant further improvement in the quieting of mechanical drive technology such an effort could require significant additional research and development funding 53some sources disagreed stating that electricdrive would be roughly as expensive to procure as mechanicaldrive technology and perhaps couple of sources stated somewhat less expensivenearterm costs as noted in the background section pursuing electricdrive will incur higher nearterm costs than strategy that places continued emphasis on mechanicaldrive technology with regard to development costs mechanicaldrive propulsion for naval ships is very mature technology and would not necessarily require substantial amounts of additional research and development funding for future naval ships52 developing electricdrive technology for warships in contrast would require hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development funding in coming years particularly if the technology is developed for submarines as well as surface ships and if development of more advanced electricdrive technologies is pursued with regard to production costs several but not all sources for this report stated that electricdrive systems initially would be more expensive to procure than mechanicaldrive systems53 although there are precise figures information provided by some sources suggest the procurement cost of noncommercial navy developed electricdrive system might add few tens of millions of dollars to the total procurement cost of navy combat ship an additional cost of for example 15 million to 50 million would equate to an increase of about 2 percent to 6 percent in the procurement cost of surface combatant costing about 800 million the approximate target cost in fy2001 dollars of dd21 class landattack destroyer or about 1 percent to 3 percent in the procurement cost of an attack submarine costing about 2 billion the approximate current cost of virginia ssn774 class submarine the cost premium for commercial electricdrive system which as discussed below might be suitable for use in navy auxiliary ship could be less than that of navydeveloped system that is engineered to be more powerdense quiet and shockresistant these sources however agreed that the procurement cost of electricdrive systems would come down over time if more systems are procured and production economies of scale for electricdrive technology increase and as electricdrive technology continues to improve they also agreed that the higher initial costs of electricdrive systems both development and procurement would be more than offset over the longer run by reduced ship lifecycle operating and support costs measuring and assessing cost effectiveness several sources agreed that the costeffectiveness of electric drive should be examined not by focusing on the electric drive system or any of its components in isolation but rather by examining the effect that electric drive has on overall ship cost and capability focusing on the electric drive system or any of its components in isolation they stated could overlook certain effects of electric drive on total ship cost and capability and encourage optimization of the design at the system or subsystem level rather than the totalship levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs40 54castelli christopher j navy plans to study potential of electric drive for ships and subs inside the navy december 28 19981 10in view of the potential for electricdrive technology to be applied across multiple ship types and of the proposal for common electric drive system or common family of components it might also be said that the costeffectiveness of electric drive might best be measured not only in terms of its effect on the total costs and capabilities of individual ship designs but also in terms of its effect on total fleet costs and capabilities in this view just as it would be inappropriate to optimize the application of electric drive at the system or subsystem level so too it might be insufficient to assess the costeffectiveness of electric drive at the level of individual ship designs such an approach may obscure the advantages of certain strategies for applying electric drive on fleetwide basis in particular it is possible that an electricdrive system that results in suboptimal design for particular kind of ship may nevertheless enable more optimal application of electric drive across multiple ship types since some of the most important projected potential benefits of electric drive technology such as ship lifecycle fuel savings would accrue over many years any newly developed estimates of the costs and benefits of electricdrive technology should arguably include not just shorterterm issues such as initial research and development and procurement costs but also measures that examine longerterm ie lifecycle or total ownership costs and warfighting effects as well although electricdrive technology offers numerous potential cost and warfighting benefits for navy ships relatively few precise estimates are available on the magnitude of these benefits many of the available estimates moreover are singlepoint estimates that relate to the potential costs or benefits of particular electricdrive technology concept as applied to particular kind of ship under specific set of assumptions regarding ship service life and typical ship operating speeds the scarcity of estimates that are both precise and systematic rather than rough or singlepoint is currently providing ample room for firms involved in developing electricdrive technology to make wellintentioned but also selfinterested and sometimesconflicting presentations to policymakers on the technology if not redressed the scarcity of precise and systematic estimates will make it difficult for policymakers to assess with any precision the potential costeffectiveness of electric drive technology in general and probably more significant the relative cost effectiveness of differing technical approach to achieving electric drive incorporating it in the fleet and improving it over time as result policymakers would have more difficulty making decisions concerning electric drive particularly decisions relating to longerterm development of the technology following an initial application to the fleet more precise and systematic estimates may be produced by study on electric drive that is being done for the navy by the rand corporation and the center for naval analyses54 the navys interest in electricdrive technology is consistent with the decisions of commercial ship operators especially cruise ship operators and other navies inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs41 recent years to move to electricdrive technology for their own ships the commercial ship industrys shift from mechanical to electricdrive technology suggests that electric drive offers demonstrated advantages at least for large ships in areas such as reduced fuel costs increased payload space for cruise ship operators this can translate into additional passenger cabins or other revenuegenerating spaces and perhaps reduced propulsion plant noise the strong interest in electric drive by other navies particularly in europe and the reasons they have identified for pursuing the technology provide support for the argument that electric drive offers variety of warfighting and lifecycle cost advantages for naval ships the british navys interest in electric drive is particularly noteworthy not only because of the variety of ships that the united kingdom is considering to equip with electric drive but also because the british navy in the past has adopted or invented important naval technologies that were later adopted by the us navy the interest shown by other navies in electric drive however also demonstrates that there are multiple technical approaches that can be pursued for example both the 1998 nato report and the british navys development program highlight the transverseflux version of the permanent magnet motor as well as the radial gap ie radialflux version while permanent magnet motor efforts in the united states focus more exclusively on the radialgap version there are also actual or potential differences between the us and european approaches to other components of electric drive such as the shipwide electrical power distribution system thus while the interest shown by other navies in electric drive tends to support the us navys interest in pursuing the technology it also arguably underscores the need to carefully evaluate the relative merits of different technical approaches technical risk as noted in the background section incorporating electric drive rather than mechanicaldrive technology into navy shipacquisition programs could add technical or schedule risk to those programs since electricdrive technology is less mature than mechanicaldrive technology for application on naval ships the potential amount of technical or schedule risk varies depending on the exact configuration of the system in question more advanced approaches to electric drive eg those involving more advanced types of motors and motor drives present greater potential technical or schedule risk but also promise greater potential cost effectiveness in general electricdrive components presenting potential technical or schedule risk include among others motor drives which some sources identified as perhaps the foremost item of development risk motors whose development risk has been widely discussed generators if more advanced generator designs are pursued the electrical distribution system advanced propellerstern configurations if these are pursued and overall system design and integration issues to be addressed includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs42 demonstrating at full scale technologies that to date have been demonstrated at partial scale improving thermal performance ie preventing the overheating of increasingly powerdense components achieving desired levels of acoustic quieting and shock resistance and designing overall system interfaces controls and module specifications particularly for achieving system modularity and commonality and builtin potential for evolution and upgrades some of the risks involved in developing electricdrive technology have been mitigated by the successful development of electricdrive technology for commercial ships some industry sources argued that the amount of remaining risk involved in developing electric drive for navy use is low to moderate and that development of electric drive poses less risk than has been posed by other technologies that the navy has successfully developed other sources suggested that the degree of risk may be higher moderate or even potentially high risk in some respects particularly if the technology is developed on an aggressive ie compressed schedule the degree of technical risk involved in developing electric drive might be mitigated through more intensified research and development given the number of specific development possibilities that currently exist in electricdrive technology the amount of research and development funding that until recently has been programmed for the area and the potential cost and warfighting benefits of electric drive an argument can be made that electric drive technolo gy could be further elevated in priority as an element of the navys research and development account electric drive however is by means the only promising technology area for the navy if the department of the navys overall budget or its research and development budget remains relatively stable applying significantly more funding to research and development work on electric drive might come at the expense of other promising navy technology programs the potential implications for other navy programs of providing increased funding might underscore the need for developing an electricdrive technology investment roadmap and more precise and systematic measures of the potential costs and benefits of electric drive technology common system as noted earlier the navy stated in its march 1999 report to congress that developing common electricdrive components is feasible for several kinds of navy ships and that pursuing electric drive technology in the form of common family of components could have advantages for the navy the navy and the other military services have used the concept of commonality in numerous other equipmentacquisition programs over the years as means of satisfying operational requirements in the most efficient manner possible to cite just few key examples the navy has long had common guns missiles weapon launchers radars sonars computers communication systems and other electronic systems that are installed across variety of ship classes in the area of ship propulsion single type of nuclear reactor the s5w was once used to power various navy submarine classes and single type of gas turbine engine the lm2500 has been used as the prime mover for every class of major surface combatant that the navy has built since the 1970s as the navy has declined in size during the 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs43 55see for example schweizer roman requirements chiefs approve plan to focus common technology development inside the

achieving commonality of key equipment across ship classes as means of preservi ng economies of scale in equipment development procurement and lifecycle operation and support55 potential advantages of common electricdrive system or family of common components for application to both submarines and various surface ships include nearerterm cost savings due to streamlining of research and development costs ie avoidance of parallel development of differing electricdrive systems both nearer and longerterm savings due to greater efficiencies in procurement ie achieving maximum economies of scale in the production process by producing larger numbers of single system or family of components and longerterm savings due to the streamlining of fleet training operation and support efforts ie maintaining common training maintenance and logistical support systems for all navy ships equipped with the system56 the potential nearerterm savings are difficult to estimate due to the scarcity of precise and systematic cost estimates for researching and developing various potential technical approaches to electric drive on the basis of preliminary cost information provided by sources for this report however it appears that the savings could easily total in the millions of dollars and could depending on the potential scope of avoided parallel development efforts run into the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars the potential longterm savings of pursuing common system or family of components are similarly difficult to estimate due to both the relative scarcity of precise and systematic cost estimates for producing operating and supporting ships equipped with differing forms of electric drive and uncertainty concerning how many classes of ships might be equipped with the technology and when navy experience with other major acquisition programs however suggests that longerterm savings due to improve d economies of scale in production and the streamlining of training operation and support systems could be substantial the concept of developing common system or family of components poses at least two potential policy issues for the navy and congress one concerns the extent of commonality across electricdriveequipped navy ships the other concerns the use of competition in the development and procurement of electricdrive technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs44 extent of commonality the concept of developing common electricdrive system or family of components for all electricdrive equipped navy ships is sometimes posed tacitly if not explicitly as an alternative to developing different electric drive system for each kind of navy ship to be powered by electric drive these two approaches however are simply two options at opposite ends of spectrum of acquisition options that also includes mixed approaches that would combine elements of commonality with elements of shipspecific solutions one example of mixed approach would be to equip most types of ships with one kind of electric drive system while equipping one or more other types of ships with different kind another example would be to install certain components as common elements across the fleet while permitting other components to vary more fundamentally by ship type the navys march 1999 report appears to suggest that the second of these approaches may have merit should agreement be achieved to broadly pursue electric drive the goal for policymakers would be to optimize the costeffectiveness of electric drive as it is applied across the fleet past acquisition experience clearly suggests that designing unique electricdrive system for each kind of ship would not result in the most cost effective application of electric drive across the fleet past experience however does not prove conclusively that it would be achieved by an approach that would install common system or family of components on every kind of ship that is scheduled to be powered by electric drive just as there are numerous kinds of equipment in the navy that are installed in identical or nearidentical form on various classes of ships so too are there examples of equipment that differ significantly in design from one kind of ship to the next some cases of equipment differentia tion across ship types are likely due to either reduced emphasis in previous years on achieving the benefits of commonality or conscious decisions to continue operating nonconforming legacy systems on some ships because these systems would be expensive to replace other cases of equipment differentiation across ship types however might reflect judgment that maximally common approach was not the optimum solution on fleetwide basis in the case of ship propulsion equipment differentiation across the fleet in the past has resulted from differences across ship types in factors such as ship size mission or operational cycle from publicpolicy perspective commonality is not an end in itself but rather strategy that policymakers would consider as they sought the most costeffective path to apply electricdrive technology across the fleet in seeking this path policymakers might wish to assess the relative merits of both maxima lly common approach and more mixed approaches technologydevelopment roadmap or master plan and more precise and systematic estimates of the costs and benefits of various technical approaches to electric drive could keep the potential value of commonality in perspective and help policymakers identify the best overall path for the fleet competition if policymakers chose an acquisition strategy for electric drive featuring maximal or nearmaximal commonality across ship types second potential issue to consider would be the role of competition in the development and procurement of electricdrive technology pursuing common electricdrive systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs45 or family of components could in theory lead to the emergence of dominant or monopoly supplier to the navy of electricdrive technology components and systems such development could inhibit if not preclude the navy from using competition in the development and procurement of followon electricdrive technology in light of this possibility policymakers who place high value on the use of competition in defense development and procurement to secure benefits in restraining cost improving product quality encouraging adherence to scheduled delivery dates and promoting innovation might wish to consider measures aimed at ensuring that the navys acquisition strategy for electric drive makes maximum use of competition among industry approaches prior to selecting an approach that would form the basis for the common system they also might consider actions aimed at ensuring that nearerterm acquisition decisions including the selection of common system or family of components preserve as much as possible potential for employing competition in the eventual development and procurement of followon electricdrive technologies components and systems one possible approach for preserving potential for competition in followon development and acquisition in electric drive would be to require the common electric drive system to be designed to socalled open architecture set of nonproprietary and nonexclusive technical standards for key system characteristics that would permit firms other than those making the current system to compete on an equal footing with those making the current system for the development of followon technologies components or systems this approach is now being used in other defense acquisition programs particularly those involving electronic systems another possible approach not mutually exclusive with the previous one would be to provide some amount of support to firms other than those who supply the current electricdrive system to finance continued development of potential competing technologies or components that are currently considered less mature or more risky than those used in the current common system providing such support would reduce the research and development savings associated with pursuing common electric system or family of components but would help bring to maturity alternative technical approaches that could be more cost effective than those that can be pursued today financially supporting potential downstream competitors and competing technologies could maintain wider set of alternatives and some degree of competitive leverage for the federal government over the longer run as it sought to improve its electric drive technology in step with technological advancements motors much of the debate since 1998 over the application of electricdrive technology to us navy ships concerns the type of electric motor that should be used indeed within the overall debate over electricdrive technology perhaps one issue has been more contentious the issue is highly charged because specific motor types are associated with specific firms competing for part of the navys electricdrive program preference for certain motor type can thus lead to preference for the proposal of one firm or industry team over that of another as mentioned in the background section the electric motors associated with electricdrive systems for large ships can be divided into five basic categories httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs46 synchronous motors induction motors permanent magnet motors superconducting synchronous motors and superconducting homopolar motors each of these is discussed below synchronous motor of the basic motor types considered here the synchronous motor can be considered the most mature technologically in application to large ships it is the type currently used on most electricdriveequipped commercial ships particularly cruise ships where it has been used successfully for more than decade there is consensus among both naval and industry sources that the synchronous motor if scaled up to the higher horsepowe r ratings needed to move surface combatants and submarines at high speeds ie 30 knots would be too large and heavy to be suitable for use on these ships the synchronous motor in other words is considered insufficiently powerdense for application to these ships space and weight is critical design consideration in the design of submarine propulsion plants while space and weight considerations might be more relaxed in the design of surface combatants propulsion system highhorsepower synchronous motor is considered too large to fit into podded propeller the synchronous motor can be made somewhat smaller and more powerdense through the application of water cooling as opposed to air cooling this approach however appears to be receiving attention in industry efforts to develop electric drive technology for the us navy perhaps because the potential gain in power density is not deemed large enough to justify the effort the most likely apparent opportunity for incorporating electricdrive systems using synchronous motors into the navys electricdrive effort would be to install them in large navy auxiliary ships compared to surface combatants and submarines auxiliary ships are often designed for lower maximum speeds their internal space constraints may not be as great and their propulsion systems might not need to meet the same acousticquieting or shockresistance standards consequently it might be feasible to equip auxiliary ships with commercial electricdrive systems using moderatehorsepower synchronous motors that have already been developed for use on cruise ships using commercially available electricdrive system on an auxiliary navy ship would raise an issue concerning the extent of commonality of electricdrive technology on us navy ships equipping auxiliary ships with commercial systems using synchronous motors would differentiate them from navy ships using technology developed specifically for us navy use and thus reduce commonality in electric drive technology within the us fleet it would also however make these auxiliary ships common in their electricdrive technology to cruise ships and other commercial ships and permit them to take advantage of the economies of scale that exist for the production and lifecycle support for these systems thus recouping at least some and possibly much of the costrelated benefits that commonality within the navy would achieve in addition if future navy auxiliary ships are built to more commercial as opposed to us navy military standards of construction which is an option of growing interest to the navy it might be viewed as appropriate to equip these ships with commercial as opposed to military electricdrive technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs47 57the induction motor discussed here is sometimes called the advanced induction motor to distinguish it from earlier less sophisticated induction motorssince todays commercially available electric drive systems are made by european firms using commercially available electricdrive system on an auxiliary ship could raise an issue regarding use of foreignmade propulsion technology on us navy ship using europeanmade commercial electricdrive system on us navy ship might be viewed as acceptable in terms of contributing to broader two way useuropean trade in defenserelated systems policymakers however have traditionally been highly resistant to the idea of relying on foreignmade technology in the construction of us navy ships and many other major us military platforms and weapons in part on the grounds that it introduces risk that unforeseen developments in foreign country could delay or disrupt us shipbuilding program or complicate efforts to support these ships once they are in service particularly in time of crisis or conflict although usbased firms involved in electricdrive technology development so far have chosen not to develop competing systems engineered to commercial performance specifications commercial electricdrive systems in the future could still be built and supported in the united states either by us subsidiary of european firm or by us firm on license from european firm this could reduce any risk associated with using europeandeveloped commercial electricdrive system induction motor the induction motor is generally considered the secondmost mature motor type for application to large ships after the synchronous motor57 as discussed earlier it is the type of motor used in the navys landbased fullscale electricdrive demonstration system in philadelphia the induction motor can be made significantly more powerdense than the synchronous motor most of the sources consulted for this report argue or do not contest that it can be sufficiently powerdense to be suitable for use on us navy surface combatants by the same token however most sources including the us navy in its march 1999 report to congress also argue or do not contest that the induction motor is not sufficiently powerdense or quiet to be suitable for use on us navy submarines because the induction motor is generally considered more mature technologically at this point than the permanent magnet motor or superconducting motors using an electricdrive system with an induction motor might help mitigate the risk of integrating electricdrive technology into the dd21 program since the induction motor is not considered suitable for use on us navy submarines however using it on the dd21 would preclude achieving motor commonality across surface ships and submarines in the navys electricdrive program in addressing the commonality issue one potential issue for policymakers would be whether an electricdrive system for the dd21 using an induction motor could be designed so that it preserved commonality with submarines in components other than the motor another would be whether the dd21 system could be designed so thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs48 58costa keith j newport news electric boat to outfit test sub with electric drive inside the pentagon february 25 1999 15the induction motor could later be changed to permanent magnet or superconducting motor using the induction motor on the dd21 or other ships would similarly raise potential issue regarding use of foreigndeveloped technology since this motor has been developed by europeanbased firm alstom while us firms are focusing on developing permanent magnet and superconducting motors as noted earlier however alstom is the supplier of the induction motor and other components of the us navys landbased electricdrive demonstration system and has established us based subsidiaries in pittsburgh and philadelphia to support its electricdrive efforts for the us market permanent magnet motor the permanent magnet motor can be made quieter and significantly more powerdense than the induction motor enough so that it is consequently considered suitable for use on submarines as well as surface combatants as consequence the navy and other sources generally agree that the permanent magnet motor can be used in common electric drive system for navy surface ships and submarines as noted earlier the navys march 1999 report to congress focuses on the permanent magnet motor as the motor available in the nearer term that would be suitable for common electricdrive system both the 1998 nato report and the british navys current advanced electricdrive development effort similarly focus on the permanent magnet motor the permanent magnet motor is less mature technologically than the induction motor and consequently at this point may pose more development risk to incorporate into nearerterm shipacquisition program such as the dd21 destroyer in contrast to the induction motor version of which is being tested in fullscale form at the navys landbased test site the permanent magnet motor will be tested in quarter scale 6000horsepower form on lsv 2 largescale vehicle 2 also known as the cutthroat the navys approximately onequarter scale unmanned submarine for testing technologies for possible use on the virginiaclass submarine and other future submarines58 the navys decision to use permanent magnet motor as the propulsion system for this important test vehicle reflects certain amount of navy confidence in permanent magnet motor technology at least in quarterscale form sources differ regarding the amount of technical risk involved in scaling up the permanent magnet motor to full size firms involved in developing permanent magnet motor technology argue that the basic technological issues in permanent magnet motors have been resolved and that scaling up the technology will not pose any new issues other sources including firms involved in developing other types of motors demur arguing that scaling up is never riskfree key issue at this point is whether the permanent magnet motor will be sufficiently mature for timely incorporation into the lead ship in the dd21 class the navys decision announced in february 2000 to delay the procurement of the first dd21 by one year to fy2005 will other things held equal reduce the riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs49 59in permanent magnet motor the magnetic field that interacts with the electrical flow to create mechanical movement is created by permanent magnets that are built into the rotor the magnetic field thus continues to exist when electrical power to the motor is cut off on other motor types the magnetic field is created as product of electrical energy flowing through the motor and ceases to exist when power to the motor is cut offassociated with equipping the first dd21 with an electricdrive system using permanent magnet motor under the previous plan to procure the first dd21 in fy2004 most sources agreed that the time line for developing the permanent magnet motor for the lead ship would have been challenging the additional year relaxes the situation somewhat though much will still depend on the intensity of the development work that is conducted on the motor which will depend in part on the amount of funding applied to the work and on whether unforeseen issues arise in scaling up the technology if the permanent magnet motor is deemed not mature enough to install on the first dd21 then policymakers could face the issue of whether the later ships in the dd21 program should be built with the permanent magnet motor when it matures and whether earlier ships in the program built that are built with different kind of motor presumably an induction motor should be backfitted with the permanent magnet motor at some point during their life addressing these issues could involve weighing the potential benefits of maintaining electricdrive component commonality within the dd21 class against the potential benefits of commonality between the dd 21 class and other subsequent navy ship classes that are equipped with electric drive us as well as european firms are developing electric drive systems using permanent magnet motor technology the us navy can thus develop and procure an electricdrive system using permanent magnet motors without necessarily raising issues associated with use of foreignmade or foreigndeveloped technology as noted earlier both the 1998 nato report and the british navys development efforts focus to some degree on the transverseflux version of the permanent magnet motor as opposed to the radialgap version being developed by us firms this raises potential issue for congress as to the relative risks and merits of the transverseflux and radialgap versions and whether the us development efforts should include more work on the transverseflux version supporters of the transverseflux version believe it to be the most efficient design but some sources stated that it may pose greater development risks than the radialgap design some sources for this report particularly supporters of other motor types raised particular technical issue regarding permanent magnet motors that they argued poses an elevated danger in the event of an internal fault ie shortcircuit in the stator windings problem that can occur in an electrical motor the issue arises because it is not possible in permanent magnet motor as it is in other motor types to turn off the motors magnetic field59 this they argued creates the potential for permanent motor to act as generator in the event of an internal winding fault particularly if the fault occurs as the ship is moving through the water at some speedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs50 60electrical motors which convert electrical into mechanical energy can also if operated differently act in the reverse manner as generators that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy the sources argued that in the event of winding fault even when electrical power to the motor could be cut off the rotor would continue to spin for some time under its own momentum as the rotor with its permanent magnets continued to spin past the stator with its windings an electrical current would be created that could flow back into the winding fault causing additional heat and damage to the motor this scenario some sources argued would be particularly relevant if the ship were moving at some speed because the ships continued forward movement would cause the nowunpowered propeller to rotate as result of the ships forward movement through the water this rotation would be fed by the propeller shaft back into the motor causing the rotor to spin even longer than it would simply as result of its own momentum 61a crashback scenario is when the motor is commanded to go immediately from full ahead to full reverse in accomplishing this the system employs dynamic braking in which electrical energy is drained from the motor so as to produce reverse torque that helps bring the motor to stop 62see for example whitcomb clifford commercial superconducting technology for ship propulsion the submarine review april 2000 6273 kalsi s b gamble and d bushko hts synchronous motors for navy ship propulsion paper presented at naval continuedthis situation they argued would create flow of electrical energy that would be fed by the motor back into the fault exacerbating the damage caused by the fault60 supporters of the permanent magnet motor stated that they are well aware of this issue for most kinds of internal faults they stated it will not be necessary to turn off the magnetic field because these faults can be managed through the design of the motor and motor controller for one kind of fault turntoturn short they stated an ability to turn off the magnetic field could be useful but the permanent magnet motor can cope with this fault by stopping or slowing its rotation through use of the same dynamic braking action as would be employed in the first stage of crashback scenario61 in sum they argued that the issue of dealing with an internal fault while real can be addressed through careful system design and operation some sources for this report also argued that the longterm stability of the material used for the permanent magnets is not proven in largeship propulsion motors and could lead to reliability and maintenance issues over the lifecycle of the motor supporters of permanent magnet motors argued that permanentmagnet motors in industry use have proven themselves reliable over lengthy operating periods in other applications and that the careful motor design can make permanent magnet motors easier to maintain than existing electric motors superconducting synchronous motor the superconducting synchronous motor employs superconducting technology including cryogenic equipment to cool the superconducting wire down to the temperatures at which the wires become superconducting to achieve significantly stronger magnetic fields than non superconducting motors as result supporters of this motor type argue the superconducting synchronous motor if developed can be more powerdense and also quieter and more energyefficient than permanent magnet motor62

times november 3 1998 and spotts peter n electric power cables that just cant resist christian science monitor november 5 1998firm developing the superconducting synchronous motor american superconductor is doing so as part of broader effort to introduce hightemperature superconducting technology into the electrical power industry the superconducting synchronous motor is less mature technologically than the permanent magnet motor most sources argue or do not contest that it cannot be matured quickly enough to be installed at acceptable risk on the first dd21 advocates of the superconducting synchronous motor while not necessarily disagreeing with the navy about whether the technology would be ready for installation the first dd21 argue that the technology for this kind of motor has progressed in recent years more than others might realize and that the time needed to mature the technology may be less than others estimate one technical issue regarding the superconducting synchronous motor concerned the cost reliability and survivability of its cryogenic systems supporters argue that this issue has effectively been resolved through the advent of hightemperature superconducting materials as opposed to older lowertemperature superconducting materials and improved cryocoolers refrigeratorlike devices that have made it possible to achieve the necessary amount of cooling without the need for using expensive liquidhelium cooling systems some sources for this report raised second issue the possibility that the superconducting wire in these motors might degrade over long periods of motor use in response supporters of superconducting motors argue that superconducting wire has been extensively tested and that its durability is now being proven in the commercial electrical power industry63 the question is how quickly superconduct ing synchronous motor might be made ready for use how this would depend on the cost and intensity of the development effort that is undertaken and how the technology might consequently fit into longerrange strategy for incorporating electricdrive technology into navy ships the navy has initiated program to build and test 1000horsepower proof ofconcept superconducting synchronous motor according to american superconductor such motor can be built and tested by 2004 upon completion of this effort the company says fullscale 25000horsepowe r version could be developed and completed by 2009 making it possible to have the motor enter service with the fleet in 2012 two years after the first dd21 is scheduled to enter service and about the time that the first followon dd21s would enter service american superconductor says this estimated 10year motordevelopment effort would cost total of about 90 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs52 64the term homopolar ie unipolar refers to the fact that this motor uses direct current rather than alternating current electricity and does not require either reversal of current or electrical commutation as result the magnetic field and the electrical current in the armature of homopolar motor are constant over time and space ie unvarying 65for general discussion of the potential advantages of the homopolar motor and recent developments in homopolar motor technology see walters jd et reexamination of superconductive homopolar motors for propulsion naval engineers journal january 1998 107116superconducting homopolar motor64 the homopolar motor like the superconducting synchronous motor uses superconducting technology to achieve stronger magnetic fields than nonsuperconducting motors as result supporters argue this motor can be made more powerdense quieter and energyefficient than permanent magnet motor in addition supporters argue because the motor employs dc current rather than the ac current used by all the other motor types discussed here the homopolar motor permits the motor drive to be less complex and thus less expensive than the motor drives associated with the other motor types65 because of its potential advantages the navy worked on developing the homopolar motor for many years starting in the mid1970 s this effort has been continued in more recent years by general atomics the homopolar motor like the superconducting synchronous motor is less mature technologically than the permanent magnet motor in addition to the issue of the cryogenic system discussed above in connection with the superconducting synchronous motor the homopolar motor poses second development issue concerning the current collectors that transmit electrical power from the stationary parts of the motor to the rotating parts supporters of the homopolar motor state that solidmetal current collectors have been developed that are superior to the older liquidmetal current collector technology previously used in homopolar motors and that this development risk has consequentl already been substantially reduced others point out that these new solidmetal collectors have been tested only at smaller scales and need to proceed through largerscale testing third technical issue concerning homopolar motors concerns the need to transfer lowvoltage highcurrent electrical power the kind used by homopolar motors from the generator to the motor and the implications that this would have for the design of the electricdrive system work on this issue is progressing particularly in devising new designs for the motor that reduce the amount of low voltage current needed to operate the motor but these developments have not yet been tested at larger scales general atomics believes that quarterscale approximately 6000horsepower homopolar motor can be built and demonstrated at sea in about two and onehalf years at cost of about 15 million this motor supporters argue could be tested on the quarterscale lsv 2 submarine technology test vehicle designing building and testing fullscale ie 40000 horsepower homopolar motor

submarines see hollung achim pm generators for submarines naval forces special issue 2 1999 conference proceedings subcon 99 german submarine technology 4043the navys march 1999 report to congress on electricdri ve technology particularly its summary table can be read to suggest that superconducting motors are of limited nearterm relevance to the us navys electricdrive technology program because of their lessmature status such an interpretation which the authors of the report may not have intended may be too dismissive of superconductin g motor technology although superconducting motor technology appears likely to take longer to mature than permanent magnet technology it might if pursued prove suitable for use in common electricdrive system for use on navy surface ships and submarines the potential advantages of superconducting motors combined with their leastmature status among the motor technologies discussed here raises the issue discussed earlier of electricdrive technology posing longer as well as shorterterm issues for policymakers and of the potential need for technology development roadmap stretching several years into the future two additio nal comments in discussing the issue of motor types several sources offered two points that put the motor issue into additional perspective first they stated that the debate on motor types has led many discussions of electricdrive technology for the us navy to become excessively focused on the merits of competing motor designs as opposed to the more fundamental issue of the relative merits of mechanical vs electricdrive technology second they argued that an excessive focus on the merits of various motor types can obscure the issue that the motor is simply one component of an electricdrive system that contains several other major component s as well motor that might seem the best when viewed in isolation might not lead to the best overall electricdrive system because of its effects on other elements of the system design the goal they point out is to identify the best overall electricdrive system not simply the best motor other nonmotor components information provided by sources to this report indicates that there is considerable potential for evolution and improvement in the nonmotor elements of electricdrive technology this is potentially significant because with the partial exception of the motor drive there has been relatively little discussion of how these other components could or should evolve or be improved some sources suggested for example that developing newer and more compact ie lightweight generators would reduce total system weight and space requirements and make it easier to locate surface ships gas turbine engines and generators higher in the ship thus reducing the amount of internal ship volume occupied by the gas turbines large air intakes and exhaust ducts one of the potential architectural advantages of electric drive66 similarly there may be potential for developing motor controllers even more compact than the pulsewidth modulated controllers now being developed the ship wide power electrical distribution system can evolve and change in

configuration from the traditional arrangement horizontal shaft with propeller at the end to more advanced arrangement the potential to evolve and improve the other components of an electricdrive system poses potential issues for congress including the following how do these other components affect the overall costeffectiveness of an electricdrive system have sufficient attentio n and resources been directed to the development of these other components how should the potential for evolving these other components be factored into the design of the baseline electricdrive system for the dd21 application of electric drive to specific shipacquisition programs dd21 landattack destroyers67 given the navys january 2000 announcement that dd21 class ships will be equipped with an electricdrive system key followon issue for the program and for the navys overall electricdrive effort is what kind of electricdrive system the ship should employ this issue is highly significant because the choice of system type would likely amount to decision as to which firms would be involved in building the system given the possibility that the dd21s system might become the basis for common electricdrive system for the navy the economic stakes for competing firms are potentially very high68 the navys acquisition strategy for the dd21 program gives the two industry teams that are competing for the right to design the dd2169 wide latitude in determining the features of their proposed dd21 designs including the type of electricdrive system they will use this approach is consistent with navy and department of defense acquisition reform efforts the potential for the dd21s electricdrive system to become the basis of common electricdrive system together with the navys acquisition strategy for the program raises several potential issues for congress including the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs55 procurement schedule and risk does the navys new plan for procuring the first dd21 in fy2005 provide more than enough not enough or about the right amount of time for developing an electricdrive system for the first dd21 how does the schedule for procuring the first ship affect the risk associated with incorporating electric drive into the ship or the potential cost effectiveness of the system that is developed funding for development has the navy provided adequate funding in its overall dd21 development program for development of the ships electric drive system how is the amount of risk associated with developing electric drive technology affected by the amount of development funding dd21 procurement cost goal is the navys unit procurement cost goal for the dd21 750 million in fy1996 dollars for the fifth ship built at each of the two shipyards that will build the ship compatible with the objective of equipping the dd21 with an electricdrive system if equipping the dd21 with the most costeffective electricdrive system would result in ship design that would cost more than 750 million in fy1996 dollars should this situation be resolved by increasing the 750 million procurement cost goal by reducing the procurement cost of the ships propulsion system or by reducing the procurement cost of other parts of the ship if the procurement cost of the propulsion system is reduced how much less costeffective would the resulting propulsion system be and what effects might this have for the idea of using the dd21 electricdrive system as the basis for common system for the fleet system evolution given the potential for electricdrive technology to evolve and improve over time should the dd21 be designed so that parts of the system can be changed over time either in the construction process ie forward fitting for later ships in the program or during lifecycle overhaul and modernization ie backfitting for earlier ships in the program what effect might this have on the time and funding needed to develop the dd21s electricdrive system does the navys acquisition strategy adequately address this issue latitude for competing dd21 industry teams does the navys acquisition strategy give the two competing dd21 industry teams too much not enough or about the right amount of latitude in determining the features of the dd21 electric drive system potential for common fleetwide system has the navy structured the dd21 competition to take into account the possibility that the dd21 electric drive system might become the basis for common system for use by other navy surface ships and submarines does the dd21 competition require the two competing industry teams to select an electric drive system that would be suitable for wide array of navy ships do the electricdrive technologies being considered by the two industry teams include all those that might contribute to an optimal common navy electricdrive system if not what effect might this have on the navys downstream ability to achieve the most costeffective application of electricdrive on fleetwide basis if there is conflict between optimizing the dd21 electricdrive system and optimizinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs56 70questions regarding the relationship between the dd21 electricdrive system and potential electricdrive systems for us submarines were raised by representatives herb bateman and duncan hunter at june 27 2000 hearing on submarine force stucture and modernization issues held by the military procurement subcommittee of the house armed services committee for discussion see bohmfalk christian first electric

of this letter see text bateman letter on electric drive inside the navy july 3 2000a common electricdrive system for the fleet how should the navy resolve the issue70 if it is decided early in the dd21 development effort that the dd21 electric drive system will definitely become the basis for common electricdrive system for navy surface ships and submarines then there are grounds for arguing that the dd21 acquisition process should be structured so that consideration is given to optimizing the costeffectiveness of electricdrive technology for the fleet even if this adds costs to the dd21 program or results in an electricdrive system that is not fully optimized for the dd21 itself if however it remains uncertain during the dd21 development effort whether the dd21 system will form the basis for common system policymakers may face difficult decision in weighing the certain benefits of optimizing the costeffectiveness of the electricdrive system for the dd21 against the uncertain benefits of optimizing it for potential wider use in the fleet given the competing motor technologies now being pursued there are numerous potential strategies that can be pursued concerning the type of motor used in the dd 21 electricdrive system the table below shows variety of notional alternatives but is not an exhaustive listhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs57 table 4 selected notional

permanent magnet none permanent magnet permanent magnet none superconducting permanent magnet superconducting superconducting sources differed regarding the amount of technical risk associated with incorporating different versions of an electricdrive system into the first dd21 the lowestrisk option would appear to be system using an induction motor connected by traditional horizontal shaft at the stern of the ship to fixedpitch propeller although the navy does not consider the induction motor suitable for use on submarines other components of this system could possibly form the basis for common electricdrive system for the fleet this option could be pursued as part of longerterm acquisition and modernization strategy for the dd21 class in which later ships are built and earlier ships are possibly backfitted with permanent magnet or supercon ducting motor the potential costeffectiveness of such an approach would depend on how it would alter costs and capabilities for both dd21 class ships and if the system forms the basis of common fleetwide system subsequent classes of electricdriveequipped ships with some amount of added risk how much is not certain but not necessarily enough to make the dd21 program highrisk effort the lead ships system could include permanent magnet motor rather than an induction motor this option could lead to streamlined approach for achieving common electricdrive system under which all navy electricdrive systems use an permanent magnet motor in assessing this approach policymakers would need to balance the risk associated with equipping the first dd21 with permanent magnet motor against the savings associated with developing procuring and supporting only one type of motor for both the dd21 program and other classes of shipshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs58 71source litton industries press release june 14 2000 entitled dd 21 gold team selects newport news team for permanent magnet motor development the ingallsled

raises the issue of whether the baseline dd21 design should be developed so as to facilitate the later incorporation of more advanced propellerstern configuration on june 14 2000 ingalls shipbuilding

of an electric drive propulsion system and will incorporate the nnsled teams permanent magnet motor design into its initial system design proposal for the dd 2171 virginia ssn774 class submarines electricdrive technology in some form could be installed on followon virginiaclass submarines potentially on boat procured within the next several years depending on the configuration of the electric drive system and the intensity of the navys development effort72 navy officials testified in june 2000 that nearerterm electricdrive system could be ready for virginiaclass boat procured in fy201073 some industry sources suggested that it could be ready for boat procured in fy2007 if decision were made in the near term to pursue the option and adequate development funding was provided given electric drives potential for achieving substantial improvement in submari ne quieting key question for policymakers concerns the urgency of achieving such an improvement in light of current and projected antisubmarine warfare capabilities of potential adversaries how quickly might such an improvement need to be incorporated into the us submarine fleethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs59 74us navy internet page adcx baseline design version as of april 20 2000 available at http wwwnavseanavymiladcxviewadcxblhtml in addition to major improvement in quieting some industry sources have suggested and the navy did not disagree that electricdrive technology for submarines if pursued ambitiously has the potential for altering the stern of virginiaclass submarine in way that could reduce the procurement cost of the submarine currently 19 billion to 20 billion by as much as 100 million this is highly significant because the navy is seeking to increase the virginiaclass procurement rate in few years from the currently planned rate of 1 per year to 2 or more per year and any actions to reduce the procurement cost of the virginiaclass would make such an increase more affordable if the 100million figure above is roughly correct electricdrive technology would represent rare if not unique opportunity to make change in the design of the submarine that reduces its procurement costs by such large amount without reducing ship capability indeed in more than decade of searching for options for reducing submarine procurement costs crs has encountered other single design change for nuclearpowered submarine that could reduce procurement costs by such large amount without reducing ship capability although numerous design changes have been suggested for the virginiaclass design many of which have been or will be implemented most will reduce the cost of the virginiaclass design by much smaller amounts typically few or several million dollars pursuing electricdrive technology for submarines this ambitiously however would be very expensive it could easily require hundreds of millions of dollars or even more than billion dollars in research and development funding beyond the funding that the navy has already programmed for development of electricdrive technology as consequence even if the program succeeded in reducing the procurement cost of the virginiaclass design by 100 million it could be several years before savings in virginiaclass procurement costs fully recouped the upfront research and development costs of this development option if the reduction in unit procurement cost turned out to be something smaller for example 50 million instead of 100 million then the breakeven point would be even farther in the future even if the breakeven point were not reached until the procurement of the final units in the virginia class however the technology would continue to act as source of recurring savings on submarines procured following completion of virginia class procurement tadcx auxiliary dry cargo ships although often overlooked in discussions of electricdrive technology the navys planned tadc x class of auxiliary dry cargo ships the first of which was procured in fy2000 is nearterm candidate for electricdr ive propulsion the navy states the tadcxs propulsion plant will either be diesel with mechanical drive gas turbine with mechanical drive or electric drive74httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs60 75the navys notional performance characteristics for the tadcx call for maximum sustained speed of 20 to 26 knots us navy internet page adcx baseline design op cit speed of 20 knots would be comparable to the maximum sustained speeds of the ammunition and refrigerated stores ships that the tadcx is to replace 76source information provided to crs via telephone by ingalls shipbuilding the builder of lhd1 class ships july 24 2000as large slowerspeed 20 to 26knot75 noncombat ship now in procurement that is somewhat similar to commercial cargo ship it might be feasible and costeffective to equip the tadcx with currentlyavailable european commercial electricdrive system similar to those now being used for cruise ships system employing synchronous motor and possibly podded propeller this would raise at least two potential issues for policymakers would equipping the tadcx with commercial electric drive system using synchronous motor contribute to or detract from an effort to optimize the application of electricdrive technology to navy ships should the tadcx be equipped with european electricdrive system if that is the only kind of electricdrive system now available for the tadcx jccx joint command and control ships electric drive might similarly be candidate for the four joint command and control jccx ships that the navy plans to begin procuring in fy2004 the design of the jccx has yet to be determined but one possibility being considered is to build them to modified commercialship standards if so the jccx like the tadcx might be candidate for commercial electricdrive system the operational requirements of the jccx however might require an electric drive system with better quieting and shock resistance than commercial system in which case the ship might be candidate for more advanced military electricdrive system if so in light of the currently planned fy2004 date for procuring the first jccx one possibility might be to equip this ship with version of the electricdrive system that is developed for the dd21 the question is whether the fy2004 procurement date for the first jccx one year earlier than the procurement date for the first dd21 would permit this lha replacement ships lhd8 the first of the five lha replacement ships is to be built to modified version of the basic wasp lhd1 class design the modifications include among other things the use of hybrid propulsion plant consisting of lowpower electricdrive system for lowspeed operations and mechanicaldrive system for higherspeed operations the lowpower electricdrive system will employ 1000horsepower electric motors using electricity produced by the same diesel generators that produce electrical power for the rest of the ship the mechanicaldrive system will be powered gas turbine engines rather than the oilfired steam turbines used on lhds 1 through 7 during lowspeed operations the rpms produced by the ships electric motors will be transmitted to the propellers through the reduction gears of the ships mechanicaldrive system76 this hybridhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs61 77see the background section for

the lhx option more certainly could include full electricdrive system in the case of the furthermodifiedlhd option the issue for policymakers is how the benefits of incorporating full electric drive

while electric drive is feasible for future aircraft carriers mechanical drive would be more appropriate at this time meaning that mechanical drive would be more appropriate for cvnx1 the first of the navys planned class of nextgeneration aircraft carriers which is to be procured in fy2006 the navy report stated for ship the size of an aircraft carrier electric drive did not offer space or weight savings over steam driven mechanical drive design with appropriately sized turbine generators in addition the studies found that the most affordable method to achieve the objective of increased electric generating capacity was to use mechanical drive with larger turbine generators78 the navys conclusion contrasts with 1997 naval research advisory committee nrac report on the cvnx that strongly endorsed the idea equipping the cvnx with electricdrive technology79 although the navys march 1999 report reflects two years of additional information and study of the issue in light of the 1997 nrac study and the potential for electricdrive technology to evolve and improve policymakers may review the navys 1999 conclusion periodically eg with the procurement of each carrier to determine whether it remains validhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs62 80krull r d propulsion systems survey for the uscg deepwater surface platform stevensville md 1998 23 p report cgd1398 final report february

podded propulsors and ac electric drives are candidate technologies the report also notes the potential advantages of various options including electric drive for meeting certain mission requirements of deepwater cutter the second report provides general discussion of electric drive and potential advantages and disadvantages and description of the navys ips programcoast guard deepwater cutters the coast guard commissioned two studies both delivered in 1998 that examined various propulsion options including electric drive for cutters procured under the deepwater project these reports however did not come to any firm conclusions or recommendations regarding the kind of propulsion system that might be best suited for this ship80 in 1998 the navy and the coast guard issued joint policy statement setting forth new national fleet concept under which the two services would seek to coordinate their activities more closely in various areas including equipment procurement the document states as we enter the next millennium the navy and coast guard together must deploy forces with greater flexibility adaptability and affordability because of incompatible equipment mutual logistics support has proven difficult as has the ability to exchange near realtime intelligence and information as partners in maritime security our approach should stress commonality wherever appropriate from shipboard propulsion systems to aircraft components to training standards the national fleet has two main attributes first the fleet is comprised of surface combatants and major cutters that are affordable adaptable interoperable and with complementary capabilities second whenever appropriate the fleet is designed around common equipment and systems and includes coordinated operational planning training and logistics the navy and coast guard will work together to build national fleet of multimission surface combatants and cutters to maximize our effectiveness across all naval and maritime missions the navy and coast guard will coordinate surface ship planning information systems integration and research and development as well as expand joint concepts of operations logistics training exercises and deployments the coast guard and navy will work together tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs63 81national fleet joint navycoast guard policy statement washington 1998 september 21 1998 2 p emphasis added 82the 1998 nato report that endorsed electric drive as feasible and viable focused on notional design for 4000ton frigate ship potentially about the same size as the deepwater cutteracquire and maintain future ships that mutually support and complement each services roles and missions81 the national fleet concept with its emphasis on commonality raises potential issue for policymakers concerning the possibility of using electricdrive on the cutters that are to be procured under the deepwater project equipping these cutters with electricdrive could produce ship capability and lifecycle cost benefits for the coast guard similar to those that electricdrive technology will produce for the navy82 and potentially improve economies of scale for both the navy and coast guard in the production operation and lifecycle support of ship propulsion systems in assessing the feasibility of this notion one issue to address would be the size of the cutters propulsion plant the cutters to be procured under the deepwater project will likely be much smaller than the dd21 design the cutter might have full load displacement of less than 5000 tons while the dd21 might have displacement of about 12000 tons it is not clear that an electricdrive system designed for the dd21 or other large navy ships could be easily scaled down or otherwise modified to produce system suitable for cuttersized ship if the navys electricdrive system employs modular architecture in which smaller modules are combined to create system with the requisite power scaling the system down to size appropriate for coast guard cutter might be made easier if some elements of the system needed to be changed to make the system suitable for cutter policymakers would face an issue of whether the design and development costs for the changed components should be paid for by the coast guard the navy or some combination second issue concerns the schedule for the deepwater program under the coast guards plans the first deepwater cutter is to be procured in 2002 three years before the dd21 the three industry teams now competing for the deepwater project moreover have completed much of the initial work on their proposed deepwater cutter designs incorporating electricdrive into the first deepwater cutters might thus require restructuring the deepwater program to delay the start of cutter procurement and have the industry teams redo much of their initial design work this would delay the introduction of the new cutters into the coast guards fleet something the coast guard strongly wants to avoid given the advanced age limited capabilities and high operating costs of its current cutters it would also increase research and development costs for the deepwater project something the coast guard also strongly wants to avoid given the coast guards limited acquisition budget and an alreadysignificant challenge in identifying adequate funding for the deepwater project as currently conceivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs64 another approach would be to build the first few deepwater cutters as mechanicaldrive ships then build later cutters to modified design that incorporates electric drive this would resolve the issue concerning the coast guards desire to begin procuring cutters in 2002 but would still leave the issue of who should pay for any design and development work that would be needed to modify the navys electricdrive system to make it suitable for use in the coast guards new cutters in addition given the potential impact of electric drive on the overall design of ship the amount of ship redesign needed to optimize the application of electric drive to later ships in the program could be extensive and thus expensive redesigned ships might also be delivered later slowing the pace at which new cutters are introduced into coast guard service the alternative of simply incorporating electric drive into baseline deepwater cutter originally designed for mechanical drive would likely result in ship that does not achieve the full benefits of electric drive building later ships in the production run with electric drive would also create an issue regarding lack of propulsion equipment commonality among the coast guards new cutters this would add complexity and possibly cost to the coast guards strategy for lifecycle operation and support of the new cutters another issue that may arise concerns the composition of the industry teams that are competing for the deepwater and dd21 programs the teams competing for these two programs contain differing combinations of firms which may make it difficult to transfer electricdrive technology from the dd21 program to the deepwater project without compromising firewalls that are intended to prevent transmission of competitionsensitive information between teams competing for the same program in addition one source suggested that the idea of incorporating electric drive into the deepwater cutters could itself add political uncertainty to the deepwater project reducing industry confidence in the program potential questions for policymakers include the following how necessary is it to procure the first deepwater cutter in 2002 if procurement were delayed to 2005 how would this affect coast guard fleet capabilities and operational costs what would be the effect on the deepwater project how do the potential shipcapability benefits of incorporating electricdrive into deepwater cutters compare with the benefits of incorporating it into navy surface combatant like the dd21 how do the potential savings of incorporating electricdrive technology into the new cutters from reduced lifecycle operating costs and commonality with the navy in the production operation and support of ship propulsion equipment compare with the potentia l additional costs of this option for design and development work and potentially due to loss of commonality in propulsion equipment across all the new cutters that are procuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30622crs65 how significant factor should the principles set forth in the navycoast guard national fleet policy stateme nt be in considering the issue of the new cutters propulsion equipment
