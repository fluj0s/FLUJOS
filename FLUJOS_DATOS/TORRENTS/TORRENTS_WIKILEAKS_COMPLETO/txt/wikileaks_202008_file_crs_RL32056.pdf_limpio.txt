christopher bolkcom coordinator specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056the air force kc767 tanker lease proposal key issues for congress summary the air force wishes to replace its kc135e aircraft by leasing 100 new boeing kc767 tankers the air fo rce indicates that leasing is preferred because it will result in faster deliveries than outright purchasing air force leaders argue that lease will allow them to husband scarce procurement dollars by making small down payment although congress authorized the proposed leas in the fy2002 dod appropriations act it stipulated that the defense oversight committees must approve the lease only the senate armed services committee has yet to approve the lease proposal has been contr oversial and issues raised thus far include whether there is an urgent need to replace the kc135 fleet the air force states that replacing the kc135 is urgent citing high costs aircraft vulnerab ility to catastrophic problems and the imminen t closing of the 767 production line opponents of the lease state th at operating costs are contro llable and will be far lower than the overall costs of leasing the 767 that the vulnerability is more than depicted in 2year old study which th air force found acceptable and that the 767 production line is viable until 20062008 whether the kc767 is the right airplane if acquired the kc767 may be in dods inventory for 50 years the air fo rce says that the kc767 is much more capable than the kc135 opponents say that other aircraft are even better than the kc767 in meeting the air forces requireme nts the air force opposes reengining kc135es but opponents say it merits atten tion as does outsourcing aerial refueling whether the air force cost comparison is authoritative the air forces report to congress calculates that 767 lease w ould cost 150 million more than purchase on net present value basis this cal culation however is sensitive to many assumptions crs analysis shows that several assumptions built into the calculation if treated differently than in the air force report could change the calculation by hundreds of millions of dollars each alt hough some could change the calculation to favor either the lease or the purchase others such as the discount rate used to calculate net present value and whether to use multiyear procurement for the purchase option could be more likely to lter the comparison more in favor of the purchase option whether this lease has implications for congressional budget oversight the proposed lease appears to be an unpr ecedented method of funding major new defense procurement critics point out that this approach is coupled with exemptions from longstanding laws on budgeting and fense procurement the proposed lease raises policy issues regarding the visibility of full costs for dod programs in the congressional oversight process including questions concerning locking in budgetary resources when costs are uncertain appropr iateness of using an operating lease for this proposal the impact of special pur pose entity and the potential for deviation from fullfunding of the govern ments contractual liability this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056contents introduction and background 1 introduction 1 background 2 i s s u s f r c n g r s s 1 0 is there an

introductory overview of the subjectthe air force kc767 tanker lease proposal key issues for congress introduction and background introduction by christopher bolkcom and ronald orourke 7072577 and 7077610 the air force is proposing to replace 133 of its oldest boeing kc135e aerial refueling tanker aircraft by leasing 100 new boeing kc767 tankers instead of initially buying them outright1 the proposed lease was authorized by section 8159 of the fy2002 dod appropriations act p l 107117 of january 10 2002 the lease if implemented would represent si gnificant shift away from previous air force plans to modernize its tanker fleet and significant departure from normal dod procedures for major dod ai rcraft acquisition programs the main issue for congress is whethe r to approve or disapprove the lease congresss decision on this lease could si gnificantly affect dod aerial refueling capabilities air force funding requirements and the us defe nse industr ial base congresss decision could also set preceden ts for dod acquisition practices and have significant implications for future oversight of dod acquisition programs this report examines the lease proposal and its ramifications by providing background information on the air forces tanker fleet the boeing 767 tanker and the proposed lease itself then the report analyzes the following potential oversight issues for congress relating to th merits of the proposed lease is there an urgent need to replace the oldest kc135s if so is the kc767 the best replacement aircraft are there industrial base concerns how the does cost of acquiring 100 kc 767 tankers through lease compare to the cost of acquiring them thr ough purchase ie procurement what potential implications might implementing the lease have for

only particular question can read the section on that question background by christopher bolkcom and ronald orourke 7072577 and 7077610 air forces draft tanker roadmap the air forces tanker fleet currently consists of 544 aging kc135e tankers nd 59 somewhat newer kc10 tankers the air forces draft tanker roadmap of june 18 2003 its draft plan for managing and modernizing the tanker fleet proposes to begin recapitalizing ie replacing the fleet by leasing 100 new boeing 767 aircraft that have b een converted into tankers the leased 767 tankers would be used to replace tanker capability now provided by the 133 oldest kc135es in the fleet th lease on the first group of 767s would begin in late fy2006 the draft roadmap also calls for retiring 58 kc135s in fy2004fy2005 and another 68 in fy2006fy2008 and using the re sulting savings to help finance the lease third component of the draf t roadmap calls for conducting new tanker requirements study and an analysis of alternatives aoa to determine future requirements for the tanker fleet and the tanker characteristics best suited to replace the remaining aircraft in the tanker fleet the june 18 2003 draft roadmap appears to depart from longstanding air force plans for the tanker fleet whic h called for conducting an aoa prior to acquiring any new tanker aircraft and fo r beginning recapitalization in the 2012 time frame rather than in fy20062 the most recent tanker requirements study found that by the year 2005 the air force would need 500 to 600 kc135r tankers or their equivalent to meet the tanker needs of the national military strategy the air force study concluded that the current tanker fl eet cannot satisfy this requirement because portion of the fleet is always in main tenance and is ther efore not operational kc135 cost and availability the economic service life study esls the air forces most comprehens ive study of the kc135 fleet is the kc 135 economic service life study february 2001 which serves as the most appropriate baseline and point of departure for cons idering the urgency of kc135 recapitalization the economic service life study esls made cost and availability forecasts for the kc135 fleet for the years 2001 through 2040 it was conducted by team of experts from thr oughout the air force and led by the air mobility command amc regarding cost the esls found that the kc135 fleet would incur significant cost increas between 2001 and 2040 but economic crisis is on the horizon there appears to be runaway costgrowth and the fleet is structurally viable to 2040 see figure 1 following

declining from high point of approximately 330 in 2004 to only 190 in 2040 the esls predicted that the actual future trend would be somewhere between the upper bound 349 and the most likely trend

support for leasing 100 767s and ex plained the air forces rationale for the proposal we have unique business opportunity to ge t the best pricing possible to address our critical need for multimission aircraft that can carry gas and also do all kinds of other things this is not bail out but taking advantage of buyers market7 the proposed 767 tanker lease basic elements of the lease under the proposed 767 lease the air force would lease each of the 100 767s for period of 6 years the 100 aircraft would be leased in 6 groups the leas for the first group of four aircraft would begin in late fy2006 and extend to late fy2012 the l ease for the next group of 16 aircraft would begin at the start of fy2007 and ex tend to the end of fy2012 the remaining 80 aircraft would be divided into 4 groups of 20 whose leases would begin at the start of fy2008 fy2009 fy2010 and fy2011 respectively and extend to the end of fy2014 fy2015 fy2016 and fy2017 respectively figure 3 below

available for sixyear lease from the time of delivery total lease program cost includes annual lease payments and all support costs but not purchase of aircraft if th at the end of the leases the air force purchases all 100 aircraft the total pr ogram cost would be 298 billion or about 44 billion more if the air force does not buy the aircraft wilmington trust would sell the aircraft to pay off the bondholders if the air force sells the planes for more than needed to pay off bondholders the air force would receive rebate estimated at 800 million under the air force plan aircraft would be delivered between 2006 and 2011 on the following schedule 4 16 20 20 20 20 since each aircraft is to be leased for sixyear period the num ber of aircraft leased grows to 100 by fy2011 when all aircraft are delivered and then declines to zero once all leases are completed to continue to retain th full fleet of new aircraft the air force would need to begin buying the planes starting in 2012 source crs calculations based on air force business case analysis model leasereturn option july 1 2003 boeing would begin building each group of aircraft 3 years prior to the start of the lease for each group to finance the 3 year construction effort for each group of aircraft boeing would draw down on bank line of credit ie bank loan upon completing construction of each group of airc raft boeing would sell the aircraft to special nonprofit entity established speci fically for the 767 lease this entity referred to as special purpose entity spe or variable interest entity vie and named

onequarter of typical commercial usage rates 10discussion above based on air force briefi ng to crs kc767a report to congress status brief july 15 2003 and boeing brie fing usaf kc767a tanker july 24 2004and the air force the spe would purch ase the 767s from boeing using funds that the spe would raise by issuing bonds on th commercial bond market ie funds that private investors would agree to loan to the spe in exchange for promise from the spe to eventually repay those funds with certain amount of interest the spe would then lease the 767s to the air force using lease payments that are calculated to cover but not exceed the spes costs which would include the purchase cost of the 767s an average of 1384 million in fy2002 dollars per plane including 74 million in interest costs on boeings construction loans the interest return promised to the bondholders and the spes minor administrative expenses the spe plans to offer three tranches of bonds each secured by different assets and each reflecting different ri sks the g tranche timated to make up about one third of the total lease cost will be secured by the air forces lease payments because the air force is contractually liabl for an additional years worth of lease payments in case of termination these are essentially lowrisk bonds for that reason the air force is projecting that ra tes will be about 1 2 point above the projected treasury bill rates from 2006 to 20118 the second tranche of bonds the bonds covering about half of the borrowing would be secured by the value of the aircraft itself and would be the second claimant in case of termination the air force is projecting that those bonds would also be relatively low risk and hence would require an in terest rate 1 above the projected treasury rate in each ear from 2006 to 2011 although it could well be difficult to sell the aircraft for their full value some would argue that the likelihood that the air force would renege would be low because under the contract they would face large unbudgeted terminati on liabilities that could be as high as 27 billion in current year dollars at the highpoi nt of lease payments in addition the air force sees compelling need to maintain the size of the tanker fleet the third tranche of bonds the b bonds to cover about 15 of the total cost of the lease would be backed by the potential sale of the aircraft to the air force at the end of the lease this tranche of bonds is more risky proposition because purchase requires congressiona l approval and an add itional 44 billion in current year dollars in funding however purchas is an attractive option because the air force would already have paid 90 of the cost of the aircraft in its lease payments additionally the aircraft would only have b een used for onequarter or less of their normal service lives9 to reflect potential risks the air force projects that 10 interest rate compounded to the end of each lease would be required to attract bondholders10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs8 principal purpose of the spe is to relie ve boeing of the need to lease the 767s directly to the air force if boeing were to lease the 767s directly to the air force boeing would have to retain owners hip of the 767s and would pay off its construction loans gradually using proceeds from the lease payments this would require boeing to carry significant am ount of constructionrelated debt for an extended period of time which might significantly weaken boeings financial condition upon the conclusion of the 6year leas period for each group of 767s the air force would have the option of either retu rning the 767s to the spe or purchasing the 767s for an additional payment of 44 million in current year dollars per plane enabling legislation and report language the authority for the air force to lease 100 767 tankers and also 4 boeing 737 transport aircraft was provided in the following legislation section 8159 of the fy2 002

107248 of october 23 2002 section 308 of the fy2002 supplemental together these provisions provide author ity for lease that departs from normal procedures for major dod acquisition programs by specifying that particular acquisition method can be used ie lease of commercial asset which would make it an operating rather than capital lease or procurement specifying the number and type of aircra ft to be leased 100 boeing 767s and 4 boeing 737s exempting the lease from requirements and limitations that normally governdod leases of ships and aircraft wh ich are established in 10 usc

whereapproval would be either through authorization nd appropriation language or through new start notification to be approved by the four congressional defense committees at any time it should be noted that section 8159 is not the first provision permitting dod to lease aircraft the fy2000 defense appropriations act pl 10679 enacted on october 25 1999 contained provision sec tion 8133 somewhat similar to section 8159 that permitted the air force to leas six aircraft for operational support purposes including transportation of the co mbatant commanders in chief ie thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs9 top us officers in charge of us military forces operating in various regions of the world section 133 of the fy2003 defense aut horization act pl 107314 of december 2 2002 states that the air force may not enter into lease for the acquisition of tanker aircraft under section 8159 of pl 107117 until authorization and appropriation of funds nece ssary to enter into the lease are provided by law or until dod submits to and the four congressiona l defense committees approve new start reprogramming notification for the l ease in accordance with established reprogramming procedures this is an unusual if not unprecedented way to approve major procurement program since repr ogramming or transfers of funds between appropriations are generally used for nor adjustments to ongoing programs status of congressiona l approval process section 8159 of pl 107 117 states that the air force may not ente r into the lease until it submits report to the congressional defense committees the house and senate armed services committees and the house and senate appropriations committees on its plans for implementing the lease and until period of not less than 30 calendar days has elapsed after submitting the report the practical effect of this provision is to prevent the lease from being implemented until the four congressional defense committees have signaled their approval of the lease on july 10 2003 the air force submitte d the report required by section 8159 of pl 107117 to the four defense overs ight committees the 7page report plus 1page

accounting office the air force does not make the case that leasing is cheaper instead the real main argument for the proposal is that theres an urgent need to begin replacing the current tanker fleetissues for congress for congressional policymakers the rits of the decision to approve or disapprove the kc767 lease re late in part to examining the following questions is there an urgent need to replace the oldest kc135s is the kc767 the best aircraft for the job what are the industrial base concerns given the uncertainties involved in th is unusual acquisition mechanism are the costs projected by the air force the most authoritative what potential long term implications does this lease present in terms of budget and congressional oversight is there an urgent need to replace the kc135 by christopher bolkcom 7072577 much of the air forces argument for leasing 100 kc767s is based on its assessment that it has an urgent need to replace the oldest kc 135s that operations and support costs are too high that mission availability is too low that the aircraft is wearing out prematurely due to high ope rations tempo and that it is vulnerable to catastrophic problems11 the air force argues that leasing the kc767 will result in faster deliveries under the air forces selfimposed funding limits than will purchasing them which may be important if the need to recapitalize is urgent key judgement for policy makers is whether the need to replace the kc135e fleet is urgent enough to justify the leasing procedure if the need is urgent then the higher costs of leasing rather than purchasing new aircraft may be justified if the need is not so urgent then it may be more prudent to delay any action on new aircraft in this case critics of the lease point out that an analysis of alternatives aoa could be performed over the next few years to more accurately determine what joint aerial refueling requirements may be prior to embarking on tanker recapitalization recently air

september 11 2001 usage rates have and tanker requirements likely will increase in the new security environment each of these issues will be addressed in the sections below new findings on kc135 costs air force and dod officials argue that recent estimates of kc 135 costs have been higher and future costs will also be higher than the esls projected they say that the esls study was extremely optimistic12 especially in its assumptions and projections on key operation and support cost drivers for example depot labor rates have increased much more quickly than anticipated from 111 per hour in 2001 to 160 per hour in 2002 and 210 per hour forecast for 2003 the cost of repairing the engine struts on the kc135es increased from 1 million per airc raft in 2001 to 3 million per aircraft in 200213 the effect of the optimistic projections contained in the esls study becomes evident dod officials argue by compar ing esls projected 2001 costs to actual 2001 costs while the esls projected 2001 costs to be 21 billion the air force actually spent 226 billion an increase over esls estimates by 250 million or 119 percent revised air force projec tions now assume that the annual kc135 costs

rather than the esls one percent estimate the air force has provided analysis or proof that the increased costs in curred in 2001 arent onetime anomaly opponents argue and thus the esls cost projections to 2040 are still the most authoritative the increased costs for 2001 lease opponents argue are likely caused by the considerable efforts the air fo rce made to fix the kc135 depot see

force claim that the esls study was optimistic on the c ontrary they say the esls took conservative approach in its projections of future kc135 costs for example the esls airframe cost estimates the largest cost drivers in figure 1 above are made up of programmed depot main tenance major structural repairs and structural investments the esls identified two structural investments that were needed kc135e struts 1 million per aircraft and topcoat removal 500000 per aircraft recognizing the uncertainty of predicting future repairs the esls estimates included 6 million per aircraft of notiona l repairs that may not in fact ever be needed upper wing skins 2 million per aircraft fuselage skins 2 million per aircraft and unknown structures 2 llion per aircraft also while some costs notably programmed depot maintenance or pdm have gone up others have gone down or have been eliminated depot engineers for example have learned how to save 500000 per aircraft by conducting periodic in

air force officials argue that as aircraft age the oldest kc135s mission capable rates m cr will decline and that the aircraft spends too much time in maintenance depots these two factors will combine to reduce the number of available aircraft to unacceptably low levels the air force needs they argue to recapitalize the kc 135 fleet with new aircraft that will satisfy mission availability requirements the air force has goal of an 85 percent mission capable rate mcr for tanker aircraft the mcr is the percent of time that an aircraft is available to perform its assigned mission making judgements on the adequacy of kc135 mcr is complicated because the mcr appears highly dependent on the time period considered and whether the aircraft is in the active or reserve component air force officials have testified that over the last five years kc135rs have averaged 78 percent mcr and the kc 135es 719 percent mcr well below the 85 percent goal19 this testimony appears to roug hly correlate with 2002 air force study that showed activ duty kc135rs with an mcr above 80 percent for fy1997 1998 1999 2001 and 2002 the active duty r models mcrs fell slightly below 80 percent in 2000

of the gao and air force studi some debate has focused on the time or duration of mcr estimates and the impact that these factors might have on the applicability of estimating over the long term for example the air force has discounted some gao mcr estimates noting th at they were for short time periods and that even aircraft with low mcrs can have spikes of higher availability the kc135s performance during operation iraqi freedom is an example of this phenomenon kc767 lease supporters say the kc135s 864 percent mcr during this conflict has not been sustained over the long term lease supporters argue lease opponents would agree that short term mcrs might not be the most reliable of an aircrafts long term mcr but lease opponents argue when the chips were down the kc135 fleet did achieve and actually exceeded mcr goals also the kc135s 864 mcr was higher than th mcrs for many other aircraft that participated in the iraq war a10 b1b b2 b52 e3b e8c f117 f15 all models f16 all

the case for the 13 other aircraft types that had lower mcrs than the kc135 this comparison shows opponents argue that kc135 availab ility can be on par with if not superior to other aircraft and claims about low m cr are not compelling reason to retire the fleet prematurely the mcr is only calculated for those ai rcraft not otherwis unavailable due to depot maintenance or trai ning requirements few kc135rs and kc135es are used for training therefore the number of aircraft in depot and the amount of time they spend there are also important factors that affect aircraft availability the kc135s maintenance history is well established as the aircraft has aged and as agerelated problems have become more acute it has taken more effort to complete scheduled maintenance called programmed depot maintenance pdm the kc135s maintenance problems app eared at their worst in 1999 when 176 aircraft 32 percent of the fleet were in depot at the same time it was at this point both the air force and kc767 lease opponents agree that the air force had to make concerted effort to improve depot mainte nance and processes according to one air force study the chief of staff of the air force directed his staff and the air force mobility command to fix the depot24 the result was marked improvement in aircraft availability from fy2001 to fy2003 by some estimates kc135s are

the material s and manufacturing techniques used to produce this aircraft in the 1950s did not reflect modern corrosion prevention techniques the air force ca nnot accurately predict the extent or cost of corrosion air force officials now say and currently lacks mature diagnostic tools that could help safely and economically ex tend the life of the kc135 fleet32 because of corrosions unpredictability the air force is concerned that it has little idea if when or how badly the next big corrosion problem will appear air force officials say they have recently experienced wake up call

confidence in the right now34 lease opponents do not dispute the fact th at the kc135 is old or that is has corrosion problems they take issue however with the air forces depiction of the problem the kc135 fleet clearly suffers from corrosion and this causes noteworthy maintenance problems however leas opponents say the air force makes observations about corrosion that appear out of sync with the

grounding of the tanker fleet many note that by having 90 percent of its refu eling fleet in one aircraft type the air force for some years now has been accepting the risk of fleetwide problems that could ground the entire fleet38 if the air force has been living with this risk for many years why lease opponents ask s concern only been voiced recently the air force claims that the ptember

contributing to the urgency of replacing the kc 135 fleet is the unanticipated increase in kc135 flying hours relatedly the defense department revised its military strategy in light of post september

hours for the kc135s averaged about 300 hours per year between 1995 and september 2001 since then according to th gao employment is averaging about 435 hours per year42 this unanticipated use kc767 lease proponents say is wearing out the 42 year old aircraft even faster than anticipated just 3 years ago lease opponents recognize the upturn in flight hours but challenge that the consequences are as negative as the ai r force contends corrosion lease opponents point out is the limiting problem with th kc135 and increased use does not make corrosion worse if the kc135s limiting fact ors were flying hours or metal fatigue for example the increase in flying hours could have notewor thy detrimental impact on the kc135s remaining life increased flying hours however have less impact on the

major conflicts and 4 upon the presidents direction win decisively against one of the two major conflict adversaries according to air force documents the new strategy coupled with antiaccessarea

fleet as soon as possible those skeptical of the kc 767 lease challenge the air force assertion that the new strategy will automatica lly result in increased tanki ng requirements opponents challenge this assumption first because the air force has not conducted tanker requirements study since the new strategy has been declared when asked how the air force could be so sure of its future re quirements considering the lack of analysis one air force official replied because were convinced that the requireme nt for air refueling is large and will continue to be very large as we talked just moment ago the requirement is growing actually although i cant give you specific number right here for how much its grown based on the new defense planning guidance yet but we know its growing we know its goin g to continue to be very large44 lease opponents agree that conventional wisdom suggests that the new military strategy could demand increased tanker capabilities however they say conventional wisdom is ofte n wrong determining futu re tanker capabilities is very complex and really requires serious anal ysis the air force does not know what its requirements are going to be 10 20 30 or 40 years hence and it certainly does not know what future navy or marine corps tanker requirements will be what will be opponents ask the net effect on tanking of more aggressive and pervasive fielding of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs will these more fuel efficient platforms reduce requirements as they replace manned aircraft in the inventory or will uavs continue to augment rather than repl ace manned aircraft and thus add to tanker requirements many suggest that air sh ips blimps and unma nned tethered balloons aerostats will likely replace awacs for variety of surveillance missions in the future such as homeland defense if this transition occurs and when may have implications for future tanker requirements lease opponents also note that dramatic

in lieu of the 68 kc135es lease opponents ask premature retirement of 68 kc135es they say reduces the strength of the air forces argument that recapitalization is required to satisfy growing tanker requirements air force officials recognize that on one level retiring 68 kc135es can appear inconsistent with the stated concern over increasin g tanker requirements also air force studies such as th

recapitalization problem and the kc767 airframe as the most effective way to improve aerial refueling capabilities it is important to understand how well kc 767 attributes match air force needs because if leased and then purchased th 100 aircraft could likely be in the inventory for at least 50 years also many believe that if the air force is successful in leasing and purchasing these 100 aircraft it will attempt to lease andor purchase some additional number of kc 767s perhaps up to another 10048 former defense acquisition chief pete aldridge for exampl was reported to have said that

its modernity the kc767 only carries 1 percent more fuel 2000 lbs than the kc135 the kc767s cargo and aeromedical capabilities for ex ample are second order issues for consideration lease opponents

the kc767 represents almost negligible improveme nt over the kc135 another more meaningful evaluation of the kc767s performance is how it compares to air force requirements air force aerial refueling requirements are expressed in the operational requirements document ord hq amcxpr october 22 2002 lease opponents say th at the kc767 while looking good compared to the kc135 does not measure up in many important areas to the ord yardstick the ord requires for exampl that the kc135s replacem ent be able to refuel two aircraft simultaneously with the hos eanddrogue system the kc767 variant being considered in this lease cannot satisfy this requirement it can only refuel one aircraft at time with the hoseanddr ogue which considerably reduces opponents say its operational capabilities another kc767 shortcomin g opponents say is the aircrafts inability to offload multiple types of fuel on the sa mission the ord lists this objective because it would greatly enhance the aircraft s ability to simultaneously fuel both air force and navy and marine corps aircraft both services aircraft can operate on the same fuel if necessary however to min imize the hazard of shipboard fires navy and marine corps aircraft regularly use type of fuel less prone to ignition than the standard air force fuel carrierbased navy and marine corps aircraft will only use air force fuel infrequently because their tanks must be emptied prior to landing and their fuel systems must be flushed clean to avoid contaminating the carriers fuel supply with the air forces more combustible fuel thus kc767 able to offload only one type of fuel on single mission is much more limited in the types of aircraft it can service contend lease opponents some of the capabilities that the air fo rce and boeing tout sound attractive opponents say but they arent required by the ord this brings into question how important these capabilities really are the ability to operate from runways less than 12000 feet is one example the air for ce also reportedly wanted the kc767 built in combi configuration that would permit it to carry passengers and cargo at the same time this configur ation however would have required building special bulkhead and would have presumably increased the cost of the aircraft so the plan was dropped54 the loss of this capability opponents say is another example of how the kc767 might look good compared to 42 yearold aircraft but still might not have the attributes most attractive in new aerial refueling aircraft the air force and other lease supporte rs could counter these criticisms by pointing out that the kc767 does satisfy th majority of ord requirements it is unrealistic to expect an aircraft to satisfy all of the requirements and the many that the kc767 does satisfy more than make up for the one or two that it does not the ability to offload more than one type of fuel on single mission is an ord objective lease supporters argue not requirement also

airc raft if future needs warrant kc767 versus other aircraft another way to determine if the kc767 is the best aircraft for the job is to compare it to other available ai rcraft the air force says that it evaluated 747 757 767 777 nd a330 aircraft and found the 767 the best candidate for the aerial refueling mission55 these aircraft are not the only alternatives to be consid ered critics argue lease opponents note that there is currently glut of excess commercial airliners on the market and the air force could more cheaply buy some number of these unwanted aircraft and convert them into tankers some estimate that over 700 surplus commercial ai rliners are in longterm storage facilities in the american southwest alone56 surplus boeing dc10 aircraft for exampl appear to be excellent candidates for conversion into tankers and for recap italizing some portion of todays kc135 fleet lease opponents say the air force already operates 59 converted dc10s called kc10 extenders these aircraft have almost twice the maximum fuel capacity of both the kc135 and the kc767 using the air forces own comparative metrics the kc10 is 195 kc 135 equivalent in other words it has 195 percent of the kc135s fuel carry ing capabilities thus 50 kc10s have roughly the same tanker capabilities as 100 kc135s also lease opponents point out the kc10 can use the refueling boom and the hoseanddrogue systems on the same mission the kc10 also has much larger cargo carrying capacity 170000 lbs than either the kc135 or the kc 767 this large capacity would also be boon to the air forces strategic airlift capabilities which are currently hard pressed to meet the requirements established in th air forces latest requirements study57 in addition to these operational advantages lease opponents point out that buying and converting surplus dc10s into kc10s offers significant financial advantages over the kc767 surplus dc 10s are being offered for sale for 600000 to 103 million each58 if 50 surplus dc10s could be purchased for 10 million each and if the tanker conve rsion cost another 40 million59 the air force could replace the oldest 100 kc135s with 50 tankers that are twice as capable

aircraft essentially turning them into kc135rs kc767 lease critics say that reengining th kc135e has many merits that should be considered as an alternative to l easing 100 new aircraft upgrading the engines will increase the aircrafts takeoff power cruise speed and other performance parameters despite their old age the kc 135es have only used approximately half their flying hours reengining them to improve their performance over their remaining lifetime perhaps 35 more years would be costeffective and prudent step many argue major advantage of this approach lease critics say is timeliness if the need for improved tanker capabilities is urgent as the air force argues then upgrading the fleet to r models may be the quickest solution62 the second advantage of this approach is cost the gao estimates that re engining 127 kc135es would cost 36 billion much lower figure lease opponents say than the air forces 172 billion estimate for leasing the kc767 or the 246 b illion total program cost plus the 44 billion likely spent at the end of the lease to purchase the aircraft63 not only is the cost of the reengining procedure low compared to the 767 lease but this approach also saves money by avoiding projected maintenance on the old gines that will be replaced much of the increased cost projections for the kc135 from 2001 to 2040 have to do with engine maintenance according to the esls study emodel per ac engine costs are 20 times the rmodel64 thus the outyear maintenance costs avoided by this re engining will help finance the 36 billi on initial investment lease opponents argue third advantage of reengining is th at it will eliminate one of the kc135es most challenging maintenance problems co rrosion of the engine strut corrosion induced maintenance and repair of the kc 135e engine struts have recently been estimated at 3 million per aircraft65 concerns over the effects of corrosion on this key structure have also led the air for ce to impose flight restrictions on the models eliminating these problems in addition to the cost savings and performance improvements argues strongly fo r reengining lease opponents say the air force is strongly opposed to re engining the

kc135e business case analysis headquarters usaf may 1 2003 pe2year to r models at cost of about 29 million per aircraft66 the air force makes number of arguments against reengining first only 100 of the emodels are candidates for reengining67 so if reengined the fina l number of rmodels in the inventory would be at least 27 fewer than advocates of this pproach believe second reengining will improve some of the kc 135es capabilities but it does nothing to address the underlying issue of the aging aircraft fleet according to former dod acquisition chief pete aldridge the upgrade from emodels to rmodel will not buy you any lifetime and thats what we need to buy additional life68 the third argument the air force makes against reengining the kc135es is one of immediate and longerterm availability reengining the would remove them from the active inventory for at least six months reengining the air force argues would decrease the availability of air refueling tankers when the air force has the highest demand on tankers now during war reengining the kc135e fleet would leave tired iron in the inventory that would degrade mission capable rates relative to new aircraft fourth the air force says while re engining may obviate corrosion problems with the engine strut it will not address any of the numerous remaining problems such as the wing attachment fittings electrical wire replacement and body skin replacement that will continue to plague the kc135r fleet the final air force argument against reengining the efleet is economic kc 135es have approximate ly 80 percent the capability of kc135r if the air force were to reengine and convert the emodel to an rmodel it would gain 20 percent increase in capability for the 38 million inves tment this is poor deal the air force argues also according to air force studies conver ting emodels to rmodels exacerbates the recapitalization problem considerably because it does not satisfy recapitalization requirements it only postpones them furthermore it postpones recapitalization with significant investme nt 387b for 100 aircraft that will take decades to pay for itself the air force argues69 kc767 versus leasing tanker services those critical of the proposed 767 lease also say that there ar other alternatives to purchas ing or leasing an aircraft instead the air force could reduce the kc 135s workload and buy time to explore other recapitalization options by leasing tanker services the us navy for example has signed fiveyear deal with private company to refuel navy and marine corps aircraft participating in

opponents argue for severa l reasons leasing tanker services could augment the air forces tanking quickly thereby satisfying the air forces stated urgent need also leasing service would avoid any kind of cost associated with recruiting training and paying an aircrew the air force currently suffers from very high operations tempo optempo as it deals with the unanticipated strains of fighting the global war on terrorism lease opponents point out this high optempo exacerbates long standing problem the air force has had with too few kc135 crews leasing tanker services c ould immediately ameliorate this problem the current dod leadership has consistent track record of promoting outsourcing and privatization why not pply the same principles to recapitalizing the aerial refueling fleet critics of the 767 lease ask unlike the navy the air force has not yet hired private refueling services to support exercises or training supporters of the proposed 767 lease may argue that such services are inherently limited in their application companies have difficult time getting insurance for aircraft that fly into war zones also it would be difficult they argue to get private pilots to fly into contested areas during operation iraqi freedom the air force aggressively flew tankers well into iraqi airspace would private pilots balk if asked to do the same the number or companies willing to engage in such business is limited lease supporters argue and it is unlikely that companies currently in this line of work could provide the air force with the number of aircraft required to meet anticipated needs so while there may be some niche applications for leasing tanker services most believe it is replacement for fleet recapitalization also most private companies can refuel navy and marine corps aircraft but not air force aircraft so their application may be limited in that dimension as well outsourcing and priva tization do have their applications lease supporters agree

there is an urgent need to acquire tanker aircraft and if tankers based on the boeing 767 are the best aircraft to acquire then followon question is how the cost of acquiring these aircraft through lease compares to the cost of acquiring them through purchase ie procurement estimated total cost and factors that can change the calculation the air force report presents estimates for the total cost of the leasing and procurement options that have been calculated on net present valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs38 91air force report pages 45npv basis see appendix b for descripti on of npv analysis the report states that when calculated on an npv basis leasing the 767s would be about 150 million or about 1 more expensive than purchas ing ie procuring them specifically the report states that leasing would ve an npv of 172 billion while purchasing would have an npv of 171 billion thes two npv figures are rounded to the nearest tenth of billion when the difference between them is measured more precisely it becomes 150 million91 although the air force report presents this 150million difference as single answer to the question of the comparative total costs of leasing vs purchasing the 767s the cost compar ison as the report notes can be significantly affected by decisions one makes on certain key vari ables or assumptions involved in the calculation included among these variab and assumptions are the following should multiyear procurement myp arrangement be used in calculating the cost of the procurement option how much would using myp arrangement reduce the cost of the procurement option what is the correct discount rate to use in performing the npv cost comparison what progress payment schedule should be used in estimating the cost of the procurement option how should inflation be used in calcula ting the cost of the progress payments under the procurement option what interest rate should be used for the bonds floated by the special interest entity spe what interest rate should be used on the construction loans that the spe would take out under the leasing arrang ement to finance the building of the 767s what estimate should be used for the imputed government selfinsurance cost included in the cost of the procurement option each of these questions is discussed be low several of these factors could individually shift the result of the npv an alysis by hundreds of millions of dollars in combination with one another they could shift the result by an even greater sum use of myp arrangement for procurement option in calculating the costs of the 767 leasing and procurement options the air force assumed that the procurement option like most major dod acquisition programs would use annual contracting if the calculation had instead assumed the use of multiyear procurementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs39 92a footnote in the air force repor t footnote 1 on page 4 can be read as implying that the use of myp would by itself have enlarged th cost advantage of the procurement option from 150 million to as much as 19 billion on an npv basis shift of as much as 175 billion discussions with the air force offici als clarified that the use of myp would have been responsible for about 900 million of this estimated shift and that three other variables if treated differently together would have been responsible for shifting the calculation by roughly another 800 million one of these other variables the inclusion of an imputed selfinsurance cost in the co st of the procurement option is discussed elsewhere in this crs report 93the air force report states that neither multiyear procurement authority nor related funding authorities were made available and therefore was not viable option for the administrations analytical cons ideration air force report op cit footnote 1 on page 4myp for the procurement option see ppendix c for discussion of myp the npv analysis could have favored the pr ocurement option by several hundred million additional dollars92 the air force states that it used annua l contracting rather than myp for the procurement option for the following reasons myp has never before been used at th start of dod aircraft procurement program using myp at the start of procurem ent program would not be consistent with the statutory requirement that weapons and platforms being considered for myp have stable design ie design that has been in production for several years and been proven through act ual use and is thus unlikely to need to be altered during the period covere d by the myp due to the discovery of design problems congress passed provision authorizing lease of 767s and did not pass provision authorizing multiyear procur ement of 767s if congress had been open to considering an myp arrangem ent for the 767s it would have passed legislation granting such authority93 those who support the idea that the air force should have assumed the use of myp in calculating the cost of the procurement option might argue the following the leasing arrangement approved by congress inherently involves making multiyear commitment to the 767 program leasing opponents may maintain that since the leasing option is inherently multiyear option it should have been compared to multi year procurement option to ensure an applestoapples comparison of costs supporters of the lease have argued th at it constitutes an innovation in defense acquisition using myp at the start of 767 tanker procurement would equally represent an innovation opponents may argue that although dod has leased aircraft in the past the 767 lease is precedentsetting in several regards including the larger number of aircraft involved the large total cost of the lease and the use of relatively shortterm operating lease forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs40 an asset that the air force will likely continue to require for much longer period of time in addition the legisl ation setting up the lease exempted the air force from requirement to include the full amount of funding that the government would be liable for in case of cancellation and established special congressional process for appr oving the lease leasing opponents may assert that congress arguably sent signal in passing the legislation setting up the lease that in the case of the 767s it is prepared to consider highly novel acquisition approaches from their perspective using myp for the 767s would be more irregular and possi bly less irregular than the leasing arrangement the fact that congre ss approved one kind of authority leasing and not another myp does not prove lack of congressional interest in approaches other than leasing they might maintain that it is the role of congress not the air force to cide what options congress would be willing to consider there is precedent for congress granting dod multiyear contracting authority similar to myp at the start of major dod acquisition program involving platform with complex design congress in acting on the fy1998 defense budget passed provision granting the navy special blockbuy contracting authority for the first four virginiaclass nuclear powered attack submarines this authority was similar to myp authority in that it permitted the navy to sign single contract covering 4 submarines that were to be procured over the 5year period fy1998fy2002 these 4 submarines have combined estimated procurement cost of more than 10 billion in terms of design and engin eering nuclearpowered submarines are at least as complex if not more complex than tanker aircraft and congress passed this legislation in 1997 before construction of the first virginiaclass submarine had even started there is precedent for service requesting myp authority for program that has not yet produced single completed unit and consequently has not demonstrated design stability through the traditional means of successfully testing one or more fu lly built units in their intended operating environment the navy as part of its fy2004 budget submission requested that congress grant full myp authority for group of 7 virginia class submarines to be procured during the 5year period fy2004fy2008 the navy requested this authority ev though construction of the first virginiaclass boat is still not complete it was bout 85 complete at the time the navy submitted its proposed fy2004 budget to congress in february 2003 instead of demonstrating the st ability of the virginiaclass design in the traditional manner by completing c onstruction of at least one boat and showing through realworld operations that the boats design does not need to be changed to fix previously undi scovered design problems the navy is advancing the novel argument that th relatively small number of design changes that have occurred during the lead ships construction compared to the number of design changes that ccurred during construction of the lead ships of previous classes of us submarines is sufficient to demonstrate that the virginiaclass design is stable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs41 94the developmental phase of testing which incl uded four test flights began in august 2002 and

cbo stated would still captu re roughly 80 of the costreduction benefits of using myp fo r the procurement option95 air force officials have stated that the issue of whether to assume myp in the procurement option is in any event moot b ecause the air force budg et is insufficient over the next few years to meet the nearterm funding requirements of 767 procurement program without requiring undue reductions in other air force programs indeed they could argue that using myp would require even more near term funding than an annually contracted procurement program due to the need to fund the myps economic orde r quantity eoq purchase i upfront batch order of selected 767 tanker components96 those who believe that an myp arrangem ent should be used in calculating the cost of the procurement option could argue that the issue is not necessarily moot because it is possible to structure 767 tanker procurement option using myp that features reduced nearterm funding requireme nts specifically they could argue the air force could procure the 767s under an appro ach that combined myp incremental funding and possibly dela yed eoq purchase or eoq purchase at all such an approach they could ar gue would through myp reduce the total procurement cost of the 767s below what the air force estimated in its report and defer through incremental funding portions of the procurement cost of the 767s into future years so as to address the air forces requirement to minimize nearterm funding requirements deferring the eoq purchase and thereby pplying it only to later planes in the 100plane effort rather than to all 100 ai rcraft would reduce the amount of savings achieved through the myp since eoq purchases are significant contributor to overall myp savings but it w ould also defer the funding requirements of the eoq to later year and reduce the scope and cost of the eoq when it does occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs43 97for discussion of the full funding polic and

further reduce the savings achieved by the myp but still permit some myprelated savings to be achieved through work force optimization and investment in improved production equipment at the final

myp at the start of an aircraft procurement program but also violate the full funding policy governin g defense procurement in acting on the fy2003 budget request they can argue c ongress altered the air forces proposed funding profile for the c17 program and passed other legislation specifically to reinforce the principal that procurement programs using myp are less subject to the full funding policy than nnually contracted programs97 supporters of an incrementally funded myp with delayed or eliminated eoq purchase could argue that although c ongress in acting on the fy2003 budget reinforced the application of the full f unding policy to myp programs this was intended to send general sign on defense budgeting proce dures that need not apply to the 767 program because congress in passing the legislation setting up the 767 lease indicated that in th case of the 767s it was prepared to consider highly novel and irregular acquisition approaches an incrementally funded myp with delayed or eliminated eoq purchase they could argue would be more irregular and possibly less irregular than the leasing rrangement supporters of the lease have argued that it constitutes an innovation in fense acquisition supporters of an incrementally funded myp could argue that it too would represent an innovation as recent precedents for the use of incr emental funding in major dod

than 143 for the army javelin antitank miss ile and 3947 for the air force f22 fighter respectively including these two cases would produce an estimated savings rate of 77 the remaining 10 cas varied between 54 and 10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs45 100in response to questions submitted by crs the air force stated the following regarding the selection of the 9year discount rate question please explain the twostep discount rate shown in the slide on the financial analysis of lease vs purchase was that op tion rejected by the lease panel and if so why answer the twostep was developed to inj ect analytical consistency into the analysis and to resolve analytical differences between the air force and omb it was developed and then rejected initially the omb noted that the planned leases for this program involved six years of lease payments therefore it was ppropriate to consider the use of sixyear discount rate in this analysis however th air force noted that actual lease payments would not start until 2006 and would continue as leased aircraft are delivered through 2011 continuedif applying myp to the 767 procuremen t option produce savings of as little as 54 or as much as 10 then myp might reduce the cost of the procurement option on an npv basis by as little as about 660 million using the 54 figure or as much as about 12 billion using the 10 figure using delayed and thus reduced eoq or eoq at all would result in smaller amount of cost reduction discount rate used in npv analysis omb circular a94 provides guidance to executive branch agencies on wh at discount rates to use in calculating the npvs of leasing and purchasing options these rates are based on the yields ie interest rates on us treas ury notes and bonds of specified maturities as set forth in the most recent january 2003 version of circular a94 those rates are as follows table 4 discount rates for leasevspurchase npv comparisons appendix c omb circular a94 revised january 2003 discount ratematurity periods 3year 5year 7year 10year 30year nominal 31 36 39 42 51 real 16 19 22 25 32 section 8c of circular a94 further instructs agencies in choosing discount rate to use the treasury borrowing rate on marketable securities of comparable maturity to the period of analysis in selecting rate to use from the table above omb and the air force considered at least three alternatives that might qualify as being of comparable maturity to the period of analysis 6year rate which would cover the 6year lease period for each aircraft 9year rate which would cover both the 3year construction period and 6year lease period for each aircraft and 15year rate which would span the entire period fro m the start of construction of the first aircraft through the end of the lease of the 100th aircraft omb and the air force settled on using 9year rate which was then calculated by interpolating between the 7year and 10year rates shown on the above table100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs46 100continued the issue was how to calculate the present va lue of the lease payments since the lease involved different key dates the date of the contract and the various dates from 2006 through 2011 when the aircraft were to be delivered the twostep discounting took this variety of dates into account the process invo lved 1 the first step was to discount each of the respective lease streams back to the year of lease option using the omb forecasted treasury yields for the year of lease simila rly the stream of lease payments starting with the 2007 lease option would be discounted to 2007 using the forecasted yield on treasuries in 2007 and so on 2 the values from step 1 would then need to be further discounted to the contract award date the lease panel cided not to use this approach because it was unconventional our understanding is that they did not want to diverge too far from existing policy on discounting it should be noted how ever that omb acknowledged that existing guidance was not set up to handle such complex lease versus buy analysis question please xplain the rationale for selecting nineyear discount rate answer the nineyear discount met hod was the result of the resolution of the consideration of the twostep discounting proc ess omb guidance clearly stated that the discount rate should be used that is commens urate with the period of analysis however the air forces period of analysis was 15 year s from the start of the contract until the last lease payment is made omb decided that 9 year discount rate was appropriate in that it matches the 6 years for given lease plus thre years of construction for given plane by agreeing to the nineyear discount rate omb ag reed that the air force did not have to use the 6year discount rate while the air force ag reed to eliminate the 2step discount approach or the 15year discount rate again the nine year discount rate is based on the assumption that there is 3year tanker cons truction period plus 6year lease source questions 9 and 10 from air force fa ct sheet dated august 13 2003 and sent to crs on that date responding to crs questions on the 767 tanker lease 101the paragraph and the following one are based on consultations with jane gravelle senior specialist in economic policy gove rnment and finance division congressional research service 102this is rough calculation based on the following assumptions 3year construction period 15303025 progress payment sche dule during construction 6 equal lease payments paid in advance of each year equating to about 90 of the cost of the aircraft and final residual payment at the end of the sixth year to pay off the remaining 10 cost of the plane 15303025 progress payment sche dule means that the government would make progress payments to boeing for the construc tion of each aircraft on the following schedule 15 three years before delivery 30 two years before delivery another 30 one year before delivery and 25 at delivery this is the progress payment schedule used by the air force in its cost comparison this roug h calculation ignores compounding issue that would not significantly alter the outcome of the calculationwas 9year treasury bond rate the correct rate to use as the discount rate in the npv calculation101 crs analysis indicates th at different treasury bond rate should have been used specifically crs analysis indicat that the npv calculation should use the treasur bond rate for bonds having an average maturity equal to the bonds that the us government would likely use to raise the funds needed for the cash flows involved in the l ease arrangement in the case of the 767 lease crs calculates this average matur ity at something between 35 and 4 years102 using 4year discount rate instead of the 9year rate in the air force

additional 520 million103 using 35year rate instead of the 9year rate would favor the procurement option by an additional 610 million104 it is possible that the interest rates shown in table 5 particularly the rates for the shorterterm bonds are too low the congressional budget office is projecting 10year government borrowing rates that are higher than those shown in table 5105 using higher interest rates than shown in table 5 particularly for shorterterm bonds such as bonds with 35 or 4year ma turity would by itself favor the leasing arrangement by some additi onal amount of money if government borrowing rates shift up from the rates shown in table 5 however corporate borrowing rates would likely also shift up offsetting some portion possibly all of th relative advantage gained by the leasing option of assumin g an upward shift in treasury bond rates progress payment schedule for procurement option in estimating the cost of the procurement option the air force report used 15303025 progress payment schedule meaning that the air force under the procurement option would provide boeing progress payments during th construction of each aircraft or group of aircraft as follows 15 of the cost of the aircraft three years prior to delivery 30 two years prior to delivery another 30 one year prior to delivery and 25 at delivery the air force states that it used the 15303025 schedule in modeling the cost of the procurement option because this is the schedule that has been used in discussions of the lease option under whic h boeing would draw on the spes bank line of credit ie the construction loan to finance the construction of the planes for sale to the spe using th is same schedule for modelin g the progress payments under the procurement option air fo rce officials argue ensure s more applestoapples cost comparison an alternative view is that regardless of the line of credit drawdown schedule that was used in discussing the leas option the procurement option should be modeled using progress pa yment schedule that reflects actual progress payment schedules used in previous air force aircraft procuremen t programs involving aircraft built over 3year construction peri od an example of such schedule based on part programs w ould be 1024543522 this alternative schedule has been referred to by some observers as compressed schedule others however might view it as traditional or typi cal schedule for procurement program involving aircraft that take 3 years to build compared to the 15303025 progress payment schedule this alternative sche dule would shift portion of the progress payments into later years with the result that they would be discounted more heavily reducing the npv of the procurement option the air force states that using this alternative progress payment schedule for the procurement option would favor the procurement option by an additional 200 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs48 106a basis point is 1100th of

the proc urement option the air force calculated each progress payment to include an amount of inflation that would result as if all four progress payments for given aircraft or groups of aircraft were made at the time of delivery even though three of th progress payments would actually be made in earlier years the air forces states that it calculated the progress payments for the procurement option this way because this was the same basis for calculating the lease cost of the aircraft under the lease option using this same method air force officials argue ensures more applestoapples cost comparison an alternative view is that procurement programs in the past have calculated progress payments in one of two ways by including inflation through the year of delivery on all the payments as describe d above or by including an amount of inflation on each progress payment sufficient to cover inflation up to the point in time when each payment is made the air fo rce states that using the second method would favor the procurement op tion by an additional 500 million interest rates for bonds floated by spe comparing the costs of the leasing and procurement options involves making an assumption for the leasing option about the interest rates of the bo nds that would be floated by the special purpose entity spe to raise the cash needed to purchase the 767s from boeing the higher or lower these interest rates are the higher or lower the lease payments would need to be to cover the spes borrowi ng costs and thus the higher or lower the total cost of the lease option under the proposed approach for implementing the 767 lease the spe would float three kinds of bonds called g bonds bonds and b bonds these bonds would present different amounts of risk for the bondholders and would thus carry different interest rates in the air force report the assumed in terest rate for the g bonds was derived by taking the january 2003 omb forecas t for 5year treasury bonds and then increasing it by 56 basis points ie 56 hundredths of percentage point106 the result was that the interest rates for the g bonds were assumed to be 570591 during the period fy 2006fy2 0011 the period during which the bonds would be floated the assumed interest rate for the bonds was derived by taking the january 2003 omb forecast for 2year treasury bonds and then increasing them by 100 basis points ie full percentage point the re sult was that the interest rates for the bonds were assumed to be 584 604 during the period fy2006fy2011 the assumed interest rate for the b bonds was based on

and down in pr ecisely linear fashion but the difference is small enough that the 50basispoint figure can be used for making rough estimates of the change resulting from differences greater or lesser than 50 basis pointsthe actual interest rates for all th bonds will not be known until the spe actually floats them in the bond market th actual rates could be higher or lower than the rates assumed in the air force report if the actual rates turn out to be higher or lower than assumed in the air force report then the cost of the lease will be higher or lower than shown in the air force report as means of illustrating the sensitivity of the npv cost calculation to any difference between the assumed and actual interest rates for the spe bonds it can be noted that if the actual interest rates for all three kinds of bonds turn out to be 50 basis points higher or lower than assumed in the air force report then the total cost of the lease when calculated on an np v basis would be about 270 million higher or lower than the cost s hown in the air force report107 this figure of about 270 million can be used as rough yardstick for estimating changes in the cost of the lease resulting from difference between assumed and actual rates that is different than 50 basis points108 potential questions for congress arising out of the issue of the assumed spe interest rates include the following what was the analytical basis for the approach that was used in the air force report to derive the timated interest rates fo r the spe bonds was this approach reasonable what other pproaches might have been used to estimate these interest rates given changes in various economic factors since january 2003 including projected federal borrowing needs what is the likelihood that the interest rates forecasted by omb in january 2003 will rn out to be higher or lower than actual rates historically in situations where simila r estimates had to be made about future bond interest rates how much of diffe rence did there turn out to be between projected and actual interest rates and was the difference more likely to be in one direction than another interest rates for construction loans taken out by spe comparing the costs of the leasing and procurement op tions also involves making an assumption for the leasing option about the interest ra tes of the construction loans that the spe would take out from banks to finance th construction of the 767s prior to boeing selling them to the spe the higher or lower these interest rates are the higher or lower would be the constructionfinancing cost

bringing the average l ease price to 1384 million per plane the actual interest rates for the c onstruction loans will not be known until boeing takes out these loans these actual rates could be

it can be noted that if the actual interest ra tes turn out to be 50 basis points higher or lower than assumed in the air force report then the total cost of the lease when calculated on an npv basis might be several tens of millions of dollars higher or lower than the cost shown in the air force report109 this potential degree of change can be used as rough yardstick for estimating changes in the cost of the lease resulting from difference between assumed and actual rates that is different than 50 basis points inclusion of imputed selfinsur ance cost in procurement option the total cost of the 767 lease option includes cost for private insurance policies that the spe would take out to protect bondholders against events such as the accidental crash and loss of one or more of the 767s in the event of such loss the proceeds from the insurance policy woul d be used to pay off the bondholders if the 767s were procured rather than leased such insurance policy would be taken out by the government instead the government would simply bear the risk of such loss ie employ selfinsurance bearing this risk incurs immediate additional cost to the government omb circular a94 however instructs agencies when comparing the costs of leasing and purchasing options to include in the cost of the procurement option an imputed ie synthetic or virtual selfinsurance cost omb circular a94 instructs agencies to in clude such cost because there is risk that one or more of the 767s would be st during their years of operation and the government in the case of the procuremen t option would have to bear the cost of such loss either operationally due to the reduced capacity of the remaining 767 fleet or financially due to the need to spend additional funds to procure replacement aircraft for this reason omb believes including an imputed selfinsurance cost ensures more applestoapples comparis on of costs between leasing and purchasing optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs51 the cost comparison in the air force report as instructed by circular a94 includes an imputed selfins urance cost for the procurem ent option the air force report estimates this cost at 100 million on an npv basis the question is whether 100 million figure is reasonable estimate of the governments selfinsurance co st the governments selfinsurance cost would likely be lower than the cost of private insurance since the cost of private insurance includes among other things profit for the insurance company the governments selfinsurance cost would also likely be greater than zero since there is risk greater than zero of losing one or more of th 767s during their years of operation beyond these two bounding observations however cal culating the cost of selfinsurance poses methodological uncertainties that could lead to results either higher or lower than 100 million on an npv basis if alte rnative estimates put the cost of self insurance at something higher than 100 million this would make the cost comparison more favorable to lease option if they put it at something lower than 100 million thus would make the comparison more favorable to the procurement option the table

refueling aircraft multiyear lease pilot program july 10 2003 secretary of the air force james roche states the dominant reason for proposing the lease is the advantage it affords for quickly delivering needed tankers to our warfighters without requiring signifi cant upfront funding 112omb circular a11a ppendix b1 scoring leasepurchase and leases of capital continuedappropriation and authoriza tion bills appears to be unusual if not unprecedented110 the air force and others argue that the lease is attractive because it allows the air force to acquire 100 tanker aircraft with relatively little money spent up front111 on the other hand the proposed lease appear s to be in many ways an unprecedented method of undertaking major new defe nse procurement and is at odds with longstanding laws and regulations that apply to budgeting and procurement of defense systems the proposed tanker lease raises numbe r of broader policy issues particularly the visibility of full cost of planned defense programs in the congressional oversight process the ch ief issues raised are the following locking in substantial budgetary res ources when longterm budgets are uncertain if congress approves the new st art notification the air force will make contractual commitment that locksin an estimated 246 billion or more between 2003 and 2017 for the boeing tanker lease these funds have not been included in the air force budget and while the lease approach reduces air force budget requirements in the shortterm it does so only by pushing costs out into future years when potentially necessary tradeoffs with other defense programs are less visibl to policy makers but may be less difficult locking in funding when program costs are uncertain by proposing to lease rather than purchase the aircra ft the air force adds considerable uncertainty to the cost of the program that might not be experienced in straight purchase in this proposed lease the air force would make itself subject to the volatility of the bond markets because of the high cost of termination liabilities the air force would be unlikely to cancel the lease even if financing costs increased substantially the total cost of the program is also likely to be higher because according to many observers the air force is likely to purchase the aircraft at the end of each sixyear lease does the proposed lease comply wi th the statutory requirements and omb rules for operating leases some observers have questioned whether the k767 tanker proposal is appropriately categorized as an operating lease budget rules provide that payments fo r operating leases are to be counted or scored in agency budgets on an annual basis as payments are made if the tanker deal is categorized as capita l lease then omb would require that dod budget 116 billion up front to cover the full cost of the lease in present value terms112 those rules are designed to ensure that the full scope of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs55 112continued assets omb revised this circular in july 2003 but the air force lease was subject to the 2002 versi on differences between the two versions are identified in the new circular estimate of full cost of lease in net pres ent value dollars is from air force model 113estimates of current dollar costs in this report are based on either the air force model which was provided to crs by the air force or air force responses to crs questions governments obligations are visible to policymakers in order to foster cost effective decisions use of special purpose entity decrease s visibility the air force plan to rely on special purpose entity spe or variable interest entity vie to float the bonds to finance the progra m creates additional uncertainties and reduces visibility about likely cost so observers have suggested that using an spe also masks the financial commitme nt of the government because the full government liability is not scored or counted in terms of budgetary resources is the proposed lease good deal for the government the dollar value of the proposed lease is predicated on cove ring 90 of the fair market value of the aircraft in order to minimize the amount of funding that would be considered risky and hence comma nd larger premium by bondholders that pricing does not reflect either the length of the lease or the wear and tear on the aircraft some have also questi oned whether the fair market value of the aircraft is the best price for tanker particularly since the air force negotiated both the lease and suppor t contract without competition deviation from fullfunding of th governments contractual liability the statutory language applying to the multi year tanker lease exempts the air force from the requirement to budget fo r its potential termination liability ie penalty payments for cancellation of the contract congress has thus exempted this air force action from the longstanding antideficiency act which requires that government agencies have resources on hand to cover the governments contractual liabilities the following discussion analyzes each of these issues in turn the previous section compares costs of various prog ram options using net present value or discounted dollars in order to capture the effects on costs of different funding streams the section below compares costs in current year dollars because that is the way program costs are generally expresse d and how budget choices are generally made unless stated otherwise all figures in this section are in current year dollars and convert air force numbers fro m outlays to budget authority113 locking in substantial resour ces when longterm budgets are uncertain locking in the tanker lease program over the next 15 years could squeeze other programs although the ai r force has included some future funding for new undefined tanker in dods planning documents and hopes to reap savings from retiring 68 old kc135es those funds are not sufficient to fund the proposed lease there is also some congressi onal opposition to the proposed retirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs56 114s rept 10846

subjects itself to the volatility of the bond market between 2006 and 2011 which would not be the case in purchas the air force would also have contractual commitment to the entire program as well as substantial penalties for termination compliance of lease with statute and regulations is an issue some observers have ques tioned whether the proposed lease complies with the statutory language in section 8159 of the fy2002 dod appropriations act pl 107 117 that language requires that the leas be consistent with omb circular a11 which establishes the criteria that distinguish operating leases from capital leases appropriateness of using an operating lease operating leases are generally intended to be used when an asset is needed for only limited period of time and the user does not need or intend to purchase the asset if the business or agency needs the asset on longterm basis however then purchase generally makes more economic sense to guard against agencies using operating leases to buy on the installment plan or incrementally fund purchase the government has adopted series of guidelines for analyzing the tradeoffs nd for accurately reflecting the cost to the government both cbo and omb follow the same guidelines which reflect the 1997 budget enforcement act122 much of the debate about the proposed air force tanker deal has focused on the appropriateness of using an operating lease rather than straight buy if the tanker deal were scored or counted as capital lease rather than operating lease under current budget rules the air force w ould be required to provide 116 billion in budgetary authority ba upfr ont to reflect those costs123 that rule is designed to ensure that government policymakers are fully aware of the full cost when decisions are made the air force believes that the tanker deal as currently structured is consistent with the budgetary guidelines124 the issue of whether th tanker proposal meets the criteria for an operating lease has been disputed within the administration and congress since passage of the 2002 leasing authority criteria for operating leases to qualify as an operating lease omb circular a11 requires that lease must fulfill the

the lease does not contain ba rgainbasement price purchase option 3 the lease term does not exceed 75 of the estimated economic life of the asset 4 the present value of the minimum l ease payments over the life of the lease does not exceed 90 of the fair market value of the asset at the beginning of the lease term 5 the asset is generalpurpose asset rather than being for special purpose of the government and is not built to the unique specification of the government as lessee and 6 there is privatesector market for the asset125 these criteria are designed to ensure that federal agencies are not using operating leases with the ultimate intent of buying the asset once the lease is over similarly the 75 cap on the length of the lease and the 90 cap on the fair market value of the asset are intended to stop agencies from leasing assets which they need for long time and therefore would be better off buying finally the last two criteria limit operating leases to items which are not peculiar to the government and have commercial market because the government is more likely to get reasonable price for assets which could also be leased or sold elsewhere congressional intent about the tanker deal although the statutory language for the tanker deal in dods 2002 appropria tion act does not explicitly authorize an operating lease the language requires that the air force accept delivery of the aircraft in general purpose configuration and re turn the aircraft to the lessor in the same config uration the act also does not authorize purchase of the aircraft these are all omb criteria that distinguish an operating lease126 the lease is also not to include modification of this commercial configuration unless and until sepa rate authority for such conve rsion is enacted and

th 767 lease senator murray asked senator inouye whether general purpose aircraft that will meet the general requirements of many customers that can operate as passenger aircraft freighter passengerfreighter combination aircraft or as an aerial refueling tanker and is available to either government or pr ivate customers meets the definition of general purpose commercial configured aircraft130 senator inouye agreed with this characteriz ation which implies that even if the air force modified the boeing 767 to make it an air refueling aircraft military use the aircraft could still be considered commercial item as required for operating leases in support of this characterization senato r roberts noted that both italy and japan have purchased modified 767 ai rcraft as tanker aircraft131 although colloquy on the floor is an indication of congressional intent it does not carry the same force as language included in conference or committee report which reflects the views of the authorizing or appropriating committee disputes about whether the tanker deal is an operating lease within both the administration and congre ss some have questioned whether the proposed lease complies with ombs criteri for an operating lease below is summary of the chief argu ments made on both sides132 1whether ownership will be transferred to the government shortly after the end of the lease the air force would say that the special purpose entity wilmington trust owns the asset if and until the air fo rce makes decision about whether to buy the aircraft the lease calls for re turn of the aircraft after six years although the air force would be permitted to buy the planes at any time if it gets authorization and appropriation of funds others have pointed out that ev though the special purpose entity technically owns the plane that entity only exists as conduit for the air force under revised omb regulations issued in july 2003 after completion of the tanker proposal wilmington trust would be considered governmental rather than private entity133 others have noted that the contract permits the government to buy the aircraft at any point during the lease and that the lease price makes purchase of the aircraft after the lease attractive because the air force will alr eady have paid 90 of the fair market value and will have continuing need for the aircraft the

aircraft covered by the multi year pilot program134 2 the lease does not include bargainprice purchase option the lease permits the air force to purchase the aircraft for 44 million per aircraft the remaining balance of the loan to the bond holders or 10 of the fair market value the air force estimates that the aircraft could be sold as freighters for about 51 million per aircraft at the end of the l ease price that is about 15 higher than the air force will pay 3 the lease does not exceed 75 of the economic life of the asset the sixyear lease constitutes onequarter of the estimated 25 year life of the aircraft 4 the present value of the l ease payments does not exceed 90 of the fair market value of the aircraft the air force argues that its paymen ts are 899 of the initial fair market value of the kc767 tanker based on per plane price of 138 million in 2002 dollars in its report to congress the air for ce acknowledges that the lease payments would be 93 of the fair market value thus breaching the threshold if the air force used the 131 million 2002 price for the aircraft which excludes construction financing as part of the price135 some would not consider those financing costs to be part of the value of the aircraft since they would not be part of the governments purchase price136 5 the asset must be general purpose rather than built to government specifications the air force notes that the 767 was co mmercially develope d and that other customers have added as much as 35 customer specific equipment critics would argue that the tanker configuration in the lease

there would be few takers implications of using special purpose entity the air forces reliance on special purpose entity spe s raised questions about whether the total cost and financial risks to the g overnment may be obscured leaving decision makers less able to make costeffective decisions budget scoring rules as expressed in omb circular a11 and the 1997 budget enforcement act did not anticipate government use of spes and reliance on spes makes it easier for agencies to argue that the full costs of program should not be considered as government liabilities even when there is real distinction between the trust and the government in the case of wilmington trust the government is the sole beneficiary making it essentially an extension of the government according to cbos definition137 in the case of the tanker lease this lack of distinction is captured by the fact that wilmington trust is nonprofit entity that bears risk but instead acts essentially as conduit for funds between boeing th air force and the bondholders through its contractual commitment to the trust the government shoulders the financing risks including most of the risk of can cellation of the lease the bondholders would bear portion of the risk of termination of the lease and the full risk that the air force would not buy the planes at the end of each lease concerns with precedents the air force use of an spe for this lease raises additional concerns because it may strengthen the trend in which federal agencies use spes to budget offline nd not show or record the full cost of obligations of the government budget rules are ambiguous about how to identify government liabilities in public private ventures in its february 2003 report cbo describes several cases in which federal agencies launched programs without scoring or counting the full scope of the governments liabilities for example cbo estimates that dod has used publicp rivate ventures to obtain about 23 billion in military housing while recording 255 million in obligations almost ten to one ratio in the case of the tanker lease the ratio would be even more dramatic assuming that the lease is scored as an operating lease omb has not taken an official position on whether the lease should be scored as an operating or capital lease httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs65 138see omb circular a11

ensure that the budgetary and financial implications of leas were fully considered by decision makers based on current rules cbo scor leases when legislation is being considered and omb scores leases upon actment or when the government makes contractual commitment cbo has proposed that all leases be authorized individually139 in the tanker lease legislation the air force had two ways to get approval of the proposal with authoriza tion and appropriation language or new start notification the air force chose the latter simpler route questions about whether the pr oposed lease is good deal for the government some observers have questi oned whether the lease is good deal for the government as lease or as way to ac quire tankers gao and others have raised concerns about the lack of competition for both the lease and the support cost package to meet c oncerns within the administration the institute for defense analysis was commissioned to assess the price air forces lease price is higher than commercial rates on july 24 2003 john plueger ceo of internationa l leases finance corporation large company that leases 600 jet aircraft to about 160 airlines worldwide testified to the house armed services committee about how commercial leases work in light of todays oversupply of commercia l aircraft john plueger sugge sted that lease of 100 widebody aircraft like the 767 par ticularly to the us government the most creditworthy buyer would certainly command the highest concession levels offered by any aircraft manufacturer for commercialcivilian airliners140 mr plueger suggested that commercial l ease rates on new widebody aircraft like the 767 generally range from about fivetenth s to eight tenths of percentage point per month times the cost of the aircraft141 if that rate were applied to the air forces estimated fair market value of the 767 tanker an average of about 165 million inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs66 142crs calculations based on air force briefing for cost of lease 277 million per plane per year and plueger formula in testimony 143boeing has estimated these costs but the figu res are proprietary boeing would complete aircraft under construction and deliver them to wilmington trust who would then sell the aircraft proceeds from those sales would go to the bondholders in the and b tranchescurrent dollars the cost of the air force lease would range from 59 million to 95 million per aircraft per sixyear lease or about 35 to 57 of its value the air force is planning to pay about 90 of the aircrafts market value or about 40 to 60 more than suggested by the commercial formula142 in competitive market why would the air force negotiate lease at 90 of the value of the aircraft for lease that would use the aircraft for less than onequarter of its useful life according to the air force the lease price was negotiated in order to minimize the amount of the loan that w ould need to be repaid to bondholders at the end of the lease that deci sion in turn was designed to l imit the am ount of funds that would be loaned at the high est rate estimated to be 10 junk bond rate to cover the risk that the air force would not buy the plane at the end of the lease instead of negotiating the lease price to reflect the usage either the length of time or the amount of hours flown the ai r force negotiated the price to minimize financing costs and to make it easier for th air force to find resources to buy the aircraft at the end of the lease proposed cancellation payments the proposed contract for the lease includes substantial penalties for cancelling the lease which could make it difficult for the air force to cancel according to the proposed contract the air force would be liable to make special payment or penalty charges of an additional years lease costs in case of cancellation at the height of the lease those payments would be about 27 billi on see table 8 in addition the air force would be liable for unamortized costs incurred by the contractor on aircraft that were planned to be built but where boeing had not yet started cons truction the air force has not estimated those costs143 table 8

aircraft would be 162 million in current year dollars the same as the last 20 in the 100 lot buyto congress the air force acknowledged th at on this basis the gap would widen between the cost of the lease and buy in terms in both present value and current dollars as discussed previously other changes in other assumptions that would affect the comparison of costs made in the air force analysis were debated within the administration including whether to assume progress payment ra closer to standard rates for air force aircraft programs rather th an the rates desired by boeing whether to compute inflation base d on progress payments rather than compounded to the amount experienced at the time when the entire set of aircraft was completed as the air force assumed and whether to decrease the governments imputed cost of insurance belowcommercial rates to reflect lower risk if these assumptions are changed the gap be tween the cost of the lease compared to multiyear grows from 39 billion to 57 billion in current dollars see table 9 hence by opting for lease the air force would be agreeing to pay premium of from 19 to 27 more in order to have the convenience of paying lower amounts in earlier years if the air force were to spend the lease dollars on aircraft rather than exploiting the lease in order to pay less in earlier ears those additional dollars could purchase about 35 more tankers 144 table 9 cost of lease vs multiyear buy and alternate assumptions in billions of dollarspercent difference cost of air force lease optioncost of non multiyear buy with air

washington 2003 22 p this document is available on the internet at wwwwhitehousegovombcircularsa094a094pdf appendix b net present value npv analysis151 net present value npv analysis is method of calculating and comparing costs that takes into account the time valu of money the time value of money refers to the fact that dollar available today ie in the present is worth more than dollar available in the future because inflation reduces the purchasing power of money over time and because m oney available today can be invested to generate and return and grow over time npv analysis essentially adjusts the value of future sums of money to account for the inve stment value of money over time both businesses and governments use npv analysis governments can use npv analysis for comparing spending op tions that involve making payments in differing years the office of management and budget omb instructs executive branch agencies to use npv analysis in comparing the costs of leasing and procurement options this guidance is provided in omb circ ular a94 which sets forth guidelines for executive branch ag encies to use in conducting benefitcost analyses and evaluating federal programs152 since procurement options usually involve making relatively large payments in the nearer term while leasing options usually involve making series of sma ller payments over longer period of time omb officials and financial analysts elsewhere believe that npv analysis by accounting for the time value of money pr ovides for methodologically more fair comparison alternatives to npv analysis include nominal unadjusted analysis and real ie inflationadjusted analysis since procurement options us ually involve making relatively large payments in the nearer term while leasing options usually involve making series smaller payments over longer period of time nominal cost comparisons tend to be the least favorable to leasing options real cost comparisons tend to be somewhat more favorable to leasing options and npv cost comparisons tend to be the most favorable to leasing options to illustrate the differences between nominal real and npv cost comparisons consider simplified example involving hypot hetical options for procuring or leasing four airplanes for purposes of the example assume that the four planes have total of procurement cost of 500 ie they co st an average 125 each to procure that under the procurement option the planes would be purchased using two annual payments of 250 and that under the leasin g option the planes would be leased for period of 5 years with annual lease paym ents of 108 per year assume also that the anticipated rate of inflation during this fiveyear period is 2 per year and that the anticipated nominal rate of return on investments during this period is 5 per year ie 3 per year more than the anticipated rate of inflation what are the comparative costs of these two optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs76 in nominal ie unadjusted calcu lation also called thenyear dollar calculation neither the effect of infla tion on eroding purchasing power nor the investment value of money over time is taken into account and the cost comparison looks like this option year 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year 5 total procure 250 250 500 lease 108 108 108 108 108 540 as can be seen in the table when calculated this way the lease option is 40 more expensive than the procurement option in real calculation which adjusts the valu of sums of money in future years to account for how inflation in this case at 2 per year erodes the purchasing power of those sums the cost comparison looks like this option year 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year 5 total procure 250 24500 49500 lease 108 10584 10372 10165 9962 51883 as can be seen in the table when antic ipated inflation is taken into account the difference in cost between the two opti ons is reduced from the 40 shown in the nominal calculation to 2383 the entries in this table can be used to answer questions such as what is the purchasin g power in todays prices of 108 in year 5 the answer is that assuming 2 annual rate of infl ation 108 in year 5 would purchase 9962 worth of goods in todays prices in an npv calculation which adjusts the values of sums of money in future years to account for the investment valu of money over time in this case 5 annual return on investment the cost comparison looks like this option year 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year 5 total procure 250 23810 48810 lease 108 10286 9796 9329 8885 49096 as can be seen in the table when the investment value of money over time is taken into account the difference in cost be tween the two options is reduced from the 40 shown in the nominal calculation to 286 the entries in the npv table can be used to answer questions such as what sum of money if invested today at 5 annual rate of retur n would grow to nominal total of 108 in year 5 the answer is that 8885 if invested today at 5 rate of return would grow to nominal total of 108 dollars by year 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs77 153for more on npv analysis see the following internet sites wwwtoolkitcchcomtextp06_6530asp

shown in the table above the np v of the procurement option is 48810 while the npv of the lease option is 49096 what these npvs mean is that spending 48810 now ie in the present is the same from financial point of view as spending 250 now and 250 next year while spending 49096 now is the same from financial point of view as spending 108 per year for the next five years the annual rate of return on investment used in an npv analysis is called the discount rate because this is the rate at which the value of future sums of money is adjusted downward ie discounted di scount rates can be expressed in nominal terms so as to include the annual inflation ra or in real terms so as to show the rate of return above the anticipated infla tion rate the example discussed here used nominal discount rate of 5 which was quivalent to real discount rate of 3 ie 5 minus the anticipat ed inflation rate of 2 the higher the discount rate the great er the reduction in value over time consequently key factor in npv analysis is to choose the correct discount rate153httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs78 154this section prepared by ronald orourke specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division 155multiyear contracting for acquisition of services is covered in 10 usc 2306cappendix c multiyear procurement myp154 what is myp and how does it di ffer from annual contracting three key differences multiyear procurement myp also called multiyear contracting is special contracting authority that congress approves for few major dod procurement programs the statute coveri ng multiyear contracting for acquisition of property is 10 usc 2306b155 key differences between annual contracting which most dod procurement programs use and myp include the number of years of purchases covered authority for economic order quantity eoq purchases and termination liabilities contracts cover 2 to 5 years of planned purchases the principal difference between annual contracting and myp concerns the number of years of purchases that can be covered by single contract under annual contracting dod is permitted to sign contract to purchase more than single years purchase of weapon or platform and only after congress has provided the necessary funding for that years purchase under myp in contrast dod is permitted sign contr act covering two to five years of planned purchases of that weapon or pl atform including the initial years purchase that congress has already funded and one to four additional year s worth of planned purchases that will not be funded until congress passes the dod budgets for each of those future fiscal years as an example consider case in which do d plans to procure total of 40 airplanes during the 5year period fy2004fy2008 in annual quantities of 4 10 10 10 and 6 under annual contracting following enactment of an fy2004 dod budget that funds the procurement of the first 4 planes dod could si gn contract to purchase those 4 planes year later following enactment of an fy2005 budget that funds the procurement of the next 10 planes dod could sign second contract to purchase those 10 planes and so on under myp in contrast following enac tment of the fy2004 budget that funds the procurement of the first 4 planes dod coul d sign contract covering up to5 years of planned purchases all 40 planes even t hough congress at this point has funded the procurement of only the first 4 planes authority for economic order quantity eoq purchases second difference between annual contracting and myp is that programs approved for myp have the authority to make use of economic orde r quantity eoq purchasing eoq authority which is written into 10 usc 2306b permits programs using myp to make upfront batch purchases of certain components of all the we apons or platforms being procured under the myp contract so as to get better prices on those components from the subcontractors that provide them ordering components this way can be referred to as ordering them in economic quantities which after some reversing of word order leads to the acronym eoq eoq purchases are principal means by wh ich myp contracting reduces costs compared to annual contracting and programs approved for myp are expected to take advantage of eoq purchases so as to generate these savings as an illustration using the example from abov if dod has been granted authority to sign 5year myp covering the 40 plan planned for fy2004fy2008 dod might bundlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs79 156for general discussion of the full funding policy see crs report rl31404 defense procurement full funding policy back ground issues and options for congress by ronald orourke and stephen daggett washington 2002 updated november 21 2002 41 ptogether the 50 sets of landing gear intended fo r those planes and order them all together in fy2004 the initial year of the contract the fy2004 budget for the program consequently would include funding sufficient to procure not only the first 4 planes but 40 sets of landing gear as well in detailed presentation of the fy2004 budget request for the program the funding for the 40 sets of landing gear would appear as advanced procurement ap funding in support of the myp sometimes abbreviated as ap myp larger termination liability third way in which myp differs from annual contracting is that myp contracts can featur larger termination liabilities ie cancellation penalties than annual contracts these larger termination liabilities protect contractors from the financial consequences of decision by dod to change its mind in the middle of multi year procurement and not procure the minimum number of units each year established in the myp contract specifically the larger termin ation liability is intended to ensure that contractor is compensated for any investments in work force optimization and improved production equipment that the c ontractor has made as consequence of the governments myp commitment but which the contractor will longer be able to fully exploit due to dods change of mind the larger termination liability deters dod from changing its mind giving the contractor confidence th at dod will fulfill its myp commitment one similarity full funding policy still applies one way in which myp does not differ from annual contracting is that myp programs like annually contracted programs are subject to the full funding polic regarding defense procurement obtaining myp authority for program in other word s does not exempt that program from the requirement to fully fund each years worth of procurement the upfront eoq purchase in an myp program must also be fully f unded thus in the example above the fy2004 budget must fully fund the 4 planes being procured that year as well as the 40 sets of landing gear being purchased under eoq authority portion of the procurement cost of the 4 planes or the 40 sets of landing gear may be funded in fiscal year after fy2004 the fy2005 budget must fully fund the 10 planes to be procured in fy2005 minus the cost of their landing gears which were paid for in fy2004 and portion of their procurement cost may be funded in fiscal year after fy2005 and so on156 how does use of myp reduce cost using myp generally reduces the procurement cost of the items covered under the myp contract in two ways one way discussed above is by reducing the cost of components that are procured upfront in larg batches through the use of the eoq authority that comes with myp the second way that using myp generally reduces the procurement cost of the items covered under the myp contract is by giving the prime contractor the confidence to make investments in work force optimization nd improved production equipment that the contractor would not be able to justify making in situation of annual contracting under annual contracting the prime contractor faces some uncertainty about whether procurements planned for future years will actually happen myp reduces that certainty and thus makes it less risky for the contractor to make invest ments in work force optimization and improvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs80 production equipment that can reduce unit produc tion costs but would make economic sense for the contractor ie generate sufficient return on investment for the contractor only if the contractor produces cert ain minimum number of units over period of several years investments in work force optimization can in volve providing extra training to workers to improve their productivity or keeping on the payroll highly productive workers who might be laid off after completing their portion of th work involved in producing single years worth of production investments in improved production equipment can involve purchasing new machine tools that make components more quickly more accurately or with less waste how much does use of myp reduce costs savings from use of myp vary from program to program but typically they can reduce the combined procurement cost of th items being procured under the myp contract by 5 to 10 significant share of this savings is achieved by using the eoq authority that comes with myp if an myp progra m uses delayed and thus smaller eoq than would be typical for the program possibility discussed in the main body of this report then the total savings in procurement costs achi eved would likely be smaller than the typical 5 to 10 why not use myp for all dod procurement programs if using myp can reduce the cost of do d procurement program why does congress grant authority only sparingly for few dod programs one reason is that congress as general practice prefers to avoid taking actions that commit future congresses to particular course of action which is sometimes called tying the hands of future congresses permitting the use of myp on program effectively ties the hands of future congresses with respect to that program by committing future congresses to procuring certain minimum number of units over period of several years in addition to tying the hands of future congresses myp by effectively locking program into place for several years reduces the dods and congress options for making adjustments particularly downward adjustment s to the dod budget to respond to changing military needs or budgetary circumstances dod and congress usually cannot make substantial downward adjustment s to myp programs unless they are prepared to incur the sizeable termination liability costs that can be written into myp contracts as result any changes that dod or congress might need to make to the dod budget to respond to changing circumstances will now fall more heavily on the nonmyp programs in the dod budget the larger the number of dod programs that are approved for myp the more heavily the remaining nonmyp programs might have to bear the burden of any downward adjustment in the dod budget shifting all do d procurement programs or many of them to myp would eliminate or significantly reduce dods and congress flexibility in adjusting the dod budget in future years to respond to changing circumstances thus in considering dod request for my p authority for particular procurement program congress balances the potential savings that can be achieved by using myp on the program against the effect that approving the use of myp would have in tying the hands of future congresses and reducing dods and congress flexibility in making adjustments to the dod budget in the future to respond to changing circumstances this weighing of potential advantages and disadvantages traditi onally has resulted in situation where only few major dod procurement programs at any one time are given myp authority while most dod procurement programs use annual contracting how does congress approve myphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs81 defense appropriation act subsection l3 of 10 usc 2306b states that the head of an agency may not initiate multiy ear procurement contract for any system or component thereof if the value of th multiyear contract would exceed 500000000 unless authority for the contract is specifica lly provided in an appropriations act the appropriation act that usually provides myp au thority for dod procurement programs is the annual defense appropriation act the authority is usually granted through provision in title v iii of the act which is the general provisions title in recent years it has been section 8008 in the fy2003 defense appropriations act for example section 8008 provided myp authority for the air force c130 cargo plan program the armys family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv program and th navys fa18ef strike fighter aircraft program defense authorization act subsection i3 of 10 us c 2306b states that in the case of the department of defense multiyear contract in an amount equal to or greater than 500000000 may not be entered into for any fiscal year under this section unless the contract is specifically authorized by law in an act other than an appropriations act the act other than an appropriations act wher dod myp contracts are authorized is usually the defense authorization act in the defense authorization act myp is authority is usually granted on programbyprogram basis through parate sections in title i of the act the procurement title in the fy2003 defense aut horization act for example myp authority was provided for the air force c130 cargo plane program in section 131 for the armys fmtv program in section 113 and for dod pr ocurement of certain chemicals relating to the us space program in section 826 in addition section 121 of the act extended the duration of previously authorized myp for the navys ddg51 destroyer program associated committees given that myp authority for dod procurement program is usually provided through provis ions in both the defense appropriation and authorization bills the granting of myp authority for dod procurement program usually reflects favorable recommendation on the issue by the committees with principal jurisdiction over these two bills the house and senate appropriations committees and the house and senate armed services committees respectively what criteria do programs need to meet to qualify for myp subsection of 10 usc 2306b sets forth 6 criteria that dod procurement programs need to meet to qualify for myp to the extent that funds are otherwise available for obligation the head of an agency may enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of property whenever the head of that agency finds each of the following 1 that the use of such contract will result in substantial savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out th program through annual contracts 2 that the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of production rate procurement rate and total quantities 3 that there is reasonable expect ation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency w ill request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation 4 that there is stable design for the property to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with such property are not excessivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32056crs82 5 that the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of multiyear contract are realistic 6 in the case of purchase by the department of defense that the use of such contract will promote the national security of the united states criterion 1 is intended to disqualify prog rams where the anticipated savings from using myp are relatively minor and thus not worth the consequences in terms of tying the hands of future congresses and reducing dods and congresss flexibility for making adjustments to future dod budgets in response to changing circumstances the clause previously required minimum anticipated sa vings of 10 but was changed in the early 1990s to requirement for substantial savings which in practice might be understood to mean at least 5 or so and preferably something closer to minimum of10 criterion 2 is intended to disqualify programs where there might be significant risk of dod changing its mind about the need for procuring the item in the annual and total quantities set forth in the myp contract due to changing military requirements decision which could incur sizeable termination liab ility criterion 3 is similarly intended to disqualify programs where there might be si gnificant risk of dod changing its mind about the need for procuring the item in the annua l quantities set forth in the myp contract due to services inability to fully fund the prog ram criterion 4 is intended to disqualify programs where there might be significant risk of incurring the potentially high costs associated with issuing change orders to alter the design of weapons and platforms that are under construction
