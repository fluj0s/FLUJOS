ipcc working group i fourth assessment report expert and government review comments on the secondorder draft chapter 6 batch ab 15 june 2006 peck eystein keith ricardo valerie bette dominique david fortunat stefan dick olga notes the following table of expert and government review comments are for consideration by the chapter author teams they require formal response to each comment from the team and those responses will be archived responding to review comments and record keeping the chapter writing teams must consider all review comments and record an agreed response in the following table this may be done by discussing the more general and substantive comments among the whole author team and then allocating responsibilities for responding to specific comments to the relevant authors note that responses should be understandable by someone scrutinizing the archived comments file after the report has been finalized responses should generally be brief but clear the following or similar styles of responses are suggested where the authors agree with the comment and have made corresponding change accepted without comment eg in case of minor modifications or with brief comments eg where partially accepted where the authors agree with the comment and changes are not necessary or changes are made in different section taken into account with brief explanation eg see section xy where the comment does not require specific change or the issue is already dealt with in the draft change necessary with brief explanation where appropriate eg covered in next paragraph covered in section xy where the authors do not agree with suggested change rejected always with brief explanation eg insufficient literature to support this outside scope of section outside purview and competence of wg1 etc where dealing with very similar comments or common thread of comments from one reviewer and response has been given to the corresponding earlier comments see comment xy only where it is clear that the reviewer is not suggesting specific revision to the chapter noted with or without comments it is recommended that you do not use names of individual members of the author team in the final responses to comments ie responses should represent the entire chapter team where comment involves another chapter please liaise with the authors of that chapter as appropriate but retain the comment and response in the comment file that you were sent ie do not transfer comments please provide the technical support unit with the completed version of this document as single electronic file by august 4 2006 batcpageline comment notes h from to 61 00 00 this chapter exemplifies the issues that the authors must face there is complexity in the cliamate system that cannot be solely explained by the prevailing humanocentric theory the inconsistenices deriving from this complexity are the basis of the comments there is lot of work to be done lee gerhard reviewers comment id 837 62 00 00 very impressive chapter congratulations reto knutti reviewers comment id 13350 63 00 00 this chapter does not discuss changes in precipitation for which data are available for the last 1000 years i suggest to discuss this issue in this chaper for example in section 66 which at this point only has subsection on temperature use ful reference would be treydte et 2006 nature p 1179 doi101038nature04743 and references therein rolf m√ºller reviewers comment id 18136 61113 b 00 00 you should have clear description of the potential problems with millennial proxy reconstructions tree rings are well dated but may not be accurate thermometers reconstructions from nearby sites may differ dramatically and overall results may be undul stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30910 61114 b 00 00 as matter of prudence it seems risky to for ipcc to permit section lead authors to publicize and rely heavily on their own work especially when the ink is barely dry on the work in particular osborn and briffa 2006 which is by one of the section lead authors was published only in february 2006 and is presented in the second order draft without even being presented in the first order draft nonetheless it has been relied on to construct the important box 64 figure 1 this is risky osborn and briffa 2006 uses some very questionable proxies including the infamous mann pc1 i have also been unable to verify some of the claimed correlations to gridcell temperature one of the authors excuses is that they incorrectly cited the hadcru2 temperature data set while they actually used the crutem2 data set and that the some of the hadcru2 data was spurious this hardly gives grounds for comfort the point made in box 64 figure 1 is also argumentative if the relative warmth of mwp and modern periods is inessential to any conclusions reached by ipcc i would urge you to delete this figure and related commentary stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30911 61115 b 00 00 it seems very unwise to to waive ipcc wg1 policies on publication guidelines especially for lead authors for example osborn and briffa 2006 did not meet the december deadline for being published or in print it was not even mentioned in the first draft nor was it available from tsu as part of the first draft process other citations in the chapter did not meet the december deadline for being published or in press as at the december draft meeting osborn and briffa 2006 wahl et 2006 wahl and ammann 2006 hegerl et accepted several did not meet the february dropdead date for providing tsu with preprint wahl and ammann 2006 hegerl et accepted the version of wahl and ammann 2006 as accepted differeed dramatically from the version provided to tsu for both the first order and second order drafts notably in respect to the inclusion of their calculation of mbh verification statistics confirming the results of mcintyre and mckitrick showing failure of mbh verification statistics that had previously been denied stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30912 61116 b 00 00 the version of hegerl et accepted has been switched and the proxy reconstruction presented in chapter 6 relies on their submission to j climate which had not been accepted as of april 2006 rather than their nautre article the articles were switched at the wg1 website between drafts the nature article does not provide details mentioned in the second order draft noncompliance with wg1 publication deadlines especially in favor of publications by ipcc lead authors and their associates is unfair to other authors who might also have sought waivers from published guidelines stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 309120 64 00 darrigo et 2006 revisited many highlatitude treering sites in the northern hemisphere and updated records many of their records failed to track the recent instrumental warming this is the socalled divergence problem and is wellknown in the treering community many possible explanations exist including pollution damage recently an early but timedecreasing co2fertilization effect rising drought stress recently or nonlinear sensitivity of treering indicators to temperature darrigo in comments to the us nrc panel studying this noted that temperaturesensitive trees are rare and restrictedperhaps with sufficient warming trees move out of the temperaturesensitive band into regions where primary control of growth arises from other factors with weaker temperature sensitivity notably with the major exception of the pollutiondamage hypothesis most of the hypotheses for the divergence problem cast doubt on the temperature reconstructions for warm times of the past allowing the possibility that warming exceeded reconstructed levels and the trees did not capture the full variability it is clear that the divergence problem is not uniform for all observed treering records in all places but there is little doubt that proxyonly reconstruction would not fully capture the instrumentally observed warming of the last two decades of the twentieth century omitting discussion of this shortcoming especially while highlighting shortcomings of other indicators that likely are doing better than the treesglaciers for example are shrinking very rapidly while instrumentally observed temperatures rise gives skewed view of the state of the science i believe that discussion of the divergence problem is absolutely essential for the chapter richard b alley reviewers comment id 49 65 00 despite these comments the writing team has done an outstanding job with difficult topic and should be congratulated richard b alley reviewers comment id 410 66 00 overall this chapter is wellwritten and comprehensive the posing of specific questions at the start of each section is appreciated the authors do need however to check that they answer the questions they pose even if only to say that it cannot be answered with current knowledgedata etc govt of australia reviewers comment id 2001300 67 00 two significant gaps in the relevant palaeoliterature are apparent in reading of the sod first aside from good treatment of greenhouse gases and the long record from the epica ice core there is body of southern hemisphere particularly highlatitude antarctic palaeoclimate information that is not represented secondly the issue of abrupt climate change and phasing of hemispheric response lacks generally clear definition of what is meant by the phasing issue and specifically mention of connection between nh dansgaard oeschger events and antarctic counterparts including key paper on phasing morgan et science 29718621864 2002 the additional sh palaeoclimate information is mostly nontemperature related and so is recommended for inclusion in section 665 p 638 and following the treatment of abrupt climate change and antarctic phasing is difficult as it relates to number of comments spread across the chapter concentrated on page 611 and pages 618619 it could involve box to draw together both the oceanic and icecore evidence in one place or it could be treated as an addition around page 611 line 2832 as suggested below for simplicity govt of australia reviewers comment id 2001301 68 00 the authors have missed some useful references for proxy climate information from corals for windows of the more distant past ie not just the past few centuries eg felis et 2004 nature 429 164168 gagan et 2004 quaternay international 118119 127143 mcgregor gagan 2004 geophys res lett govt of australia reviewers comment id 2001302 69 00 although i recognize the space constraints i cant help but think that figure showing the geologic time scale and the boundaries would be helpful for general science reader this would help place much of the material within the chapter in context for the expert reader there are references to epoch boundaries throughout the document and given that boundaries change and are redefined eg petm from lptm it may be useful to include specific definition of the geologic time scale used just simple suggestion kb averyt reviewers comment id 83 610 00 chapter 6 is almost entirely devoted to late quaternary paleoclimate with just 2 pages on the prequaternary 69 610 section 31 even those 2 pages are unsatisfactory because while two of the three sections on the mid pliocene warming and the 55 ma methane discharge are ok as they stand these are unusual events in the climate history of the last 100 million years section 631 on prequaternary co2 through cenozoic times is not ok for several reasons for the chapter to pass review in an international journal the prequaternary section would need review of co2 history that provided authoritative analysis and an overview that puts the two selected paleoclimate events in the context of high co2high temperature cretaceousearly cenozoic climate shifting to the lowco2 lowtemperature state of the last 30 million years peter barrett reviewers comment id 121 611 00 1 chapter 6 focuses on the earths climate primarily in the recent past the last 2 million years it does well in addressing variability during the last two millennia the holocene the last 10000 years and the late part of the quaternary period the last 2600000 years for the last 800000 years ice cores show that the earths climate has been characterized by 100000year oscillations of temperature and co2 gas concentration within the narrow range of 5 deg c and 100 ppmv sea level varied in step through 120 m as consequence of bipolar ice sheets growing and shrinking the record can be extended back in time through the deepsea oxygen isotope record which shows early quaternary and older oscillations to have had 40000 year frequency with about 13 of the amplitude in temperature and sea level change peter barrett reviewers comment id 122 612 00 2 however this chapter treats the period prior to the ice core record of the last 800000 years in just 2 of the 43 pages of text it is argued in the introduction of the current text that most space is provided for recent paleoclimatic history because uncertainties become smaller towards the present and i accept that data from the distant past are of much lower quality and far more difficult to confidently place in context apart from growth features like tree rings corals and varves however these data are more than adequate to show us in some detail that climate was profoundly different in earlier times and that reviewing paleoclimates beyond the last million years should qualify for serious analysis and maybe even equal space because we will be living with those co2 levels in little more than decade peter barrett reviewers comment id 123 613 00 3 indeed by 2015 we will be experiencing co2 levels of over 400 ppmv which the earth last experienced over 25 million years ago according to estimates of atmospheric co2 from 3 different marine geochemical proxies covering the last 65 million years pearson palmer 2000 demicco et 2003 pagani et 2005 section 631 reviews the relationship between co2 and temperature in prequaternary time rather poorly providing analysis of the validity of the various proxies furthermore figure 61c that supports this section has been changed since the first draft to include co2 estimates from pedogenic carbonate over the last 30 million years that are as yet unpublished and are also very different from all other records for this interval the differences are not addressed or resolved in the text this section makes also little attempt to evaluate the causes of co2 change through time omitting for example seminal review on the topic by et 2002 it also obscures the key point made by crowley and berner 2001 that the firstorder agreement between the co2 record and continental glaciation continues to support the conclusion that co2 has played an important role in longterm climate change peter barrett reviewers comment id 124 614 00 4 to find out what the earth will be like next century when co2 levels have more than doubled it would be useful to review the high co2 high temperature world of the cretaceous and early cenozoic 130 to 34 million years ago perhaps starting with barrera and johnsons compilation on evolution of the cretaceous oceanclimate system 1999 and huber et als warm climates in earth history 1999 peter barrett reviewers comment id 125 615 00 5 some will say that the geography of the time was significantly different but plate movements can be backtracked over the last 150 million years to recreate continentocean geometry as accurate as the best current gcms as i mentioned in my response to the first draft of this chapter indeed the petroleum industry funds research into recreating past geography and climate back to 400 million years in the search for more oil peter barrett reviewers comment id 126 616 00 6 from the viewpoint of life on earth prothero 1992 has argued that the most profound climate change since the cretaceous has been the shift from greenhouse to icehouse 34 million years ago an event comprehensively documented in prothero et eds 2002 this has been more significant than the 5 degc temperate rise from the methane discharge 55 million years ago which perturbed the climate system for 100000 years before returning to its previous warm high co2 state peter barrett reviewers comment id 127 617 00 7 from geological perspective then this chapter would be greatly enhanced if it looked beyond its assessment of past behaviour of the present climate system over the last 800000 years which is likely to be with us for only another decade or two and sought insight on what is likely to happen beyond peter barrett reviewers comment id 128 618 00 8 the short section on prequaternary climate is of concern for what it does not consider giving the impression that paleoclimate has more to offer than two brief paragraphs one on what can be gained from the mild midpliocene warming and other on an explosive methane discharge 55 million years ago an event that has some similarities with the meteorite impact 65 million years ago the methane discharge is estimated to have injected as much carbon as will the burning of all remaining fossil fuels over the next two centuries and hence is useful warning however the section provides awareness of the profound change that current ipcc projections indicate from icehouse to greenhouse in the next century and that seems to weakness that needs to be remedied peter barrett reviewers comment id 129 619 00 references barrera johnson cc evolution of the cretaceous oceanclimate

00 despite discussing climate sensitivity in several sections the chapter do not give an assessment of the range or best guess for global mean of climate sensitivity as paleoclimate can contribute lot to such an assessment many paleoclimatologists attended the ipcc workshop on climate sensitivity paris july 2004 the proceedings of this workshop states on page 31 past climates offer some guidance to climate sensitivity estimates generally fall in range of equilibrium temperature change of 24 k for 2xco2 therefore we strongly feel that there already is an agreement on as well as an evidence of the climate sensitivity from paleoclimate please give conclusion on the global average of climate sensitivity both in the chapter and in the executive summary fits best on page 5 line 9 which should be in line with the proceedings of the mentioned workshop we propose to use the two sentences given above govt of germany reviewers comment id 201113 627 00 some of the findings of paleoclimate are highly relevant especially for the attribution of causes of climate change but the figures illustrating the information are often inappropriate to communicate the robust findings easily examples are figures 69 and 610c please put an effort in making the figure message clearer and asily to understand so that it will be possible to use these figures in the spm govt of germany reviewers comment id 201114 628 00 i know that authors have received plenty of comments and that it is difficult to take all into account nevertheless i am frustrated to see that 90 of my comments on fod were considered as irrelevant i will then limit my comments on the sod to few generalities joel guiot reviewers comment id 921 629 00 overall this is an excellent chapter danny harvey reviewers comment id 10142 630 00 this chapter has undergone really great improvement the ice core data is now involved in the text and the text is pedagogic written the introducing part with statements is good approach in the previous draft the epica data was hardly not mentioned but now they are showing up on relevant places in the text there are though some remains of the old text which needs some more work per holmund reviewers comment id 1084 631 00 it is hard to see how the chapter could be shortened in any meaningful way each of the topics is fairly succinctly described and cutting some topics would reduce the overall impact of the chapter new scientific results are presented and discussed repectively to the tar and credible job is done of summarizing relevant recent work in each of the topics with enough material on earlier work to in most cases put the newer studies in context without going beyond the specific scope wg1 mandate i just have few very minor comments that i listed above the only quibble about the chapter concerns section 66 that might be too wordy with too much details for expample too much details are given about each study concerning the data and methods for northern hemisphere temperature but overall the paper does an outstanding job at its stated objectives myriam khodri reviewers comment id 1266 632 00 maybe it should be checked for coherency when giving the range of

summary of the mcintyre and mckitrick work while some of the problems in the fod have been corrected the sod text still misses the mark the main points of the debate are ignored or inaccurately summarized and the text appears to place undue reliance on the new amman and wahl paper while skipping much of the discussion that has taken place in the bulk of the literature this is an important section of the ar4 and will be closely scrutinized so please take the necessary time to sort it out i will be ccing copies of this section of my comments to some of the responsible officials in the us and canadian governments so that they are aware of the criticisms that have been lodged of the sod version when they examine the subsequent draft ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17426 634 00 the references should be checked i found reference in the list that was removed from the text usoskin et prl raimund muscheler reviewers comment id 1851 635 00 once again i would like to congratulate the authors for their great job from numeros data sources they have put togehter an excelletn text that nicely illustrates the role of paleoclimate in globalchange research michael schulz reviewers comment id 2291 636 00 this chapter differs from earlier ones in that it brings in modelling and attribution as well as paleoclimatological measurements the arguments for doing it are reasonable and it makes for complete readable chapter but it does make for rather uneven report since we are told here how models whose fundamental nature is not described until later chapter reproduce the more distant past but we are not told in earlier chapters how well models reproduce the betterobserved past 50 or 100 years adrian simmons reviewers comment id 24295 637 00 the general style of the introductory sections of this chapter is rather different than that of previous chapters with more general introduction to the subject and justification for it and generalities such as paleoclimatologists always strive to generate page 617 line 17 theres problem with the style per but again it makes for rather uneven report adrian simmons reviewers comment id 24296 638 00 i think that the choice of the authors should have been done while trying to encompass wider range of scientits in the field specially in paleoceanography it strikes as rather odd that 1 of the lead authors and 3 of the contributing ones belong to the same research group in gif sur yvette and two more are from bergen if the ipcc is to represent the view of the scientific community much more care should be given to represent the views of the whole community govt of spain reviewers comment id 2019105 639 00 there is excessive use of expressions in the text denoting lack of certainty in the research findings discussedd an example is the following comment govt of spain reviewers comment id 2019106 640 00 the definition of the quaternary is not consistent with that in chapter 1 and with the latest recommendiations from the internationl commission on stratigraphy and inqua the onset of the quaternary is 26 ma govt of spain reviewers comment id 2019110 641 00 the use of the abbreviation lgm for last glacial maximum is not consistent throughout the text govt of spain reviewers comment id 2019130 642 00 i have four chief concerns with this chapter first there are numerous important references left out and an overemphasis on papers by the authors themselves which do not accurately reflect the communities view in general the certainty with which this chapter presents our understanding of abrupt climate change is overstated there is confusion between hypothesis and evidence throughout the chapter and great deal of confusion on the difference between an abrupt climate change and possible hypothetical cuases of such climate changes eg heinrich events second the use of the terms very likely likely etc are not in conformance with the rest of the ipcc document some things that are virtually certain are listed as likely and mere hypotheses largely untested are listed as very likely this carelessness does not add credibility to this chapter third extensive reference is made to very few recent papers that have not yet been thoroughly considered by the scientific community and whose relevance to future climate is in my judgement greatly overstated finally the choice of words to define or not define in the glossary is strange definition and very poor one of heinrich events is given but there is definition for holocene even though that term is used throughout the text i would additionally note that overall the chapter does fine job at dealing with the hockey stick controversy but very poor job dealing with abrupt climate change and its possible relevance to the future there are numerous glaring omissions of citations notably mention is made of the work by wunsch seager and battisti challenging the standard broeckertype hypothesis for abrupt climate change eric steig reviewers comment id 2521 643 00 chapter 6 on paleoclimate includes most important aspects of past climate change and the most relevant to discuss for an ipcc assessment it is well written and easy to follow however sometimes rather short discussion and referencing some aspects of proxy records used are missing govt of sweden reviewers comment id 202010 644 00 several key researches

chapter 6 the executive summary is in the format of five questions for the chapter 8 question there is also summary paragraph at the end of the reply in the case of several of the boxes in chapter 3 there are also summaries an inconsistent structure conveys message of lack of coordination between chapters secondly the approach of highlighting key findings in the chapeau provides important points to readers that may be skimming the chapter for salient points recommend that the executive summary of all chapters follow consistent structure chapter 3 serves as good example to follow govt of united states of america reviewers comment id 2023354 647 00 throughout chapter 6 the authors need to make sure to be absolutely clear whether past climatic conditions cited in the text originate from proxy data spatial reconstructions or paleoclimatic models this is currently unclear in many parts of the chapter leading readers to believe that modeled temperatures are based directly on proxy data and vice versa govt of united states of america reviewers comment id 2023355 648 00 it is clear in reading this chapter that it was written by multiple authors exercising varying degrees of scientific rigor the coordinating lead authors need to exercise stronger role in implementing consistency in both the writing and the scientific integrity of the chapter for example if there is not sufficient data to conduct attribution studies of southern hemisphere warming over the last 700 years page 34 lines 4850 how can page 23 lines 4348 compare global reconstructions with the late 20th century also the coordinating lead authors need to make sure that the spm is completely consistent with chapter 6 govt of united states of america reviewers comment id 2023356 649 00 this chapter will go long way to integrate paleoclimatic data into the climate change debate however to inform policymakers this chapter must reveal the limitations on how well we can truly identify the leads lags contemporaneous relations and rates of change recorded by disparate paleoclimatic proxy records dating uncertainties and temporal resolution influence our ability to develop the coherent paleoclimatic reconstructions used to identify the physical mechanisms for the observed changes to be fully transparent this chapter must identify the limitations as well as the findings govt of united states of america reviewers comment id 2023357 650 00 in general the use of tree rings for climate reconstruction is problematic for reasons that are not addressed in the report there are strong probabilistic relationships between paleoclimatic records including treerings and climate because of this relationship tree rings provide one of the strongest paleoclimatic proxy records when given through appropriate statistical treatment this should be addressed in the final paragraph of section 6214 all paleoclimatic proxy methods have limitations and these limitations need to be adequately addressed in section 6214 chapter 6 needs to provide an explicit explanation of what we know how well we know it and what we cannot know through paleoclimatic records govt of united states of america reviewers comment id 2023358 651 00 the authors of the chapter have done great job in providing balanced and concise assessment of paleoclimate information relevant to climate change policy add brief discussion or mention of paleo records for interactions and feedbacks between deglacial and holocene climate change and terrestrial carbon cycle increasing evidence from peatlands suggests that peat carbon store and

which is important for predicting the future changes recognition of ice core records as well as surface temperature changes have generally done well however strongly biassed ideas were included in the section where the last glacial sealevel changes are discussed number of recent developments done by international community are ignored and the discussions described in the section is single sided

comment id 24842 659 21 general comments this is verylong chapter longer than it should be for thepurpose of ipcc i can only provide partial comments before the deadline because of illness the chapter is very well written and an excellent source material for someone who wants to know the up to date scoop on paleoclimatology but that material is not all necessary for ipcc i think the authors have erred in putting in two much regardless of the fact i am in keenly interstd in details at this stage wholesale slash and burn is probably not good idea but i think it would be good idea to go back over the material from the viewpoint as to whether definitife statement can be made that helps buttress ipcc claims if not shorten for example there is sidebar on the ice age co2 causes and learned discussion of some of the different positions but since we do not know the answer to the problem this can be shortened great deal causes unknown couple of examples of explanations certainly the lead and lag information is valuable also with respect to modeling studies for the last glacial cycle if we cannot say somethiing definitive keep it shorter this is just general guideline i dont want to sound too harsh on the authors because they have done lotof work and aas an author myself i know the difficulty of letting go and cutting favorite sections that are actually not critical but i thik they should at least give it try thomas crowley reviewers comment id 5115 660 21 executive summary well established statements should be more direct or affirmative style more direct with fewer words

probably been already largely discussed is the order of the sections in this summary as it is from older time and long time scales towards more recent times and shorter timescales i was wondering

10ma our own unpublished modeling work suggests such transition could have been effected by co2 level abou t240250 ppm ie our model can maintain different stabel state prior to that with relatively

projected temperatures vincent gray reviewers comment id 88676 685 226 i have looked through the draft chapter 6 and find it an impressive document however bullet 4 on page 62 starting global mean cooling and warming strikes as incorrect and misleading whereas the mean rate of temperature change over the pleistocene may have been 10 times slower than that projected for the next century there is clear evidence that for specific major climatic transitions global or at least hemispheric temperature changes in the past have been at least as rapid as those projected by climate model simulations and incorporated in the last ipcc report the most obvious case in point is the global warming at the start of the holocene ca 115 ka bp russell coope more than 20 years ago showed from beetles that uk temperatures rose faster than could be dated within the errors of 14c dating subsequently this was confirmed by greenland ice cores based on layer counting full glacial to interglacial in less than 100 years and by the cariacos basin marine record i have worked on varved lake records from both the tropics roberts et nature 1993 366 146148 and the mediterranean roberts et the holocene 2001 11 719734 where this climate transition was accomplished in substantially less than century in short several independent lines of evidence show that the climate system has been capable of flipping from one metastable state to another very different one over timescales that could be experienced by single human lifetime this is not an unimportant conclusion in terms of the potential for nonlinear responses of future climate to ghg forcing i also looked for supporting argument for bullet 4 later in chapter 6 but found nothing of substance in short this particular bullet seems in need of critical reassessment before the definitive version of the next ipcc report emerges or simpler still just cut it c neil roberts reviewers comment id 2161 686 228 228 took place at rate ten times

very specific models and forcings can reproduce the observed differential changes between northern and southern hemispheres but these are dependent on specific parameterisations in general then i and

may not be response and evidence for the abruptness is certainly not global to say that the dansgaardoeschger events have repercussions is statement of cause and effect which is not by any means

finding is bit overstated given the data limitations the time scales of all of the holocene warming events cited here are different than the time scale of the late 20th century warming there is lack of interannual resolution at global coverage for practically all of these events if in hand comparable warming over few decades could be discerned at other times in the holocene this mismatch in temporal scales and global coverage in the comparison of warm spells in the holocene with late 19th century warming needs to be addressed in section 6513 change sentence starting in line 14 to read however data coverage temporal resolution and age control of available proxy data make it impossible to discern if the earlier holocene contained 50 year periods of global warmth comparable to the late 20th century govt of united states of america reviewers comment id 2023364 6135 312 316 the summary says there are known holocene periods of synchronous global warmth comparable to the late 20th century this statement is taken from sct 6513 which poses the question of whether the midholocene was warmer than the present not whether there were synchronous warming periods thereby insinuating that there is period in the holocene in which global warmth is comparable to late 20th century such claim is not made or supported in the text first of all section 6612 concludes that deep soil temperature is good proxy for the annual sat on continents and that the spatial array of borehole locations is adequate to reconstruct the northern hemisphere mean sat the gst reconstruction of huang pollack and shen 1997 clearly indicates substantially higher midholocene optimum temperatures in globallysynchronous sample but this paper is not mentioned in section 6513 where the question is posed instead appeal is made to figure 69 which provides qualitative graphical summary of disparate group of selected proxybased studies when reference is made in chapter 6 to another paper using similar technique soon and baliunas the findings are dismissed on the grounds that the technique provides basis for quantitative ranking with the late 20th century the same is true here yet the authors still draw quantitative conclusion moreover globallysynchronous warming in the 78kybp interval is only contraindicated by the blue box representing the tropical pacific and indian oceans the alkenonebased evidence of kim et 2000 points to 3c warmer sst during this interval in the south pacific off chile and lagerklint et 2005 find similar results for the east equatorial south atlantic so the large blue box is an exaggeration of the spatial extent of the relative cold anomaly the paper by lorenz et only covers the last 7000 kybp so it does not provide support for ruling out synchronous changes over the entire interval referred toa misleading usage of the source ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17422 6136 312 16 argues that previous warm events are local or regional and not sufficiently

the level of confidence likely rather than very likely that was attributed to this conclusion in the tar to prevent the possibility that there be some confusion about the matter it needs to be explicitly mentioned that the ar4 conclusions are in agreement with those of the tar on this point in fact it should be noted that the conclusion here is stronger than that of the tar because the

conclusions regarding the spatial extent of warmth are any stronger than those regarding the magnitude of warmth both conclusions are based in large part on the same mostly treering climate proxy data and the limitations due to potential loss of lowfrequency variability in these data would seem to have equal impact on either conclusion if the increased information since the tar allows one of these conclusions to be elevated to the very likely category it elevates both conclusions to that category however it would be appropriately conservative to keep both in the likely category michael mann reviewers comment id 15613 6198 428 430 the basis for this statement is unclear the reasons for existing uncertainties have as much to do with possible limitations in the retention of lowfrequency variability by certain proxies eg treerings as they have to do with limitations the available spatial network of proxy information if the lowfrequency information in proxies such as corals and ice coreswhich give us information outside the extratropical land areas and during seasons other than summeris more reliable that the lowfrequency information in proxies such as treeringswhich are indeed more plentiful but confined largely to the extratropical land areas and providing information limited to growing season conditions which in many cases relate to summer temperaturethen it is possible that we have better lowfrequency information from the regions outside the continental centers and during seasons other than summer it is impossible to reject this possibility based on our current

have been run to equilibrium generally predict an increase in thc intensity in warmer climate after transient decrease i could dig up some references if asked thus the response during the pliocene could be quite different from what the models project as the climate warms over the next century and the models could still be correct comparison with the pliocene is still useful validation of

balance between the three principal techniques available for sealevel reconstructions fossil reef evidence benthic oxygen isotopes and icesheet modelling some may criticise and argue down the lambeck

the formal definition of heinrich hevent is an event during which icebergs originating from hudson strait deposited icebergrafted debris over large areas of the sea floor heinrich events occur at the end of colder period and are infact coincident with warming in greenland and not cooling they do occur at the end of the longer and more important do stadials they only last up to maximum of 600 years and so they do not explain the whole of the cold periods which last several millennia nor do they explain all of the cold periods there are plenty of do stadials without significant amounts of ird at egu this year luke skinner proposed the term heinrich stadials for these events and i would support this these careful definitions make all of the difference in our understanding an hevent at the end

supported to some extent by compelling evidence of abrupt climate change in the pacific sector clement and cane 1999 argue for dynamic ocean thermostat whereby seasonal insolation maxima and direct radiative heating of the tropical pacific actually increases upwelling and cooling of the east equatorial pacific this reinforces steepened eastwest sea surface temperature gradient and semipermanent

meltwater forcing required is many times greater than the greatest amounts estimated to have actually occurred most readers will not recognize that the models eg of rahmstorff or knutti are very simplified throughout this section the type of model being discussed should be clearly stated another more general problem is lack of attention to the fact that the leading hypothesis for abrupt climate changes flooding of the north atlantic can readily explain only the abrupt cooling events whereas it is the abrupt warming events that dominate the records this is major challenge for the

2127at first the author of this section confuse to use term eustatic sealevel and icevolume equivalent sealevel they should be separately used and one have to realized the importance of this differences regarding the magnitude of the lgm sealevel we now know that the global ice volume equivalent sealevel is larger than the 120m yokoyama et 2001 palaeo3 v165 p281 this is supported from both north western australia data as well as barbados data after correcting the isostasy yokoyama et 2000 nature tuning modeling based sealevel reconstructions directly onto the raw barbados coral data has serious problem since the area has been undergone glacial isostatic adjustments due to the laurentide ice sheets melting therefore lambeck et 2002 corrected the effects not only the barbados data but also other published data sets from tahiti sunda shelf new zealand papua new guinea and north western australia lambeck et 2002 qsr v21p343 relative sealevel curve are different spatially on earth surface so presenting the ice volume equivalent sealevel curve is more relevant during the course of their compilation of global rsl data lambeck et 2002 only one outlaying data was found at the lowest part of the sunda shelf data that was in fact radiocarbon data from organic material extracted from chemical reaching from sediments but not from carbonate fossils such as molluscs and corals hanebuth phd thesis univ keil therefore we as international comunity know that the age determination may have had influenced from groundwater effects to shift the age older than the actual data there are some indication of this at the melt water pulse 1a mwp 1aevent the timing of the mwp 1a should be the same as in both barbados and sunda shelf but sunda shelf data are rugged consistently from barbados corals weaver et 2003 science v299 p1709 in any cases gathering the many temporal and spatial data for sealevel are the key to reconstruct the reliable global melt water history curve and to do that we must not forget to correct glaciohydroisostasy lambeck et 2002 qsr v21 p415 the magnitude of this larger lgm ice volume equivalent sealevel ie 135m or so was originally not well accepted from paleoceanographic community because it did not match to the conventional sealevel measure ie deep sea oxygen isotope results eg shackelton 1988 qsr v6 p183 the larger than 120m sealevel during the lgm required near freezing temperature at the deep sea later on however independent analyses of pore water oxygen isotope reconstruction done by schrag et 2002 qsr v21 p331 1996 science v272 p1930 and adkins et 2002 science v298 p1769 also deep sea oxygen isotope data by waelbeck et 2002 qsr v21 p295 and rohling et 1998 nature v394 p162 in the modelling side milne et 2002 qsr v21 p361 successfully reproduced the lgm sealevel as low as the one that published by yokoyama et 2000 nature and the glacial isostatic modeling code cf lambeck et 2003 qsr v22 p309 was also independently validated by mitrovica et 2003 qsr v22p127 therefore large number of researchers in the palaeoceanography and palaeoclimatology now recognize the magnitude of the lgm sealevel was larger than 120m

yokoyama reviewers comment id 2983 6589 216 2110this statement is not correct and should be removed in his qsr 2002 paper peltier uses version of his earth model that he has tuned to the barbados relative sea level rsl record this tuned earth model is not able to reconstruct the tahiti huon peninsula bonaparte gulf and argentine shelf records see fig 4 6 and 7 in his last he acknowledges that examples exist in the current literature of misfits of his model to rsl observations in certain locations therefore it appears that tuning to the barbados record does not allow to reconcile all available rsl records around the globe note that the citation of peltier and solheim 2002 is wrong here again claire waelbroeck reviewers comment id 2795 6590 219 2110lambeck et qsr 2002a have proposed computation of the global change in ocean and ice volumes since the last glacial maximum lgm that reconciles available rsl records from seven different regions to do so they chose parameters of their earth model so as to minimize discrepancies between the individual estimates for each region they show that there is strong gradient in the isostatic effect across the caribbean region due primarily to the glacioeustatic contribution of the laurentide ice sheet implying that barabados can not be assumed to be an equivalent of the ice equivalent eustatic curve fig 2 contrarily to what

approximately 120 m can not be inferred eg shackleton 2000 on the basis of deep sea oxygen isotopic information shackleton 2000 or waelbroeck et 2002 did not produce any sea level data but only sea

to show value with 4 significant digits i doubt it michael schulz reviewers comment id 22917 6594 2112 2112shackleton 2000 does not provide any independent information regarding lgm sea level and this citation should not be included here in fact shackleton assumed sealevel lowering of 120 m at the lgm based on barbados we must be careful of circular reasoning based on the assumption that the barbados estimate is correct mark siddall reviewers comment id 23832 6595 2113 2115the last phrase which scales with the barbados estimate could be viewed as correct but i think it is ambiguous in one aspect and is seriouds miscitation in another the phrase used could be interpreted as offering new information on lgm sea level in addition to coral based estimates especially mentioned in this context what is more waelbroeck et actually scaled to yokoyama et als estimate the phrase should read something like waelbroeck et 2002 produced sea level reconstruction based on coral evidence and deep sea oisotopes corrected for the influence of bottom water temperature variations for the entire last glacial interglacial which is scaled to 130 m at the lgm yokoyama et 2000 estimate and therefore offers indendent information on the magnitude of the lgm low stand figure 68a the lack of independence here means the usefulness of mentioning it in the context of the lgm lowstand is in doubt the fact is that the genuinely independent estimates of the lgm are few and far between what estimates there are should be included with fair appraisal of what may be wrong with each mark siddall reviewers comment id 23833 6596 2113 2115this sentence is misleading because i used published relative sea level data from coral terraces in the calibration step of my method my curve cannot be interpreted as ice equivalent sea levels see waelbroeck et 2002 section 4 2 and has such value only complete earth models like those developed by peltier or by lambeck and coauthors can yield estimates of the global impact of ice sheets build up and melting there is an ongoing debate on the total icevolume equivalent sea level depression that prevailed at the lgm peltiers ice5g model

disagreement yokoyama et 2001 essentially state that there was bug in the programme they used but that this makes difference to their result they do not event replot their figures because they do not change as result of correcting the mistake they state fortunately the error does not enter into any other part of the model predictions because the estimate of global sea level rise is based on hte ice volume changes in equation 3 they conclude by stating the cause for the disagreement must be sought elsewhere possibly in the different ice andor earth models used the last statement gets exactly at the important point here we do not know the precise corrections to make for hydroglacioisostatic uplift at during glacial periods hence estimates using different data sets and models vary this is

of the much of the greenland ice sheet would orbital elements not be leading to the opposite sort of change over antarctica are there hypotheses explaining then how an equivalent of half of the melting of greenland occurred i would assume hypotheses might include rising sea level from the melting of greenland destabilized some ice shelves and streams in antarctica in that the models cited in this report seem to be indicating that warmth would lead to much more snowfall on antarctica i guess one could conclude that significant cooling reduced snowfall onto antarctica and it was this that allowed sl to rise if the former is the case then we should likely be very concerned about an upcoming antarctic contribution to sl for greenland melting will be cause of it if the latter then it would suggest that antarctic snowfall really is sensitive to temperature and so future sl rise might not be so much can any hints on this be provided michael maccracken reviewers comment id 152262

2145 the discussion of the recent results of overpeck et 2006 implying that future warming and its influence on the greenland ice sheet can be inferred from the paleoclimate modeling results for the last interglacial may greatly overstate the relevance of these results the overpeck et results used stateoftheart but nonetheless highly idealized ice sheet model that may not represent the processes correctly the all important basal conditions of the ice sheet and resolution of ice stream processes are simply not realistically simulated yet additionally while arctic warmth in summer may have been as great at the lig as in our near future the radiative forcing during summer was as stated in the chapter about 10 greater the effects of co2 from anthropogenic activities do not come anywhere near this without detailed energy balance modeling which has not been done it is not at all clear how relevant the lig results are to the future while these results should certaintly be discussed these important caveats deserve more attention it is also critical that the issue of timescale be discussed the overpeck et results do not tell us how quickly the ice sheet will melt for policy makers this is of course the critical issue note that this is all handled much better in the summary for policy makers and i recommend taking some of the language from there and using it in this chapter eric

the present in that there are regions underoing cooling trends this seems to be an attempt to mislead readers into thinking that the midholocene optimum was not as warm as the late 20th century yet

to why his study was removed from figure 69 here is his response i know of reason the conclusions regarding siberia would have changed the data are extremely robust and the work is widely cited it is based upon many many radiocarbon dates from the remains of trees found far north of the present forestthere is very little to question about that the data came from many different researchers and has consistently been supported by work on other proxies such as pollen from lake sediments etc i think the qr work is highly appropriate and would be sorry to see it excluded for two reasons 1 it provides for the general timing of maximum warmth across eurasia and rough idea of magnitude 2 the story shows the sensitivity of the northern boreal limits to modest changes in temperature 3 positive feedbacks due to boreal forest extension northward are very important for global warming and the data we presented speak directly to this phenomenon i would add that the 2000 paper shows that the extension of forest in eurasia in the early through midholocene is very similar to what is anticipated in most global warming projections i would rather hate to think that this figure was removed because it shows that in this one case eurasian forest advance the holocene has already experienced an event very much like what is forecast due to greenhouse gas radiative forcing the perception that inconvenient data were removed from this crucial ipcc report would be disaster we then wrote back to dr macdonald who had not seen the actual illustrations he responded i looked at the figures and it is very curious the revised figure does not capture the fact that there was relatively uniform warming response across eurasia and it thusin my opinion is misleading i would finally add that there are number of studies of similar nature from fennoscandia that show the same warming eventin the holocene marked by treeline advance it seems to problematic to leave eurasia out of this when the evidence is so compelling over such huge and important high latitude region obviously macdonalds work has to be reinserted into this figure i would anticipate major problems for ipcc if it is not and he may be

is global phenomenon even if that is agreed the recession has in most places been going on at least since the early part of the 20th century sometimes longer eg luckman and kearney most glaciers used in this compilation have response times 50 yrs most of the recession represented as the sharp upcurve at the right in the diagram represent recession from the advanced positions these glaciers reached during the little ice age centuries and most of the volume loss occurred before 1970 ie before the effect of increased emissions of greenhouse gases influenced the radiation balance it is important to present all aspects of proxy used to provide reliable story and this is not the case here glaciers are indeed sensitive to climate change but their response is lagged of course the recession has continued and in some places accelerated since 1970s but most of the recession shown in the figure is due to lagged response of postlia warming in the first half of the 20th century govt of sweden

610 i here repeat point made in my comments on the fod it is statistically invalid and visually misleading to overlay the black instrumental line on this diagram the coloured graph lines show proxy records that end at 1980 if you want line that continues up to more recent years that then you must use the proxy records that continue past 1980 not switch to different type of series there are up to date proxy records available but as im sure the authors of this chapter are aware they depart from the surface instrumental record many of them declining after 1980 by failing to show this and including the surface temperature data in black it constitutes misrepresentation since the black line is an invalid forward extrapolation of the proxy data if the reason for not showing the updated proxies is that they are not considered to be good representatives of temperature anymore then by what right does the figure insinuate that they were good proxies 810 centuries ago it is defence to claim that mbh99 established statistically skillful relationship between the proxy network and the instrumental data since that claim has been refuted as discussed above mcintyre and mckitrick 2005ad showed that the pre1450 re statistic was incorrectly benchmarked yielding spurious inference and the r2 stat calculated by mbh themselves which showed the lack of skill was simply not reported the failure of the r2 and ce stats is confirmed by wahl and ammann the squared correlation between the mbh long proxies and the instrumental record is nearly zero mm05ac the mean correlation between the long noamer proxies and gridcell temperatures in the mbh98 data set which dominate the pread1450 portion is 008 mcintyre and mckitrick 2005c and the re significance benchmark is above the mbh98 re score using all available implementation of the mann code mcintyre and mckitrick 2005d the surface instrumental record cannot be used as statistically valid extrapolation for the proxies after 1980

indistinguishable from the sheep mountain fashion the variability bristlecone series discussed in lamarche fritts of numerous records that graybill and rose 1984 these authors compared growth have

the correlation of strength of the response this series with hadcru2 gridcell temperature and of bristlecone pine trees obtained correlation of 00 osborn and briffa say thatto temperature they

61144 b 2914 2914another prominent series on the right hand side of box see response to comment 64 figure 1 is foxtail series which interbreed with 61143 bristlecones from site within few tens of miles fromsome of what the reviewer the sheep mountain bristlecone site they do not explain says may be true but is why two similar series from so close are used rather as yet unpublished and the than being composited if they are to be used at all i current review is based on checked the correlation of this data to hadcru2 gridcell multiple strands of temperature and only obtained an insignificant evidence among which the correlation of 004 the authors said that they had citedresults of mann and the temperature data incorrectly that they had actually colleagues remains used crutem2 yielding correlation of 019 and that relevant hadcru2 data was spurious in its early portion 18701887 because there was station data however there is station data at ghcn going back to the data in hadcru2 darrigo et 2006 considered using foxtails and rejected the use of this data because it did not meet standards of being correlated to gridcell temperature expressed in very similar terms to osborn and briffa 2006 the contrasting views of darrigo et 2006 certainly establish that the relationship is ambiguous and that this proxy should not be used on multiple grounds stephen mcintyre reviewers

significant relationship gridcell temperature and was completely unable to with local summer replicate the claimed 049 correlation to temperaturetemperature obtaining only correlation of 012 the authors here have used data from yamal while they used gridcell data from polar urals there is an updated version of the polar urals series usedin esper et 2002 which has elevated mwp values and which has better correlations to gridcell temperature than the yamal series since very different results are obtained from the yamal and polar urals updated again the relationship of the yamal series to

avoided the proxies series used with the appropriate for these reconstructions indicate that this is indeed caveates and indication of reasonable level however as we are uncertain if we can

majority of presenters everyone is justified as for the except mann stated that they would not say that we knewuse of very likely temperatures 1000 years ago to within 05 deg c the this has been changed to confidence interval calculations for the reconstructions probably to avoid is very problematic the difference between mwp proxy possible interpretation index values and modenproxy values is razor thin in some according to the ipcc reconstructions and it cannot be said that it is very definition which was not likely or even likely that mwp values were below the intention modern values creating important unresolved uncertainties are the high medieval tree lines higher than modern tree lines i personally think that the probability of mwp temperatures being higher than mid20th century

paragraph both deal with criticisms to the hockey stick curve eva calvo reviewers comment id 376 6731 2940 2940the statement mcintyre and mckitrick 2003 reported rejected the current that they were unable to replicate the results of mann text represents factual et is misrepresentation mcintyre and mckitrick report of the substantive 2003 states that the authors had substantial successcontent of the mcintyre in replicating the mbh98 methodolgy but some differencesand mckitrick 2003 remain possibly due to undisclosed variations in their paper procedures and assumptions the specific claim was that the calculations of proxy principle components in mann at 1998 were erroneous mcintyre and mckitrick concluded that the tempertaure indexes computed using mann et 1998 data and methodology were unreliable and could not be used for comparisons betwene current climate and that of past centuries jeff kueter reviewers comment id 13766 6732 2940 2951the opening sentence of this paragraph is accepted because misrepresentation mcintyre and mckitrick reported that current text is apparently the data as used by mann et differed in material open to misinterpretation respects from what was reported in mbh98 finding that though the subject is too was upheld by nature and which led to the corrigendum of involved and periferal in mann et 2005 which this paragraph conspicuously the context of further fails to mention as for the inability in mm03 to papers regarding the mann reproduce the results of mann et 1998 this paragraph et 19981999 fails to cite mcintyre and mckitrick 2005b which methodology and further updated the subject and provided detailed explanatory papers providing other reconciliation between the mm03 results and the mbh98 reconstructions to results in this respect the suggestion that wahl and justify over emphasising ammann diagnosed the source of the differences between the many details of the the mm and mbh results as an omission of data is false subsequent debate the and pejorative by suggesting that it resulted from text will be further deliberate omission of data the issues were far more modified to remove the complex including the failure by mbh98 to explain all implication the reviewer their computational steps and difference in final sees in the use of the weighting on small but influential portion of the word omission and to entire data set this was all explained in mm05b more include reference to other than year before the wahl and amman paper was in pressmm papers ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17427 6733 2940 2951the opening sentence also misrepresents the situation by wahl and ammann did not failing to point out that the results of mann et submit this paper to the were principally the supposed findings of unprecedentedipcc review site rather robustness and statistical significance not only have it was provided to the these results not been replicated by others but they of chapter 6 directly the have been amply disproven by teams on both sides for confusion about which example the final version of the wahl and ammann paper version to cite has now confirms the findings of mm05a that the unreported r2 been removed tests show the mbh98 significance claims were untrue see their table 1s the wahl and ammann defence of the re score in mbh98 is based not on material in the cc paper itself but on citation to submission by wa to grl which was twice rejected and which remains unpublished however the lead authors may have been unaware of this point because at the time of release of the sod wahl and ammann had submitted version of their paper to the ipcc review web site in which the appendix containing this key information was left out httpipccwg1ucaredurestrictedreviewsorsorunpub ch06in_presswahl__ammannpdf 577 6577 28 ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17427 6734 2940 2951the second sentence is misleading and pejorative by accepted but note stating that wa were able to replicate the results by reviewer is reading too including all the data as if to suggest that mm were somuch into the current careless as to not use all the data while failing to wording differences in mention the reconciling calculations published in mm05b the implementation of the that include all the data in each step only the weightspca inherent in the mann as determined by pc algorithms

identical results to the mcintyre code to 9 decimal in the mm work it is places except in one respect wa added in variance unfortunate and rescaling step which is nowhere described in mbh98 or misinterpreted that the supplementary literature the wa program yields reviewer considers that temperature pcs identical to those in mm but their the text is taking slightly closer fit in the final nh

mcintyre comments 61157 6732 code the results are identical between mm and wa and and 6736 neither group exactly replicates mbh the only improvement wa achieved in replication came from having private access to an undisclosed mbh programming step so you have business using the ipcc report to take cheap shot at mm for what amounts to not being telepathic ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17429 6735 2940 2951the next two sentences refer to 2 important items the rejected the text is failure of statistical significance of manns results andbased on the authors the biased pc method but then with supporting interpretation of the evidence whatsoever the first point is dropped by sayingcurrent literature and the latter point may have some foundation the formerall papers cited are point matters acutely and has completely solid within current ipcc foundation as has been spelled out in papers to which publication deadline your attention was drawn after the fod first the re rules the text gives significance benchmark for mbh98 is 051 not 000 as balanced view had been claimed in mbh98 the higher benchmark was please note the following established in mm05a and further settled in our exchange with huybers notably mm05d and is the final word in the perrreviewed literature on the subject unfortunately the mm05d benchmarking the authors of this section omit any mention of it and method is based on an ignore mm05d altogether even when referring to huybers entirely different comment second the r2 test score is 00 in the earliestanalytical framework than portions of mbh this is not contested by wahl and that used by mbh98 ammann indeed they computed the r2 and ce values for each grid step confirming insignificant skill through tombh used the standard the late 1700s this is shown

working off version that underwent replicating the actual substantial modification after the deadline we would be target time series is justified in demanding all references to wa be removed evaluated according to any third the claim in wahl and ammann that an re benchmark measure of merit in which of 00 can still be used is not established in their cc the investigator is paper itself but is asserted based on reference to an interested unpublished submission to geophysical research letters preprint of this paper is available for the simple mms method instead uses reason that their paper was rejected at grl twice the fullorder ar consequently this paper is not available in the characteristics of one of published literature and reliance can be placed on itthe proxies used in the in the ar4 use of wahl and ammanns climatic change reconstruction to create paper as an indirect means of citing the rejected grl pseudoproxies in monte paper is surely violation of the ipcc principle the carlo framework these matter concerning the re and r2 scores is settled in the are then input into the peerreviewd literature mann et 199899 presents reconstruction algorithm climate reconstruction that is statistically along with white noise insignificant in its pre1450 portions thereby providingpseudoproxies for all the quantitative basis for ranking the late 20th century n1 remaining proxies to the medieval period this is in theory ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17430 statistically meaningful procedure which asks what kind of apparent skill is available in the reconstruction simply from one proxys noise however this procedure is not general and would need to be repeated for each proxy set to be examined also it would need the subjective choice of which single proxy should be modelled according to its red noise characteristics each time finally it does not take into account that some of the verifications seen as skillful are associated with very poorexceedingly poor calibrations which would be rejected on first principles in real world reconstruction applications this consideration indicates that the 051 threshold cited by mm is actually at least somewhat overstated see responses to comments 6736 61157 and 6732 6736 2940 2951you refer to the comments of von storchzorita and accepted only as far as huybers but omit any reference to our rebuttals this isthe suggestion to cite the misleading to readers and unfair to us if the point is reviwers work more fully important enough to raise then treat it properly more references will be everyone mm vzz h agrees that manns pc method is cited but the text will biased towards finding hockey sticks in the tree ring remain similar in data base the question is whether the pc error matterssubstance for the final reconstruction we ourselves explored this please note the following in detail in mm05b which you fail to mention and we explained in our replies to von storch and huybers why their counterarguments do not affect the underlying the wahlammann paper point the final reconstruction looks like hockey stickshows clearly that the pc only if the bristlecones are included in such way as toconventions actually have dominate the results this is acknowledged by all extremetly little impact partiesmm wa vonstorchzorita huybers all papers on the 14001449 period of on the subject acknowledge this the reliance on the the mann et 1998 bristlecones therefore points to the questions of whetherreconstruction mbh the the bristlecones are good proxies whether their actual reason that mm in influence undermines the claim of robustness in mbh98 andtheir 2005 energy and whether they affect the claims of significance here it environment paper get is significant that the ipcc itself in the 2nd very different assessment report examined the topic and specifically reconstruction for this warned about the contamination problem in bristlecones period is that they yet now that the exact problem warned about in the sar indirectly exclude the false signal in contaminated data has been shown to bristlecone pines by using have undermined material prominently emphasized in the only n american tree pcs tar instead of coming clean about it in the ar4 we see a1 and 2 in their report section that tries to cover it up and cast reconstruction in this aspersions on the investigators who discovered it the case the pcs were derived reality is that there is very little disagreement from unstandardized data remaining among the various authors about the core hockeyinput into pca algorithm stick questions one defends the bristlecones in using the print everyone agrees that the hockey stick conclusion variancecovariance is not robust to their exclusion either via direct matrix the actual mbh exclusion or through removal of the pc4 of the noamer procedure used network everyone agrees that the r2 and ce test scores standardized data are unambiguously insignificant with or without the wahlammann show that when bristlecones everyone agrees that the re score is higherstandardized data are when the bristlecones are included everyone agrees that used then the mbh red noise significance benchmark shifts upward when theshortsegment reference mann pc algorithm is used rather than conventional pc period for centering and algorithm wahl and ammann argue implausibly that only scaling does have an the re score matters not the r2 there is basis in impact but it is very the literature for this but even if one accepts the small claim they provide published grounds for setting the significance criterion at anything less than 051 which wahlammann do find that still leaves mbh98 with an insignificant re even the bristlecone pines including the bristlecones thats where things stand in bcsare necessary for print 14001449 to get ross mckitrick reviewers comment id 17431 successful verification in the mbh framework however wahlammann also find that over the common 14501980 period the 1400network results with bcs included gives reproduction that is very similar to the one determined from the 1450network where bcs have been eliminated which successfully verifies given this and because the problematic behaviour of bc series does not occur in the 15th century but is concentrated primarily in the calibration period which does not change between the cases these facts alone indicate that the bc data are quite likely not introducing spurious information in the 14001449 segment wahlammann also make careful arguments for false negative judgements that can be made based on sole application of the r2 statistic in appendix i see response to comment 6735 6737 2940 2951the final sentence of this paragraph is disputatious and accepted the sentence offtopic the topic in the paragraph is mbh9899 and thehas been removed though relative ranking of the late 20th century to the medievalit is certainly not off era the conclusion from the literature is that the topic the salient hockey stick is insufficiently robust to support information follows anyway conclusion about such ranking the final sentence refers to different studies not considered in the paragraph and not even listed for the reader and refers to comparisons of the rate of change which is not the issue under consideration in the paragraph the sentence should be deleted ross mckitrick reviewers comment

reconstructions using different methods to those of mann have shown high 20th century values relative to the medieval era but none have made similar claims to statistical skill and none have been shown to skillfully predict warm temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s in light of the recent debates the hockey stick graph on its own does not provide robust basis for claiming that the climate of the

success in replication of the method except for some details they also raised statistical questions potentially relevant to determination of the reliability of all reconstruction methods highlighting the need for greater involvement of statisticians specialized in time series analysis in paleoclimate reconstructions firstly mcintyre and mckitrick 2003 identified sensitivity of the 20th century warming to the presence or absence of specific series bristlecone pines also considered by graybill and idso 1993 as problematic secondly mcintyre and mckitrick 2005a challenged the reliability of mann et 1998 reporting that the earliest portion of the mann et reconstruction did not have significant skill under reasonable red noise assumptions replies by both wahl and ammann 2006 and huybers 2005 agreed that the re benchmark statistic is dependent on model assumptions and can indicate model skill while simultaneously contradicted by r2 and ce statistics though differ on the appropriate benchmark value for the re statistic these and other contingencies in the methodology were elaborated by b√ºrger and cubasch 2005 who showed that plausible variations of mann et 1998 methodology can lead to wide variety of results and argued that verification statistics cannot be used to decide between models von storch and zorita 2005 also confirmed the bias towards reduced long time scale variability in the mann et principal components methodology these efforts attribute the hockey stick shape of the reconstruction in mann et 1998 largely to contestable statistical artifacts in the

proxy series used by mann every single one of manns 61157 series was used in fact we used all the series listed in the mbh98 supplementary information whereas mann et had themselves omitted over 35 series said to have been used in mbh98 mann et corrigendum 2004 differences in result exist because of the impact of pc methods on bristlecone weights stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30954 61160

authors describe this result as being developed using the mbh reconstruction methodology albeit with elimination of large number of the proxy data series used by mbh especially during the 15th century well i can assure you that we did not describe this result as being developed with the elimination of large number of proxy data series in mm03 differences arose because of pc methodology in the context of the north american tree ring network these issues were fully analyzed in mcintyre and mckitrick 2005b long befiore wahl and ammann wahl and ammann 2006 show that you can get high 15th century results by eliminating north american tree ring series but we got them without eliminating north american tree ring series you can get high 15th century results in more than one way and just because they can get them by eliminating series does not mean they we eliminated series stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30955 61161 b 2942 2942there is fundamental contradiction in what wahl and see response to comment ammann are trying to do one of the results that we were 61157 unable to replicate was the supposed mbh robustness to the presenceabsence of all dendroclimatic indicators see mann et 2000 as well as mbh98 this claim is simply false it is not robust to the presenceabsence of bristlecones if you eliminate the 15th century north american tree rings you also eliminate the bristlecones and the hockystick doesnt apply wahl and ammann did not demonstrate this this had been demonstrated by us in mcintyre and mckitrick 2005b wahl and ammann cant claim that theyve replicated the robustness claim of mbh one of its key warranties while making this argument stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30956 61162 b 2942 2942ipcc tar stated that the mbh reconstruction as having see responses to comments skill in crossvalidation statistics not just the re 61157 and 6736 statistic mann et 1998 claimed statistical skill ini verificaiton statistics referrring to the re verification r and verification r2 r2 even illustrating the verification r2 statistics for the 1820 step in mbh98 mcintyre and mckitrick 2005a reported that the 15th century step of the mbh reconstruction failed crossvalidaiton r2 and ce and other tests these results have been confirmed in the 2nd version of wahl and ammann 2006 but not in the version filed with the second order draft this has nothing to do with bristlecones being in or out of the reconstruction the mbh reconstruction fails verification r2 either way wahl and ammann have argued that the verification r2 is not an appropriate measure of low frequency validity in our opinion this is completely ad hoc argument which will not get much of hearing from applied statisticians we think that ipcc would be foolish to rely on this afterthefact rationalization stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30957 61163 b 2942 2942the issue of verification r2 is not just technicality see response to comment the standard errors that enter into the calculation of 61157 confidence intervals are also used in r2 calculations so if you have very low r2 statistic you will have very very wide confidence intervals with an r2 statistic of nearly zero you will have useful reduction of variance from natural variability whatever that is so if you have verification r2 of 00 and you use verification residuals you are not even clsoe to being able to make claim about the relation of the mwp to the modern period stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30958 61164 b 2942 2942mcintyre and mckitrick 2003 already stated that the see responses to comments principal components method in mbh was incorrect but was61157 and 6736 unable to precisely diagnose the flaw in mcintyre and mckitrick 2005a we precisely diagnosed the error neither von storch and zorita 2005 nor huybers 2005 tested the effect using mbh proxies we did and found difference mcintyre and mckitrick 2005b reported that if 5 pcs were used instead of 2 pcs using covariance pcs as recommended in statistical texts in such situations then you get an mbhtype hockey stick because the bristlecones are in the pcs but do not with fewer than 4 pcs wahl and ammann obtained similar results without crediting our previous observation of the same effect so this type of thing matters this was confirmed and extended by burger and cubasch who found bewildering variety of outcomes with minor variations of mbh methods stephen mcintyre reviewers comment id 30959 6752 2947 2949there is severe problem in how this is currently see response to comment worded specifically the assertion the latter may have 61157 some foundation has been definitively falsified by two other studies that are inexplicably not even referenced in this context ammann and wahl accepted is cited above and yet key conclusion of that study is ignored here wahl and ammann show explicitly that the mann et 1998 reconstruction is not sensitive to how treering networks are represented as long as correct selection rules are followed mcintyre and mckitrick did not follow correct selection rule criteria moreover wahl and ammann demonstrate that essentially the same reconstruction is achieved whether or not pca is even used to represent treering networks this is independently demonstrated by rutherford et 2005 so the statement made here is completely indefensible it must be acknowledged here that both wahl and ammann 2005 and independently rutherford et 2005 have explicitly falsified the claim by mcintyre and mckitrick that the main feaures of the mann et reconstruction are in any way dependent on how the predictor networks are represented michael mann reviewers comment id 15621 6753 2948 2948the von storch paper has been shown to be seriously in rejected paper error owing to model drift osborn et 2006

as currently worded is absolutelyaccepted text modified false regression residuals of course take into account to further clarify the the uncertainty in the degree to which the proxy point accurately record the climate variables of interest ie the uncertainties in the proxy climate signal as this is estimated from calibrationverification what they dont take into account is possible degradation of that signal prior to the interval used for calibrationverification the latter may or may not be significant depending on the data being used for example the extent to which treering estimates are based on large samples and multiple replication of chronologies i believe it is this latter sort of uncertainty which is being alluded to here by the authors but that is very different from what is stated the wording here should be revised to be more accurate and precise michael mann reviewers comment id 15639 6774 3157 322 neglected contributor to uncertainties at least where noted but change will crossvalidation is not used is the selection bias be made to the text mentioned earlier with respect to eg the hegerl et reconstruction ie use only of proxies which are highly correlated with temperatures over the calibration period this leads to underestimation of uncertainties even in relatively simple test cases with simulated temperatures with small fraction of missing values this selection bias can lead to significant underestimation of error variances cf schneider t analysis of incomplete climate data estimation of mean values and covariance matrices and imputation of missing

greatest lowfrequency variability moberg et and particularly as it is not esper et dont even remotely resemble each other possible to judge which they are essentially anticorrelated on centennial if any is more likely to timescales with the first showing pronounced cold in thebe realistic that later centuries and the latter showing pronounced cold insomemany of the the earlier centuries it is highly implausible that differences between both or in fact either one reflect meaningful estimates reconstructions are of past annual northern hemisphere mean temperatures attributable to different more likely the differents are due to differential targetspredictors is seasonal and spatial sensitivity of the underlying proxy clearly implied and can data this is only vaguely alluded to yet it is perhaps not be taken further on the primary reason for the observed differences the basis of current secondly it is shown in the figures figure 610a but understanding left unstated in the discussion that the available the final remark regarding instrumental record in earlier ie 17th19th the similarity or centuries agrees far better with the reconstructions otherwise to early shown in the tar than many of the more recent instrumental data is also reconstructions egmoberg et or huang pollack et ala debatable point with boreholes which suggest far greater cooling than do the the bias towards european instrumental recods the same is true with the oerlemans early instrument locations glacierbased estimate which is entirely independent of and as result of cla all other proxy data and shows

for preanthropogenic run so that the model cited see 61214 had to cool initially furthermore the wahl et 2006 piece shows that von storch et simply failed to implement the mann et procedure and so did not test that procedure point already made by zorita and von storch the text should reject the von storch et estimate of 2x error with high confidence based on known shortcomings in the study richard b alley reviewers comment id 47 6788 333 337 the discussion here does not accurately reflect where theaccepted text now science currently stands based on papers that were indicates that rutherford accepted or in press by the official ipcc deadline bothet 2005 is rutherford et 2005 and mann et 2005a show that potentially nonbiased the hybrid regem method that has been used by mann and and the references to the collaborators in all work done during the past 5 years bias issue are not formed yields essentially the same reconstruction as the in any way that impunes original mann et 1998 method applied to the same regem rather the text multiproxy networkfurthermore mann et 2005a show makes general points about that the regem method applied to synthetic proxy data the possibility of with even lower signaltonoise ratios than those assumedseveral methods being by von storch et 2004 and cubasch et 2006 yieldsomewhat suspect in this evidence at all of systematic bias in the retrospect overall the reconstructed lowfrequency variability of the sort balance is considered fair originally claimed by von storch et 2004 thereforeand though very brief it cannot honestly be argued that there is any legitimatefactual and sufficient evidence that the methods in question systematically references are provided to estimated lowfrequency variability as discussed above help those seeking further the arguments by von storch and associates to the details contrary are based on erroneous work that incorrectly implements the mann et 1998 method as shown by wahl et 2006 and b makes use of seriously flawed model simulation the discussion here is not accurately reflective of what has actually been demonstrated in the peerreviewed literature and must be revised if the ar4 report is to maintain the level of rigor and accuracy that has been the hallmark of past ipcc reports as sidenote it is worth noting that von storch et now claim that even though von storch et 2004 was entirely erroneous they can still get statistical methods to underestimate lowfrequency variability if they assume an extremely red proxy noise component this is both disingenous since it reflects an assumption about limitations of the proxy data and not the method and it is also false as shown in recently submitted work the latest claims by von storch and associates like their earlier claims are simply false and likely the product of additional errors or undisclosed erroneous procedures it is additionally worth noting that the specious criticisms leveled by cubasch and associates burger and cubasch cubasch et are demonstrably not even remotely plausible criticisms of the regem approach used by mann and coworkers in climate field reconstruction over the past 5 years since that method provides room for the socalled flavors essentially subjective distortions of methodology introduced by cubasch et in this method regularization guards again statistical fitting and the regularization parameters are objectively chosen by generalized crossvalidation gcv the error structure is moreover explicity modeled and an unbiased estimate of unresolved variance is obtained given that rutherford et 2005 using the same proxy data obtain nearly identical reconstruction to that of mann and coworkers based on earlier statistical methods the cubasch criticisms are neither legitimate criticisms of the earlier work nor are they relevant having effectively been already discredited by the findings of rutherford et 2005 and mann et 2005a michael mann reviewers comment id 15626 6789 334 334 the

supposedly using method total least amended to include the squares which yields reconstruction which better word possibly the retains lowfrequency variability is absolutely assessment does not state

approach has the potential interest eg surface temperatures from noisy or sparseto avoid bias in the predictors eg proxy data must necessarily estimation of the underestimate the true variance this is because the regression coefficients variance about the estimated expected values is not there is implication in reflected in the estimated values themselves but the revised text that the nonetheless contributes to the true variance variance tls approach is better or estimates should therefore be derived separately as in worse than regem eg the expectation maximization em algorithm and its regularized variants such as the regem algorithm of schneider2001 schneider t analysis of incomplete climate data estimation of mean values and covariance matrices and imputation of missing values journal of climate 14 853871 2001 which employs ridge regression for regularization the regem method was first applied in the context of climate field reconstruction by schneider 2001 and subsequently

ammann c testing the fidelity of methods used in proxybased reconstructions of past climate journal of climate 18 40974107 2005 indeed if tls is regularized as it should be and the assumption is made of homogenous relative errors which is reasonable using normalized proxy data in the absence of any further information about the error structure in the proxy data it simply leads to the regem algorithm of schneider 2001 which achieves regularization through ridge regression it is therefore highly implausible that the tls method alluded to here is in practice more reliable than eg the regem algorithm or that reconstructions based on tls more reliably reconstruct past longterm climate changes than those based on regem eg the reconstructions described by rutherford et 2005 the claim that tls somehow produces reconstruction of past variability that magically retain the true underlying variance on some particular timescale is simply nonsense and the authors of this chapter open themselves up to potentially severe critcism if they so uncritically repeat this absurd argument michael mann reviewers comment id 15627 61216 b 3311 3311once again hegerl et 2006 should not be used

chapter page 37 that the conclusions of gonzalezroucoto be overcritical of the et are compromised by major error in the simulation potential value in some of as identified by osborn et 2006 which renders most the papers referred to of the longterm variability in the simulation which here despite the known forms the basis for their interpretation about ground and described as the surface

it is not simulation that does not depend on spinup errors clear whether these gonzalezrouco et 2006 claim to reach similar problems seriously conclusion to gonzalezrouco et 2003 but as this compromise conclusions simulation two may contain serious errors there is being refered to here certainly an error in their 20th century forcing which this assessment is does not include tropospheric aerosols any work by attempting to provide gonzalezrouco and collaborators is suspect until dispationate view of the independent analyses are done by other modelers to issues determine whether mann and schmidt 2003 or gonzalezrouco et are closer to the truth with regard to the disconnect between gst and sat on long timescales given other work as cited here which has found significant differences in the presence of seasonal snowcover and landuse change the gonzalezrouco et conclusions seems dubious at best it is dangerous for the ar4 to give them these dubious studies the weight that are currently given them given the multiple errors and undisclosed erroneous procedures that are already known to have riddled the von storch zorita gonzalezrouco et studies to date michael mann reviewers

hydrographs change the precipitation to snow ratio increase demand evaporation and evapotraspiration and lead to persistence of drought conditions eg oglesby and erickson 1989 if 20th21st century warming exacerbated the recent drought what would be the impact of this amount of warming or more as projected on drought such documented in the paleoclimatic record at the end of the 16th century if temperature increase was superimposed over this widespread and severe drought which did occur during period of generally cooler conditions the chances are it would be even more widespread and persistent it would be interesting to recalculate the reconstructed gridded pdsi values for western north america cook et 2004b with increased temperatures for this period maybe it would not make too much difference since temperature is not dominant factor in pdsi but it might be an interesting exercise if it could be done as is mentioned in section 6655 proxy records show that the range of drought characteristics in the 20th century do not contain the full range of variability in the past 1502000 years these records contain evidence for relatively short droughts 46 years that exceed the severity of droughts of similar length in the 20th century eg the 1950s drought as well as runs of years with below average conditions that persist for many more years than seen in the modern period in both cases these droughts under warmer conditions would likely result in more widespread persistent andor severe events the impacts of these paleotype droughts under warmer conditions are apt to be far reaching as has been hinted at with the recent drought just very few midlevel water managers in the western united states with the foresight and courage to start considering the implications of

and erickson 1989 if 20th21st century warming exacerbated the recent drought what would be the impact of this amount of warming or more as projected on drought such documented in the paleoclimatic record at the end of the 16th century if temperature increase was superimposed over this widespread and severe drought which did occur during period of generally cooler conditions the chances are it would be even more widespread and persistent connie woodhouse reviewers comment id 2934 6867 380 41 it would be interesting to recalculate the reconstructedpeck gridded pdsi values for western north america cook et 2004b with increased temperatures for this period maybe it would not make too much difference since temperature is not dominant factor in pdsi but it might be an interesting exercise if it could be done as is mentioned in 6655 proxy records show that the range of drought characteristics in the 20th century do not contain the full range of variability in the past 1502000 years proxy records contain evidence for relatively short droughts 46 years that exceed the severity of droughts of similar length in the 20th century eg the 1950s drought as well as runs of years with below average conditions that persist for many more years than seen in the modern period in both cases these paleodocumented droughts under warmer conditions would likely result in more widespread persistent andor severe events connie woodhouse reviewers comment id 2935 6868 380 41 the impacts of these droughts under warmer conditions arepeck apt to be far reaching as has been hinted at with the recent drought just very few midlevel water managers in the western us with the foresight and courage to start considering the implications of the paleo records in concert with the regional impacts on temperature from global warming are beginning to incorporate this information into planning it would be enormously helpful to bring up this point in the summary for policymakers in order to

crucifix reviewers comment id 5282 6875 3848 3851this paragraph looks strange assuming that the mean sensitivity among models is 8 ppmc and the mean change in co2 concentration is 10 ppm the estimated mean temperature change should be 08k and not 06 k this can be confirmed by montecarlo simulations of the ratio between two gaussian probability distributions with mean 8 and standard deviation 1 and mean 10 and standard deviation 2 respectively the ratio between both yields median of 08 k with 595 range of 055k11k the assumption of 06k of nh t temperature range is therefore biased towards low variations value of 08 k supports more strongly reconstructions with high past variability the recent paper by scheffer et geophys res lett 33 doi 1010192005gl055044 also supports higher past

figure the orbital parameters are not really discussed in this section mariefrance loutre reviewers comment id 1489 6950 681 the logic behind the selection of references is not easy to follow references seem to have been picked at random eg climate simulations confirm that an ice age can be confirmed that way two references are cited which are perhaps not the most appropriate while other important informations such as changes are not synchronous and have opposite sign in the north and south atlantic this statement perhaps more controversial is not supported by appropriate references michel crucifix reviewers comment id 5286 6951 684 684 sentence should read on all time scales including long before wilmer anderson reviewers comment id 535 6952 686 the body of the answer shows that changes in radiation balance are indeed the principal driver of past climate change see question 11 the cause of such changes has multiple sources so suggest that the sentence be rewritten as although changes in earths radiation balance are the principal driver of past climates the cause of such changes are varied david wratt david fahey reviewers comment id 6745 6953 688 689 this sentence seems

many of the changed parameters eric wolff reviewers comment id 29241 6954 6811 6815this sentence sounds like it is possible for man to change the earths orbit or the solar energy output i suggest it be changed to read as follows there are three fundamental ways the earths radiation balance can change thereby causing climate change 1 changes in the incoming solar radiation eg by changes in the earths orbit or changes in the energy emitted by the sun itself 2 changes in the fraction of the solar radiation that is reflected this fraction is called the albedo it is changed eg by changes in the cloud cover aerosols or land cover and 3 changes in the long wavelength back radiation eg by changes in the greenhouse gas concentration wilmer anderson reviewers comment id 536 6955 6812 suggest word

provides an excellent overview of the problems of deriving sealevel estimates in the past as well as sea level curve that combines isostatic correction with data the curve combines careful stratigraphic interpretation with careful dating and isostatic corrections for sea level from an alternative model to that of peltier we should not put too much weight on any one model there is excuse not to include it in genuinely consensus piece of work we need product with which one cannot be left with the suspicion that one approach to the problem has dominated the outcome at the cost of another by including the lambeck and chappell curve any remaining doubt on this will be gone and there will be better balance between the three principal techniques available for sealevel reconstructions fossil reef evidence benthic oxygen isotopes and icesheet modelling some may criticise and argue down the lambeck and chappell curve in preference for alternatives but in consensus piece of work our real uncertainty in this is best represented by its inclusion this will make obvious the range of realistic estimates available mark siddall reviewers comment id 23844 61070 901 9023figure 68 the figure should be drawn using isostatically corrected sealevel ice equivalent sealevel instead of relative sealevel since the latter is not identical where samples were corrected the figure have still used specmap data for the last 5 years or so large number of data sets are reported from coral reefs but they have been ignored yokoyama et 2001 epsl v193 p579 cutler et 2003 epsl v206 p253 potter et 2004 epsl v225 p191 the coral based sealevel histories were also reproduced from physical oceanographic modeling using red sea deep sea oxygen isotopes siddall et 2003 nature v423 p853 but again this was ignored the working group should use coral data as well as the compilation by lambeck et 2002 qsr v21 p343 to draw the figure because this is the one of the major development from the previous ipcc report the larger figure b which described the sealevel history was also not correct at first the sealevel should be drawn using isostatically corrected value ie ice equivalent sealevel the error bars represented by coral living depth in the figure are large and we cannot conclude neither the magnitude of the lgm sealevel nor mwp1a if we use this data only i belive most of the researchers in the paleoceanographic communities who know the nature of the sealevel observation will not accept this curve as the general knowledge in the community people should use to draw sealevel curve using only by most reliable sealevel indicators in this case they should have used acropora palmata only since it is most reliable sealevel indicator during the deglaciation period in the atlantic for this purposes also citing shackleton 2000science v289 p1897as reliable lgm sealevel data is misleading since the lgm sealevel estimation has uncertainties of 1020m shackleton per comm i hope the ar4 wg will modify this curve before the publication yusuke yokoyama reviewers comment id 2984 61071 901 figure 6 8 why not directly providing the the eustatic sealevel curve given by the model rather than the barbados one michel crucifix reviewers comment id 52111 61072 910 do we have any idea whether theses estimated warmest valerie temperatures are annual or seasonal the text talks

figure 610c is not well designed please consider the possibility of plotting graph solid line into the overlapping range where it reaches highest values govt of germany reviewers comment id 201128 61075 921 924 the authors of this chapter should request an explanation from the lead authors of the spm of why there is not single graphic from the chapter shown in the spm every other major section of the spm has at least one supporting graphic the lack of supporting graphic in the paleoclimate perspective section is effectively slap in the face to chapter 6 authors it also sends disturbing message that ar4 is somehow backing away from paleoclimatebased claims made in the tar where the results from paleoclimate studies were highlighted yet reading of chapter 6 shows such thing and in fact reveals more robust evidence in support of the key conclusions chapter 6 highlights the fact that there are now large number of different paleoclimate studies which all lead to the same key conclusion that northern hemisphere mean temperatures in recent decades are likely unprecedented in at least millennial timeframe moreover several of the newer studies extend these conclusions back to at least the past 2000 years it was mistake for the authors of the spm in the tar to show only one reconstruction that of mann et 99 when in fact there were multiple reconstructions shown in the body of the report chapter 2 which supported the main conclusion regarding anomalous late 20th century warmth this clearly set up one study as straw man for attack ar4 has an opportunity to undo the damage of that unfortunate decision and show in the spm figure 610 which indicates that the key conclusions regarding recent hemispheric warmth in millennial context are now supported by more than dozen different reconstructions taking into account the ensemble of uncertainties associated with the different reconstructions michael mann reviewers comment id 15655 61076 926 926 it may be helpful to add

figure is somewhatstefan misleading the earths orbit is not this ellipitical and the sun is shown as being too near the center of the ellipse rather than at focus unless the earths orbit is intended to be on plane with respect to the plane of the paper if this is the case coordinate system might help illustrate the idea that the earths orbit is at an angle to the plane of the paper in addition the figure shows that the eccentricity of the orbit is changed without changing the locations of the perihelion or the apehelion also the figure does not show either the precession of the perihelion of the earths orbit or the time variation of the tilt of the earths orbit with respect to the plane of jupiters orbit wilmer anderson reviewers comment id 539 61111 1031 question 61 figure 1 the figure contains several mistakes 1 precession the ellipse showing the precession movement should be round the axis even though it would still imperfectly represent the notion of climatic precession the important is to show that perihelion occurs alternatively in spring summer autumn etc sun it is essential to put the sun at one of the two focii of the ellipse here it is almost centred obliquity more widely used than tilt is defined between the axis and the perpendicular to the ecliptic this is not well shown either michel crucifix reviewers comment id 52118 61112 1035 comment i would like for the figure caption to describe the changes in the orbit bit more so that the figure is bit more understandable wilmer anderson reviewers comment id 540
