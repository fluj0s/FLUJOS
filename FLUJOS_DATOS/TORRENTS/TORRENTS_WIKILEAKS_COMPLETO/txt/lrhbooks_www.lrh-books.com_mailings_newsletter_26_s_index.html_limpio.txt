bridge publications inc newsletter date indestructible motion source so the first place we take the riddle to pieces is right here on the basis of what are you and the first moment you realize youre not your bodybang you can at least stand over here your body will always be an effect and there is reason for you to go on through life going and winding this riddle round and round and round of am i cause or am i an effect or am i an effect or am i cause because if i step on nail i hurt therefore i am an effect therefore i could never be completely at cause because if i step on nail why then i hurt and that automatically makes an effect you better locate that part of you which is always cause and then recognize that you are that part and thats very simplevery very simple right here on the middle of youness is an imperishable completely indestructible motion source it is motion source which itself has motion that is your inheritance as part of divine beingness that is it and dont think that is small part of you or merely part of you because its not thats you you have immortality in that part of you which is you that is immortal if you didnt have that you wouldnt be here l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture decision cause and effect contained in the route to infinity series knowing by being an article by l ron hubbard from the route to infinity lectures and i told you about going over this incident and over it and over it and why does it erase well youre burning it up youre not rubbing it out theres nothing mest there to rub on youre just burning it up you burn it up burn it up and finally it blows well theres reason why you cant just sort of get mmmmmmpsshew now the fact of the matter is fact of the matter is you take light locktake some little light lock thats completely inconsequentialand practice on it for while and say how do i burn this thing down get visioa visio of somethingand just go finally until you find out how to make the visio go and oddly enough if you get the trick rather easily it will then develop on up the line with magnitude but of course there is an implant on the track that tells you you shouldnt do this you shouldnt do this this is bad bad to burn things up like this because youve got to have facsimiles i tell you if you didnt have facsimiles you wouldnt have any experience if you didnt have any experience you wouldnt remember how police could get so tough and you wouldnt remember it enough to be facsimiles to do all that labor for us and so youve got to have facsimiles and theyre very valuable and therefore lets all study eidetic psychology because facsimile is the only important thing beingness is not important but the facsimile is important so therefore you got to have pictures of everything youve ever seen been and felt or heard dont go ramming up and down the time track through time you know and taking look in personnot done anybody here by the way every time he tries to go back down the time track and return to another place just sort of sits and looks at himself sitting where he was sitting i mean he never quite gets out of present time whenever he starts to look at something anybody here who does that yeah he says im going back to the time when i was sitting in the chair there and scan all that out and he doesnt seem to go anyplace and he looks at himself sitting in the chair and he runs it couple of times and its gone but what hes actually doingwhat hes doingis he dubs himself in as sitting in the chair and then dubs in the incident that happened to him and then says now ill run it out and so he rubs out what he dubbed in and then he says now i feel better well facsimile is little bit different than that facsimile is pretty quote unquote solid but somebody else would love you to have facsimiles and you dont need any the less facsimiles you have the faster you can think the less facsimiles you have the better off you are and yet the second you start to rub out the whole bankand if you were to suddenly say im going to take all of my memory banks and im going to wipe them all outpsheww oh you say ooooh because thats mmhm yep yep all those memories theyre you see i dont exist anywhere so those memories are so if i wiped out any of these memories of course i would be gone yeah i need those you get people who have this so bad by the way that locks wont blow and that is the principal reason why locks wont blow on some preclears because theyve got to have this memory bank because this memory bank is them actually it is not them at all they are vital spark of beingness and that vital spark of beingness happens to be cause and it happens to know and it can know anything it wants to know instantly and its wonderful little gimmick and its the one that does all of your thinking for you anyhow but an implant can be put on to you to such degree that youve agreed that this and that is the case so the best thing for you to do is to go back and look at the facsimile or go back and remember what you were taught in school or go back and do something or other and then think it all out and then get into present time again and then say well i remember it oh its nonsense there is knowledge worth knowing thats in your memory bank all the knowledge thats worth knowing is outside your memory bankin complete and perfect contact with the beingness that is you seems hard to believe doesnt it but actually you can understand completely how an automobile drives by being the automobile you can slide in behind the wheel maybe sometime when you were little kid you could do this before some grownup grabbed ahold of you and said ooh ooohno we have to teach you and were going to teach you now now lets start in at the beginning and lets not try to run before we learn how to walk and now if you learn this thoroughly we can get you feeling mighty stupid and thenthen we can get lot of work out of you when you grow up but there have been times in your life when you suddenly looked at something and you knew it and then maybe question came into your mind well how could i possibly have known it because i didnt have access to it well you were it for moment so of course you knew it l ron hubbard from the lecture therapy section of technique 80 part ii excerpted from the route to infinity lectures test your knowledge of the route to

the data from those lectures the route to infinity i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true my wife and i have been scientologists for over 25 years for variety of reasons we got stalled on the bridge i was at clear my wife at ot iii although we had the purpose and intention to move up the bridge it just wasnt happening as any scientologist would agree this creates serious failed purpose i started listening to the the route to infinity lectures while in my car driving to and from sales and service calls and key datum that ron repeats frequently began to sink in from my own duplication of lrh it was as follows the mest universe is reality only because we all agree to it but that it is really an illusion and shabby one at that ones own universe is the actuality as thetan slides down the scale he reverses this concept so that his own universe becomes seemingly insignificant illusion the mest universe becomes the reality and that the actuality is lost to that thetan somewhere around the fourth lecture the datum finally sunk in and i cognited on what he was saying that the reason i was so pressed back having my intention blunted etc was because i believed that i could survive only if i agreed with mest until it would permit to survive when i got home i put aside all of the problems i was facing located myself in the room i was in and then created the illusion that i was in fact quite successful in anything i wanted to be that had all of the space i needed and could enjoy the game of life and get up the bridge less than two weeks later i pulled in the money to get going on the bridge again and to do it full time this year i have moved from stalled clear to ot iv my wife has completed ot iv and v and in less than two months we will be going to flag for vi and vii now from this viewpoint i see that i was imprisoned in structure of my own making unable to get out even though i was holding the key in my hand which i had forgotten about and i wasnt even aware that i held anything in my hand without the data from those lectures i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true i share this data with you with the hope and postulate that you can use the data in these lectures and if you are stuck trapped or blunted on your progress up the bridge i cannot recommend this data highly enough mt ot iv order your set now by clicking here or by phone 800 7221733 send your friends this newsletter sendandsubscribelink removelink 2003 bridge publications inc
