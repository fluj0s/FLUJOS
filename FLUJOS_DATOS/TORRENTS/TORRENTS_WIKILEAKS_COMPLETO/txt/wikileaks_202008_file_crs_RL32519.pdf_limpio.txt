opportunities for people to impr ove the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future the us should counter the conti nued growth of islamist terrorism by engaging other nations in developing comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism there are several multilateral institutions in which such issues should be addressed but the most important policies

president should make more effective use of authority to designate foreign governments as not cooperating fully with us counterterrorism efforts to deter all state support for terrorism specifically the president should di rect the secretar of state to consider greece and pakistan among others as candidates for this designation review the current list of state sponsors and recommend that certain states be moved to the not c ooperating fully designation after they have undertaken specified measures to cease sponsorship of terrorism increase publicity of the activities of state sponsors and countries designated as not cooperating fully through special reports making extensive use of the internet the secretary of state should ensure the list of foreign terrorist organizations fto designati ons is credible and frequently updated the secretary of state in concert with other departments and agencies should take the lead in developing an international convention aimed at

athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32519crs5 home and abroad including the gr owing terrorism threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and associated technologies this strategy shoul d identify and fully engage those foreign policy economic military in telligence and law enforcement elements that are critical to comprehensive blueprint for success in the war against terrorism as part of that effort the director of national intelligence shall develop the intelligence community component of the strategy identifying specific programs and budgets an including plans to address the threats posed by osama bin nssg laden and qaida hezbollah hamas and other significant terrorist groups consistent with pplicable law the strategy should effectively employ and integrate all capabilities available to the intelligence community against thos threats and should encompass specific efforts to develop human sources to pene trate terrorist organizations and networks both overseas and within the united states fully utilize existing and future technologies to better exploit terrorist communications to improve and expand the use of data mining and other cutting edge analytical tools and to develop multilevel security capability to facilitate th timely and complete sharing of relevant intelligence inform ation both within the inte lligence community and with other appropriate federal state and local authorities maximize the effective use of covert action in counterterrorist efforts develop programs to deal with financial support for international terrorism facilitate the ability of cia paramilitary units and military special operations forces to conduct joint operations against terrorist targets the state department in consultation with the department of justice should review and report to the president and the congress by june 30 2003 on the extent to which revisions in bilateral and multilateral agreements including extradition and mutual assistance treaties would strengthen us c ounterterrorism effo rts the review should address the degree to which current categories of extraditable offenses should be expanded to cover offenses such as visa and immigration fraud which may be pa rticularly useful against terrorists and those who support them the intelligence community and particularly the fbi and the cia should aggressively address the po ssibility that foreign governments are providing support to or are invol ved in terrorist activity targeting the united states and us inte rests statesponsored terrorism substantially increases the likeli hood of successful and more lethal attacks within the united states this issue must be addressed from national standpoint and should not be limited in focus by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32519crs6 geographical and factual boundaries of individual cases the fbi and cia should aggressively and thoroughly pursue related matters developed through this joint inquiry that have been referred to them for further investigation by these committees key hartrudman commission recommendations the president should develop comp rehensive strategy to heighten americas ability to prevent and protect against all forms of attack on the homeland and to respond to such attacks if prevention and protection fail institutional steps to protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks key 911 commissi on recommendations the united states should combine terrorist travel intelligence operations and law enforcement in strategy to intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain terrorist mobility the u s border security system should be integrated into larger network of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors the president should direct the department of homeland security dhs to lead the effort to design comprehensive screening system addressing common problems and setting common standards with systemwide goals in mind extending those st andards among other governments could dramatically strengthen america and the worlds collective ability to intercept individuals who pose catastrophic threats the department of homeland secu rity properly supported by the congress should complete as quick ly as possible biometric entry exit screening system including single system for speeding qualified travelers it should be integrated with the system that provides benefits to foreigners seeking to stay in the united states linking biometric passports to good data systems and decision making is fundamental goal we should do more to exchange terrorist information with trusted allies and raise us and global border security standards for travel and border crossing over the dium and long term through extensive interna tional cooperation secure identification should begin in the united states the federal government should set standards fo r the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as drivers licenses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32519crs7 the us government should identif and evaluate the transportation assets that need to be protected set riskbased priorities for defending them select the most practical and costeffective ways of doing so and then develop pla n budget and funding to implement the effort the plan should assign roles and missions to the relevant authorities federal state regional and local and to private stakeholders improved use of nofly and au tomatic selectee lists should not be delayed while the argume nt about successor to capps continues this screening functi on should be performed by the tsa transportation security admin istration and it should u tilize the larger set of watch lists maintained by the federal government air carriers should be required to suppl the information needed to test and implement this new system the tsa and the congress must give priority attention to improving the ability of screening checkpoi nts to detect explosives on passengers as start each individual selected for special screening should be screened for explosives further the tsa should conduct human factors study method ofte n used in the private sector to understand problems in screener performance and set attainable objectives for individual screener s and for the checkpoints where screening takes place as the president determines the guidelines for information sharing among government agencies and by those agencies with the private sector he should safeguard the pr ivacy of individuals about whom information is shared the burden of proof for retaining particular governmental power should be on the executive to explain that the power actually materially enhances security and b that there is adequate supervision of the executives use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties if the power is granted there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use at this time of increased and consolidated government authority there should be board within the executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend and the commitment the government makes to fend our civil liberties homeland security assistance s hould be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnera bilities now in 2004 washington dc and new york city are certainly at the top of any such list we understand the contention that ever state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for em ergency response but federal homeland security assistance s hould not remain program for general revenue sharing it should supplement state and localhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32519crs8 resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support emergency response agencies nati onwide should adopt the incident command system ics when multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved they should adopt unified command both are proven frameworks for em ergency response we strongly support the decision that federal homeland security funding will be contingent as of october 12004 upon the adoption and regular use of ics and unified command procedures in the future the department of homela nd security should consider making funding contingent on aggressive and realistic training in accordance with ics and unified command procedures congress should support pending legi slation which provides for the expedited and increased assignme nt of radio spectrum for public safety purposes furthermore high risk urban areas such as new york city and washington dc should establish signal corps units to ensure communications connectivity between and among civilian authorities local first responders and the national guard federal funding of such units should be given high priority by congress we endorse the american nationa l standards institutes ansi recommended standard for priv ate preparedness we were encouraged by secretary tom ridges praise of the standard and urge the department of homeland security to promote its adoption we also encourage the insurance and creditrating industries to look closely at companys compliance with the ansi standard in assessing its insurability and creditworthiness we believe that compliance with the standard shoul d define the standard of care owed by company to its employees and the public for legal purposes we recommend the establishment of national counterterrorism center nctc built on the founda tion of the existing terrorist threat integration center ttic breaking the older mold of national government organization th is nctc should be center for joint operational planning and joint intelligence staffed by personnel from the various agencies the head of the nctc should have authority to evaluate the performance of the people assigned to the center key gilmore commission recommendations there should be national level st rategy on combating terrorism that clearly delineates and distinguishes federal state and local roles and responsibilities and articulates clear direction for federal priorities and programs to s upport local responders and comprehensive parallel public education efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32519crs9 more needs to be done and can be done to obt ain and share information on potential

create single pr incipal point of oversight and review for homeland security congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee should have ju risdiction over this department and its duties but we believe that congress does have the obligation to choose one in the house and one in the senate and that this committee should be permanent standing committee with nonpartisan staff since
