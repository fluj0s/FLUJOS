ru subject saudi exchange with russian ambassador on irans nuclear plans classified by pm counselor scott mcgehee reasons 14 b d 1 c summary comment netherlands ambassador ron strikker russian ambassador victor gibinvish and embassy riyadh polmil counselor scott mcgehee met on january 25 with dr prince turki alkabeer undersecretary for multilateral affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs to deliver joint demarche on the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism gicnt the meeting evolved into pointed exchange between the russian ambassador and dr prince turki on irans nuclear ambitions prince turki warned that if iran tried to produce nuclear weapons other countries in the gulf region would be compelled to do the same or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the gulf to serve as deterrent to the iranians turki then pointedly demanded that the us keep saudi officials informed about us plans for iran 2 c dr prince turki is not decisionmaker but he is reliable transmitter of official saudi thinking most of what he said is not new although this is the most explicit mention we have heard of saudi willingness to see nuclear weapons deployed in the gcc as deterrent to iran his concern that the united states will negotiate grand bargain with iran without consulting saudi arabia is concern we have heard often in recent weeks end summary comment 3 c after hearing brief verbal demarche from ambassador strikker on the upcoming june plenary of the gicnt dr turki turned to ambassador gibinvish saying on this issue what concerns us most is how to get our neighbor to change its policy on enrichment iran needs to be convinced to enter dialogue on this matter he continued noting that saudi arabia is also concerned about the russianbuilt reactor at bushehr leakage from plant at that location could bring an environmental catastrophe to saudi arabia pointing out that it is located less than 300 kilometers away from saudi shores across open water 4 c ambassador gibinvish was able to say only sure i agree before prince continued the location is so dangerous not just to us but to the world economy he urged that russia use its influence to have the reactor moved north suggesting that location on the shore of the caspian sea would be much better where there is water available for reactor cooling and where mountains rise behind to contain any possible leakage from moving south perhaps more troubling he said is irans pursuit of nuclear enrichment he explained that if iran tries to produce nuclear weapons other countries in the gulf region would be compelled to do the same or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in the gulf to serve as deterrent to the iranians 5 c amb gibinvish responded that irans desire to enrich uranium reflected its fears that it will someday be attacked by israel or the united states and also sign of irans desire to establish its supremacy in the region prince turki interjected and we cannot accept iranian supremacy in the region we are okay with nuclear electrical power and desalination but not with enrichment he said that the prospect of iranian enrichment raises troubling questions about their motivations for doing so they do not need it 6 s amb gibinvish noted that some experts in russia believe that iran will have bomb in 10 to 15 years russia he said is concerned about this matter as well and has put forward initiatives with iran russia hopes to discuss this further with saudi arabia in the near future and he said that an important delegation would be coming to riyadh in about two months to discuss this with the saudi leadership prince turki said that the russian delegation would be welcomed stressing that we must work together to get them to abandon their effort to acquire nuclear weapons israel too he said must be convinced to surrender its nuclear arsenal but you deal with them you have influence that is why i raise this with you amb gibinvish pledged that we will do what we can but the iranians are difficult partners at this point prince turki turned to polmil counselor who had momentarily stopped taking notes prince turki said please write this down whatever is discussed with the iranians we must be kept informed any riyadh 00000181 002 of 002 negotiations with the iranians must take into account the interests of saudi arabia otherwise we will not accept it we should be told in advance of what you plan to say rundell
