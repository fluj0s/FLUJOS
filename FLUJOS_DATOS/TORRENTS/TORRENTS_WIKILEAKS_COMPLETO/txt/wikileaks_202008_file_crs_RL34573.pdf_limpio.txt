protection of the polar bear updated october 16 2008 kristina alexander legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34573does the endangered species act listing provide more protection of the polar bear summary the polar bear has been protected under the marine ma mmal protection act mmpa since 1972 meaning that it is illegal to kill or harass the bear or to transport or trade its parts with few exceptions the endangered species act also prohibits killing or harming listed species some ask if it was already illegal to kill or harm the bear when the us fish and wildlife service placed the polar bear on the list of protected species on may 15 2008 what protections were provided by the listing one example of increased protection is that being listed as threatened species categorized the polar bear as depleted species under the mmpa meaning that polar bear trophies could longer be impor ted from sporthunts in canada under that mmpa exception approximately 80 bears year are permitted for import under this program perhaps the more significant protection offered by the listing is habitat protection the has several provisions that function to protect not just the bear but its habitat while the mmpa has bitat protection as purpose it does not require any habitat conservation measures or punish habitat struction fws has agreed to designate critical habitat by june 30 2010 and so that environmental protection will be available then the citizen suit provision of the could protect the bear if litigants use its terms to challenge not just government acti ons but those by private parties the requires another system that might protect the bear establishing recovery plan but the fish and wildlife service has not completed the process at time recovery plan is prepared it would estab lish recovery goals nd trigger congressional monitoring of the polar bears progress areas in which the might have pr ovided additional protections such as for incidental takes or subsistence users were eliminated by the special rules that accompanied the listing which defined those protections as more extensive than the mmpa had the polar bear been listed as an endangered species rather than threatened there would be special rule s and arguably the protection would have increasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34573contents p r t c t i n s 1 p r h i b

questioned the need to use the to protect the bear citing other treaties statutes and regulations that protect polar bears primarily the marine mammal protection act mmpa2 this report discusses what additi onal protections are provided by the listing that were not available before the fish and wildlife service fws considered existing regulatory protections before listing the polar bear that is one of the five factors requires when making listing determination3 fws found that potential threats to polar bears from direct take disturbance by humans nd incidental or harassment take are for the most part adequately ddressed through inte rnational agreements national state provincial or territorial legislation and other regulatory mechanisms4 however the polar bear was listed because the bears primary habitat of sea ice was threatened with destruction due to gl obal climate change fws f ound that the bear was likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future protections the and the mmpa have similar provenances both appeared during the high tide of environmental legislation of the late 1960s and early 1970s both are written to protect species and their habitats the endangered species act has broad purpose it is intended to provide means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved and to provide program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34573crs2 6 mmpa 22 16 usc 13612 7 9 16 usc 1538a1 mmpa 101 16 usc 1371a 8 50 cfr 173 see babb itt v sweet

protected under the acts7 the definition of take includes harm which means killing or injuring wildlife including significant habitat disruption that impairs essential behavioral patterns8 it also includes harass meaning an action likely to injure by significantly disrupting nor mal behavioral patterns9 under the mmpa the term take includes harass hunt capture or k ill or attempt to do those activities10 harass means acts that have the potential to injure marine mammal level harassment or has the potential to disturb marine mammal by causing disruption of behavioral pa tterns level b harassment by being listed under both statutes the bear enjoys the protections of both the regulation has been interpreted to mean habitat disturbance by itself can function as take although courts have not uniformly agreed on this the dispute centers on whether species must be injured or killed before the statute has been violated the ninth circuit has in terpreted taking broa dly as it applies to habitat modification which in cludes alaska the bears u s habitat the court has held that if an injury to wildlife occurs as result of the habitat change either in the past present or future the definiti ons injury requirement is satisfied11 this could be an advantage to polar bear protecti on as the mmpa does not directly prohibit habitat destruction however not all courts w ill find take based on hab itat destruction without an actual injury for example one district court said that an injury must occur before prohibited taking may be found although some of the comments specific ally argued that habitat modification alone is prohibited taking under s ection 9 in the opinion of the service congress expressed such intent in response to the broad misperception of the intent of the

time of the listing15 in essence the polar bear special rules harmonize the requirements of the mmpa and the saying that compliance with the mmpa will be treated as compliance with the they are discussed in more detail later in this report exceptions both statutes have exceptions to their prohibitions permits may be issued under either the or the mmpa for taking species for scientific

subsistence users the two acts have different provisions regarding how native alaskans may take polar bears it is not clear that the listing provides additional protections for the polar bear the fws says that the mmpa rule is more restrictive and that it will treat complian ce with that act as compliance with the esa20 in essence neutralizing any additional protections the may have provided both laws provide exemptions for alaskan natives to take species for subsistence purposes21 the definition of subsistence users is more restrictive in the mmpa than the both allow indians aleuts and eskimos to kill polar bears for subsistence use however section 10e of the also allows nonnative permanent residents of an alaska native village to take for subsistence use22 on the other hand the allows only subsiste nce use in its exception while the mmpa also permits alaskan natives to take polar bears for commercial sale of traditional handicrafts made of polar bear parts23 incidental takes in general as stated above both the and the mmpa allow incidental takes of species protected under the acts24 there are differences between the two programs unde r the incidental takes are divided into two categories section 10 takes by citizens which are authorized by incidental take permits and section 7 consultations for takes by federal agencies which are authorized by incidental take statements25 the mmpa has two ty pes of takes based on the severity of the action incidental take authorizations itas also known as letters of authorization for killing or in juring animals and incidental harassment authorizations for lesser takes26 all have statutory author ization but the details are in the regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34573crs5 27 50 cfr 1732b1iiic 28 50 cfr 1827d

such permit include description of the activity the names and numbers of the species and bitat conservation plan hcp the hcp requires the applicant to describe the steps it will take to monitor minimize and mitigate any impacts to the threatened species alternative actions and why they are not being used and any other necessary and appropriate measures imposed by fws27 permission for an mmpa incidental take requires an applicant to submit data about the project and the impacted animals and to suggest mitigation28 the agency is required to review the application using the best scientific evidence the mmpa requires monitoring and reporting during the time the take is authorized even though both statutes allow incident takes the steps to obtain those permits are different under the the incidental take permits are issued to an individual which can be corporation29 under mmpa the incidental take authorizations are issued for an activity instead the language of the mmpa allows us citizens to seek authorization for specified activities to allow the incidental take of small numbers of marine mammals fo r fiveyear periods provided that the taking will have negligible impact on such species and will not overdeplete animals available to subsistence users30 similar permission may be provided for oneyear periods for activities that incidentally harass small numbers of marine mammals31 one difference in the incidental ta ke permit under the over the mmpa equivalent is that the permit can be valid for decades ev 100 years the mmpa authorization is valid for fiveyear periods although it can be renewed it is not clear if this difference pr otects the polar bear however special rules for polar bears the incidental take provisions of section 1722 ordinarily apply to threatened species but the section 4d rules for the polar bears alter this in one section of the special rule fws establishes that the rules for taking polar bears will be the same under the as they were under the mmpa fws stated if incidental take has been authorized under section 101a5 of the mmpa either by the issuance of an incide ntal harassment authorization or

cfr 173 37 7 16 usc 1536incidental take regulations we will not require an incidental take permit issued in accordance with 50 cfr 1732b32 fws states that the standard under mmpa is more restrictive it says that the definition of negligible impact which is defined as an impact that cannot be reasonably expected to and is not reasonably likely to adversely affect the species through effects on nnual rates of recru itment or survival33 is more protective standard than 50 cf r 1732s requirement34 based on this representation by fws the listing would not increase protections for the polar bear one advantage for applicants in having an mmpa incidental take authorization over the equivalent is that hcp has to be negotiated and approved the hcp application process can be invol ved fws recommends creating steering committees to develop the scope of the hcp and mitigation programs and issued handbook to guide applicants35 however the hcp is one way in which the protects habitat of listed species an hc p is to provide for the restoration and protection of the listed species habitat36 such plan is required by the mmpa and habitat protection or restoration is required alt hough applicants are required to discuss methods to make the least impact on the species and habitat this difference appears to be an advantage to applicants by saving substantial time in assembling take application it is not clear that it is to the polar bears advantage section 7 consultations based on the above it seems that the pr otections under the two acts are nearly identical and most differences in the prohi bitions have been equalized one area in which there is still distinction between the acts is how federal agencies are authorized to take listed species the requires federal agencies taking actions that may harm polar bear to consult with the fws before committing significant resources toward that action37 this requirement is known as section 7 consultation the section 7 consultation can be timeconsuming and litigious activity look at 51 cases since 2001 in which court found fws or nmfs did not comply with the shows that 15 of those cases involved section 7

development in the state due to the extra requirements that the imposes39 under the federal agencies are re quired to consult with fws or nmfs to ensure that federal actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the adverse modification of habitat40 fws indicated there was interaction between section 7 c onsultation and the section 4d rules requirements to authorize incidental take associated with federal action are set under section 7 of the and would not be affected by this special rule41 agencies are required to consult to see if their actions may jeopardize the continued existence of the polar bear the special rules address section 7 consultations with regard to climate change some believed listing the polar bear under the would allow challenges to actions that adversely affected climate change as takes against the polar bear42 the theory was that projects that woul d increase greenhouse gas emissions such as power plant authorizations or automobile emission standards w ould adversely affect the bear by contributing to habitat loss fws has treated this in the section 4d rules at 50 cfr 1740q4 that rule states that incidental takes apply only to activities within alaska effects that occur beyond the footprint of the action would be considered only if there is causal connection between the proposed action and discernible effect to the species or critical habitat that is reasonably certain to occur43 this applies to section 7 cons ultations and the incidental take permits discu ssed above as for existing mmpa incidental take authorizations for federal actions relating to the oil and gas industry fws has said that it believes the itas are harmonious with consultation re quirements and that dditional measure would be required to the extent that any federal actions comport with the standards for mmpa incidental take authorization we woul d fully anticipate any such section 7 consultation

protection th erefore is significant to the bear the united states committed by treaty to protect the habitat of the polar bear in 1973 the united states canada denmark norway and the former union of

give special attention to habita t components such as denning and feeding sites and migration patterns and manage polar bear populations in accordance with s ound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data in addition to the international obligation to protect polar bear habitat the prohibits habitat destruction that injures an animal and requires incidental takes to

bear in 2006 fws has said that it would make its critical habitat designation separately from the listing51 the center for biological diversity sued fws for not designating critical habitat at the

while the mmpa has reporting requireme nt in conjunction with monitoring efforts under the itas there is similar requirement fo r identifying any success in protecting species in some instances recovery plan is issued at the time of the listing plan for the polar bear has been issued upon completion of plan congress would receive biennial updates on the polar bears status citizen suits the has an enforcement provision that the mmpa does not the allows citizens to take action against other citizens to halt violations of the act57 the citizen suit provision could provide additiona l protection for the polar bear if citizen enforcers use it it allows any person to give 60 days written notice of violation to an alleged violator and the fws if the fws or the united states has not begun an action to redress the viola tion or otherwise punish the violator by then civil suit may be filed to enjoin the violation in practice however the citizen suit provision primarily is used against federal agencies and very rarely against anybody else additionally the special rules limitation of takings to actions within alaska combined with the geographical remoteness of polar bears may inhibit this tools use citizens may bring suit for violations of the mmpa only against federal agency by using the administrative procedure act apa difference if listed as endangered there would be slightly different protecti ons if the polar bear had been listed as an endangered species rather than th reatened one however as it was already forbidden to kill harm or harass the bear under the mmpa an endangered status would not improve that prot ection primarily with an endangered listing there would be special rules without the special rules there would be homogenization of the incidental take pe rmission incidental takes would require development of hcps focusing more atte ntion on habitat restor ation and protection takes of the polar bear would not be limited to actions in alaska and takings based on climate change could be mo re of factor also wit hout the special rules there would not be an exception allowing the killing of polar bears for commercial sale of handicrafts by subsistence users the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna cites provides dditional trade protections for those species threatened with extinction known as appendix i speci the polar bear is listed as an appendix ii species meaning that it does not have all of the prot ections available to an appendix i species country cannot unilaterally place species on those lists however the united states listing the polar bear as being in danger of extinctionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34573crs11 would likely be persuasive in changing the bears status from appendix ii to appendix i conclusion the polar bear was already protected under the mmpa before the fws listed it as threatened under the but some additional protections inure to the polar bears benefit being listed as threatened species meant permits for importing sport hunted polar bear parts from canada were discontinued pr actice that permitted approximately 80 bears per year for import the protects the bear and its habitat meaning that some protection may accrue if habitat destruction is prosecuted the citizen suit provision is tool that could be used to halt activities that are harming the bear but it is seldom used to challenge an ything but government actions otherwise there appears to be little additional protection provided by the listing while there may have been some differences between the incidental take permissions under the versus the mmp and fws says the mmpa is stricter those differences were ended by the special rules that declared compliance under the mmpa would be evidence of compliance with the the special rules also declared that the mmpa rules for subsistence users apply ending any distinction that might have protected the polar bear had ju st the been used finally the special rules limited takes to actions occurring in alaska circumscribing the scope of citizen suits critical habitat designation and recovery plans are two areas in which the provides protection but the mmp does not however as neither was prepared at the time of the listing th potential for such additional protections remains unaddressed
