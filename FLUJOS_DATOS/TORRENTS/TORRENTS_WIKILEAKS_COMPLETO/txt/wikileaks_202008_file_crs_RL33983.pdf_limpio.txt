leftist sandinista party and allies of rightist former president alemán alemán and ortega once long time political foes negotiated power sharing pact pacto in 1998 that s since defined national politics their parties passed laws making it difficult for other parties to participate in elections and otherwise facilitated an alternating of terms between their two parties their ongoing influence made governing increasingly difficult for president bolaños who had limited legislative support in 2004 renegotiation of the pact included demand for alemáns release in oc tober 2004 the organization of american states oas sent special mission to nicaragua to encourage all parties to preserve and follow democratic order there in january 2005 the two parties adopted series of constitutional amendments that transferred presidential powers to the legislature and further divided up government institutions as political patronage moves the central american court of justice ruled illegal during the height of tensions pr esident bolaños invoked the oas inter american democratic charter and the oas sent several highlevel delegations to help negotiate solution negotiations in octobe r 2005 considerably reduced tensions and provided for president bola ños who had been isolated by his anti corruption efforts against alemán to serve the remainder of his term which expired in january

the passage of the 2006 budget the firstever tax code local government transfers and financial administration reforms ortega and bolaños then agreed to postpone the implementation of the constitutional amendments at the root of the tensions politics remained volatile in 2006 but for different reason as attention shifted to national elections held on november 5 2006 the fsln and plc

elements were key to ortegas victory change in nicaraguan electoral law an effective political machine and divided opposition the sandinistas negotiated change in the electoral law with thenpresident

candidates is held many obser vers saw this lowering of th threshold as part of the pact alternating power between the plc and fsln the lower percentage required to win in the first round facilitated the election of ortega whose support in the previous three presidential elections had hovered around 40 analysts believed ortega felt it was critical he win in first round because the opposition would unite against him in second round ortega w on only 379 of the vote but was able to avoid runoff vote because he was 96 ahead of the next closest candidate eduardo montealegre of the nicaraguan liberal alliance aln ortega also had the advantage of an extremely welldisciplined party critics say he forced out members seeking reform nd made the party into platform for his personal ambitions in addition ortega ensured through his position as opposition leader in the legislature and through the pact that fsln loyalists were firmly entrenched throughout various government agencies according to polls prior to the vote about 60 of voters said they would not vote for ortega this held true in the final vote but the opposition was divided in 2006 among four candidates in the 2001 presidential
