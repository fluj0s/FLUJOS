ir is subject codel kyls meeting with prime minister netanyahu what will the us do about iran classified by ambassador james b cunningham reason 14 b d 1 s summary codel kyl accompanied by the ambassador called on prime minister benyamin netanyahu april 6 in the first official us meeting with netanyahu since he formed government the main topics of discussion were stopping irans nuclear program and netanyahus approach to peacemaking with the palestinians on iran senator kyl raised ways to increase the effect of sanctions including possible legislation targeting iranian imports of refined petroleum adopting forceful stance netanyahu asked repeatedly what the us plans to do if sanctions and engagement fail to stop irans program calling irans development of nuclear bomb worldchanging event netanyahu said all other issues become insignificant by comparison on the palestinians netanyahu reviewed his intent to pursue threetrack approach with political economic and security aspects while noting that his government is conducting review of israeli policy toward the palestinians netanyahu asserted that there is agreement within the government and among 80 of israelis that the palestinians should be able to rule themselves but with limits imposed by israels security requirements netanyahu said the only difference between his position and that of opposition leader tzipi livni is over the name of the goal ie the twostate solution in response to comments by senator sessions that the palestinian authority needs functioning courts and jails as well as police netanyahu agreed but said he had not yet focused much on palestinian governance issues netanyahu said he wants to show the palestinians the benefits of peace but with the proviso that if iran goes nuclear peace will fail predicting that his government would pleasantly surprise many critics netanyahu concluded that he hopes to come up with common approach with president obama end summary 2 u codel kyl consisting of senator jon kyl r az senator jeff sessions r representative jane harman d ca representative john kline r mn and representative chris carney d pa called on prime minister benyamin netanyahu april 6 the ambassador congressional staff and pol couns notetaker participated in the meeting netanyahu was joined by national security adviser uzi arad spokesman mark regev policy adviser ron dermer former chairman of the knessets foreign affairs and defense committee kadima mk tzachi hanegbi senators kyls counterpart in the usisrael joint parliamentary committee on national security and the israeli embassy in washingtons congressional liaison officer the meeting was the first official us face to face contact with netanyahu since he formed his government what will the us do about iran 3 s after brief discussion of the world economic crisis senator kyl raised iran noting the sobering briefings the codel had received from senior israeli defense and intelligence officials the previous day kyl said the congress is looking at legislation that would target irans imports of refined petroleum products adding that there are only four or five companies that supply refined petroleum to iran and the us has considerable leverage over most of them kyl added that israeli experts had told the codel that they thought such legislation would be helpful netanyahu said nothing is slowing the progress of irans nuclear program the prime minister asked what will happen to the middle east if iran obtains nuclear weapon if such prospect is unacceptable what will the us do as iran reaches the nuclear threshold what will the us do if pakistan is taken over by islamic radicals 4 s representative harman told netanyahu that one in the codel disagreed with his analysis but the us should give engagement an opportunity to see if it works if it does not at least it would show the world that the us had tried she added that congress supports engagement on bipartisan basis senator kyl added that the europeans tried to engage iran for five years but it did not work president obama will pursue engagement but kyl said he doubted it would be successful we should consider what to do in the mean time netanyahu responded that the us should move quickly engagement should have short time limit and specific goal for example talk to the iranians for four to twelve weeks and make clear that the us goal is an end to their nuclear program leaning forward netanyahu repeated his earlier question what will you do if it does not work tel aviv 00000936 002 of 003 5 s netanyahu said that learning to live with nuclear iran would be big mistake which would lead to different more dangerous world while he noted that he could not say for certain that iran would use nuclear weapon against israel if iran had bomb israelis would have to ask that question every day this is historic moment and leaders have responsibility to make decisions all other issues are insignificant by comparison for third time netanyahu asked what are you going to do netanyahus approach to the palestinians 6 c senator kyl asked the prime minister about his view of the twostate solution netanyahu said he plans to engage the palestinian authority quickly and will not tie political talks with the palestinians to developments with iran reviewing now familiar formula netanyahu said he will approach the palestinians on parallel political economic and security tracks political talks would aim at achieving an agreement within certain limits the economic approach would promote foreign and arab investment and joint projects with israeli partners while the security track would continue to build up the pas security forces in order to do any of this netanyahu noted he will need palestinian partner 7 c representative harman observed that the codel had visited units of the pas national security forces and the presidential guard pa prime minister fayyad said he was happy with the pas security forces and they want to take on increased responsibility for security in jericho and jenin netanyahu replied that israel would be happy to let them do more but it is not clear what hamas will do next if hamas forces confrontation israel will have to initiate further military action in gaza israel did not want to go back into gaza but it will do what is necessary to protect its people 8 c netanyahu said his government is reviewing israels policy toward the palestinians there is consensus in the government and among 80 of the israeli public that the palestinians should be able to govern themselves the only limits on palestinian sovereignty would be elements that affect israels security palestinian state must be demilitarized without control over its air space and electromagnetic field and without the power to enter into treaties or control its borders netanyahu concluded that he and opposition leader tzipi livni only disagree about the name ie the twostate solution 9 c senator sessions noted that people everywhere want law and order palestinians not only need to deal with terrorism they also need functioning legal system moving from lawless system the palestinian authority is showing some pride but police are not enough they need courts and jails that work economic development is impossible in lawless society netanyahu agreed this was valid point and uncharacteristically admitted that he had not focused much on palestinian governance he added that international assistance should provide funding for jails and courts it is possible to create crimefree zones and begin economic development in bubbles which would then be expanded senator sessions noted that lt general dayton is focused on this issue representative harman commented that bubbles in the west bank would not be enough palestinians need law and order everywhere 10 c netanyahu said the classic rhetoric of the peace process has been that if israel withdraws all will be well now however if israel withdrew from the west bank hamas would take over economic development would not be substitute for political settlement but it would change the environment and show palestinians the benefits of peace israel has been trying to build roof without foundation and it has not worked netanyahu said there was one proviso if iran gets nuke peace efforts will fail 11 c netanyahu pointed to the example of jordanian king hussein whom he termed israels best arab ally and man deeply committed to peace yet when saddam hussein took kuwait king hussein got on board with the iraqis in the event of nuclear iran all the arabs will become qatar we should therefore move in parallel to work for peace with the palestinians while acting to stop iran netanyahu said he thought his government would pleasantly surprise many of its critics he concluded the meeting by saying that he wants to coordinate israels positions with the us and hopes to come to common position with president obama tel aviv 00000936 003 of 003 12 u codel kyl has cleared this cable visit embassy tel avivs classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpneatelaviv cunningham
