marine corps air force and theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31810crs2 1 facility sustainment restoration and m odernization srm includes the repair and maintenance of buildings structures ware houses roadways runways aprons railway tracks utility plants and their associated dist ribution systems plus minor construction cost not to exceed 500 thousand to create new facilities or expand alter or convert existing facilities large part of the funding dedicate d to the srm function is requested not as part of the military construction appropriation but rather as part of the operations and maintenance account within the annual defense appropriation 2 the nato security investment program is th us contribution to alliance funds for the construction of facilities and the procurement of equipment essential to the wartime support of operational forces in the common defense of the nato area facilities funded by this program include airfields naval bases sign and telecom installations pipelines war headquarters as well as early warning radar and missile installations the us contributes approximately 25 of the total annual nsip asse ssment with the rest coming from the other members of the north atlantic alliance 3 virtually all costs associat ed with the latest complete d brac round that of fy1995 have been funded the bulk of current brac appr opriations before the next round commences in fy2005 will be dedicated to environmental remediation of closed military installations 4 see crs report rl31005 appropriations and authorization for fy 2002 defense by amy belasco mary

defensewide construction us contributions to the nato security investment program form erly known as the nato infrastructure program2 and military family housing operations and cons truction the bill also provides funding for the base realignm ent and closure brac account which finances most base realignment and clos ure costs including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions nd environmental cleanup at closing sites3 the military construction appr opriations bill is one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for na tional defense othe r major appropriation legislation includes the defe nse appropriations bill whic h provides funds for all non construction military activities of the department of defense and constitutes more than 90 of national securityrelated spending and the energy and water development appropriations b ill which provides funding fo r atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy and for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers two other appropriations bills va hudindependent agencies and commercejusticestate also include small amounts for national defense4 funds may be expended by any agency of the federal government before they are appropriated5 in addition for nearly half century congress has forbidden the department of defense to obligate funds for any project or program until specific authorization is granted6 this explains why for fense funds both authorization and appropriations bills are required two separate defense appropriations bills are written annually military c onstruction appropriations act dedicated to military construction and na tional defense appropriations act covering all other defensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31810crs3 7 the relevant subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees are military construction for the military construction appropriation and defense for the national defense appropriation 8 the subcommittee on readiness in the house armed services committee and the subcommittee on readiness and management support in the senate armed services committee draft legislation to authoriz military construction appropriations 9 the homeowners assistance fund defense was established by the demonstration cities and metropolitan development act of 1966 42 usc 3374 it authorizes the secretary of defense to acquire the title to or to reimburse for certain losses upon the sale of one and twofamily homes owned by federal employees located at or near military installations ordered closed in whole or in partappropriations7 normally only one national defe nse authorization act is passed each year to authorize both of these appropriations8 therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues includi ng military construction can be associated with any of these bills b ecause issues in the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this report includes salient parts of the authorization bill in its discussion of the military construction appropriation process the separate military cons truction appropriati ons bill dates to the late 1950s traditionally military cons truction was funded thr ough annual defense or supplemental appropriations b ills however the korean war prompted surge of military construc tion followed by steady increase in military construction appropriations given the str ong and enduring security threat posed by the soviet union relatively high level of spending on military infrastructure appeared likely to continue the appropriations

demilitarization of chemical munitions had usually been divided between the defense and military construction appropriations because both construction and operations are involved in the process for fy2004 the department of defense folded both components into the much larger defense appropriations request apparently to be able to shift funds into nd out of construction w ithout having to request

an iraqi freedom fund iff the iff is transfer account or an account that is not dedicated to any specific purpose rather it can be considered holding pot for funds that may be transferred to other accounts at the discretion of the secretary of defense the re quest justifies the creation of transfer account by noting the unpredictable scope dur ation and intensity of ong oing military operations in iraq and afghanistan this provision is contained in the enacted law according to the language of the legisl ation authority to transfer the funds in the iff is to be granted to the secretary of defense and is in addition to any other existing transfer authority funds may be transferred from the iff to military personnel operation nd maintenance overseas huma nitarian disaster assistance and civic aid procurement military cons truction defense health program and working capital appropriations accounts any funds deemed to be in excess after transfer to regular appropr iations account may be returned to the iff for subsequent retransfer the request specifies that the secretary of defense will notify the congressional defense committees not less than five 5 days in advance of any transfer and will summarize the details of i ff transfers not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter contingency construction under chapter 8 general provisions the secretary of defens asked for the authority to transfer up to 500 million of the supplemental appropriations into tingency construction account this proposal did not survive but section 1301 of the acted bill provided temporary authority for the use of up to 150 million of operations and maintenance funds for similar purposes see below contingency construction as establishe d by 10 usc 2804 permits the secretary of defense or the secretaries of the army navy or air force to carry out any military construction project not otherwise authorized if the secretary determines that its deferral to the next military construction appropriations act would be inconsistent with national security or the national interest existing law specifies that when the secretary decides that contingency construction is appropr iate he must report this to the appropriate congressional committees the report must explain why the pr oject is necessary its justification and why it must be contingency instead of regular construction project it must also include an estimate of the projects cost section 2804 also bars the secretary from carrying out the project until after the end of 21day period that begins on the date his notification is received by the committees the supplemental appropriati ons request would have permitted the transfer of dod funds into the contingency constr uction account seven 7 days after notification was sent to the appropriate congressional committees by the secretary of defense this notificati on would have certified that th transfer is necessary to respond to or protect against acts or th reatened acts of terrorism or to support department of defense ope rations in iraq and specify the amounts and purposes of the transfer including list of pr oposed projects and

situation and assesses the impact if the project is not approvedthe recommendation further specified that notwithstanding the 21day waiting period required under title 10 the secretary of defense shall tify the appropriate committees of congress later than 15 days after the obligation of the funds for the project specifying the estimated cost of the project and including the standard dod form

military installation which is defined as real property land bu ilding or structure under the operational control of the secretary of military department or the secretary of defense for the purposes of this contingency constr uction account the recommended language expands this definition to also include an building structure or other improvement to real property to be used by the arme d forces regardless of whether such use is anticipated to be temporar or of longer duration section 1301 of the enacted legislation au thorized the secretary of defense to obligate operations and main tenance funds during fiscal year 2004 for construction projects outside the united states when they are necessary to meet urgent military operational requirements of temporary nature on military installation where the united states will not have longterm presence where the united states has intention of using the construction af ter the operational re quirement has been satisfied and the level of construction is the minimum necessary to meet the temporary requirement the act requires the secretary to notify the congressional defense committees within 15 days of the obligation of funds for any project and to submit report on all projects within 30 days of the end of each fiscalyear quarter the section specifies that only this temporary authority and the limited authority of 10 usc 2805c

included three major actions the potential realignment and closure of us military installations overseas the potential realignment and closure of installations within the united states during fy2003 and the permanent authorization of the brooks air force base development demonstration project expanded to include all military services the language as proposed was not adopted by congress instead

military department army navy and air force these pilot initiatives were to be modeled on the brooks air force base development demonstra tion project in san antonio texas the brooks air force base devel opment demonstration project the brooks air force base development monstration project also known as the base efficiency project or the brooks citybase project is partnership between the secretary of the air force and the city of san antonio texas and represents an alternative to traditional base closings or realignments usually military reservations are federal land jurisdictionally independent of the surrounding communities and governed by the base commander congress authorized the secretary to convert any military or civil service appropriated or non appropriated fund ac tivity at brooks air force base texas into contracted activity or an exchange of services compensated for by the lease sale conveyance or transfer of real or private property22 this empowered the secretary to transfer title in exchange for appropriate compensation of the whole of federal real property at brooks to the city and to lease back for military use those parts that directly support the bases military mission23 the base is then long er federal property the cost of maintaining and operating the facilitys physical plant including fire and police protection upkeep and the like is effectively transferre d along with ownership from the department of defense to the local community funds generated from the lease or sale of property reimbur sements and so on is placed in special project fund which the secretary of the air force may employ for operations leaseback maintenance and repair of department facilities and other uses24 this has taken place at brooks and one aim of the efi was to make the same management tools available permanently to all service secretaries for use where they considered appropriate but congress granted this authority only as pilot project of limited scope and
