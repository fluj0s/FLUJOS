summary in december 2001 the united states granted vietnam mostfavorednation status key condition of the usvietnam bilateral trade agreement bta that was approved by congress and signed by president bush earlier in the year since the bta went into effect us imports from vietnam have more than doubled most of this increase is due to the sharp rise in clothing imports which increased to almost 900 million in 2002 nearly twenty times the 4550 million range that vietnam had recorded in 2000 and 2001 by dollar value clothing is now the largest import item from vietnam in 2002 vietnam accounted for less than 15 of us textile and apparel imports while about onethird of vietnams textile and apparel exports went to the us market during the congressional debate over the bta many members urged the bush administration to negotiate bilateral textile agreement soon after the bta came into effect on april 25 2003 the united states and vietnam completed nearly three weeks of intense negotiations by signing bilateral textile agreement that places quotas on 38 categories of clothing imports from vietnam including cotton pants and cotton knit shirtsblouses the two most important items the deal was reached after the us side threatened to unilaterally impose more restrictive quotas if the vietnamese did not agree to us demands additionally the talks were nearly derailed by an april 2003 finding by the us customs service charging that some apparel imports labeled as vietnamese were actually produced in china on labor rights the agreement calls for vietnam to reaffirm its commitments to and cooperate with the international labor organization and to continue its bilateral programs with the us labor department these provisions are far less detailed and comprehensive than the labor

vietnam1 in february 1994 president clinton took major step towards normalizing relations when he lifted the 19year old trade embargo diplomatic relations with vietnam resumed the following year and the first postvietnam war us ambassador to vietnam was approved in 1997 in 1998 president clinton granted vietnam waiver of the jacksonvanik amendments freedomofemigration requirements step which opened the way for the overseas private investment corporation opic and the us exportimport bank exim bank to support us trade and investment in vietnam2 following this waiver and the subsequent presidential waivers granted in 1999 2000 and 2001 joint congressional resolutions of disapproval were introduced but defeated in the house in these cases opposition to the waiver had been based on concerns over vietnams emigration policy restrictions on human and religious rights and lack of appropriate accounting for pows and mias 1 legislation was enacted in 1998 to replace the term mostfavorednation with the term normal trade relations ntr in existing and future legislation the former term is used here for historical continuity and because of its continued use in international

reduced us tariffs on vietnamese goods from an average of 40 to about 35 this tariff reduction has led to sharp rise in usvietnam trade which in 2002 was worth over 29 billion more than double the value in 2001 most of the 14 billion increase in imports from vietnam came from sharp rise in clothing imports which increased to almost 900 million nearly twenty times the 4550 million range that vietnam had recorded in 2000 and 2001 see table 1 by dollar value clothing is now the largest import item from vietnam in 2002 vietnam accounted for less than 15 of us textile and apparel imports while about 33 of vietnams textile and apparel exports went to the us market the marked increase in clothing imports added to pressure on the bush administration to negotiate bilateral textile deal

trade in textiles and clothing with vietnam is of particular interest to members of congress with significant textile and clothing manufacturing in their districts as well as members representing major clothing retailers and importers additionally several members have been monitoring closely the general normalization of us vietnam relations congressional discussion regarding textile agreement with vietnam began during the debate over the bta which contains provisions restricting textile and apparel imports from vietnam some members urged the bush administration to negotiate separate bilateral textile agreement that would place quotas on imports crs4 of vietnamese textile and apparel products due to concerns that such imports would significantly affect the us textile and apparel industries6 although bilateral textile agreements do not require congressional approval congress can attempt to influence us policy toward vietnam generally through its role in reviewing presidential waivers of the jacksonvanik trade restrictions on vietnam these waivers can be rejected through joint disapproval resolution on may 29 2003 president bush transmitted to congress renewal of the jackson vanik waiver for vietnam in previous years some members of congress have used its review of the jacksonvanik waiver as an opportunity to scrutinize vietnams record on human rights and labor rights the us state department and human rights groups have reported that vietnams human rights situation worsened in 2002 particularly with regard to the treatment of ethnic minorities unregistered religious groups and individual citizens criticizing the government7 congress is also likely to focus on vietnams record in implementing its initial commitments under the bta vietnam has reportedly taken steps to carry out nearly all of the reforms that were to be completed upon the btas entry into force8 the question remains whether the government will be able to implement the longerrange reforms given the opposition of powerful vested interests and the degree of cooperation required among governmental ministries and at the provincial level the international textile and apparel trade regime from 1974 to 1995 the multifiber arrangement mfa provided the framework for international trade in textiles and apparel the mfa was set of rules governing bilateral agreements that applied quotas on imports into countries whose domestic industries were facing serious damage from rapid surge of imports from developing countries the mfa in allowing importing countries to set different quota levels for individual exporting countries conflicted with the then general agreement on tariffs and trades gatt principle of equal treatment for trading partners and with its general preference for customs tariffs over quantitative restrictions9 6 for more recent call to include labor rights provisions in textile agreement with vietnam see the prepared remarks by rep sander levin at the

period the transition period which allows manufacturers in industrial countries to prepare for increased competition from developing countries ends on january 1 2005 when all import quotas on textile and apparel products are to cease vietnams bid to join the wto vietnam is currently not wto member and therefore not party to the atc this puts vietnam at significant disadvantage in the international textile and apparel trade in two ways first vietnam does not benefit from the current phase out of existing import quotas second if vietnam is not wto member by 2005 its trade in textiles and apparel will be limited by whatever existing quotas it faces wto members on the other hand will then operate under quotafree trade in textiles and apparel vietnams prime minister phan van khai and other officials have set wto entry goal of 2005 which many analysts consider optimistic given the depth and breadth of reforms vietnam will have to undertake to meet wto requirements10 the vietnamese government has conducted several rounds of multilateral negotiations on wto accession and has commenced bilateral negotiations with various wto member nations the terms of the usvietnam textile agreement11 formal negotiations on textile deal began in early 2003 and intensified over the following weeks in april vietnamese negotiators traveled to washington dc and held nearly three weeks of talks with their american counterparts that culminated in the completion of an agreement on april 25 2003 the deal was reached after the us side threatened to unilaterally impose more restrictive quotas if the vietnamese did not agree to an offer the us put forward on april 18 2003 several us negotiators reportedly believed that vietnam was deliberately stalling in the negotiations which apparently had reached an impasse to increase the base levels of imports that are used to calculate quotas to counter this us officials said that if vietnam did not accept their offer by april 24 the quota levels would be based 9 continued httpwwwwtoorg 10 interview with phan van khai far eastern economic review march 20 2003 11 the bush administration and the vietnamese government have yet to

not february 2003 because imports of vietnamese clothing spiked in late 2002 and early 2003 this would have left vietnam with much lower level of imports vietnams negotiators accepted the us ultimatum on april 22 quota levels the final agreement places quotas on 38 categories of clothing imports from vietnam based on vietnams exports for the year ending february 28 2003 the most important and controversial items are cotton trousers and cotton knit shirts for which vietnam received 2003 quotas of 84 million and 168 million units respectively the quotas will increase by 7 year except for the quotas of wool products which will increase by 2 per year the textile agreement allows vietnam to adjust its annual quotas by carrying over applying unused quotas from the previous year by 11 by carrying forward borrowing portion of the following years quota by 6 for cotton trousers and cotton knit shirts and blouses the carryforward provision is 8 annually also vietnam may make adjustments by taking up to 6 of one items quota and giving it to another item in the same calendar year enforcement the agreement provides for both sides to cooperate on enforcement including informationsharing and facilitating plant visits vietnam agreed to withhold visas from vietnamese enterprises that do not cooperate with us customs authorities circumventiontransshipment during the final round of talks the us customs service produced finding that textile shipment labeled as vietnamese had actually been manufactured in china if further investigation reveals this finding to be accurate it would mean that the base level of imports from vietnam which was used to set the quotas was inflated in response the negotiators agreed to clause pledging to discuss adjusting the quotas if customs initial finding is borne out the agreement pledges both signatories to investigate and punish circumvention if the united states has clear evidence of transshipment and is not satisfied with vietnams enforcement it may reduce vietnams relevant quota by an amount up to the quantity that allegedly is transshipped if the united states presents clear evidence of multiple cases of circumvention over twelvemonth period it may could triple charge vietnam by subtracting three times the amount allegedly transshipped from vietnams relevant quota us access to vietnamese market in the bilateral textile

detailed and comprehensive than the labor provisions included in the uscambodia textile agreement or the usjordan free trade agreement which several members of congress had suggested as models for usvietnam agreement duration of the agreement the bilateral textile agreement runs from may 1 2003 to december 31 2004 but it will automatically roll over for one year unless the two sides terminate or renegotiate it by december 1 similarly in subsequent years the agreement will roll over for one year unless it is terminated or renegotiated the agreement will expire if and when vietnam enters the world trade organization wto see the following section for discussion of vietnams application for wto membership usvietnam trade in textiles and apparel12 the us textile and apparel industries and markets employment in the us textile and garment industries has fallen markedly over the past two decades in 2000 the us textile and apparel industry employed 12 million people 65 of total us employment in manufacturing this marked 35 and 50 decline in employment in the textile and apparel industries respectively since 1980 this decrease in employment can largely be attributed to both productivity gains and increased imports of textile and apparel products over the same twentyyear period us production of textiles rose while apparel production fell slightly13 12 this section was prepared by amanda douglas 13 crs report rs20436 textile and apparel trade issues by bernard gelb crs8 the united states is currently the worlds largest import market for textile and apparel products14 in 2002 the united states imported over 78 billion in apparel and textiles of which 62 billion was apparel during the same period the united states exported 16 billion worth of apparel and textiles worldwide with 6 billion in apparel and 10 billion in nonapparel textiles15 vietnams textile and apparel industry16 vietnams textile and apparel industries are important sources of economic growth and employment for the country they produce about 15 of vietnams exports and employ 16 million workers approximately 25 of all industrial workers in the country the sectors comprise over 1000 enterprises 190 stateowned 800 private and approximately 180 foreigninvested companies that include international joint ventures with domestic firms individual tailors and small enterprises currently serve much of the domestic garment market therefore most medium and large apparel enterprises focus on export production the industry is dominated by vinatex conglomerate of 60 stateowned enterprises that accounts for over one third of all textile and garment exports the vietnamese government and textile industry have taken several measures to expand both production and us sales the government is granting an export subsidy of 7 to textile companies that export to the united states17 vinatex opened representative office in new york sent several producers to the world source exhibition and is building four specialized industrial parks18 in addition the government plans to invest 100 million in the domestic cotton industry with the goal of expanding production to meet 60 of domestic demand by 2010 currently vietnams domestic producers can only supply 10 of the cotton and 20 of the fabrics used in garment production19 the present level of vietnamese cotton production may benefit the united states since raw cotton is one of the its leading export items to vietnam 14 bbc monitoring international reports vietnams textile firms improve conditions for workers march 1 2002 15 data from

2002 crs9 controversy over the textile agreement the terms of the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement has been criticized by both those who in the past had favored and those who opposed beginning negotiations on an agreement proponents of negotiating an agreement argue that the final deal was overly generous to vietnam and will lead to further job losses by us clothing and textile workers opponents of negotiating an agreement contend that the final deal was too restrictive to vietnam and to us consumers prior to the signing of the agreement members of the us apparel manufacturing industry called for usvietnam textile agreement to protect domestic producers against potential surge of vietnamese exports with the view that vietnam with its low labor costs mostfavorednation status and unrestrained access to the us market is threat to domestic production they contended that the lack of textile agreement could lead to increased job losses and factory closings in an industry already hard hit by the worldwide recession and trade benefits extended to other countries20 domestic pressure for textile agreement was further heightened by us quota concessions granted to pakistan in february 2002 estimated at nearly 500 million over three years to help repay pakistan for its help in the war against terrorism at the time sources in the textile industry asserted that such concessions would have substantial impact on the us textile industry and could cost as many as 2500 jobs21 in order to offset this negative impact on domestic industry it has been suggested that quota space from another country be shifted to pakistan prior to the opening of negotiations with vietnam some sources hinted that vietnam was the most likely candidate to lose potential quota22 once the agreement was finalized however several textile lobbying groups condemned it on the day the agreement was signed for instance the american textile manufacturers institute atmi issued statement labeling the quotas given vietnam as enormous calling special attention to the largest quotas in history that were granted for woven trousers and cotton knit shirts domestic industrys most sensitive products the institute also published fact sheet alleging that us negotiators made large increases to vietnam between the time the formal negotiations began in february 2003 and the final agreement was signed finally the atmi criticized the bush administration for backtracking on pledges previously given to the domestic industry to push for reciprocal access for us textile and apparel goods in future trade agreements23 such promise was critical in convincing some 20 inside us trade ustr officials visit vietnam to begin talks on textile accord february 22 2002 21 inside us trade white house grants pakistan quota concessions worth half billion february 15 2002 22 inside us trade february 15 2002 paul wiseman and james cox competing interests tangle textile policy usa today april 2 2002 23 atmi condemns new vietnam bilateral agreement us government breaks continued crs10 lawmakers representing textileproducing districts to support presidents bush request for trade promotion authority also known as fast track authority in december 200124 those opposed to negotiating textile agreement with vietnam argued that by restricting trade any textile agreement would hurt american consumers us industries and the textile industry itself limiting the amount of apparel goods available to us consumers in theory would restrict choice and raise the cost to consumers of those goods which in turn would reduce us consumer spending on goods from other industries textile agreement opponents maintained that us job losses would weaken us consumers purchasing power also it would limit vietnamese export earnings thereby reducing vietnams ability to buy us goods they asserted that textile quotas in reducing the us industrys competition from abroad would discourage the industry from modernizing and improving productivity leaving the industry more vulnerable to international competition after textile quotas expire under the atc in 2005 they also contended that freer trade with vietnam may also contribute to greater voice for the private sector in the economic and political affairs of that country some opponents of vietnam textile agreement have asked whether vietnam can truly be considered threat they have asserted that imports of vietnamese textile and clothing products accounted for less than 15 of the 78 billion in textile and apparel that the us imported in 2002 moreover in order for vietnams production to be true threat to us domestic producers it has to be shown that vietnams increased market share would come out of the market share of us producers opponents contended that the more likely scenario is that increased imports from vietnam displaces the market share of china or other developing country producers25 opponents of textile agreement also have argued that the imposition of quotas could discourage potential investment in vietnams textile industry if vietnam is subject to us quotas and is not wto member by 2005 the country would be at significant disadvantage against wto competitors who will enjoy quotafree trade in textiles and apparel opponents have noted that potential investors eyeing post bta vietnam may choose not to risk being stranded in an industry that cannot compete well in the world market after 2005 another argument made against setting quotas on vietnam was that us producers of raw cotton one of the united states leading export items to the vietnam would benefit from expansion of vietnams garment sector since the bta was signed us cotton exports to vietnam increased 23 continued promises to industry and

kilograms in 2001 to record 131000 kg in 2002 exports in the first quarter of 2003 exploded to over 118 million kg nearly 100 times the volume exported in all of 200226 labor rights accompanying initial discussion of possible us textile agreement with vietnam has been the question of whether such an agreement should have labor provision possibly modeled after the uscambodia textile agreement or the us jordan free trade agreement this section will provide brief background on the debate over labor provisions and explore some preliminary issues relative to vietnam background on labor provisions in trade agreements linking the promotion of labor standards to international trade policy is highly controversial issue both in the united states and internationally27 within the broader debate about the effects of trade on labor standards and the impact of varying labor standards on trade competitiveness is the question of whether trade agreements should include legallyenforceable standards to protect worker rights labor rights proponents argue that the wtos traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips which protects owner rights for seven types of intellectual property sets precedent for including legallybinding standards that protect the rights of resource holders in trade agreements some also ask whether it is morally acceptable for the united states to import items made under labor conditions that would be illegal if the production occurred in the united states proponents believe that critical advantage of including labor rights provision in the body of trade agreement is that it allows for the use of the agreements dispute settlement process to ensure that labor standards are enforced on the other hand many argue that trade and labor issues should not be linked some economists point out that labor provisions inhibit free trade thereby raising the prices and reducing the selection of imported goods other critics of the tradelabor linkage assert that requiring poor countries to meet industrial nations standards simply serves to protect developed country industries from developing country competition and in doing so limits the developing countrys potential economic growth through trade opponents of labor provisions maintain that in the end by 26 trade dataweb us international trade commission the hts codes 5201001090 5201009000 and 5201001025 were used to generate this data 27 the labor standards outlined in the ilos 1998 declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work are widely accepted as the international core labor standards freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively elimination of forced labor abolition of child labor and the elimination of discrimination in employment the us trade act of 1974 as amended by pl 98573 contains the first three standards in its definition of worker rights however rather than nondiscrimination in employment its final standard is acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages hours of work and occupational safety and health crs12 restricting trade and imposing higher standards provisions that are ostensibly designed to help workers may actually cause factories to close and workers in developing countries who have few safety net resources and work alternatives to lose their jobs28 the wto faced with strong debate on this issue in the 1996 singapore ministerial declared that the international labor organization ilo was the appropriate organization for labor matters and refused to link these issues to its trade policies29 two us trade agreements that are considered possible models for linking trade and labor issues are the cambodiaus textile agreement and the jordan free trade agreement the cambodia model introduced an innovative incentivebased labor provision that ties cambodias improvements in labor standards to increased access to the us market under the agreement cambodia is entitled to receive annual onetime bonus increases in its quotas if us interagency panel determines that working conditions in the textile and apparel sector substantially comply with internationally recognized worker rights and cambodian labor law30 the bonuses which take effect for one year only are in addition to the 6 increase that typically is automatically granted to textile import quotas in the 1999 agreement the amount of the potential quota bonus was up to 14 and cambodia received bonuses of 9 in 2000 2001 and 200231 after the awarding of each bonus the cambodian government american textile importers and some labor rights organizations criticized the united states for not awarding the full 14 increase in december 2001 the uscambodia textile agreement was amended and extended for another threeyear period with the potential quota bonus raised to 1832 in order to gather information on conditions in the garment sector the united states cambodia and the garment manufacturers association in cambodia funded the establishment of an independent monitoring system operated by the ilo the ilo program began 28 for more information see crs report rs20909 trade agreements procon

agreement to include labor provisions directly in the body of the agreement where they would be subject to dispute resolution procedures the labor provisions require each country to enforce its own labor laws and authorize sanctions for nonenforcement however controversy over the use of sanctions to enforce labor standards led to last minute exchange of letters between jordan and the us agreeing to make every effort to resolve the disputes without recourse to the formal dispute resolution procedures34 some members of congress have called on the administration to include the jordan standard in the areas of trade and labor in future trade agreements35 possible approaches concerning vietnam labor provision new labor provisions this essentially is the option adopted in the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement which calls for vietnam to reaffirm its existing commitments to and cooperation with international and us labor agencies the agreement also commits the two countries labor ministries to meet to review progress toward the goal of improving working conditions in vietnams textile sector prior to the signing of the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement many argued that there was need for labor provision in any textile agreement including one between the us and vietnam in addition to the arguments mentioned above regarding the potential negative effects on workers and consumers opponents of labor provision contended that the bta in itself will improve labor rights by promoting economic development foreign investment and the rule of law in vietnam36 other critics of labor provision pointed out that vietnam is already working with the united states to improve its labor situation under memorandum of understanding mou signed during former president clintons visit to vietnam in november 2000 the vietnamese ministry of labor invalids and social affairs molisa and the us department of labor usdol agreed to program of technical cooperation in six areas employment

contend that through its labor cooperation with the us prior to the bta its numerous labor programs with the ilo and other foreign governments and its recent revision of the labor code vietnam has already demonstrated its commitment to improving labor standards these critics concluded that labor provision was not only unnecessary but that it could potentially distort the current efforts to improve worker rights in vietnam as discussed above however labor rights supporters viewed labor provision both as leverage to level the competitive playing field and as insurance against the use of unfair or substandard labor practices to bolster exports mou plus another approach that was discussed prior to signing the agreement was supplementing the current usvietnam labor cooperation program with an initiative tailored to the purpose of the labor provision for example if the goal of the labor provision were to improve conditions in the garment sector efforts could have been targeted at building the capacity of the vietnamese labor inspectorate to identify and enforce violations in that sector this could also have entailed focusing attention on the garment industry through cooperation with the ilo such an approach would likely have been supported by those who argue that the improvements in cambodias garment sector are the result of the international attention focused on the industry rather than the specific incentives of the us cambodia textile agreement jordan standard some supporters of labor provision have argued that at minimum any textile agreement should have language similar to that in the us jordan free trade agreement that requires vietnam to enforce its labor laws which have been substantially reformed over the past decade step beyond that might have included dispute resolution procedures that would have provided mechanism for the us to legally enforce the labor provision this would have given the united states economic recourse in the event that vietnam lowered its labor standards us opponents of dispute resolution mechanisms that include labor standards in general argue that it opens the door to the imposition of trade sanctions for alleged violations or lack of enforcement of countrys own labor laws based on vietnams reaction to us comments on its human rights situation vietnam would likely have viewed this approach as an unwarranted interference in its internal affairs cambodia model some suggested that vietnam textile agreement include trade incentive provision modeled after the cambodia textile agreement advocates of this provision pointed to numerous improvements in cambodias labor system as evidence of the models effectiveness for example since the agreement began in 1999 cambodia has established tripartite labor advisory committee ratified 7 of the 8 ilo core conventions and established new regulations on union representation for collective bargaining in addition the minimum wage in the garment sector has been raised and the number of registered unions has risen from crs15 20 in 1997 to 245 by january 2002 approximately 218 of those unions are in the garment sector37 the cambodia ilo monitoring system itself has also been praised for contributing to increased communication trust and understanding of cambodian labor laws among unions employers and the government through project advisory committee the monitoring program has provided forum for the tripartite social partners to discuss labor issues related to the project that committee also serves as an effective monitor of the monitoring program itself since all three social partner groups review and in some cases approve activities under the project through factory visits and meetings with workers the monitoring program has also increased awareness among factory management and employees about cambodian labor laws other supporters of the cambodian model viewed it not only as way to encourage governments to take action to improve labor conditions but more importantly as mechanism to empower workers because enterprises have to demonstrate good working conditions in order to receive quota bonuses under the agreement it is in their interest to keep workers satisfied in order to minimize the incidence of complaints and disputes this provides workers with an environment in which their issues are more likely to be addressed to their satisfaction and without reprisal from management supporters of the cambodia model emphasized that as labor conditions improved through the incentive system so did the economic benefits to cambodia since the start of 1999 cambodia has increased its garment and textile exports to the us by roughly 500600 million the number of garment factories has increased and approximately 100000 jobs have been created in the sector38 some contend that the ilos neutral review of labor conditions makes cambodias garment sector more attractive for buyers and retailers who are concerned about social responsibility they also assert that by contributing to improved labor relations the cambodia model has enhanced political stability another critical factor in economic growth thus according to some the cambodia model proves that linking trade and labor can bring about the winwin results of economic growth and improved working conditions in january 2002 us trade representative robert zoellick called the cambodia agreement an excellent example of the way trade agreements lead to economic growth and promote greater respect for workers rights39 on the other hand the cambodia agreement has been criticized for several reasons some critics argue that focusing international attention and inspection resources on the garment sector distorts the equal protection of workers in other sectors although garment sector workers account for 50 of the industrial work 37 labor trends report 2002 us embassy in cambodia april 2002 available at httpusembassystategovcambodia 38 labor trends report

press release january 7 2002 crs16 force in cambodia they represent only 3 of the national work force40 some question whether the united states should be promoting increased rights for workers in favored sectors only and why the united states only examines conditions in one sector to determine whether cambodia complies with international labor standards these critics also point out that despite the increased international attention and cambodias efforts there continue to be reports of child labor forced overtime and antiunion discrimination in the garment sector other critics have called into question the effectiveness of the cambodia incentive provision citing the fact that most of cambodias apparel exports to the united states are not under quota according to privatesector source cambodias unrestricted trade to the united states as of october 31 2001 was almost two and half times the volume of the trade under quota41 some observers suggest that leaving most textile and apparel trade unrestrained is greater benefit to cambodia than the bonus quota offered through the labor provision of the factories that do produce quota goods there is the question of whether those in compliance with labor laws actually receive the bonus quota or more of the bonus quota than noncomplying factories42 if cambodian garment factories do not need additional quota nor expect to receive it the bonus quota may have little impact on factory management behavior some contend that it is the international attention focused on its main industry rather than the quotas that prompted the reported improvements in cambodias labor situation another criticism of the incentive provision is that it acts in effect like reverse sanction under regular quota the exporting country is entitled to ship set amount of goods to the united states if the united states believes labor laws in that country are not being enforced then the united states must prove it in order to take that countrys quota away under the incentive approach the presumption is that the exporting country has poor labor standards in order to receive its bonus quota the country must prove that presumption wrong if in the end it receives less than the full amount of bonus quota as the case has been with cambodia it has little recourse some opponents of the cambodia agreement assert that it suffers from lack of transparent criteria used to measure cambodias substantial compliance43 while the ilo monitoring program bases its factory inspections on comprehensive checklist of criteria the program is still gathering baseline data on most factories and has yet to release followup report that will show whether conditions have improved or worsened since 1999 however the us has awarded bonus quota to cambodia 3 times for improvements in complying with core labor standards some critics question how those determinations were made since the ilo program did not 40 labor trends report 2002 us embassy

textile agreement is not available to the public on the flipside these critics ask whether monitoring program is necessary at all if the data used to make the substantial compliance determination is available from other sources another view holds that the cambodia model whether effective in cambodia or not would not have been applicable to the vietnam context during testimony before the house ways and means committee on february 26 2003 us trade representative robert zoellick explained that the cambodia model would not be applied to vietnam because its economy is much more diverse than cambodias which is dominated by the textile and apparel industry therefore ambassador zoellick said providing incentives for improvements in the textile industrys working conditions would only meet portion of the united states broad labor interests in vietnam44 some argue that it would be difficult for vietnam to comply with the labor standards criteria and difficult for the united states to find vietnam in substantial compliance the key question is how to deal with the issue of freedom of association one of the internationallyrecognized core labor standards although vietnam as an ilo member state is obligated to promote freedom of association workers in vietnam are reportedly not accorded that right by the government according to the state department in vietnam workers are not free to join or form unions of their choosing trade unions are controlled by the party and have only nominal independence individual unions legally are not free to affiliate with join or participate in international labor bodies45 the argument can be made that by restricting freedom of association in this way vietnam does not comply with international core labor standards therefore some observers believe that vietnam would be ineligible for any bonus quota under an incentive provision critics of applying the cambodiastyle incentive provision to vietnam speculated that the only way vietnam could receive bonus quota would be if the united states focusing on the term substantial chose to reward vietnams compliance with other labor standards alternatively the united states could have examined other perhaps more factorylevel indicators of freedom of association such as whether workers are free to join or not join unions or whether factory unions have the ability to represent workers and negotiate on behalf of workers given that the united states has been strong supporter of labor standards and as an ilo member state is obligated to respect all of the core standards such an approach may have been inconsistent with avowed us policies on labor standards additionally some questioned whether textile agreement would press vietnam to lift its restrictions on freedom of association since this would have required the communist party to relinquish significant control the achievement of complete freedom of association over the next few years generally is thought to be highly 44 february 26 2003 ways means trade subcommittee hearing on the presidents trade agenda 45 us department of state country reports on human rights practices vietnam 2001 crs18 unlikely however strong labor incentive could perhaps influence vietnam to allow greater freedom for the hundreds of unofficial labor associations that exist in vietnam in terms of applying cambodialike monitoring program to vietnam some argued that the logistics would be much more complicated and costly in cambodia the garment sector is limited to an estimated 220 factories located mostly in and around phnom penh that employ 200000 workers46 in vietnam there are over 1000 textile and apparel enterprises located across the country with 16 million employees even if monitoring program were focused solely on garment factories since clothing rather than textiles dominates the sectors exports to the united states this would still have required substantial financial and manpower resources if the cambodia programs monitoring and reporting schedule had been applied to vietnam with rate of inspection of approximately 100 factories per year it would have taken several years for sizeable sample of vietnamese factories to be evaluated the bureaucracy of conducting surprise inspections critics contend may also have been cumbersome because factories are located across numerous provinces and special investment zones approval for random inspections would have been needed from the national government provincial governments exportprocessing and industrial zone authorities national and local unions national and local industry associations and the factories themselves in addition to maintaining geographic balance among participating factories balance would have to have been sought in ensuring that stateowned domestic private and foreigninvested enterprises are treated equally inspection of the stateowned enterprises in particular may have been politically sensitive issue especially if the monitoring process finds violations moreover unlike cambodia where the independent tripartite social partners the employer association unions and government ensure the neutrality of the monitoring program by voicing their different interests vietnams social partners are all linked in varying degrees to the communist party this implies some argue that the interests of the government the entity most closely connected to the party will dominate any type of monitoring program 46 labor trends report 2002 us embassy in cambodia synthesis reports from the ilo garment sector
