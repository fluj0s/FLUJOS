public order in diverse range of communities in the united states today congress has long recognized that this problem affects number of issues of federal concern and federal legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress to address some aspects of the issue youth gangs have been an endemic feature of amer ican urban life they are well attested as early as the 18th century and have been recurrent subject of concern since then contemporary views of the problem have been formed against the background of significant adverse secular trend in gang activity during the last four decades in particular the rapid growth of gang membership geographical dispersion and criminal involvement during the violent crime epidemicassociated with the emergence of the crack cocaine market during the mid1980s to the early 1990shave intensified current concerns the experience of those years continues to mark both patterns of gang activity and public policy responses toward them reports about the increased activity and recent migration of violent californiabased gang the mara salvatrucha ms13 have heightened concerns about gangs in certain areas of the country policy development and implementation in this area are bedeviled by discrepant uses of the term gang and the absence of uniform standards of statistical reporting there are reasons for special care in the use of data on gangs and their activity without standardized definition of what is meant by gang such as the age group or activities engaged in by its members or standardized reporting among the state local tribal and federal levels of government it is difficult to target antigang initiatives and evaluate their effectiven ess according to national gang survey the most recent estimate indicates that there were about 760000 gang members in 24000 gangs in the united states in 2004 in the 110 th congress several bills have been introduced that would address various aspects of the gang problem some of the bills would address the problem through comprehensive gang prevention initiatives such as hr 3846 other bills address the gang problem through combinations of criminal penalty enhancements targeted prosecutorial efforts and antigang task forces and gang prevention provisions these antigang proposals include hr 880 hr 1582 hr 3547 hr 3922 s 456 s 990 and s 2237 this report provides background

high point in the mid1980s and early 1990s as the violent crime rate reached unprecedented numbers although concerns about gangs and gangrelated violence during these years were essentially isolated to innercity urban areas today the concern has shifted to include violent gang activities that have more recently proliferated into rural and suburban areas growing concerns about the number and geographic migration of certain violent latino gangs into new areas both rural and suburban brought the issue before congress in addition concerns about the potential threat gangs pose to domestic security along with longstanding concerns about the prevalence of gangs in urban areas and the proliferation of gangs in rural areas continue to fuel congressional interest for the most part gangs and gang crime have been state and local law enforcement issue until recently the federal role in stemming illegal gang activity was largely limited to grant programs to state and local law enforcement and communitybased agencies as gangs became more sophisticated and expanded the types of illegal activities they engaged in ie money laundering drug enterprise etc congress and the administration began to take note although federal laws already existed for prosecuting the types of crimes committed by gang members at the federal level congress began to specifically address the gang problem and gangrelated violence linked to the crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s through the antidrug abuse acts of 1986 and 1988 pl 99570 and pl 100690 2 further congressional action on gangs did not occur until 1994 when congress passed legislation designed to address the gang problem through more comprehensive approaches3 this report provides background information on the issue of youth gangs including data on gangs and gang crime it reviews existing antigang initiatives at the federal state and local levels and describes proposed federal legislation designed to address the problem as well as some of the issues raised by these proposals the report then briefly discusses policy options for dealing with the gang problem g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 gang activity in the united states has been traced back to the late 18th century in the years following the end of the american revolution4 the earliest identifiable gangs were recorded 1 the terms youth gang street gang and gang are often used interchangeably in much of the literature on youth gangs and generally these terms are used to refer to individuals ranging in age between 12 and 25 years in contrast the term juvenile generally refers to individuals who are under 18 years of age when the term youth gang is used as it is in most of the literature on gangs it is possible for some to assume incorrectly that gang member is typically juvenile although gang memberships also include adults see irving spergel and g david curry strategies and perceived agency effectiveness in dealing with the youth gang problem gangs in america 1990 p 289 2 both acts provided mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers who were found to be in possession of certain types of illicit drugs the illicit drug trade is often associated with more highly organized criminal gangs 3 see the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 4 luc sante low life lures and snares of old new york 1991 pp

were black historically most gangs have been locally based groups that often took names that indicated the neighborhoods where they lived and carried on their activities for example continued

york city in 17835 it has been estimated that in 1855 new york city alone had more than 30000 gang members6 the emergence of youth gangs in the us is thought by some to be connected to immigration patterns forming as collective response to urban conditions in many of the large cities populated by recent immigrants as they struggled to make economic social and cultural adjustments one of the earliest researchers on youth gangs frederic m thrasher wrote in 1927 that the gangs he studied in chicago may have emerged from play groups in immigrant neighborhoods 7 early in american history gangs were made up of specific ethnic groups such as irish italian jewish slavic and other ethnic groups who immigr ated to the united states and were drawn to the first large cities of new york boston and philadelphia most gang researchers agree that waves of immigration played major role in the formation and spread of gangs in the united states for many immigrant groups gangs have historically provided way of developing economic or social advantages in strange country in more recent history the past 35 years have brought waves of immigrant groups of asians cambodians filipinos koreans samoans thais and others and latin americans colombians cubans dominicans ecuadorians mexicans panamanians puerto ricans and many others into urban areas across the country where many of the same language and cultural barriers have led to the formation of gangs among these groups 8 most of the research on youth gangs has traditionally been based on sociological ethnographic and psychological methods using the methodological constructs of these disciplines the majority of the research focuses on how the socioeconomic and environmental factors work to foster youth gangs poverty poor educational opportunities joblessness and unstable family structures are among the social structures identified that can influence atrisk youth to join and to remain in gangs gangs are found in urban and suburban neighborhoods or rural areas where disaffected youths or migrant populations face poverty poor schools and joblessness researchers have also identified many factors that contribute to heighten juveniles risk of joining gang including familial and individual problems such as juveniles growing up with little or parental involvement parents single parents or both parents working or juveniles with behavioral problems see table 1 according to gang researchers such atrisk juveniles would be more likely to look to gangs to find acceptance stability companionship and sense of identity particularly when their communities or the larger society is not perceived to provide opportunities for integration and acceptance continued the fly boys were from the area around fly

alienation from many of societys institutions gangs provide affiliation with others who have certain characteristic s in common to one another but who may be considered as outsiders in the larger society often providing income to those with few prospects of finding job or making living gang membership has not always been associated with serious criminal activity although research indicates that joining gang does increase an individuals risk of involvement in crime gangs often fight other rival gangs over turf issues and often are involved in petty crimes and misdemeanors more highly organized gangs are often involved in more serious crimes such as drug trafficking violence and illegal possession of firearms

and the types of individuals included in gangs does gang consist of members of certain ages are gangs always involved in crime do gangs vary in composition and organization from community to community or do they all have some common elements in their organization activities and cultures despite decades and mountains of research there is still not common definition of gang that is accepted by police schools academics and communities across the nation generally there is agreement that gangs usually have name and some sense of identity that can sometimes be indicated by symbols such as clothing graffiti and hand signs that are unique to the gang typically gangs tend to have some degree of permanence and organization and are generally to some degree involved in delinquent or criminal activity the criminal activities of gangs can range widely from graffiti vandalism petty theft robbery and assaults to more serious criminal activities such as drug trafficking drug smuggling money laundering

invasion murder and other violent felonies some of the characteristics that are used to identify gang membership often in combination with self identification are symbols or symbolic behavior the association with known gang members participation in certain criminal behavior the individuals location or residence identification by police informant or direct observation of certain symbols or symbolic behavior by law enforcement officers9 gang definitions vary widely and have changed over time early in the twentieth century gangs could be seen by some as benign groups of friends from the same neighborhood providing social support and sense of community sometimes bound by kinship and not established to commit delinquent acts gang members could be perceived as providing protective function for their communities by attacking or driving out unwanted interlopers however today gangs are most often seen as juvenile delinquents and criminals who are more likely to be threat to communities and public order frequently as drug traffickers and violent criminals although this may not be true of all gang members it is certainly clear that popular images in the media often portray gang members as criminals and they are widely perceived as such by many the department of justice doj office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ojjdp relying on several definitions offered by leading theorists and researchers defines youth gang as group that is involved in pattern of criminal acts typically composed only of juveniles but may include young adults in their membership

criminal justice reference service ncjrs while acknowledging that gangs are defined in many ways provides common definition of gang as group of three or more individuals who engage in criminal activity and identify themselves with common name or sign gangs are also defined in current federal law the us criminal code defines criminal street gang as an ongoing group club organization or association of 5 or more personsa that has as 1 of its primary purposes the commission of 1 or more of the criminal offenses described in subsection c b the members of which engage or have engaged within the past 5 years in continuing series of offenses described in subsection c and c the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce 10 the criminal offenses ascribed to criminal street gang in subsection c include certain federal felonies that involve controlled substance with maximum penalty of five or more years of imprisonment federal felony that involves violence or

relied on most by researchers has been selfidentification by gang members themselves law enforcement officers too most often rely on suspects willingness to selfidentify or claim gang membership for police identification and reporting purposes for policy makers how the term gang is defined and who is gang member are important concepts for gauging the extent and nature of the problem as well as for developing appropriate policy and program responses the continued absence of standard definition limits the utility of data collection for research purposes and for criminal reporting it also limits the ability to quantify and understand the extent of the gang problem and complicates any national public policy response

an overview of the late st blendedyear analysis from the nygc of the 20022003 surveys which elicited responses to slightly different questions than are included in the standard annual survey these two surveys provide the only national estimates of how widespread the gang problem is and the extent of gang involvement in certain types of criminal victimization

gang mem bers or jurisdictions described sepa rately below recent detailed reanalysis of the nygc survey data from 1996 to 2001 provides some clues as to what may underlie these disparate survey responses and declining respondent numbers according to nygc reanalysis respondents from all the largest cities populations greater than 250000 and the vast majority of large cities populations greater than 1000000 reported gang problems in all survey years law enforcement agencies in small cities populations above 2500 and below 50000 reported 16 fewer gang problems over the 19962001 survey period in addition rural and suburban counties reported significantly fewer gang problems over the same period in the first two survey years nearly 60 of suburban counties reported gang problems however the number of respondents declined steadily and by the 2001 survey suburban county respondents had dropped to just over onethird similarly onefourth of rural counties reported gang problems in the first two survey years however the response rate of these jurisdictions also declined so that by 2001 the response rate of rural counties was just over 1 in 10 18 there are many possible explanations for the decline in survey responses among small town and rural jurisdictions that could affect the gang estimates one possible explanation could be that gang activity varies and may be more entrenched and constant in some areas whereas in other areas particularly in areas of low population density gang activity could be more episodic fluctuating problem in other areas gangs could be relatively new problem that perhaps has not yet firmly established itself in community or area as result the reported experience of gang 18 finnaage esbensen stephen g tibbetts and larry gaines

nygc survey for larger cities remained fairly constant over the survey period in smaller cities and rural and suburban counties the decline in reported gang problems could reflect the variability of gang problems in these jurisdictions while simultaneously and disproportionately driving down the number of jurisdictions responding to the nygc survey another explanation might be connected to the fact that responding to the survey is voluntary and not linked to any programmatic requirement or receipt of federal funding which could help explain why law enforcement agencies particularly in lowpopulation jurisdictions with limited staff might not consider completion of the nygc rvey to be the most important expenditure of staff time finally the decline in survey respondents and gangs or gang membership might not reflect the experiences of all jurisdictions for reasons related to methodological issues inherent in surveys and population sampling including sample size and weighting of responses which are beyond the scope of this report although the nygc survey may indicate that the reported youth gang problem could be receding in some areas respondents to the survey reported that gangrelated violence has been increasing in larger cities and some rural areas the 2004 nygc survey indicated that among larger cities population of 100000 or more 173 cities reported both gang problem and gang homicide data in 2004 homicides involving gang member of the 171 larger cities approximately onefourth of all homicides were considered gang related in the two remaining large cities chicago and angeles more than half of all homicides were considered gang related the combined gang related homicides in chicago and angeles accounted for nearly half of the total number of homicides nearly 1000 homicides reported in the nygc 2004 survey 19 in addition to the survey responses on gang homicides the nygc survey reports responses regarding the respondents perception of whether the gang problem in their jurisdiction was improving or worsening of respondents to the 2004 nygc survey 52 of law enforcement officers indicated that they thought their yout h gang problem was getting worse while 48 reported that there was decrease or significant change in their gang problem according to the nygc survey since 2001 law enforcement officers have been reporting that the gang problem in their area is worsening 27 in 2001 rising to 42 in 2002 and to 52 in 2004 see figure 2 g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g344g556g344g342g342g345g561g16g27g9g5g561g21g158g155g159g142g162g561 in june 2005

according to the nygc survey the increasing number of gang members continues to be serious policy issue this trend indicates that there is still much to do at the federal level in the fight against the youth gang problem moreover the migration of gangs into suburban and rural areas beyond their traditional base of operation in the urban innercities has also raised concerns about the possible spread of gang violence in areas of the country that have not been the types of communities usually besieged by gang activities and violence

the concern about the youth gang problem stems from the attendant violence associated with gangs and gang crime research indicates that the longer gang member remains in gang the higher the risk they will become involved in crime generally and of particular concern in violent crime crs analysis of data from th fbis supplementary homicide reports shr provided below offers some insight into the commonly held view that gangs and youth gangs particularly older juveniles are more likely to be involved in violent crime similar analysis by the justice policy institute of gangrelated violent crime as reported in the fbis shr from 1994 to 2003 concluded that over that period gangrelated violent crime declined by 73 24 some critics have claimed that the fbi data on gangland and juvenile gang homicides may inadvertently give the impression that these homicides are primarily committed by juvenile offenders yet juveniles are responsible for smaller proportion of all homicides included in this crime category than are young adults and adults who are included in the counts of these gang related killings 25 the shr count of gangrelated homicides includes offenders of all ages according to the fbi data large majority of of fenders of known age in gangland and juvenile gang killings are not juveniles26 the 2003 shr includes records for 1111 offenders in such killings age data were reported for 528 n587 of the 1111 among offenders of known age only 189 n111 were under 18 years of age or juveniles see figure 3 because age data are reported for 472 n524 of offenders reportedly committing juvenile gang homicides the exact proportion of all 1111 offenders who are juveniles under 18 years of age is unknown however to hypothesize about the likelihood that those of unknown age are under or over 18 years of age upper and lower bounds for those of unknown age can be established to determine the percentage of all 1111 offenders who are juveniles if the age distribution of the offenders of unknown age were the same as that of offenders of known age then 189 n210 of all offenders reported in 2003 would be under 18 because that is the proportion of offenders of known age reported in the shr alternatively if all offenders of unknown age were under 18 then 572 of all offenders would be under 18 n 111 524 conversely if all offenders of unknown age were 18 or older n 476 524 then 100 of all offenders would be under 18 unless 85 or more of offenders of unknown age were under 18 n 22 us federal bureau of investigation uniform crime report 2004 23 crs report rl32824

the national alliance of gang investigators associations nagia including the fbi the na tional drug intelligence center ndic and the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosiv atf according to the report gangs were pervasive throughout society and more sophisticated and flagrant in their use of violence and intimidation tactics the report also found that when todays gangs migrate across the country they bring drugs weapons and criminal activity with them however the report was not backed by hard data or crime statistics and instead was based on survey of law enforcement agencies and anecdotal accounts and experiences law enforcement respondents to the 2005 assessments questionnaire identified number of trends across the country gangs were identified as the primary distributors of drugs throughout the us sometimes associating with organized crime entities such as mexican drug organizations and russian organized crime groups and engaged in lowlevel criminal activities such as protecting territories and facilitating drugtrafficking activities gang members were reportedly becoming more sophisticated in their use of computers and technologies for improved communications facilitating criminal activity and avoiding detection by law enforcement respondents identified the migration of califo rniastyle gang culture along with growing hispanic gang membership as particular threat as these gangs spread into new areas and promote the gang subculture although outside of the scope of this report the expansion of outlaw motorcycle gangs into new territories and the formation of new gangs were also identified as threat to communities as these types of gangs battled over territories with increasing continued gang members 19932003 ncj 208875 june 2005 29 ibid 30 information

typically chronic and perpetual but instead is episodic and not likely to persist as it is in larger urban areas where gang problems typically are chronic35 in part this is due to the fact that these areas do not have the population base from which gangs can recruit new members the small size of most rural or small town gangs makes them more vulnerable to disruptions such as arrest or mbers dropping out of the gang and although all gangs are characterized by movement among members in and out of the gang over the course of year this dynamic has more disruptive effect on the permanence of rural smalltown gang recent analysis of small town and rural county respondents to the nygcs annual gang survey of state and local law enforcement agencies looked at responses from agencies representing populations between 2500 and 25000 36 nygcs analysis revealed that few of these agencies 34 the nygc analysis of small town and rural gangs is based on responses to the annual survey described at the beginning of this report from which national estimates of ga ngs and gang activities are derived however this analysis is separate and special analysis based on data that are not reported in the annual summary of the nygc survey 35 james c howell and arlen egley jr gangs in small towns and rural counties nygc bulletin doj ojjdp 1 june 2005 p 1 36 nygcs analysis is based on

to the survey only 4 108 counties reported persistent gang problems similarly of the 36 small town respondents only 10 of small towns 36 small towns reported persistent gang problems37 the analysis of small town and rural county agencies found that agencies reporting persistent gang problems had higher proportion of adult aged gang members in addition jurisdictions reporting persistent gang problems were more likely to have also had gangrelated homicides in their jurisdiction than jurisdictions reporting variable gang problems thus the analysis found that the reporting of sudden gang problem in particular community might not always signal the beginning of protracted or persistent gang problem or one which wo uld be likely to develop into serious problem like that seen in some larger cities nygcs analysis identified population shifts and changing demographics in some small towns and rural areas as potential factors contributing to the emergence or escalation of gang problems as in larger cities language barriers and exclusion of newly immigrating youths were identified as factors which could contribute to the formation of groups that could coalesce into gang examples of such possible situations included the rapid growth of latinos in north carolina and salvadorans in northern virginia both situations which could potentially contribute to development of local gang problems for these areas however data were presented indicating that these areas were experiencing such gang problems and the analysis cautioned that the majority of youth gangs are homegrown with memberships composed of longtime residents in the particular area moreover the analysis concluded that the formation of gangs was more likely to be the result of failed social institutio ns even in small towns and rural communities 38 broader applicability of the nygc analysis to other similar areas across the country is however limited by the small sample size and small number of survey respondents among other factors which make it difficult to infer that the data are representative of all such jurisdictions across the nation

compared to 4 in rural private schools42 gangs remain serious concern for school safety and many advocate that particular attention should be given to signs of gang activity in schools gangrelated fights and assaults are of different nature and tend to escalate to other related and occasionally larger conflicts that can spill over into the neighborhood43 some have argued that schoolbased gangrelated activity is often not reported perhaps in part because of the negative attention that acknowledging gang problem may bring to the school parents and surrounding community44 schools play critical role in the socialization and development of children and this is especially the case for atrisk children from strained families45 according to researchers schools typically respond to gang problems by suppression methods that include getting rid of the problem by separating gang members from the other students some researchers have concluded that this type of tactic can further marginalize atrisk youth bond them more completely to gangs and reinforce their loyalty to gangs 46 these and other studies have led some researchers to conclude that more balanced use of prevention intervention and suppression strategies starting in elementary school could help to reduce gang violence in schools47

international connections between such central american gangs raise the possibility that illegal entrants could pay gangs to smuggle them into the united states and as such terrorists could also be illegally smuggled across the us border by gangs the decision of dhs to crack down on ms13 discussed above further indicates the significance of the transnational threat posed by gangs the involvement of gangs in smuggling weapons humans and drugs has long been established however following the 911 terrorist attacks there are heightened concerns that gang smuggling interests may be shared by terrorists groups interested in crossing the us border illegally and undetected concern about the convergence of these smuggling interests may have been the impetus behind the sharpened focus of dhs on transnational gangs and their illegal activities and particularly on latino gangs as threat to domestic security 53 despite the specter of transnational latino gangs undermining domestic security evidence has been found linking us gangs regardless of their members immigration status with the smuggling of terrorists into the country the 2005 national gang threat assessment concluded that despite their vigilance in looking for associations between gangs and international terrorist groups few investigators identified any associations and those who did described the connections in terms of speculation that was supported by little evidence54 furthermore ice recently reported that of the 1057 gang members and associates arrested since february 2005 as part of its recent crackdown on gang members crossing the southern us border none were found to have any terrorist ties 55

the crimes they committed were generally the responsibility of state and local law enforcement gangs pose significant threat to public safety and as gangs have spread across the country the interest in finding adequate solutions to the problem has included all levels of government in the mid to late1980s and early 1990s congress passed legislation federalizing certain gangrelated crimes and providing additional penalties for individuals convicted under these laws in addition the federal government has taken an active role in helping state and local jurisdictions develop antigang responses through support for research on gangs and through grant programs to help jurisdictions develop effective gang prevention and intervention strategies developing an effective response to gangs however is complicated by the range of gang criminal activities from juvenile delinquency to serious violent crimes by criminal organizations moreover gang activities vary from community to community making it difficult to establish national programs or provide uniform assistance strategies developed by the congress to address the gang problem have included 1 prevention aimed at preventing youths from joining gangs and engaging in gang behavior by educating children and teens about the dangers of joining 53 testimony of fbi assistant directorcriminal investigative division chris swecker in us

project dealing with drug use and delinquency among dropouts and gang members in new york city 56 in 1987 ojjdp in cooperation with the university of chicagos school of social service administration initiated major research and development program to address the gang problem the project the national youth gang suppression and intervention program was fourstage process that included an assessment of the gang problem the development of model program for preventing youth gangs review of the literature on gangs and national survey of youth gang problems and programs 57 the federal response to youth gangs in the late 1980s was inextricably linked to drug trafficking and violence associated with what is often referred to as the crack cocaine epidemic the anti drug abuse act of 1988 pl 100690 addresse d the gang problem by establishing grant programs within ojp58 and ojjdp designed to address number of gangrelated issues including the prevention and treatment related to juvenile gangs drug use and drug trafficking further congressional action specifically on gangs did not occur until 1994 when legislation was enacted that took more comprehensive approach to addressing crime and the youth gang problem the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 contained several antigangrelated initiatives including new or enhanced penalties for certain crimes that were often associated with gangs the act provided new or enhanced penalties for gangrelated crimes by 1 imposing an additional term of imprisonment of up to 10 years for involvement in serious federal drug offense or federal violent felony affecting interstate or foreign commerce 2 permitting the prosecution of youths 13 years of age and above if the juvenile possessed firearm during crime of violence and 3 tripling the penalty for employing children to distribute drugs near schools and playgrounds the law also authorized funding for new grant program the gang resistance education and training

the secretary of the treasury to develop national strategy to coordinate gangrelated investigations by federal law enforcement agencies in addition pl 103322 authorized the community oriented policing services cops program which was designed to put more police officers on the streets and make communities safer the cops program was generally designed to provide grants to state and local law enforcement agencies to fight crime at the local level through the strategy of having larger police presence in high crime areas thus cops by providing grants that could be used in preventing street crime was indirectly providing assistance for fighting gangs and gangrelated crime during the 107 th congress antigang provisions were included in the 21st century department of justice appropriations

community is unique so it is difficult to generalize and develop onesizefitsall strategy to address the issue over the last two decades there have been many antigang projects and initiatives that have been developed and implemented in communities across the country federal state and local governments have actively developed approaches designed to prevent or stop gang involvement in violence drug trafficking firearms offenses and other related activities of concern research and experimentation on what might effectively end the gang problem has been busy area of juvenile delinquency research currently mixture of approaches is being tried across the nation but most programs attempt to integrate some component of prevention intervention and suppression strategies even municipalities have

in january 1992 the fbi announced the ssvci an initiative designed to allow the special agent in charge of each fbi field division to establish longterm proactive task forces focused on reducing violent crime61 the task forces placed specific emphasis on the identification of major violent street gangs andor drug enterprises of national scope by applying the same methods used to successfully wage war on traditional organized crime according to fbi testimony before the senate judiciary committee one of the first gangs to be targeted by the gang task force was the ms13 gang moreover the work of the task force enabled the us attorney for the central district of california debra yang to successfully use statutes to prosecute the leaders of the 18 th street gang and the mexican mafia prison gang62 the need for intelligence sharing forced uniformity and facilitated the fbis development of an integrated information sharing system for tracking criminal gang activity through national system capable of sharing information by computers in real time according to the fbi the task force concept increases the effectiveness and productivity of limited personnel and logistical resources avoids duplication of investigations and expands the cooperation and communication among law enforcement agencies in response to the threat from gangs the fbi established the safe streets violent gang task forces ssvgtf to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement at all levels of government and use the same statutes intelligence and investigative techniques against violent gangs that are used to

higher levels of attachment to both mothers and fathers and less likelihood of acting impulsively from october 1994 through december 2001 the national institute of justice nij funded national evaluation of the g reat program 72 the evaluation had two purposes 1 to find out if the programs components were being executed as designed and 2 to observe the actual delivery of the program by law enforcement officers in the classrooms the evaluation included both crosssectional and longitudinal survey of middle school youths in selected locations the evaluation used control group of students and group of students that had participated in the g reat program the crosssectional survey obtained information from 5935 eighth graders in 315 classrooms at 42 different schools located within 11 diverse law enforcement jurisdictions across the country the crosssectional survey found that selfreported gang membership was significantly related to selfreported juvenile delinquency the survey also revealed higher than expected levels of female and white youth gang members 38 female 25 white73 the results of the crosssectional survey supported the effectiveness of the program these results were similar to previous evaluations of the program that had yielded modestly positive results74 in addition to evaluating the g reat program longitudinal study was conducted in six cities consisting of 3500 students in 22 classrooms in 22 schools75 one year after participating in the g reat program the differences between th students who had participated in the program and those who had not were small the longitudinal evaluation did not find significant differences in the groups of student participants until three or four years after program exposure76 overall the evaluation found that the

program has received funding of more than one million dollars since its inception in 2001 funds can be used to hire new federal state and local prosecutors provide training hire research and community outreach support and develop and promote effective prevention and deterrence efforts under the psn program each us attorney develops plan incorporating three national priorities 1 increased prosecution of violent organizations by aggressively using federal conspiracy racketeering narcotics and all other available laws to attack and punish violent drug traffickers violent street gangs and violent robbery rings 2 strict enforcement of all federal laws against illegal gun traffickers and their suppliers with an emphasis on those gun traffickers who supply illegal firearms to violent organizations and to juveniles and 3 aggressive enforcement of federal firearms laws against those persons prohibited from possessing firearms or who use firearms in furtherance of illegal activities including those persons denied under the brady act 78 the strategic plans are required to reflect the unique features and problems of the particular district but with the goal of reducing the levels

and cities have long been developing cal approaches to the gang problem some of the areas that these initiatives and programs fall under are prevention intervention and suppression of youth gang activity the following discussion is not intended to be comprehensive review of the numerous antigang programs that have been initiated and developed by state and local governments but mere sampling of initiatives that are considered models for programs that may be generally applicable and replicable in other communities80 prevention programs developed by states and localities include those designed to improve the living conditions of atrisk youth and provide them with opportunities to replace gang activities with safer and more beneficial activities and services examples of these types of programs include providing alternative recreation opportunities where atrisk or highrisk youth and others involved in the juvenile justice system can be in volved in safe alternatives to being out on the streets late at night prevention programs can also include early intervention programs for parents and infants or small children designed to provide parental training and childhood skills development including preschool for early social and cognitive development preventive programs can also include schoolbased programs to ensure inschool safety and control in school enrichment procedures with formal links to communitybased programs as well as 79 project safe neighborhoods executive summary and other information on the program is available at the psn website at httpwwwpsngov

employment counseling job placement assistance advocacy assistance with the police and courts and other social assistance such as health care and other services boys girls clubs across the country provide gang intervention programs that provide lifeskills development education and employment programs other programs are designed to provide alternatives to gang life through jobs in the community or through the enterprises developed by the project to provide employment opportunities for participants one example of californiabased program funds daycare center homeless shelter an alternative school for gang members and tattooremoval service another example of gang intervention initiative developed by faithbased organization provides jobs and refurbishes neighborhoods including removing graffiti and providing landscaping suppression programs are also designed to reduce gang crime by deterring such crimes through the arrest prosecution and incarceration of gang members as early as 1979 angeles ca created prosecutorial gang suppression program through the citys district attorneys office that targeted serious and violent juvenile gangrelated crime the formation of specialized gang units among local police departments improved intelligence gathering investigation and suppression of gangs thr ough the use of gang sweeps targeting gang gathering pl aces or hotspots and intensified patrols in communities plagued by gang violence and drug trafficking to bring pressure to bear on gangs in addition there has been an emphasis on reducing handgun violence among gang members through various initiatives often supported through grants from the federal cops program previously discussed numerous communities across the country have used combinations of these examples and techniques to develop their antigang strategies community policing has been one strategy used to respond to gang activity whereas other communities have approached the problem with strategies that combine local law enforcement with federal and state agencies many of these multiagency initiatives have been developed in angeles and other cities of southern california where the gang problem is endemic however an influential multiagency project was developed in boston massachusetts known as the boston gun project or operation ceasefire the program is considered model multiagency gang suppression initiative 81 under the program gang violence is tracked to the neighborhoods where it occurs there is an explicit communication campaign to let the community and gang members know that there will be zero tolerance of all gang violence and that those offenders who violate these conditions will receive long prison sentences

enhancements for gang related crimes once an individual has been convicted under the step act the law requires the offender to register with the local law enforcement agency on release from prison and

subjected to its penalties the police andor prosecutors then gather evidence on targeted gang members that fit the acts definition and the information is presented to the court for judicial order once

one response that is being taken by cities and jurisdictions across the country has been to use civil injunctions or nuisance ordinances to curtail the activities of gang members angeles city with one of the worst gang problems in the country pioneered this response in 1987 in neighborhoods around the city particularly hardhit by gang violence and crime civil injunctions are legal actions that prohibit specifically named individuals from engaging in particular activities within specified area civil gang injunction cgi can restrict or prohibit both legal and illegal gang activities 85 for example cgi could be used to ban gang from using public parks or wearing certain articles of clothing or publicly associating with known gang members cgis could also be used to make it violation of the injunction to possess graffiti tools spray paint or to carry pager or cell phone because these items could be used for illegal activities cgis have been applied to specifically named gang members who have been prohibited from engaging in certain activities within specified area in an attempt to create safety zone within highcrime neighborhood if permitted by courts cgis have also included curfews although generally these types of restrictions are typically only imposed on juvenile gang members named in an injunction violations of cgi generally carry fine or incarceration that varies depending on whether the case is brought in civil or criminal court typically cgis go into effect as soon the named gang members are served with copy of the injunction order86 since angeles first issued an injunction against gang in 1987 the use of this type of local ordinance has spread throughout southern california communities and into other states the rationale for cgis is based on the finding that much of gangrelated crime is perpetuated by 83 some law enforcement sources think that these provisions may be responsible for the r ecent trend among gang members of trying to conceal their membership status 84 arizona arkansas florida georgia illinois indiana iowa louisiana minnesota mississippi montana nevada north dakota rhode island and south dakota have enacted step laws 85

gang members who are repeat offenders that can be identified and targeted proponents of cgis report that drop in crime in the target areas after cgi is imposed provides communities some gangfree time to organize and develop constructive ways of limiting gangs effect on their community if cgi worked as intended communities that impose such measures would expect gangrelated crime rates to drop and this experience has been reported by communities employing cgis at least in the shortrun however cgi critics argue that the use of injunctions infringes on the rights of targeted gang members violating their constitutional right to freely associate and assemble peacefully several of the cgis have been litigated however generally the courts have upheld their use recent study of the use of cgis in five neighborhoods in san bernardino ca provides evidence supporting the use of cgis as strategic method of gang suppression 87 the study found that cgis were relatively flexible tools for fighting gang violence because they could be customized to address the particular needs of community88 the study found that cgis may also have an important psychological effect on gang members deterring them from criminal activities simply because of their concern about added police scrutiny resulting from cgi89 surveys of residents in the cgicovered communities found that the injunctions had an immediate impact on the visibility of gang members and that the cgi in turn actually lowered the fear of gang members among residents90 over time the study found that the cgis did have positive effect on residents perception of the gang threat even if the effect was temporary the study concluded that even temporary reductions in gang activity and violence through cgis have the potential to help communities reduce persistence of gang activity

comprehensive antigang bills introduced in the 110th congress focus on making changes to federal criminal law that would provide longer prison sentences for gang members convicted of certain violent felonies these provisions would amend the current law definition of what constitutes criminal street gang by lowering the number of affiliated persons required to trigger additional criminal penalties for serious violent offenses some of the bills address the gang problem through other indirect punitive measures such as increasing the penalties for specified violent crimes including the use of mandatory minimum sentences similarly few of the bills would permit the ag to determine whether juvenile offender should be transferred for prosecution as an adult proponents of these gangrelated sentencing enhancements argue that these enhanced federal penalties are needed to address the rising gang crime in many communities they argue that longer sentences could deter violent gangrelated crime in addition the threat of longer time in prison could encourage greater cooperation of gang members with prosecutors which could lead to the identification arrest and prosecution of other gang

measures are supported by law enforcement officials who contend that they need these tougher sentences to stop gang violence92 similarly proponents of mandatory minimum sentences argue that this type of sentencing offers greater incentives for criminals to cooperate with law enforcement providing evidence in exchange for prosecution for different or lesser charge that does not carry mandatory minimum or carries lesser sentence proponents of new additional federal criminal penalties for gang crimes argue that tougher penalties and federal mandatory minimum sentences for gang crimes are an essential deterrent to gang crime particularly violent crimes critics of mandatory minimum sentences argue on several levels against these proposals on the broadest level there are critics opposed to the further federalization of laws that have traditionally been under the sole jurisdiction of states and localities they cite the growing number of new federal crimes recently estimated at almost 4000 crimes 93 and that federal approach is less desirable and unnecessary when there are already adequate federal state and local laws to address gangrelated crime it is also argued that not only are federal resources strained as they cope with investigating and prosecuting national threats but it is the state and local law enforcement officers that have the necessary ex perience and local intelligence sources to investigate and prosecute gang crimes which may vary greatly by state region or locality opponents of mandatory minimum sentences for gangrelated crime also point to the greater expense of imprisonment versus the costs of prevention and rehabilitation efforts moreover it has also been argued that in certain situations many individuals will break the law nothwithstanding severe criminal penalties94 questioning the crime deterrence effect of harsher penalties the issue of prosecuting juveniles as adults is highly contentious issue discussed voluminously in the literature on juvenile delinquency and is beyond the scope of this report95 however provisions such as the one proposed in hr 880 that would permit federal prosecution of juveniles who commit gangrelated crimes after their 16th birthday could have significant implications for example under provisions of th is bill juveniles prosec uted and convicted as adults for serious gangrelated violent offenses could be subject to mandatory minimum sentences under provisions such as the enhanced criminal penalties for gangrelated crimes found in hr 880 juvenile gang members transferred for federal prosecution as adults could be eligible to receive sentence of death for certain violent crimes opponents of prosecuting juveniles as adults point to research that shows juveniles who are tried as adults and imprisoned in adult facilities have higher recidivism rates and higher rearrest rates compared to those of juveniles sentenced in juvenile court others argue that these measures could disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority juveniles in addition they point to data from the fbi uniform crime reports and the national crime victimization survey ncvs reports discussed above crime statistics section that indicate that juvenile gang crime has been declining 92 supported by the fraternal order of police the national sheriffs association and the

crime and racketeering statutes rico to include provisions to make ra cketeering gang predicate offense and increase penalties the penalties for such crimes proponents of such federal rico amendments argue that these amendments are necessary to prosecute cases where drug trafficking activity has been conducted by gangs onto federal land and indian reservations to avoid detection and state prosecution proponents argue that additional fede ral gangspecific rico laws as provided by some of these bills would provide an important addition to the federal arsenal for investigating and prosecuting gangrelated crime opponents argue that the existing federal rico laws are sufficiently broad to provide for successful prosecution of gangrelated crime rico prosecutions can present number of obstacles to prosecuting gang violence and murder using these statutes for example one significant obstacle in gangrelated rico prosecution can be the statutes requirement that gang being prosecuted must be shown to have defined structure and hierarchical organization and that the crimes were committed or that there was conspiracy to commit crimes in furtherance of the gang 96 despite these and other evidentiary obstacles under existing federal rico statues there have been number of successful rico prosecutions for gangrelated crimes97 more general criticism of many antigang legislation that has been introduced in previous congresses has been that many of the bills were not sufficiently focused on gang prevention assistance and that there was lack of innovation or expansion of prevention strategies similarly some have criticized the lack of focus on intervention efforts designed to help keep exoffender gang members from falling back into the gang life after imprisonment supporters of gang prevention and intervention programs have long argued that these types programs have been subjected to funding cuts in recent years despite research indicating that gang prevention can be an important and effective way of stopping gang growth moreover there are few specifically targeted ojp or ojjdp antigang prevention programs and gangspecific intervention programs most of the remaining ojp and ojjdp programs are broad grant programs with numerous programmatic purposes among which antigang initiatives are one among many opponents of prevention programs raise concerns about the costs of such programs and their effectiveness they argue that rigorous evaluations are needed to substantiate the cost and the outcomes of initiatives critics also argue that grant programs may not sufficiently reduce the gang problems facing communities across the nation given that as some observers conclude the root causes of gang formation and gang violen ce stem from poverty lack of employment opportunities and alienation from the larger society much more than grant programs may be needed to fully address the countrys gang problem

nation gang members also vary by number of factors including age race or ethnicity gender and educational attainment among many others research also indicates that there is much about youth gangs that authorities do not know and may never fully understand because of the inherent complexity of the communities that give rise to gangs as one researcher put it gangs emerge grow dissolve and disappear for reasons that are poorly understood98 it is also important to note that gangs are dynamic entities that evolve over time further defying easy or static responses evaluations of youth gang initiatives are complicated by the numerous levels that must be assessed often antigang strategies must encompass broad contributing factors such as the formation and dissolution of gangs the diversion of youth from gangs delinquency and crime prevention andor reduction antigang strategies also involve gang members their parents educators community leaders community organizations providers law enforcement the police prison systems parole and probation officers nd judges once again the lack of commonly accepted definition of youth gang perhaps most fundamentally hampers evaluation measures despite this array of obstacles numerous evaluations of federal state and local antigang initiatives have been conducted and model programs have been identified by gang researchers as promising responses to the gang problem careful consideration of the outcomes of antigang program evaluations could also contribute to the development of federal programs and policies the following

type of strategy alone could not solve communitys gang problem but coupled with some other strategies it could provide communities with pause in gang crime that is long enough to put in place more longterm antigang programs or initiatives designed to stop gang criminal activity congress could introduce legislation to provide for foreign policy initiatives to assist latin american countries in

multiple strategies to fully address the problem the history of gang problems indicates that total elimination of gangs or the social problems that foster their formation and development may always persist as national concern the range of gang problems which span juvenile delinquency to drug trafficking and the serious violent offenses indicates the complexity of addressing the problem and the need for multiple strategies targeted at different populations efforts to address the problem could be significantly improved by greater attention to data collection efforts on gang prevalence characteristics and criminal activities as well as careful program evaluation measures to ensure that efforts to address the problem are functioning at optimal levels law enforcement approaches at all levels of government could benefit from more coordinated efforts to assure that resources are being used in the most effective manner information and intelligence sharing between law enforcement at all levels of government could also enhance the development and execution of antigang strategies and could foster greater cooperation to address the gang problem gang researchers have long advocated that balance of strategies in the areas of prevention intervention and suppression may begin to effectively address the gang problem prevention strategies targeted on keeping juveniles from ever joining gangs such as the great program or boys and girls clubs offer some possible prevention approaches intervention strategies such as training and employment assistance to provide alternatives to the gang life for active members is also suggested as mechanism for providing economic alternatives to criminal gang activity imprisonment and other punitive measures such as forfeiture and fines are appropriate for serious violent gang perpetrators however such measures alone have not proven to be sufficient to stem the growth of gangs
