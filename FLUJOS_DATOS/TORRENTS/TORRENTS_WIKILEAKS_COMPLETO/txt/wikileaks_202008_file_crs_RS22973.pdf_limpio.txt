documented in multiple reports issued by governments and other in ternational bodies the bush administration initially highlighted and later deemphasized pyongyangs human rights record as its policy on nuclear weapons negotiations volved congress has c onsistently drawn attention to north korean human rights viol ations on bipartisan basis on several occasions congress has criticized the executive branch for its approach to these issues through tough questioning of administrati on witnesses during multiple hearings and through written letters of protest to secretary of state condoleezza ricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22973crs2 the passage of the north korean human rights act of 2004 hr 4011 pl 108333 and 22 usc 7801 and its reau thorization in 2008 hr 5834 pl110346 serve as the most prominent examples of legislative action on these issues the legislation both reinforces some aspects of the administrations rhetoric on north korea and expresses dissatisfaction w ith other elements of its policy on north korea the reauthorization bill explicitly criticizes th implementation of the original law and reasserts congressional interest in adopting human rights as major priority in us policy toward north korea us attention to north korean human rights and refugees is complicated by the geopolitical sensitivities of east asia china is wary of us involvement in the issue and chafes at any criticism based on human rights south korea also had reservations about more active us role particularly in terms of refugees although the current administration in seoul has been more amenable to such efforts both want to avoid massive outflow of refugees which they believe could trigger instability or the collapse of north korea us executive branch officials worry that criticism of how seoul and beijing approach north koreas human rights violations could disrupt the multilateral negotiations to deal with pyongyangs nucl ear weapons programs north korean refugees

first several years of the bush ad ministration highlevel officials including the president and secretary of state public ly and forcefully criticized the regime in pyongyang for its human rights practices as efforts to push forward the sixparty talks accelerated in 2007 the administration did not propose any negotiations with north korea over human rights but asserted that hum an rights is one of several issues to be settled with north korea after the nuclear issue is resolved the sixparty agreement of february 13 2007 calls for the united states nd north korea to start bilateral talks aimed at resolving bilateral issues and moving toward full diplomatic relations prior to the agreement in 2007 the bush administration held that it would not agree to normalization of diplomatic relations with north korea until there was progress on human rights presumably including refugees and ot her issues however since the signing of the agreement in february 2007 some observers say that assistant s ecretary of state for east asian and pacific affair s christopher hill has focused exclusively on satisfactory settlement of the nuclear issue it remains unclear how and when north koreas human rights record and refugee issues might emerge as agenda items in usnorth korea relations the north korean human rights act of 2004 the 108th congress passed by voice vote and president bush signed the north korean human rights act of 2004 nkhra the legislation authorized up to 20 million for each of the fiscal years 20052008 for assistance to north korean refugees 2 million for promoting

status and instructs the state department to facilitate the submission of applications by north koreans seeking protection as refugees and required the president to appoint special envoy to promote human rights in north korea the act also expressed the sense of congre ss that human rights should remain key element in negotiations with north korea all humanitarian aid to north korea shall be conditional upon improved monitoring of the distribution of food support for radio broadcasting into north korea should be enhan ced and that china is obligated to provide the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr with unimpeded access to north koreans inside china some hail the nkhra as an important message that human rights will play central role in the formulation of us policy towards north korea passage of the legislation was driven by the argument that the united states has moral responsibility to stand up for human rights for those ffering under repressive regime s advocates claim that in addition to alleviating ma jor humanitarian crisis the nkhra will ultimate ly enhance stability in northeast asia by promoting in ternational cooperation to deal with the problem of north korean refugees critics say the legislation risks upsetting relations with south korea and china nd ultimately the diplomatic ity necessary to make north korea abandon its nuclear weapons program thr ough the sixparty talks further they insist that the legislation actually worsens the plight of north korean refugees by drawing more attention to them leading to crac kdowns by both north korean and chinese authorities and reduced assistance by southeast asian c ountries concerned about offending pyongyang selected implem entation progress while the passage of the nkhra raised th profile of congre ssional interest in north korean human rights and refugee issues many of the activities had existing authorizations already in place the state department had programs

enacted in august 2005 was cr iticized for accepting the job as parttime position while maintaining his legal career in new york the reauthorization bill stipulates that the special envoy be an ambassadorlevel position which requires confirmation by the senate and expresses the sense of congress that the position should be fulltime whereas the original gislation was vague on whether the refugee specific provisions fell under the envoys res ponsibilities the reauthor ization bill includes the sense of congress that the envoy s hould participate in policy planning and implementation on north korean refugee issues lefkowitzs role has varied in its public profile at times he has been an active and vocal advocate for human rights issues and at other times he has faded from public view

was negotiated he raised questions about labor practices at the kaesong complex an industrial park cated in north korea in which consortium of south korean firms em ploy north korean labor2 lefkowitzs visibility declined particularly in 2007 as the bush administrati on renewed its effort on nuclear negotiations his statements occasionally have sparked c ontroversy in january 2008 he gave speech at

jay lefkowitz has nothing to do with the sixparty talks he certainly has say in what amer ican policy will be in the sixparty talks3 complications with the refugee provisions implementation challenges some observers contend that goodfaith implementation of nkhras refu gee provisions may be counterproductive they argue that the legislation on north korean refu gee admissions could send dangerous message to north koreans that admission to the united states as refugee is assured encouraging incursions into us diplomatic missions ov erseas state department officials say that given the tight security in place at us facilities abroad unexpect ed stormings could result in injury or death for the refugees secondly granting of asylum status to north korean refugees involves complex vetting pro cess that is further co mplicated by the fact that the applicants originate from state with which the united states does not have official relations in congressional hearings state department

of information available to us immigration officials on north koreans4 funding concerns some government offici als and ngo staff familiar with providing assistance to north ko rean refugees say that funding explicitly associated with the nkhra is problematic because of the need for discretion in reaching the vulnerable population refugees are often hiding from authorities and regi onal governments do not wish to draw attention to their role in tran sferring north koreans so funding is labeled under more general assistance programs in addition many of the ngos that help refugees do not have the capacity to absorb large amounts of funding effectively because of their small grass roots nature ready alternative for resettlement south korea remains the primary destination for north korean refugees in addition to automatically granting south korean citizenshi p the south korean government admin isters resettlement program and provides cash and training for all defector s according to press reports over 14000 defectors from north korea have resettled in the south since the conclusion of the korean war in 1953 including over 2500 in 2007 alone5 the south korean system
