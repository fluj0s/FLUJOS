has given restricted reading to the clause holding that it protects only from inquiry into legislative acts in frequently quoted scription of the scope of the clause the court in 1972 in gravel v

the house of congress in which he serves3 and to the electorate4 scope of privilege the speech or debate clause has its roots in english history specifically in the conflict between parliament and the crown5 in the american system of government the clause performs two re lated functions first it protects the independence and integrity of the legislature and secon d it reinforces the separation of powers 6 although the privilege is available in private civil suits against members the purpose of the clause was to prevent intimidation by the executive and accountability before possibly hostile judiciary7 the supreme court has recognized that the clause was not inte nded simply for the personal or private benefit of members of congress but to protect the integrity of the legislative process by insuring the independence of individual legislators8 the clause protects members not only from the consequences of litigations results but also from the burden of defending themselves9 in cases in which the clause applies the immunity is absolute10 and cannot be defeated by an allegation of an improper purpose or motivation11 where it is applicable the clause affords not only substantive immunity but also complementary evidentiary privilege12 in other words the clause provides both immunity from liability in civil and criminal proceedings and testimonial

have limited it to words spoken in debate relied on the interpretation of comparable clause continuedthe clause affords both an institutional and an individual privilege14 i t is uncertain whether at least in limited circumstances the institution might be able to waive the privilege of individual members15 the court has assumed without deciding that an individual member coul d waive the clauses protection against criminal prosecution but has held that ch waiver could be found only after explicit and unequivocal renunc iation of the protection16 it has been held that the clause may be asserted not only by current member but also by former member in an ac tion implicating his conduc t while in congress17 and by members aides insofar as the conduct of the latter would be protected legislative act if performed by the member himself18 the immunity applies regardless of whether the member or aide is party to the litigation or has merely been called to testif or give deposition19 although the clause affords personal imm unity for member and his aides it does not preclude judicial re view of the merits of challenged congressional action20 or the use of acts eg speeches or votes as evidence in the course of such review21 the supreme court has construed the speech or debate clause in only few cases in its first decision interpreting the clause kilbourn v thompson 22 the court read it expansively finding that members privilege extended to things generally done in session of the house by one of its members in relation to the business before it23 notwithstanding broad

ruling in 1972 in united states v brewster 24 the court has taken more limited view of the protection provided by the clause25 holding that it protects only from inquiry into legislative acts26 in brewster the court explained that legislative act has consistently been defi ned as an act generally done in congress in relation to the business before it in sum the speech or debate clause prohibits inquiry only into those things generally said or done in the house or the senate in the performance of official duties and in to the motivation for those acts27 in another frequently quoted description of the scope of the privilege the court in gravel v united states 28 decided on the same day as brewster explained that in addition to actual speech or debate in either house the clause applies only to acts which are an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in committee and hous proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or re jection of proposed legislati on or with respect to other matters which the constitution places within the jurisdiction of either house29 the clause does not protect political activity term which the court has indicated would include inter alia for purposes of article i 6 constituent service press releases and speeches delivered outside the legislative sphere as the court explained in dicta in united states v brewster members of congress engage in many activities other than the purely legislative activities prot ected by the speech or debate clause these include wide range of legitimate errands performed for constituents the making of appointments with government agencies assist ance in securing government contracts preparing socalled newsletters to constituents news releases and speeches delivered outside the congress although these are entirely gitimate activities they are political in nature rather than legislative it has never been seriously contended that these political matters however appropriate have the protection afforded by the speech or debate clause30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30843crs5 31 408 us at 609 62229 32 id at 626 33 id at 616 cochran v

united states v brewster 408 us 501 526 1972 the court emphasized that the prosecution in that action could establish its case without inquiry into legislative acts or motivations for legislative acts id at 525 and on that basis distinguished its decision in united states v johnson 383 us 169 1966 which had voided members criminal conviction for conspiracy to defraud th united states the prosecution in johnson had introduced evidence bearing on the preparation and motivation of speech on the floor that the member had allegedly delivered as part of the conspiracy the court has also ruled that in crimin prosecution the government may offer evidence continuedjudicial construction of the speech or debate clause since brewster has been founded on the distinction veloped in that case betw een legislative and political activity and on related dis tinction between legislative acts on the one hand and acts in preparation for or implementation of legislative acts on the other in gravel the court held that grand jury c ould probe the manner by which senate subcommittee chairman had obtained classified government documents the pentagon papers and could c onsider allegations that th senator had arranged for private republication of those materials but further held that the grand jury could not inquire into the conduct or motives of th senator or his ai des at subcommittee meeting during which the senator placed th pentagon papers in the public record31 in explaining its ruling in gravel the court stated while the clause recognizes speech voting and other legislative acts as exempt from liability that might otherwise attach it does not privilege either senato r or aide to violate an otherwise valid criminal law in preparing for or implementing legislative acts32 the clause protects member when speaking on the house or senate floor33 introducing and voting on b ills and resolutions34 preparing and submitting committee reports35 acting at committee meetings and hearings36 and conducting investigations and issuing subpoenas37 the clause does not protect criminal conduc t such as taking bribe which is not part of the legislative process38 additionally the clau

and making appointments with government agencies46 are not protected the application of the clause to various other contacts by members with the executive eg letters and other informal means of communication from members to officials of the executive branch particularly in the course of the oversight process is uncertain47 it is also uncertain whether the speech or debate clause immunizes member for personnel actions48httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30843crs7 48 continued court would find speech or debate immunity applicable to employment actions in forrester the court held that state court judge did not have judicial immunity for firing probation officer and advocated functional approach to the immunity issue evaluating the effect of possible liability on the performance of particular function in 1995 with little debate focused on the immunity issue the house and senate passed the congressional accountability act pl 1041 109 stat 3 1995 which provides for judicial review under various statutes of congressional personnel actions however 413 of the act declares that the authorization to bring judicial proceedings under various provisions of the law does not constitute waiver of inter alia the speech or debate privilege of any member conclusion the speech or debate clause provide s member with immunity for his legislative acts including inter alia speaking and voting on the house or senate floor and in committee the clause does not protect political activity including inter alia constituent service press releases and speeches delivered outside the legislative sphere
