of columbia in fy2006 the most recent data available section 1115 waiver federal expenditures for medicaid and schip totaled approximately 424 billion section 1115 waiver programs represented approximately 24 of all federal medicaid spending in the 50 states and the district of columbia for fy2006 19 for schip and provided coverage to approximately 115 million enrollees 25 million of whom were eligible only for targeted benefit package such as family planning or pharmacy benefits this report provides background information on the waiver authority order code rs21054 updated september 11 2008 medicaid and schip section 1115 research and demonstration waivers evelyne p baumrucker analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division summary section 1115 of the social security act provides the secretary of health and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054 human services hhs with broad authority to waive certain statutory requirements for states to conduct research and demonstration projects that further the goals of titles xix medicaid andor xxi the state childrens health insurance program schip states use the section 1115 waiver authority to cover nonmedicaid and schip services limit benefit packages cap program enrollment among other purposes as of july 1 2008 there were 94 operational medicaid and schip section 1115 waiver programs in 43 states and the district of columbia in fy2006 the most recent data available section 1115 waiver federal expenditures for medicaid and schip totaled approximately 424 billion section 1115 waiver programs represented approximately 24 of all federal medicaid spending in the 50 states and the district of columbia for fy2006 19 for schip and provided coverage to approximately 115 million enrollees 25 million of whom were eligible only for targeted benefit package such as family planning or pharmacy benefits1 this report provides background information on the waiver authority and will be updated when new data are available 1 fy2006 waiver expenditure and enrollment estimates from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms based on statereported data and are subject to change between fy2001 the earliest year for which crs has access to section 1115 expenditure estimates and fy2005 federal medicaid waiver expenditures as percentage of total medicaid spending were steady at approximately1214 in fy2006 there was substantial increase in federal waiver spending as percentage of total medicaid spending ie almost 60 increase over the fy2005 totals while there are several plausible explanations for this increase eg ramp up of new and renegotiated waivers prior period adjustments etc because waiver financing arrangements are negotiated over 5year budget window it is hard to determine if the jump in federal expenditures represents step increase in overall federal waiver spending or onetime increase that will be mitigated over the budget authority window analysis of future waiver expenditure trends will help to clarify this question estimates do not include state experience under the 5 month temporary katrina waivers described below crs2 background medicaid authorized under title xix of the social security act is federalstate program providing medical assistance for lowincome individuals who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children or who have one of few specified medical conditions the balanced budget act of 1997 established schip under new title xxi of the social security act schip builds on medicaid by providing health insurance to uninsured children in families with income above applicable medicaid income standards section 1115 waiver authority section 1115 of the social security act provides the secretary of health and human services hhs with broad authority to conduct research and demonstration projects under several programs authorized by the social security act including medicaid and schip section 1115 also authorizes the secretary to waive certain statutory requirements for conducting these projects without congressional approval for this reason the research httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054 and demonstration projects are often referred to as section 1115 waiver projects under section 1115 the secretary may waive medicaid requirements contained in section 1902 including but not limited to what is known as freedom of choice of provider comparability of services and statewide access2 the secretary may also use the section 1115 waiver authority to provide federal financial participation ffp for costs that are not otherwise matchable under section 1903 of the social security act for schip specific sections or requirements are cited as waiveable section 2107e2a of the social security act states that section 1115 of the act pertaining to research and demonstration waivers applies to schip states must submit proposals outlining terms and conditions for proposed waivers to cms for approval before implementing these programs in recent years there has been increased interest among states and the federal government in the section 1115 waiver authority as means to restructure coverage control costs and increase state flexibility under current law states may obtain waivers that allow them to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for medicaid or schip cover nonmedicaid or schip services limit benefit packages for certain groups among other purposes whether large or small reforms section 1115 waiver programs have resulted in significant changes for medicaid and schip recipients nationwide and may serve as precedent for federal and state officials who wish to make statutory changes to these healthcare safety net programs while section 1115 is explicit about provisions in medicaid law that may be waived in conducting demonstration projects number of other provisions in medicaid law and regulations specify limitations on how state may operate waiver program for example one provision restricts states from establishing waivers that fail to provide all 2 freedom of choice refers to requirement that medicaid beneficiaries have the freedom to choose provider comparability refers to requirement that services be comparable in amount duration and scope for persons in particular eligibility groups waiver of the statewideness requirement allows states to provide services in only portion of the state rather than in all geographic jurisdictions crs3 mandatory services to the mandatory povertyrelated groups of pregnant women and children another provision specifies restrictions on costsharing under waivers other features of the section 1115 waiver authority include federal reimbursement for section 1115 demonstrations approved section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part of states medicaid or schip state plan for purposes of federal reimbursement project costs associated with waiver programs are subject to that states fmap or enhancedfmap3 financing and budget neutrality unlike regular medicaid cms waiver guidance specifies that waiver costs are budget neutral to the federal government over the life of the waiver program to meet the budget neutrality test estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the states existing medicaid program under current law program requirements4 for example costs associated with an expanded population eg those not otherwise eligible under medicaid must be offset by reductions elsewhere within the medicaid program several methods are used by states to generate cost savings for the waiver httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054 component 1 limiting benefit packages for certain eligibility groups 2 providing targeted services to certain individuals so as to divert them from full medicaid coverage and 3 using enrollment caps and cost sharing to reduce the amounts states must pay financing and allotment neutrality under the schip program different budget neutrality standard applies states must meet an allotment neutrality test where combined federal expenditures for the states regular schip program and for the states schip demonstration program are capped at the states individual schip allotment ie original allotments and funds made available through the redistribution of unspent schip funds this policy limits federal spending to the capped allotment levels application and approval process there is standardized process to apply for section 1115 demonstration but cms has issued program guidance that impacts the approval process states often work collaboratively with cms to develop their proposals project proposals are subject to approval by cms the office of management and budget omb and the department of health and human services dhhs and may be subject to additional requirements such as site visits before the program may be implemented under the agreed upon terms and conditions duration waiver projects are generally approved for fiveyear period however states may seek up to threeyear extension for their existing 3 section 1903 describes the conditions under which federal financial participation is available section 1115a2 stipulates that expenditures under waiver are eligible for matching under section 1903 the same federal reimbursement rules apply to schip waiver projects as with schip state plan expenditures schip section 1115 waiver programs are reimbursed at an enhanced federal matching rate 4 an exception was made by the secretary for the katrina waivers ie all tests of budget and allotment neutrality were waived crs4 waiver program under the same special terms and conditions stc and an additional extensions under revised stc for the continuation of waiver project operating under an initial threeyear extension5 relationship of medicaidschip demonstration waivers to other statutes section 1115 waiver projects may interact with other program rules outside of the social security act for example employer sponsored health insurance as described by the employee retirement income security act erisa or alien eligibility as contained in immigration law in cases like these the secretary does not have the authority to waive provisions in these other statutes6 program guidance the secretary can develop policies that influence the content of demonstration projects and prescribe approval criteria in three ways 1 by promulgating program rules and regulations7 2 through the publication of program guidance eg waivers must be budget neutral8 and 3 waiver policy may also be implicitly shaped by the programs that have been approved eg cms approval of benefit specific waivers legislative action may be required if congress chooses to further shape the secretarys authority over the content of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054 demonstration programs dictate specific section 1115 waiver approval criteria or otherwise limit the secretarys waiver authority program types as of july 1 2008 there were 94 operational medicaid and schip section 1115 waivers in 43 states and the district of columbia in fy2006 the most recent data available section 1115 waiver federal expenditures for medicaid and schip totaled approximately 424 billion section 1115 waiver programs represented approximately 24 of all federal medicaid spending in the 50 states and the district of columbia for fy2006 19 for schip and provided coverage to approximately 115 million enrollees9 of the 115 million total medicaid and schip waiver enrollees 25 million 5 the approval process associated with each type of extension is defined in statute at section 1115e and at section 1115f respectively 6 for example states may not provide benefits to qualified aliens as part of section 1115 eligibility expansion without adhering to the fiveyear ban on alien access to federal assistance as required by the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104 193 7 program rules and regulations that meet specified rulemaking criteria are legally binding to date cms has not shaped section 1115 waiverrelated policy through program rules and regulations 8 unlike program rules and regulations program guidance is not legally binding rather program guidance provides framework for the process by which states may obtain approvals and the principles under which states may operate their programs program guidance contains authoritative interpretation and clarification of statutory and regulatory requirements to date the secretary has only used guidance to shape section 1115 waiver policy 9 estimates do not include state experience under the 5 month temporary katrina waivers described below crs5 were only eligible for targeted benefit package such as family planning benefits there are several types of operational waiver programs including comprehensive demonstrations these demonstrations provide broad range of services that are generally offered statewide many of the comprehensive waivers operate under combined title xix and title xxi authority and are financed with federal medicaid and schip matching funds several also include family planning andor health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa component see below in fy2008 there were 32 operational comprehensive state reform waivers in 26 states10 fy2006 statereported enrollment estimates for these waivers totaled approximately 81 million11 at federal cost of approximately 384 billion the schipfinanced portion of these waivers extended coverage to approximately 475376 enrollees at federal cost of 330 million fy2006 enrollee estimates for the limited benefits offered under fp component totaled approximately 104990 family planning demonstrations fp in fy2008 there were 22 states with standalone fp waivers

texas utah hifa virginia hifa and wisconsin delaware the continued crs6 extend medicaid and schip to the uninsured with an emphasis on approaches that maximize private health insurance coverage and target populations with incomes below 200 of the federal poverty level fpl under hifa states were encouraged to finance program expansions using unspent schip funds to for example extend coverage to one or more categories of adults with children typically parents of medicaidschip children caretaker relatives or legal guardians andor pregnant women four states ie arizona michigan new mexico and oregon have approval to cover childless adults under their hifa waivers the deficit reduction act of 2005 prohibits new waivers that would use schip funds to provide coverage to nonpregnant childless adults recently the administration has not renewed existing waivers that permitted coverage of adults through schip14 in addition to expanding coverage to new populations under schip some states use the schip section 1115 authority for other purposes including modifying cost sharing rules eg new mexico and requiring periods of insurance prior to schip enrollment eg alaska and new mexico as of fy2006 approximately 925196 enrollees accessed services under httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054 schip and hifa demonstrations at federal cost of 675 million specialty services and population demonstrations these demonstrations generally include programs that provide cash to enrollees so that they may directly arrange and purchase services that best meet their needs in addition they include waivers to provide pharmacy benefits to persons with specific conditions such as hivaids as of fy2008 there were 20 such operational programs in 15 states and the district of columbia15 in fy2006 these demonstrations covered approximately 37473 individuals at federal cost of approximately 441 million federal costs for pharmacyonly demonstrations totaled 15 billion in fy2006 katrinamultistate demonstrations in response to the hurricane katrina disaster cms allowed states to provide temporary eligibility for specified katrina evacuees so that such individuals could obtain
