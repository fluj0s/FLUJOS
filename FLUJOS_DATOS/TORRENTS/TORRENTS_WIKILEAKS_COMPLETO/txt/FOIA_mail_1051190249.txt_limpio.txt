from tom wigley wigleyucaredu to timothy carter timcarterymparistofi subject re java climate model date thu 24 apr 2003 091729 0600 cc mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk phil jones pjonesueaacuk tim i know about what matthews has done he did so without contacting sarah or he uses statistical emulation method that can never account for the full range of uncertainties i would not trust it outside the calibration zone so i doubt that it can work well for eg stabilization cases as far as i know it has not been peer reviewed furthermore unless he has illegally got hold of the tar version of the model what he has done can only be an emulation of the sar version personally i regard this as junk science ie not science at all matthews is doing the community considerable disservice tom ps re cr i do not know the best way to handle the specifics of the editoring hans von storch is partly to blame he encourages the publication of crap science in order to stimulate debate one approach is to go direct to the publishers and point out the fact that their journal is perceived as being medium for disseminating misinformation under the guise of refereed work i use the word perceived here since whether it is true or not is not what the publishers care about it is how the journal is seen by the community that counts i think we could get large group of highly credentialed scientists to sign such letter 50 people note that i am copying this view only to mike hulme and phil jones mikes idea to get editorial board members to resign will probably not work must get rid of von storch too otherwise holes will eventually fill up with people like legates balling lindzen michaels singer etc i have heard that the publishers are not happy with von storch so the above approach might remove that hurdle too _______________________________ _______________________________ timothy carter wrote dear tom since you were online yesterday contributing to the climate research discussion i figured that you might be in town to give your views on the java climate model which i understand is based in large part on magicc httpchooseclimateorgjcm and seems to be getting considerable exposure amongst the policy community now that ben matthews was he student of yours at uea has made this available online i wondered if this has been subjected to peer review by the people whose models it is based on or anyone else since i have ministry people here in finland asking if this type of tool is something they should think of using during the negotiating process its certainly smart piece of software though it seems to have irritating bugs like returning to the default state when any little thing is adjusted what is critically important though is that it can do what it is advertising if it cant then the careful work done offline by people such as yourself could be undermined any thoughts best regards from sunny though cool helsinki tim ps on the cr issue i agree that rebuttal seems to be the only method of addressing the problem i communicated this to mike yesterday morning and i wonder if review of the refereeing policy is in order the only way i can think of would be for all papers to go through two editors rather than one the former to have overall responsibility the latter to provide second opinion on paper and reviewers comments prior to publication general editor would be needed to adjudicate in the event of disagreement of course this could then slow down the review process enormously however without an editorial board to vote someone off how can suspect editors be removed except by the publisher in this case interresearch
