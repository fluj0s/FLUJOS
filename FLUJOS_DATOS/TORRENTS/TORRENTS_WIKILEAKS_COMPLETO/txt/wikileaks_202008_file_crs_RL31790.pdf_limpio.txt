congress summary on october 22 2004 the tobacco quota buyout was signed into law title vi of pl 108357 is known as the fair nd equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 this legislation eliminated the tobacco quota program and compensated active producers and absentee quota owners for the lost value the concept of quota buyout was not new but it gained political momentum after be ing endorsed in the final report of presidential commission on tobacco tobacco at crossroads call for action may 14 2001 and by the leading us cigarette manufacturer philip morris several quota bills were introduced in the 107th congress without subsequent legislative acti on supporters of buyout nd legislative sponsors again put the proposal on the legislative agenda of the 108th congress by introducing several differing bills eventually hr 4033 jenkins ma rch 25 2004 and s 1490 mcconnell july 30 2003 were attached to unrelated tax legislation hr 4520 in the house and s 1637 in the senate which was taken up by conferees on october 5 2004 these bills proposed to eliminate tobacco quotas and the price support loan program as compensation quota owners i ncluding absentee owners and active producers would receive lump sum payments active produ cers were to receive 7 per pound in the house version or 8 per pound in the sena version for the quota they owned in 2002 plus 3 per pound in the house version or 4 per pound in the senate version for the quantity of tobacco they were allo wed to produce most producers grow more than the quota they own because they leas quota from other landlords the absentee landlords also were be paid for the quota they owned in 2002 the estimated cost of the house and sena bills was respectively 96 billion and 12 billion the source of funding for the two bills differed coming from the federal treasury in the house bill nd from tobacco product manufacturers and importers in the senate bill many public health advocates and ph ilip morris strongly supported tobacco quota buyout accompanied by new lega l authority for the food and drug administration fda to regulate tob acco products the proposed fda authority was included in identical bills in the house and senate h r 4433 daviswaxman and s 2461 dewinekennedy the fda au thority also was included in the senate version of the tax bill but not in th house version where there was strong opposition the

reached vote also the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 sec 1309 included peanut quota buyout provisions as part of the redesign of support for that commoditytobacco quota buyout proposals in the 108th congress several bills were introduced in the 108th congress that proposed to eliminate tobacco marketing quotas and compensate the owners for the loss of asset value associated with quotas1 the bills also proposed to make transition payments to active producers this repor t describes the various legi slative proposals and presents sidebyside comparison of the conference committee agreement with the house and senate versions that went into conference the conference agreement was enacted as pl 108357 title vi the fa ir and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 one basis for comparing proposals is the total amount of money paid to farmers and the source of funds however the quot buyout involved more than the transfer of money the design of future tobacco production and marketin g policy in each bill had important consequences for farmer s communities and the nation some proposals would have eliminated quotas others would have replaced quotas with production licenses or permits for only ac tive producers thereby eliminating quota rents also there was the question of whether some level of domestic tobacco price support would be tinued or eliminated to compare the bills in the context of public policy it is helpful to examine them against set of objectives frame d around the question what should quota buyout program seek to accomplish as the policy debate unfolded general agreement did not exist on this question di fferent interest groups seeking legislation had different objectives quota owners argued that they should be compensated for federal policies that discourage consumption of tobacco products and diminish farmers ability to earn livelihood producers leasing large amount of quota from absentee owners wanted to see their costs of production decline by granting them sole production rights and prohibiting absentee quota ownership farm ers who did not have quota argued that they should not be prohibited as under ex isting law from growing tobacco also there were some public health advocates that saw the quota program as desirable constraint on us tobacco production th cost of these proposals was important especially to the manufacturers if they were the ones who would pay for buyout finally most involved parties anticipated or were working toward the goal of linking quota buyout authority with new authority for the food and drug administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31790crs2 2 the law 7 usc 1445 specifies that each years support price be based on the fiveyear moving average of auction prices and the ch ange in the annual index of tobacco producer costs of productionfda to regulate tobacco products the linkage was seen as political necessity to broaden support for both efforts and disa greement on this issue almost blocked passage of the legislation design and impact of marketing quotas the federal tobacco support program s worked through combination of commodity price support loans and marketin g quotas pri ce support loans guaranteed farmers minimum set prices for tobacco the 2004 loan prices for the two principal types fluecured and burley are 169 and 1873lb respectively these prices were mandated by formula in the law2 marketing quotas which specified the maximum quantity of tobacco that could be sold were assigned by the us department of agriculture usda each year to farms that had history of tobacco production the purpose of quotas was to limit supplies in order to force buyers to pay the loan prices or more the 2004 nati onal basic quotas for fl uecured and burley were 4713 million pounds and 3021 million pounds respectively together the combination of guaranteed minimum pri ces and managed supply was designed to create stable market for farmers and tobacco product manufacturers also the pattern of assigning quotas to farmland with history of quotas confined production to the traditional growing regions and farm s this system of support had operated since the 1930s and was authorized in permanent law 7 usc 1311 et seq see crs report 95129 tobacco price support an overview of the program the economic stability that was desired and expected from the tobacco support program was not achieved first the suppor t prices for us tobacco as mandated by law were higher than prices for co mpeting tobacco in world markets as consequence us farmers steadily lost both export and domestic markets to foreign producers the declines are pictured in figures 1 and 2 based on usda data second tobacco support prices were high er than the costs of production this created economic profits that were capitalized into the marketing quota lease rates and land prices so marketing quotas becam an asset that adde d substantial value to farmland and became source of rental income for owners choosing not to grow tobacco themselves convers ely rent on quotas became sizable expense for active producers renting quota in an attempt to ex pand or even maintain output in the face of shrinking marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31790crs3 figure 1 us share of world tobacco exports figure 2 share of us tobacco in us cigaretteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31790crs4 3 us census of

manufacturers agreed on payments to tobaccoproducing states specifically for farmers called phase ii paymentsas with other crops the number of ac tive tobacco producers has declined over time and production has become concentrated onto fewer but larger farms in 1982 there were about 180000 farms producing tob acco by 2002 just 20 years later the number of active producers wa s about 57000 68 decline3 most of these active tobacco farmers owned some marketing quot themselves and also rented quota from about 359000 other absentee quota owners4 in the mid1990s burley producers owned about 44 of their effective quot and leased the remaining 56 at an average cost of 033lb lease and transf er of quota had been prohibited for flue cured tobacco since 1986 instead active flue cured producers rent farmland that had quota attached to it thereby obtaining th tobacco production rights in the mid 1990s fluecured producers owne d about 33 of their effective quota and rented the remaining 67 at an average cost of 037lb5 newer usda cost of production data put the average rental cost of quota in 2003 at 063lb for fluecured and 057lb for burley6 one reason for increased consolidation and higher quota rental fees was the sharp decline in quota levels after 1997 as shown in figure 3 and table 1 the decline was due to the reversal of previ ously rapidly growing export markets for usmanufactured cigarettes the basi c quotas for fluecured and burley tobacco declined 52 and 57 respectively after 1997 farmers needed to market enough tobacco to maintain their revenue and to economically utilize their barns equipment and labor this required re nting more quota along w ith these economic pressures to consolidate several sources of financ ial aid made it possible for farmers to pay higher rental rates for quota first in conjunction with phase ii of the 1998 master ttlement agreement cigarette manufacturers agreed to dist ribute 515 billion to tobacco producers and quota owners over 12year period7 second to help offset decreases in marketing quotas congress acted to provi assistance four sepa rate emergency assistance laws pl 10678 pl 106224 pl 10725 p l 1087 included what the

ccc finally completed disposal of this inventory in december 2003 by burying it in landfills ccording to ccc data the total cost of acquisition interest on principal stor age and disposal was about 625 million these three sources of financial assistan ce rather than income from the sale of tobacco are the primary reason active producers were able to pay higher rental rates to absentee quota owners as th ey bid against each other for their share of declining national tobacco quota see crs report rs20802 tobacco farmer assistance why quota buyout make tobacco production profitable for active producers active tobacco producers were being hurt financially both by declining marketing quotas which reduced their sale s revenue and higher quota rental rates which raised their production costs fa rmers felt there was little they could do to increase the demand for tobacco especially since it was federal policy to discourage consumption of tobacco products however the elimination of quota rents through buyout of marketing quotas could reduce the costs of production substantially for farmers leasing substantial amounts of quot at the same time active producers might continue to receive the price be nefit of continui ng support program advocates of this policy approach hr 245 fletcher hr 986 goode proposed to give marketing licenses or permits specifying quantity limits to active producers just as with marketing quotas however the licenses would be issued only to active producers and all forms of rent would be prohibited this restrictionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31790crs6 8 the commissions final report was tobacco at crossroads call for action may 2001 9 blake brown implications of elimi nation of the us fluecured tobacco program department of agricultural and resource economics north carolina state university september 18 1997would prevent the licenses from acquiring any exchangeable value the initial recipients of the licenses would be current tobacco producers wanting to continue as active growers active producers not just absentee landl ords also would have received quota buyout payments under all of the legisla tive proposals that were offered this provided the farmers who wanted to quit growing tobacco with sizable benefits the farmers who remained active producers under the license scheme would r eceive windfall from their buyout payment since th ey would have suffered losses they would continue to get the extra income created by licenses and price support this framework for quota buyout of li censed future produc tion and continued price support was developed by th presidents commission on improving economic opportunity in communities dependent on tobacco production while protecting public health8 this commission included advocates for tobacco farmers antismoking and health organizations and rural community development proponents hr 245 and hr 986 larg ely were modeled on the commissions recommendations make us tobacco price competitive there was little disagreement that us tobacco could become substantially more competitive in the domestic as well as export markets if prices declined by the amount paid in quota rents such pri ce reduction would happen if tobacco support program loan rates were redu ced substantially or eliminat ed the quota rent paid to absentee landlords would vanish the decline in revenue from lower tobacco prices largely would be offset by the elimina tion of quota rent payments leaving the producer in bout the same net revenue situation in fact north carolina agricultural economist once estimated that in the absence of the price support program us tobacco production could increase by possibly 509 at the same time the economic analysis noted there would be substantial adjustment costs associated with dropping support prices to free market levels or eliminating the program most immediately the value in quotas would be wiped out this would eliminate the rental income of absentee quota owners furthermore all of the farmland with quota whether owned by absentee landlords or active producers would drop in value however the ec onomic adjustments associated with reduction in tobacco prices could be min imized if not eliminated by compensating quota owners for lost asset values this free market policy approach hr 140

effective marketing quota this option was equally appealing to farmers intending to exit from tobacco production the farmers most disadvantag ed would have been small to medium sized operations and those that were ineffi cient because of high costs or low yields who wanted to continue growing tobacco as compared to system of licensed producers this free market option would result in fewer but larger farms because of economies of size also production likely would move within each of the tobacco states to the geographic locations with the most suitable soils and climate for ec onomical production the very fact that production could increase substantially ma the free market option unappealing to some antismoking and health advocates somewhere between the commission c oncept of production licenses with continued price support and the free ma rket proposal s 1490 mcconnell proposed to eliminate quotas and price support but allocate national crop acreage base among active producers should supplies become excessive an acreage limitation program would require reductions in planting this acreage reduction concept was used in conjunction with the support programs for grains and cotton before being eliminated by the 1996 farm bill hr 3160 was introduced as bipartisan consensus proposal by fletcher mcintyre and goode this bill was similar to the mcc onnell bill in most respects one major variation was different basi s for calculating the amount of money paid to quota owners and active producers u nder s 1490 payments would have totaled about 11 billion compared to about 15 billion under hr 3160 however s 1490 included some community development assi stance that was not present in hr 3160 paying for quota buyout the value of tobacco marketing quota depended on several factors including expectations about the future quota owners knew exactly how much rent they earned from active producers what they did not know was how long the tobacco program would continue to ope rate or the size of nationa l marketing quotas in future years survey data from kentucky revealed that the average sale price of marketing quotas was 258lb in 2001 when lease ra tes averaged 062lb and 208lb in 2000 when lease rates averaged 058l b and 175 in 1999 when lease rates averaged 040lb10 one would expect to get much higher sale prices with annual rents of these magnitudes these sale prices compared to lease rates implied time horizon of about five years based upon 5 interest rate in other words buyers were discounting the purchase price of quota relative to annual re nt in anticipation of future quota reductions or elimination of the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31790crs8 11 usda economist bob tarczy offered this estimate in his presentation on potential financial impact of buyout at the 41st tobacco workers conference january 22 2004 continuedmost quota buyout bills proposed to pay ow ners 8lb this payment was equal to the present value of annual rental income of 040lb in perpetuity at an interest rate of 5 the buyout price of 8lb was much higher price than sellers of quota were getting in the marketplace also th buyout offered to pay active producers an additional 4lb for all production on the fa rm the payment to producers typically was described as transition payment buyout program that payed 8lb to quota owners plus 4lb to active producers would pay 12lb for each pound of quota that qualifies for the program depending on the crop years used to calcula payments and so assumptions about participation levels rough and unofficial estimate of the buyout and transition payments ranged from about 11 to 19 b illion how much would typical tobacco farmer receive the average north carolina tobacco farmer harvested about 21 acres in 2002 producing about 45000 pounds buying out this average north carolina producer who owned 33 of the quota and rented 67 would cost 298800 118800 in quota payments and 180000 in transition

owned 44 of the quota and rents 56 would cost 56400 26400 in quota payments and 30000 in transition payments the presidents commission recommended that federal excise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products serve as the source of revenue for the proposed buyout estimated at 017 per pack on cigarettes for five years however all of the legislative proposals described in th is report included an assessment on manufacturers and importers of tobacco products or the use of us treasury funds rather than an increase in excise taxes on cigarettes certainly manufacturers could benefit from buyout if the support price for tobacco were reduced one tobacco manufacturer philip morris stated its willingness to help pay for tobacco buyout program if us manufacturers could save 060lb on their 2004 purchase inte ntions of about 450 million pou nds the savings would amount to 270 million add itional savings would accrue if drop in the price of us tobacco pushed down th price of foreign
