military ordnance deposits looted by insurgents or from stockpiles scattered in secret locations throughout that country before the war4 in afghanistan the ied munitions supply is supported by funds from an expanding opium trade5 afghanistans opium crop reportedly grew 59 in 2 006 yieldi ng 6100 tons or 90 of the worlds supply6 in 2007 the opium crop grew by another 34 and is now the source of 93 of the worlds supply of heroin and morphine7 news sources report that the average numbe r of daily attacks in iraq has decreased by 42 since june 2007 coincident with th recent surge in the number of us military forces there in addition coalition forces in iraq have discovered significantly more enemy weapons caches largely due to an in crease in the number of tips from iraqi nationals however dod official s have also stated that in afghanistan taliban fighters have increased both the number and lethality of their ied attacks8 observers have indicated that the taliban forces in afghanistan appear to have learned some ied techniques from the iraqi in surgents and some areas of afghanistan are now reportedly becoming too dangerous for reconstruction efforts there to continue9 the taliban reportedly is allied with local pashtun fighters and some foreign fighters and is using suicide bombings improvised expl osive devices and small arms to increase attack levels in neighborin g pakistan at least 865 secur ity forces and officials have reportedly been killed by suicide bombs and improvised explosive devices in 200710 dod has found that insurgents build and deploy ieds by using social

insurgents with training and new ied technol ogy such as passive infrared electronic sensors that are used for triggering roadside bombs the new sensors are more resistant to electromagnetic countermeas ures now employed by us forces dod officials also suspect that iran is supplying iraq insurgen ts with more lethal ied bomb design called an explosively formed projectile efp an efp is made from pipe filled with explosives and capped by specially shaped metal disk when the explosives detonate they transform the disk into jet of molte n metal capable of penetrating armor efps reportedly strike with enough power to cause pieces of ta rgeted vehicles heavy armor to turn into shrapnel making them much more deadly than traditional ied weapons dod officials report there were 69 ttacks utilizing efps in april 200713 the same type of efp device has been used by shiite or ganizations in leba non where hezbollah receives military support from iran howeve r iranian government officials deny involvement with any transfer of these weapons to iraq14 in addition us intelligence officials have reportedly said that most ied attacks against us forces in iraq come from sunni insurgents rather than from the shia elements most directly backed by iran15 over time the insurgents in iraq have adapted to many us countermeasures and seve ral dod officials have stated that

upgrade the washington post february 12 2007 p a1however the radio frequency rf spectrum in the iraq combat theater is largely not managed and counteried radio jammers can some times lock onto other us electronic combat systems because of lack of coordination of spectrum usage also unmanned aerial vehicles uavs can sometime s lose their radio control links due to groundbased radio interference caused by c ounteried jammers once they are far away from their control base therefore dod is now developing an electronic warfare coordination cell to help sort out problems that can impede friendly operations or endanger explosive ordnance teams as they disable ieds on the ground25 other counteried research involves fu sing large amounts of intelligence and surveillance data to monitor when and where bombs are planted using such data gathered by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs enemy bomb makers can be targeted before attacks can be launched sometimes the data can be played backward to see from where the bombers and vehicles came26 threat data about ieds is tightly controlle d by dod to avoid giving feedback to the enemy about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of diffe rent ied designs also proprietary rights must be protected for those companies who produce ied countermeasures however these cont rols may sometimes lim it access by other companies to important information about th effectiveness of antiied systems as they are tested or used in battle27 as result some industry fficials say they are not getting access to all the information they need to help them create the most effective new solutions to counter ieds and suggest that re laxing some of the controls might lead to more solutions28 however the jieddo has recognized this issue and is taking steps including modifying content on its website to improve access to information at the appropriate clearance levels29 acquisition and funding of countermeasures some us army units in iraq and afghanistan reportedly lack the latest humvee armor kits and the new deployment of five additional army brigades has added to that shortage30 humvees can be uparmored through rebuilding process that adds classified

defense appropriations act of 2008 where 500000000 was made available to the joint ied defeat fund until september 30 2010 the joint ied defeat fund allows dod to allocate funds where needed however unde r this legislation funds allocated for operating and administrative expenses are limited to not more than 110000000 and the office of the secretary of defense osd is required to submit plan to the defense committees explaining the intended manage ment and use of the amounts provided in september 2007 the senate co mmittee on appropriations recommended 1200 00000 in funding for the jie ddo
