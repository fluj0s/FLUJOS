reveals struggle with fm westerwelle on troop increase for afghanistan ref berlin 138 b berlin 112 classified by ambassador philip d murphy reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary defense minister zu guttenberg revealed in february 3 meeting with ambassador murphy that coalition partner fm westerwelle not the opposition social democratic party spd had been the single biggest obstacle to the government seeking bigger increase in german troops for afghanistan but even with the modest planned troop increase of 500 with 350 more in reserve zu guttenberg said restructuring of the current bundeswehr presence would allow germany to increase the number of soldiers involved in the training of afghan national army ana by more than 1000 while westerwelle has portrayed his skepticism about additional troops as principled it was also motivated by desire to put zu guttenberg in his place while the size of the troop increase is settled the length of the new isaf mandate remains open the government is hoping to have the new mandate approved by the bundestag before the end of february with significant if not majority support from the opposition spd and greens end summary westerwelle biggest obstacle 2 c in explaining the lowerthanexpected planned increase in the number of german troops for afghanistan zu guttenberg told the ambassador that westerwelles opening position in the coalition negotiations on the new mandate had been not one additional soldier in that context it had been difficult to get agreement on any increase at all comment zu guttenberg proposed 1500 additional troops at the initial january 4 minicabinet meeting on this issue end comment doing lot more with little more 3 c to help justify the need for more troops zu guttenberg said he had forced the bundeswehr to do complete review of all the existing positions in afghanistan which had confirmed that some could be eliminated in light of the new isaf counterinsurgency strategy he said restructuring of the current bundeswehr presence combined with the troop increase would boost the number of soldiers involved in the training of the afghan national army ana from 280 to 1400 the restructuring includes turning the battalionsize quick reaction force based in mazar into protection and training battalion second such battalion will be created in kunduz by augmenting the existing infantry company there with new troops zu guttenberg reiterated that germany strongly supports comisafs focus on protection of the population and partnering with the afghan national security forces ansf and that the german trainers ie the two new maneuver battalions will operate in the field with the ansf putting zu guttenberg in his place 4 c while zu guttenberg said he is avoiding public comment on whether the outcome of the coalition talks on the new mandate is victory for him or westerwelle fdp defense policy spokesman elke hoff told poloff separately that westerwelles hard line against additional troops had been motivated in part to teach zu guttenberg lesson she claimed that zu guttenberg had been too presumptuous last fall in making speeches in canada and the us about how germany would significantly increase its troop contribution to isaf he might have been able to get agreement on higher ceiling had he engaged parliamentarians first and showed greater respect for the political process open question length of the mandate 5 c zu guttenberg confirmed that the cabinet would formally agree on the proposed new isaf mandate february 9 and that the first reading in the bundestag would be february 10 fm westerwelle is scheduled to speak on behalf of the government in introducing the proposed mandate the government is aiming to hold the final bundestag vote on the mandate following two weeks of committee hearings on february 26 zu guttenberg was berlin 00000157 002 of 002 confident that large number if not majority of opposition politicians from the spd and greens would vote in favor of the new mandate 6 c february 2 meeting of state secretaries tentatively agreed that the new mandate should run as is the custom for one year expiring in february 2011 zu guttenberg indicated however that it might be preferable to stick to the length of the current mandate which expires in december 2010 he expressed concern that having the mandate lap over into early 2011 could lead to premature debate on withdrawal before the new strategy really had chance to work comment another option under consideration and favored by some in the chancellery is 18month mandate so that any debate on the future of the troop presence would be put off until the fall of 2011 but the mfa objects that this would only raise the ire of the opposition and give them an excuse to oppose the mandate end comment reassuring the germans on command of the north 7 c zu guttenberg confirmed that germany very much welcomed the planned inflow of us forces into the north especially the helicopter assets which filled longstanding shortfall he noted however that many in germany question whether the us will be willing to accept continued german leadership of rcnorth in view of the increased us presence ambassador murphy assured him that the us had issues working for the german command in the north murphy
