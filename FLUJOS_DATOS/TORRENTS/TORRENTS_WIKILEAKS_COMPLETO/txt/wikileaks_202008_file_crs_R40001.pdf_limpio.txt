climate change marked the progress of decades of scientific research toward conclusionswith uncertaintiesthat have remained remarkably stable in the years since greenhouse gas ghg1 emissions from human related activities are very likely causing the major portion of climate change observed in recent decades and if these continue could lead to potentially catastrophic impacts on human societies and their environment predicting the precise timing magnitude and implications of changes remains subject to variety of uncertainties many questions may not be resolvable in timeframe consistent with making effective and costeffective decisions to address the risks of climate change only concerted global action can stabilize ghg concentrations since emissions come from all countries china and the united states are now approximately tied as leading emitters of ghg although the united states historically has contributed morealmost onefifth of the rise of ghg concentrations in the atmosphere the greatest growth in ghg emissions is expected from countries such as china india and brazil that historically have contributed less now emit much less per person and have lower economic and governance capabilities to address the problem the core issues for negotiation in 1990 remain the same today when and by how much to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in order to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system 2 how to share common but differentiated responsibilities among countries taking into account respective capacities of different peoplein particular the acceptable degree of participation of developing countries what mechanisms are best suited to assuring ghg reductions by all parties at the lowest cost and while supporting sustainable economic development and the eradication of poverty how cooperatively to understand the risks and facilitate adaptation to climate changes especially by those least able to cope on their own and 1 greenhouse gases are defined in the united nations framework convention on climate change as those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere both natural and anthropo genic humandriven that absorb and reemit infrared radiation they may alter the composition of the atmosphere changing the balance of radiation entering and leaving the earth system and consequently change the temperature or patterns of climate on earth the most important is water vapor but it is believed not to be altered by human activities carbon dioxide co 2 is the most important human related ghg with about ¾ from fossil fuel use and about ¼ due to land use change and forestry other important gases listed under the kyoto protocol are methane ch 4 nitrous oxide n 2o hydrofluorocarbons hfc perfluorocarbons pfc and sulfur hexafluoride sf 6 additional greenhouse gases are partially controlled internationally under the montreal protocol of the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer including chlorofluorocarbons cfc and hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfc etc while others are emerging eg nitrogen trifluoride nf 3 other radiatively important substances are significant but difficult to treat similarly such as aerosols or tropospheric ozone 2 terms used particularly in association with the international climate change negotiations are frequently highlighted in italics in this document to

unfccc in rio janeiro brazil the united states was the fourth nation to ratify the unfccc and the first among industrialized countries as of november 2008 192 governments are parties to the unfccc as framework convention this treaty provides the structure for collaboration and evolution of efforts over decades as well as the first step in that collaboration the unfccc does not however include measurable and enforceable objectives and commitments 3 by the time the treaty entered into force and the conference of the parties cop met for the first time in 1995 the parties agreed that achieving the objective of the unfccc would require new and stronger ghg commitments though the berlin mandate deferred any new commitments for developing countries for future agreements the resulting 1997 accord the kyoto protocol pledged to reduce the net ghg emissions 4 of industrialized country parties annex i parties to 52 below 1990 levels in the period of 2008 to 2012 it also pledged to assess the adequacy of these commitments early in the new century g22g145g142g561g13g162g152g157g152g561g18g155g152g157g152g140g152g149g561 the united states signed the kyoto protocol in december 1997 however opposition in the us congress was strong in the byrdhagel resolution5 in july 1997 the senate expressed its opposition 950 vote to the terms of the berlin mandate by stating that the us should not sign any treaty that does not include specific scheduled commitments of nonannex i parties in the same compliance period as annex i parties or that might seriously harm the us economy the kyoto protocol kp was not submitted to the senate for ratification by president clinton nor by his successor president george w bush newly elected president bush announced in 2001 that the united states would oppose the agreement because it did not include ghg commitments by other large emitting developing countries and because of his conclusion that it would cause serious harm to the us economy as of 1 november 2008 183 governments had become parties to the kyoto protocol with the united states and kazakhstan 6 being the only industrialized countries to remain outside of the kyoto protoc ol in kp article 9 the parties to the kyoto 3 the commitment by industrialized parties to prepare national action plans aiming to reduce ghg emissions to 1990 levels is measurable but effective penalties or mechanisms were established to address any noncompliance with obligations 4 net emissions are the gross emissions minus the removals of ghg from the atmosphere by sinks sequestration particularly by growing forests and other vegetation or prevention of release of ghg by burning or decomposing vegetation 5 sres 98 6 kazakhstan is unusual in being considered an annex i party for the purposes of the

agreement by the end of 2009 at their 15 th meeting in copenhagen denmark the bali action plan does not provide for binding ghg commitments by nonannex i parties in april 2008 negotiators in bangkok agreed that the 2009 decision should include longterm ghg goals vision to be shared among all countries to stop growth of emissions in the next 10 to 15 years and to achieve large reductions by 2050 the key items for negotiation in an agreement to address climate change beyond 2012 are mitigation of climate change primarily to reduce ghg emissions or to enhance removals of carbon by forests and other vegetation sinks adaptation to impacts of climate change financial assistance to low income countries technology development and transfer and the shared vision for longterm goals and action four meetings in 2008 and four in 2009 were scheduled for an ambitious attempt to reach an agreement of some kind by the end of 2009 in poznan poland at the 14 th cop parties decided to shift into full negotiating mode and that first full negotiating text should be available for meeting in bonn in june 2009 to this end parties are expected to put forward their proposals as early in 2009 as possible in particular regarding specific targets for greenhouse gas reductions the meeting also ended with some bitterness in that it proved to be impossible to raise additional resources for adaptation
