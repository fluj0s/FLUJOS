studying introduction lecture given on 18 june 1964 thank you well im glad to see you too whats the time female voice june the 18th im getting so i think in terms of broader periods of time its quite amusing to but i notice the 16th took two or three days to go by and the 17th has taken two or three days to go by and now were on the 18th so this is 18 june ad 14 saint hill special briefing course the things are swinging along beautifully and its quite tribute this is not germane to the lecture the lecture is on something quite important but the lecture is about studying but its quite interesting that very rather indirect tribute can be paid to the auditing of saint hill students whove been through their lower materials and come on up to the co audit and so forth they have actually kept their pcs going over considerable quantity of bypassed charge that isnt said as gag you see its the truth see because the top of the reactive mind you see the top of gpm is the hardest thing to find out whats in it you havent been over this these humps and you probably wont have to be but just let give you this in passing the hardest thing in the world to find are the top items of gpm i dont know how many potential oppterms and terminals were discarded before the actual ones were found see its up oh i dont know the arrangements of that bank are almost uncountable you have at the moment perfect line plot thats why youre getting away with it but the top of bank you see the whole reactive mind would be equally hard to get to because the thetan is sitting on all that charge you see similarly the top of series you see would be the hardest thing to find the root words of dont you see and that is the scramble which has been going on before the thing was finally taped its very funny ive got the rest of the root words of the series you see they just run out like hot butter theres nothing to those but getting those exact top ones that was the tough one and in putting that material in exact lineup of course we had momentary stumbles on the line of exactly what was this thing of course you know you could have laid off and knocked off and not done any auditing on this you see for couple of years and let have run the whole bank out dont you see but you were running this danger is by the time ive run the whole bank out i might not be interested gag but it was considerable tribute to the fact that there was there was some missing elements there perfect line plot they started with didnt start with perfect one but had one within 24 hours and the materials pretty well lined up exactly how they went what the patterns were and that sort of thing this was pretty well ironed out but nevertheless nevertheless there were quantities of bypassed charge huge quantities such as co audit will ever face again you see and the auditors in the co audit actually were sufficiently smooth as auditors and so forth that their pcs just kept going along and they didnt have any big casualties or anything else now in the clumsiest look they would have killed somebody with that much charge see the clumsiest look and if their auditing had been the least bit crude and so on why those people would have just been flying apart at every joint you know there would have been arc breaks and rabble rouses and so forth and max mass exoduses and people checking out and you know i mean itd been itd been horrible because if you can see the amount of catastrophe caused by just missing one item and so forth well here they had whole series missing and yet they were auditing over the top of this and actually were making very nice gains and gave yesterday afternoon very beautiful series of reports everything was going along fine now by george thats pretty good auditing thats pretty doggone good auditing so i wish to give them compliment right now on the subject of their auditing they must be awful good all thats straightened out now and i imagine in todays sessions the cases just took off like rockets they must have gotten into the top of that other series and so forth and it just must have run swish in fact i never saw anything connect up with such reads as the as connecting up the missing element with what had been bypassed that really shot the lot rerunning it and connecting it up so the upshot of the situation was that i was very very pleased with that theyre making terrific progress and everybody is very very happy about this and very enthused about this and i get side note occasionally on letters going out of here and im not having to say this is it now this is it is very very calm statement compared to some of the statements ive heard going out of here on various lines and there isnt i dont think any doubt in anybodys mind who is in the co audit theyll eventually make it they may make it with only one leg or something like that theyre figuring at the present moment but theyll make it theyre on their way and the door is open wide open all right the situation with regard to auditing depends on another subject and that is subject called study if you cant learn anything why then you cant find out how to do anything so just as i talked to you in the last lecture and told you that communication was not an end all of processing but was absolutely vital if an auditor was ever going to get to pc to do something for him so it is true that study operates as the door open or closed to learning how to audit if an auditor cant learn anything then of course he wont be able to audit regardless of the attitude he has towards the human race or his wish to do something for people or his desires in any way shape or form these all would be barriered by just this one point he couldnt learn anything so in order to teach somebody how to audit its necessary that they be able to learn now this is terribly fundamental awful this is down there scraping the bottom of the barrel with regard to fundamentals and yet all great successes are built on attention to fundamentals everything is built on fundamental unless you can isolate these fundamentals you of course leave your building with with an incomplete foundation its sort of sitting in the air ever afterwards unless you find the fundamental with which to proceed you wouldnt build any skyscrapers if you didnt put down foundation well what is the foundation that foundation in auditing is of course study the ability to learn and failing that why an auditor has an awful hard time this next datum i am going to give you is something is something i really dont want you to park behind the left lobe and skip because this is going to make all the difference in the world to the future of scientology and that is knowledge of this one point this one point that better than 50 percent of scientology consists in the discipline of application consists in the technology of application consists in the know how of application and thats better than 50 percent of the subject better than 50 percent now perhaps that datum is not very impressive but let let amplify this and i think you will see how that datum is impressive you could give the entirety of the processes which have produced results in scientology and there are great big many of them you could give these in their entirety to field of mental practice carte blanche thats just the processes you understand just the commands and they wouldnt be able to do thing with them they wouldnt be able to get any result with them of any kind whatsoever they would turn out an asinine statement like the university of chicago its college thats what we used to say about it at gw we used to be tolerant about chicago most of us wanted to go there because you only had to go couple of years before they handed you sheepskin and we were bored but this outfit uttered this asinine statement we have tested all the techniques of dianetics and found out it didnt work well in the first place its asinine because all the techniques of dianetics didnt exist in published form and were not available to them to test see so right away that was nonsense for instance i know of techniques that were released at the first foundation in elizabeth which have never seen the light of day i have never seen them published or anything else matter of fact i saw three or four splinter groups suddenly start up on stuff that was merely designed to take care of one pc or something like that and then they decided that this would apply to all pcs and so forth there are several brands of therapy which are adrift today which simply consist of one technique developed for one pc at elizabeth so for any outfit for any outfit to grandly look down its nose and say we have tested all the techniques of dianetics you know well what statement see they havent got them to test how would they even know if they had tested all the techniques right away they are irresponsible and then to say they didnt work would also be asinine because if they had tested even sloppily they would have gotten some result someplace unless they were simply uttering publicity statement to protect the vested interest but that is aside from the point the point is simply this yes they could have had all the techniques they could have had them all they didnt but they could have and they could have in their haphazard bunged up way have tested these techniques and they wouldnt have worked because they didnt have dianeticist in the lot of them there was nobody there trained in the basic disciplines of dianetics and that was 50 percent or better of the technology which they might have gathered quite important dont you see now give you another one reg and i sailing around on the deep blue sea invented dreamed up course that was had nothing to do with scientology but had to do with business and commerce and nevertheless was very broad application of scientology to business and commerce but the course was for another reason entirely and reg thought this was good idea and he went ahead and he executed this course and this course has been marvelously successful its running i think at the present time and its doing fine you see only trouble is everybody else is now trying to get into the act its goodwill gesture all this course is is nice goodwill gesture its trying to increase the salesmanship and so forth of retail merchants and their clerks you see so as to move more equipment and that sort of thing see thats what the course is designed to do and everybody tried to get on the bandwagon you see there were other people started teaching this course teaching their own courses to accomplish the same end you see and recently some company or another requested that regs course be taught to all of their staff and so forth they get requests of this particular character but reg made the broad statement there that is particularly applicable to this lecture and so on he says well he says you dont have to worry about any competition or other people giving this course theyll start and theyll fail and so forth but they wont be able to duplicate the course well thats been the facts of the thing this course could go on they could quote teach similar courses do this do that do the other thing but of course they are always aware if only this that they are teaching substitute that they are not teaching the real one and people are always faintly aware of the fact that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship well this in itself you see enters enough even on the copyist in the way of an overt or something like this so that he then goes into an obsessive alter is and the statement that reg made was they cant duplicate it becomes completely true they cant and they wont duplicate it and that is the end of that and that these other courses have probably risen i dont know what the history of this i havent kept up with it too well but i think there are other courses have risen up and faded away by this time and lot of enthusiasm has been generated in this quarter or that on duplicating this course and i think this course is still going on very successful probably one of the more delicate goodwill gestures thats been entered into by company for long time well of course one of the reasons its successful its somewhat oriented scientologically but that course wouldnt be duplicated and therefore wouldnt be tremendously successful now supposing they taught the exact same methods that is they used the technique or something on these other courses that are being taught which are copy courses of this course you see supposing they did that and so on there would still be some element missing of some kind or another that element would be the missing thing that would make the course that was being taught fail i dont wish to belabor that particular simile but it is merely interesting it is merely interesting that even there even there on such thing as simply teaching some salesmen how to be nice to their customers and that sort of thing that this thing too fails when you move it out of its own perimeter of discipline so even on thing as slight as that you see that one fails too and so it goes along the line i dont know how much technology university loses because every professor makes 90 percent of his salary by making the students buy his personal books i think by the time youve rewritten james watt i think youve lost steam engines and its highly probable that there probably isnt steam engineer in the world today that has really got the technology of steam it has been perverted and twisted aside and misduplicated and so on and i go back to some of these old boys that knew their business and so on one time i was covering an air meet and there was fellow standing there it was bright sunshiny day and he was standing there with rubbers on and an umbrella the umbrella wasnt unfurled but he had that umbrella handy it was beautiful midsummer day you see and i wondered what this character was doing at an air meet all these daredevil racing pilots and that sort of thing around and i was covering this thing for the sportsman pilot but i thought this was good side color so i surreptitiously took shot at him with my press camera and got his name his name was young and he was the second man in the world beyond the wrights to fly he was probably one of the most famous early birds there was my face was little bit red you see he had become cautious in his old age but in his day i imagine his caution still didnt extend to flight but in his day they used to fly plane off the ground with an ambulance running along below it thats right they saved more pilots that way this was man who was wild man along this particular line well i was very interested in talking to him i did an article on him eventually and he showed his scrapbooks and so on and i was particularly fascinated that there were 13 methods of flight heavier than air methods of flight 13 of them of which the motionless wing was only one and by the way one of the less favored ones and one of the reasons it was favored was because at all or done at all is because it didnt take much mechanical ingenuity to build it but there were twelve other methods of heavier than air flight heavier than air thats not ballooning or zeppelins theres all kinds of methods of keeping aircraft aloft theres the principle of the rotating stick that if you throw stick in certain way itll hum spinning you know itll hum and you will see it curve straight up into the air itll do the darnedest ascendancy and thats just rotating stick there is method after method of flight of this particular character because they concentrated on the one wing it won see and you now have aircraft all over the world which are going along with this stiff wing out there from the fuselage mostly because the early birds didnt have any of the wherewithal or anything else to build something little more esoteric or different so it got the concentration of research and that is what we now call an airplane but it was interesting listening to old mr young who was designing these things back when it was very interesting to listen to him on tone of disappointment that they had chosen that particular one to push forward in research because it was one of the less workable and one of the less efficient here was this vast body of technology see which had never been developed and which is lost back there in the first ten years of this century all kinds of methods of flight none of them ever went forward well this one that was easy to do did get developed well its very interesting that one of them emerged and went forward thats probably the one thing one should look at but it is customary almost in civilizations for body of knowledge to come into being then get grooved into certain specialization some piece of it dont you see then that piece of it poorly duplicated and the rest of the technology to be lost boy would i like to talk to james watt on the subject of steam engines he probably could tell you all about high pressure boilers see he just didnt have the time money materials to build one but maybe there were dozens of methods of utilization of steam which have just been lost you see what youre studying now is lost technology lost technology now you say the civilization goes forward and wins anyway well may i invite you to go almost in any direction from where you are at this moment at saint hill for distance of ten or twelve miles and try not to find the remains of civilizations which did not win they are all over the place here civilizations that are dead civilizations that are missing civilizations that longer are with us they are all on the basis of lost technology they start specializing in one gimmick theres nothing to amplify that gimmick they finally lose the pieces of it and it vanishes the civilization may be very well dependent upon that one gimmick they have nothing to back it up they lose it in other words fascinating the changes and turns and twists that these things take now you could say lot of other things about these civilizations but the only thing i am pointing out at the moment is theyre not here see theyre not present we dont have them with us and they were good civilizations as they went the roman briton civilization the danish civilization that was here the saxon civilization here all these things terribly different the norman civilization that was here theyre all over the shop how about the celtic civilization that existed before must have been quite civilization you read casually about wicker chariots charging through the ashdown forest whats this wicker chariots charging through the ashdown forest well our good friend caesar reports as such well this civilization has went we know nothing about this civilization it must have been pretty well advanced and yet the scene of this battle and so forth is within about ten miles of saint hill well where did that civilization go what was it all about thats pretty esoteric civilization wicker chariots see maybe some somebody forgot how to weave wicker who knows what happened to that civilization see now the situation here is that technology gets lost and we have to study how it gets lost and its gets lost because people cant study thats really the only reason it gets lost thats quite quite an interesting fundamental to reduce everything down to that particular fundamental we dont then go into the esoterics of they couldnt duplicate and they couldnt this but thats only why they couldnt study civilizations tend to rise forward to certain peak and then under the stress of combat and the various elements and so forth they start losing their technology well they lose their technology simply because nobody studies the technology how about this fellow the silversmith of england englands longer today turning out the silver it once turned out its silver craftsmen used to be very very famous and then they got labour government and it put the tax up on silver to point where british silver longer could be sold they might as well have stood the british silversmith up against the wall and shot him because he drifted off then into other trades and the technology became lost and its practically lost technology at this moment now this has only been lost in the last decade or so youd have to talk hard to to jewelry store managers and that sort of thing before you understand why it is that you cant buy silver you can buy antique silver you can buy yesteryears silver there are two or three of them still in business and so forth well what about these fellows there are fellows around who learned this and there are plenty of textbooks on this subject and that technology still exists but its going to be lost thats for sure its going to be lost how about the one old craftsman who is left in the plant you see he knows all about that hes surrounded by people and all of sudden there might be resurgence in that well everybody merely depends on him they dont learn the craft you see they simply depend on him to know it it all comes up against the dead end of not being able to learn not being able to study well i always prided myself in being very quick study so i myself can speak from fair expertness in this particular line but i know my own history on this and i know my own blind spots on this when you become less worried about your mental status or something like this in the world you can actually look at it and find out if there is anything wrong with it and dare admit that it could stand few improvements here and there one of the things about study itself is that there are great many things around that are false and you could study lot of false things and therefore become disabused of studying because you had studied something false this would be one of the reasons why you might cease to study i really dont see that that has anything to do with it except that it enters the idea of judgment of what youre studying so if one studied without any judgment whatsoever of what he was studying or ability to evaluate what he was studying or know what he was studying why his ability to study would be very poor indeed hed just be chinese in aspect nothing wrong with the chinese but i remember going to school the eighth grade i think i spent some months going through grammar school all on different stations and places and the situation that arose in the eighth grade was that nobody could get an mark except two chinese who were in the school and they had they had learned how to study but so have parrots learned how to study if that is their study and they would get up and they would reel off the page number and the paragraph and everything else of the history book assignments you see and theyd give it to you verbatim most marvelous job of total duplication you ever heard of but they would not be able to tell you what universe and if you had if you had varied one comma or asked for an opinion on that material studied in that way they would have come cropper at once and very frequently did they would have to remember whether it was in the middle of the book or the back of the book as to what period that it applied to or something like this most marvelous job of carbon copy duplication that i ever saw and it used to irk the rest of us you see because they would always get plus and it held up such horrible example to the teacher that the teacher would of course then give nothing like an plus to any mere knowledge of the subject you see so our renditions of it were quite rapidly thrown away and we usually got d ill never forgive them but anyway joking aside these this is this is case of perfect perfect complete perfect duplication without grain of sense connected with it and thats absolutely deadly so that isnt how you study deadly but perhaps you should be able to do that but i would consider that mental feat and i dont think study has anything to do with mental feats study has to do with understanding study has to do basic and most formally with just really one thing willingness to know thats the first little gate that has to be opened to embark upon study willingness to know if that gate remains closed then youre liable to get into such things as the total verbatim rote system you are liable to get into all kinds of other systems none of which will add up to any knowledge now when you recognize that in scientology we have one thing one thing which is not very easy to put into texts and which may never be put into texts the discipline of how you do it but when you recognize that that one thing actually is difficult to transmit in by the written word and is very easy to transmit by example and when i call your attention to an earlier part of this lecture when i said that it amounted to at least 50 percent of what we were doing and ill point out to you that theres frailty involved in the relay of this information thats the future success of scientology and that frailty is right there it could very easily very easily become an unworkable subject you could take all the gpms in the world what do you think would happen if you took all the gpms and the total map of the bank and everything exactly right and gave it at this moment to psychiatry i know what theyd do they would immediately analyze poe to see how many times one of these words had occurred in one of his books and then get the fractional recurrence of and then try to explain why poe was mad or something like this dont you see this is probably what theyd do with this material itd be monkey tricks you know i even thought vengefully one day of sending all of the whole plot to the american journal of psychology which by the way would absolutely fall on its face and bound its forehead to flinders if i were to give them an article thats one of the reasons why theyre little bit mad at us i have been soundly berated by them for not publishing it with them at least one of our case histories because it would revolutionize all you see it cant revolutionize anything unless published in their magazine ive been scolded by them for this but i thought vengefully of just giving them the whole plot and let them publish it see and that would eliminate that but the point the point im making here is that all of this technology that can be written down and so forth could be relayed with the same result of the university of chicago result see because it has this element missing from it the discipline of how you do it now when i tell you that an auditor can get so good that gross bypassed charge exists in session and his auditing is sufficiently smooth that nowhere and on student in that co audit did it get keyed in wow see this is an almost impossible auditing feat thats walking around the edges of the lions cage you see so neatly and adroitly that there didnt even have to be bars there this is pretty terrific see well what did that thats auditing discipline thats the communication formula thats this this is handling the meter this is what you do with pc and what you dont do with pc and so forth this is omitting from the auditing sessions the things that mary sue comes down as gaes on on wednesdays on tv demos weeding these things out keeping that line straight over 50 percent of it we must at this particular time then do this rather superlatively well here at saint hill because if any serious goof existed on the part of any of those auditors in the co audit any such consistent gae as we see when person first arrives here he would have just wound his pc up in pile of junk because there was enough there to have jammed the pc into pancake against the brick wall see there wasnt any slight bypassed charge to be triggered see they werent even aware of the fact that it was there and they were auditing around it sufficiently smoothly that it didnt cave anybody in well now on the reverse side of the coin on the reverse side of the coin if they had had all of their materials absolutely perfect right at the outset and if their auditing discipline their ability to audit had been as poor as it might have been with all the materials and technology perfect and the process being done they would have turned their pc into pale pink pancake up against the brick wall do you understand thats the other side of the coin now if you appreciate that you can appreciate the remark i make when i tell you that the technique is one thing but the way it is applied is what makes the car go down the road and that thing is the most likely thing to get lost so therefore were in business as long as an auditor can learn how to audit you see you dont have to learn anything actually to run gpms you can be handed it on cards did you you realize this you could probably be handed it on cards and you could reel it off one way or the other in some kind of patter you wouldnt even have to learn it you know you could just let it sort of go off water like the goes off the ducks back you see you could parrot it you see from from list or card or something like this you wouldnt have to be learned youre not up against learning in that burrow in fact if i ever hear of an instructor making some new student memorize line plot so that he can run it better ill give him gae with exclamation points the instructor see that would be the most gruesome thing so actually in that particular case the technology is not something you would learn you wouldnt even learn the whats called the technique you wouldnt dare itd just kill the student thatd be it if you ever have have find yourself bird dogged by spy from the federal i dont want to be pardon id there are ladies present why just decide that he had better learn by heart dont even pick out anything very rough just give him one of the helatrobus line plots and tell him well he has to start in by learning that by heart so therefore when i am talking to you about learning were practically not on the subject of technology at all we know what grade certain technology belongs in and so forth but i do it myself very often write the process out rapidly below the meter so that i can put my pencil lets say its multiple question i dont want to involve my wits which should be involved with auditing with remembering what question the pc is stumbling along on i dont want to involve my wits with that so ill just write down the four or five commands or whatever the thing is in rotation and just stab the one with my pencil that is currently in action you know and when i come to the next one why i see that all is well and i look down at the paper and refresh my memory of the thing and give it to him again dont you see well that leaves free to audit has nothing to do with that in fact theres tricks like youre running multiple alternate question and so forth your positive is your index finger and the negative is the middle finger and so forth and just touch them with your thumb touch the positive question youre on the positive question well your thumb is on your index finger negative question your thumb is on your middle finger and so on you dont get mixed up that way and you dont mix up the pc either nor do you have to sit there saying now let see what am i now you know thats for the birds so frankly aside from classifying and know where the technology goes i wouldnt say there is anything to learn in that zone at all youre not going to learn auditing commands you know what type of command should be there youre going to learn that but not the command youre not going to learn line plots or gpms or something like that well this changes the complete complexion of what what what are we supposed to learn then what what learning is he talking about im talking now about learning how to do it how to apply it see thats what im talking about well its quite fascinating that theres many guy shows up he just wants couple of processes so that he can learn these processes and so on and then he thinks hes educated and he can go on his way because he knows he can apply those and then somehow or another they never seem to work for him and hes always missing as to why theyre not working for him well what he should be learning is the subject of auditing bulletins connected with good indicators bulletins connected with comm cycles and this type of thing what are the tools of the trade here where whats the categories of these tools and so on and how are they applied and what judgment do you use in connection with them learn those well enough so youre relaxed about them now thats something to learn and yet i guarantee you that that consistently will get brushed off lightly in comparison to some gimmick or trick or process see the person in other words will be very happy to learn what are the auditing commands for something or other but have nothing whatsoever to do with comm cycle now comm cycle takes some learning man as you know you cant even glibly say well it blah blah blah blah blah and it starts and continues and it finishes and and thats all there is to comm cycle and now we know all that all right now whats the auditing command you see thats whats important thats not whats important the auditing command wont work unless you arrive unless it arrives with the pc and its got to arrive with the pc along with certain how do you do it how do you act like an auditor how do you sound like an auditor thats the stuff thats the stuff that gets it there now i had recent experience which is quite amusing i have my lighter moments and i decided that i had better make an independent study theres sense in getting too concentrated on any one particular point and i was going along like shot rocket in the direction of class vi materials and working on them very hard and very concentrated and that sort of thing but i didnt figure that was going to keep my mind that involved i find i felt i might as well take up another subject which was entirely independent you know give nice shift of attention so some years ago i had incautiously and in moment of weakness bought course of photography of course ive been at photography since i was kid nice hobby and i have lot of fun with it and so forth and at one time or another why ive sold pictures and so on its just one of these hobbyist things that you fool with id probably classify as an advanced amateur one time i classified as pro when i was in college used to make lot of money national geographic and so forth i think theres some geography books around that still carry pictures of mine in them but the upshot of it is that i decided that in view of the fact that my mind was very heavily in this direction i might as well put it in another direction so i took up this correspondence course in photography the new york institute of photography one of the best and rolled up my sleeves and found out id never gotten deeper than about the third lesson so i decided i would learn little bit about study and i would start and study this thing up and i would get myself pushed along the line and get all my lessons done like good boy and send it all in lesson by lesson you know well what do you know what do you know first time in my life i learned something about studying i learned something very subjectively and very real about studying the only reason im telling you this is not to amuse you particularly but you might be able to use this and its just this i began to wonder why i had stopped at the third lesson i was tolerantly going on forward studying the remaining lessons and so forth but why had i stopped at the third lesson and why was i bogging here and there along the line because this was not going easy now of course this is very very wild occasionally very dry very often very stupid subject the subject of photography because it gets into optics well you want to take picture not study optics you see but optics are apparently something that people who want you to know about photography hold very dear to their hearts and they nag you about you see and then theres the subject of chemistry and chemistry is very interesting there are numbers of chemicals and they have something to do with the picture appearing on the thing but thats something you really dont know too much about if you can walk into darkroom and turn yourself out good negative and good print who the devil wants to know anything about chemistry dont you see this was more or less my attitude but i went on studying like good boy and passing my examinations at the end every booklet has an examination and all of sudden it dawned on that although id been interested in this since i was 12 years old i didnt know anything about it horrible dark thought ive taken pictures ive published pictures people have paid good cash money on the line my pictures have been on covers of magazines very slick fellow and i dont know anything about this subject it struck like thunderbolt this is subject i had been at if you please since i was 12 in this lifetime and i suddenly realized i didnt know anything about it and it wasnt case of sudden amnesia or something it was just you what you know and its its which and i suddenly rapidly reviewed what my reactions had been and made very careful analysis of the whole thing and exactly what had happened id had particularly great subjective reality on this i was studying an allied subject i was forcing all of you to study i should know something about the subject of study and so i had more or less to some degree started out to learn something about study and i learned something right then the tolerance that i had toward them had brought up to point where i was perfectly willing to learn few gimmicks from them and that was the state of mind i had entered that course upon i was perfectly willing to learn few gimmicks from them i realized that my arrogance on the subject has absolutely unprintably unspeakable my arrogance was absolutely fantastic but look ive been at it since i was 12 i studied photography under some of the some of the old boys that were kicking around at that time some of the government photographers and scientists up in the national museum were patient enough to teach about photography i read books on the subject read this and that even worked in professional darkrooms and the evidence was right in front of my face good heavens people pay you money for pictures i used to take pictures for underwood and underwood and i had always said that the trouble with my photography as i came on up the line i had it all beautifully explained the trouble with my photography as i came on up the line was they kept changing their methods i had it beautifully explained so therefore well actually since i started photography miniature cameras have come out panchromatic film different types of developers flashbulbs have come out theyve changed all these things as matter of fact theyre changing one on right now i had one film made by ilford so tame that i could turn out fine grain negative on this stuff and they went and changed the speed rating of the film now you cant get the old film so i dont know how to do it now i was this was blame on my part you see they kept shifting materials on and what had dawned on is what i was being struck with in these texts because this is good professional course see this is nothing for any amateur what i was being struck with in the text was known by mathew brady in the american civil war the basics and fundamentals that i didnt know had been present in that subject since 1860 had nothing to do with changing materials i didnt know the first fundamental of why the picture got took in the first place and all of sudden at that moment it dawned on with tremendous crash that i had been very arrogant and that i really didnt know all there was to know under the sun moon and stars on the subject of photography i really wasnt the worlds past master on the subject of photography because i had gotten few results in my day but that there was something there to learn thats what i was struck with and boy i buckled down and started to study now the speed of advance is very interesting three books in three and half years eight books in two weeks and one is prior to that realization and the other is post that realization i suddenly looked at it last night and realized i was halfway through the course three and half years it took to get the first three of the fifty some books that comprise the course why was i unable to move through that well i was studying something i knew all about i could not bring myself into relaxed frame of mind of here is something to study lets study it i was studying it through this screen i know all about this i know everything there is to know about it well will you please tell why the devil i was sitting there studying it then if i knew all about it why was i sitting there studying it and yet i was putting up this pretense of studying it i was even pretending to myself i was studying it i didnt realize that i was pretending i thought i was really studying it you see id read it you know and so on but it was all from the viewpoint that i knew all about it and my arrogance was such that i was perfectly willing to learn few tricks from them and i think that was very tolerant of now the funny part of that is in subsequent study and so forth my whole viewpoint has shifted on the subject the whole viewpoint of what im willing to take picture of and my critical standards of whats good picture have shifted utterly im even criticizing their examples of perfect pictures see very critical but very well founded criticism i couldnt learn because i knew all that i knew all about it you see now that passed from realization that i didnt really know thing about it i had to get right back to fundamentals and study those fundamentals once i got those fundamentals in and had those fundamentals well studied and so on and moving along the line up there then i got to point where i was not only perfectly willing to learn i was also perfectly willing to talk back i wasnt in any slavish state about learning i knew my fundamentals now i could see where they applied and so forth and within the scope and limits of that educational course was able to talk up in other words i could have an opinion i could now have an opinion i could exert judgment i had judgment on the subject before i merely had some fixed ideas just fixed ideas and these fixed ideas told that i really knew all was to know about the subject when i finally found out the big breakthrough was i found out there was something there to learn that i didnt know it wasnt matter of few gimmicks then this reversed around the other way and with hard study all of sudden made another breakthrough i freed my own judgment id talk to any of these birds now there are texts there by some very famous photographers good hard tough slugging this thing is but one of those guys id say ah come off of it you know youre talking like this but this picture here man i how come look youve burned out all of the this would have been legitimate he would have talked to about it too id say look there youve burned out all of the highlights you just burned them right straight through why you might even have at least remedied it in the darkroom for heavens sakes and he would have said well i didnt think anybody would notice id say well i noticed critical not that criticism is bad dont you see but i developed critical eye did not have to slavishly say this is picture by sam falk new york times magazine one of the greatest exhibition photographers of all time therefore it is holy see gone completely through that and up to point of where thats an awful good picture that guy really has good sense of composition terrific sense of composition what the hell was he doing that day in the darkroom drunk see what i mean and i could have put my point finger on point which im sure that sam falk himself would have agreed with hed say thats right i didnt even hold back the enlarger light on that burned off highlight over at the side and it completely washes out that birds features over there thats right youre right attracts the eye over to the side of the picture not to the principle subject youre right could have been improved could have been improved in the darkroom he wouldnt have argued about it or he could have said to you dont know how bad the negative is you see what i mean then this would have been sensible discussion because in the meantime by burning the midnight dawn actually ive been using this to go to sleep on but the point had come up here where ones fixed slavishness to something was there because one really didnt understand it in the first place so he had to have fixed opinions to safeguard himself perspective perspective is handled by making something dwindle into the distance well there is if i dont have something go dwindle into the distance the picture wont have perspective you know this kind of slavish fixed idea on the subject of perspective not there are lot of ways to give pictures three dimensional effect see thatd do you different point of view see and perspective is accomplished in several ways different viewpoint see then once you understand that then you can look at picture and say well that photographer had good command of perspective or he didnt see you say this guy had stepped over here another couple of feet to take his picture he probably would have had different depth and it would have looked lot better see because look heres couple of advantages he could have taken that he didnt take in other words you have flexibility you have flexibility of route so therefore you can have an opinion not fixed idea or prejudice theres big difference between prejudiced or fixed idea and the ability to have an opinion an opinion could be based on many things but when an opinion is based on an inability to find out what it was all about in the first place man looks like fool and he suddenly looks like fool even to himself when he makes breakthrough so that my ideas on the subject of photography were not resulting in finished picture thats one of the first things i suddenly recognized you know the lightning struck that was not necessarily what broke down on the line id broke it down before that but i recognized that afterwards well guys as good as he can finish picture it doesnt have anything to do with anything else it obviously can be done so therefore why there it is and this also included overshooting the mark which you might find interesting previous to this breakthrough i made and the realization that i didnt know what the devil i was doing when i took camera i know how to clean lenses and do all sorts of things but i didnt know what i was doing when i picked up camera i mean it was just ridiculous to even think that i did few lucky breaks you know and you seem to be so hot but what about this its bum day and you want to get picture and if youre real shaky and you dont know your business and so forth you say well its bum day thats one day i dont get picture see well if you really knew your camera you wouldnt pay any attention to the fact that it was bum day youd say oh yeah well all right bangbang what do we want the effect here bright sunlight good bang boom youd say thats kind of interesting awful foggy out there well lets make the fog little bit worse and lets get it real spooky looking picture see if you knew your business then you could turn the tool to your advantage any which direction you could see you werent the victim of everything that occurred you werent the victim of every little splinter on the road see well its too bad day the suns not out and oh well take that picture tomorrow or some other day when the weather is nicer you know well whats whats this you mean this can this can exist to such big goof that you dont get picture at all then how do you like this and yet guy would not be able who couldnt say all right lets see pick up camera and take picture see hes supposed to get picture well he should know his subject well enough that he can get picture thats fairly easy all hes got to do is put himself in the vicinity of what hes trying to take picture of if he knew his tools real well if he knew his darkroom technique real well hed p hed get picture see hed get very acceptable picture now the degree of picture that you would get depends lot on practice and that sort of thing so i learned that lesson too in big way that the conditions of the activity around did not necessarily monitor whether or not i got result or not pc nattery today therefore we couldnt get much auditing done what the hell are you an auditor or arent you see i mean thats it nattery pc snattery pc who cares youre going in to do session well do session so it takes you little bit longer to get the session wheeling well get it wheeling thats the difference dont you see but these are the things i learned through this little side study and it was i found it myself very interesting to pick up completely alien subject to what we are doing it had been lying around for quite while it merely exists in the field of hobby and find all kinds of applicable materials on the subject of study and to find out that the first thing that barriers learning is the consideration that you know all about it and if you want to build up ridge on the subject of learning man thats it just consider you know all there is to know about it and the next thing the next thing is dont let your idea of what you know this is most amusing dont let your idea of what you know get contaminated in any way by the fact that youre not producing youre not getting any result see youre not getting any result and this is quite rather obvious to you that youre not getting result but this doesnt challenge for moment the idea that you know see yeah this never causes you to question it for an instant see youre not getting result you know that you know and the fact that youre not getting result doesnt challenge your conviction that you know the other thing is the fixed the idea of the fixed opinion one has to have certain fixed opinions to protect the fact that hes stupid on the subject and that he can exercise judgment of any kind whatsoever as long as hes mired down in bunch of fixed opinions and that afterwards that judgment then depends on freedom from fixed opinions and an actuality of of good assessment you know what you know you know what you dont know see you know what you know you know what you dont know in other words youre not fighting this chimerical thing youre not protecting your nebulous reputation to yourself about how wise and how marvelous you are youre relaxed on this subject you see you can say well theres one section of this i dont know anything about have to look into it some day but at the same time this doesnt bring you into feeling that you dont know what you do know utilization of judgment then depends on very thorough knowledge of subject and if you havent got judgment on subject why its because you dont know the subject thats just that if you find your judgment is very often false or bad in some line well you must realize that this signals to you in some way or another that this maybe you dont know all there is to know about this certain situation see if your judgment on it was bad why it must have been bad because of an absence of knowledge of the subject so what it boils down to what it boils down to is an auditors ability to learn depends not necessarily on his saying how stupid he is but depends certainly on willingness to learn just willingness to learn hes willing to learn and so forth and the biggest single barrier is preconception that he knows that is not attended by any singular result for instance lets hear remark something like this well i i know scientology ive studied scientology long time and i know it very well in fact i audit very well of course i dont get very good results well this is that thing same thing in nutshell this the fact that he isnt getting results results can be gotten hes heard of these things hes seen them around and so on results can be gotten but this fact does not at all challenge his implicit confidence that he knows all there is to know on the subject you see doesnt challenge him for an instant well of course thats just lack of perceptiveness fellow cant see hes not capable of judgment with regard to his own skill his judgment then with regard to what hes doing is at fault to that gross error he is uttering the fact that black is white he cant do it yet he knows all about it he knows all there is to know about doing it yet he cant do it well thats silly statement and that is the lowest ebb of judgment on any one particular subject you get into you can get into an area of examination of this sort of thing you find out that nearly everyone is put up in some particular sectors to status status has an awful lot to do with this you know and he gets pushed up into feeling like he has to protect his own status by certain arrogance or pretense even to himself he has to think well of himself dont you see by pretending that he knows something or appearing very clever to himself or so forth hes really really you can head it under the heading of self esteem one of the methods of bolstering self esteem nothing particular wrong with this im pointing this out in very mild way its necessary that an individual feel somewhat confident in some direction but its also very interesting that this need for status and self esteem evaporates in the presence of real knowledge and real esteem takes its place and its that real esteem which is most impressive to self and to others because its producing results the competence there is argument with competence argument with it at all it doesnt then really come down to test of what does person know but it comes down to test of what can person do and if you just adjudicate this on the basis of its not well psychiatry should serve as wonderful example to you in this man i hate to run these boys down because they are being kicked to pieces anyhow but let tell you i have never been as surprised over things as i have been by that particular crew its not that im even terribly fascinated with what theyre doing but do you know i read one time what an examination for diplomate in psychiatry consisted of and do you know it only consisted of the date and the context and title and the place of publication of freuds lectures not what was in them not what could you do in the field of psychiatry but it was just that when was the lecture given what was its title dont you see and what publication did it appear in and thats an examination for diplomate the highest degree in psychiatry oh some psychiatrist will come along because theyre always trying to make liar out of everybody they come along and tell oh thats not true thats not true thats not true and you say theyre doing this down in melbourne right now oh thats not true thats not true thats not true and well he doesnt really know anything about psychoanalysis and so forth well does psychoanalysis assert that sex is the basic mainspring of life well yes well does the article say this yes well is that true about psychoanalysis well yes but you see hubbard doesnt know anything about psychoanalysis well what doesnt he know about psychoanalysis see oh well he wouldnt know anything about it because he just wouldnt know anything about it and so forth well what psychoanalysis are you talking well we dont know there 9 s various brands of psychoanalysis you always would get into this kind of an argument its something like walking into swamp when you when you try to talk on this particular subject you see so its not very sensible well im just pointing out to you that that is really pure idiocy thats really pure idiocy one could you learn anything from that lecture and two how have you been able to apply it and three if the fellow really knew about it hed be able to answer the next question if he really knew up to this point hed be able to answer the next question well what opinion do you have of it what opinion do you have of that subject matter see if he really if he really knew the subject and hed studied that and he really knew that and he could apply that and so forth then hed have free opinion on it he wouldnt have to be protecting himself with his free opinions see itd have nothing to do with esteem or anything else hed just have free opinion on the subject you see in other words hed have judgment but if you fix it on give us the lecture and the date and where was it published and thats all you have to know about it you know you of course have taught the man nothing more than you could learn from card catalog system well it doesnt have anything to do with doingness well in photography which ive just used as somewhat amusing sidelight to this to you the test of course is whether or not you can get picture that seems rather obvious doesnt it that would be its different than in well you conclude photography now is an art which is interesting because its only graduated into that field very recently metropolitan museum and so forth has exhibits on it now as fine art but didnt used to be now critic could exist in the field of painting merely through his knowledge of painters and paintings and that sort of thing and he could have opinions on the subject these things would probably be very basic and thats all very fine because heres very wide very complex field and maybe you could have critic in the field of photography who didnt really have to be able to produce picture maybe he could just criticize pictures and maybe to very good extent but the odd part of it is as you enter into technical subject out of purely artistic subject this burning question comes up how the devil would he know whether or not that was good darkroom piece of work he would have to be able to know what can be done in darkroom so hed have to answer the question what is done in darkroom is this better than what is done in darkroom or worse than what is done in darkroom because youre up against this technical fact technical fact intrudes here unlike art you can take handful of mud and throw it at rock and say thats great painting see well maybe it does have form and design who would know because there is real technical backup with regard to art at large its great great wide huge subject you see depending on mostly on whether person is pleased or displeased with some form color object or significance it basically forms an opinion anyhow but the second that you get into technical fact when you get into the technical line well you have to know what can be done you have to know if it is done well what is being done and what isnt being done see this then you would have to know pretty well before you could have much of an opinion on the subject in other words there could be an art critic quite legitimately but i dont think there could actually be photographic critic who didnt really know his photography see hed have to know his photography to be be critic of it because hed have to know what the devil to compare it to and actually there wouldnt be any auditing critic who couldnt audit you couldnt criticize auditing if you couldnt audit youd have to know what could be done and what couldnt be done i think anybody thats been over the jumps of the co audit here recently and so forth hed be quite critic of auditing not on basis of my giving an examination and finding out what he knows about auditing but just on the basis of the trial and error of just the last two or three weeks i give you that as very broad test man i dont think there ever again will be such test never again probably wont be that much bypassed charge you see but thats terrific test wasnt given to them willingly or anything of that sort it just occurred that way what fantastic test those people must really know how to audit see thats the test because under similar circumstances you arc break pc on itsa oh you get the comparison very simple you see well god all you have to do is drop toothpick in r6 and you arc break one that must be pretty smooth now i dont think theres anybody doubts in anybodys mind in r6 that they arent going places and that the technology in running gpms isnt doing some fantastic things one way or the other for pcs and so forth the result is being produced the result is being produced smoothly itll of course be produced much more smoothly and much more rapidly as matter of fact with the top of the bank being cut into exactly correctly but even with that its producing results see all right then that tells you that there must be an awful difference between level vi co audit auditor and somebody who would arc break pc on itsa but im willing to make you bet that the auditor now in level vi co audit asked for an opinion of auditing would probably give you very honest offhand very certain very firm opinion boppety boppety boppety bop you ask him something about well is that persons auditing good or bad or so forth or was that proper way to do it and so forth hell give you quite an opinion see boppety boppety bop wouldnt be any status connected with it see hed just give you an honest opinion on the subject you see and you ask this person that can arc break pc on itsa for an opinion hed give you couple of fixed data but he wouldnt be able to give you much of an honest opinion something else that would be different something else that would be different ill just bet you that person in the level vi co audit at the present moment you gave him something to study and so forth he could find out what was there and know what knowledge was there without questioning whether or not it was good bad or indifferent that he learn it or whether or not it was damaging for him to learn it or whether or not it was this or that or whether or not he knew all about it you wouldnt run into much of that argument but the person who would arc break person on itsa dont challenge that arrogance man he knows all there is to know about it he has known all there is to know about it from the beginning he will notice all knows all there is that will ever be known about it he knows all this perfectly and he would be deeply insulted if you even inferred there was something on the subject that he didnt know do you see there would be this significant difference if you asked him at the same time if he was willing to learn about it well hed hedge of course he isnt he isnt willing to learn about it hes on the false premise that he knows all about it well you want to ask him well what are you there for why are you studying it then if you know all about it this might shake him up but you only really have to shake up this point in that auditor he isnt being bad hes merely being arrogant he lacks the humility of vast wisdom and in its place he has the arrogance of know it all when he knows nothing he doesnt even know what he doesnt know and theres the gates of study theyre right there thats the gate of study thats the gate you got to crack thats the one you got to kick down before you walk any road in toward any subject and i dont care whether that subject is auditing or photography i think you would hold it would hold good uniformly and straight through and so forth so ive been over the jumps on completely alien and different subject and i have found certain things held true and i compared them to the experiences ive had in trying to relay interpret or teach scientology and so forth and ive found that they held good ive found out that they held good straight through i can give you dozens of case histories and i cant really give you lot of exceptions outside of this field and i can even tell you you say well theres the case of the fellow who cant see and doesnt know the language and that sort of thing i dont know whats the matter with him that he cant see and doesnt know the language he must be arrogant indeed very very funny but youll find that that would hold good too if you dont believe it talk to field mouse some day talk to field mouse about the ways of man it might be very entertaining conversation if you could talk to him and there man you would find arrogance electronics nuclear physics hes never heard of them but he knows all about them and there is the only place that we in scientology are going to break down if we break down at all and there is about the only place where our technology will break down it wont break down just on the basis of getting lost and drifting off and all that sort of thing it wont get lost that way because well take good pains that it doesnt the only place it can get lost is an unwillingness to learn about it and the only place that can get lost is just not knowing it at all and not knowing particularly that the reason why one cant learn is one thinks there is nothing there that he doesnt know and he feels he knows it all so he doesnt learn it and thats very silly fundamental its almost an idiotic fundamental its like the way to cross the river is cross the river you know i mean its one of those stupid data but stupid data are the ones that have habit of getting lost and in the final analysis its brightest to remember you will always have difficulty if you do not get down to the true fundamental and the true fundamental is always stupid and is always nonsensical and is not really worth knowing which is why it remains unas ised till the end of time so it itself stays in for the same reason nobody bothers to know it trying to teach trying to teach some savage how to tie his shoes will always be very upset and be very upsetting procedure if he doesnt have any reason to wear shoes and doesnt know what they are and so forth so you go in it upstairs trying to teach him how to tie his shoes you havent taught him that if he wants to look civilized he should wear shoes you see you can always fail utterly in teaching somebody something by not cutting in at the lowest level of entrance and reality on the subject there is always first lesson to teach and where you fail in instruction is you havent isolated the first lesson to teach there are numerous examples i could give you tons of data on that subject all by itself very interesting but on the subject of learning itself the first datum to teach is this little and the first barrier to crack is this datum about why are you studying it if you know all about it to begin with this is your first datum there is your fundamental theres bedrock on the subject of learning subject and if you just remember that you wont have any trouble trying to teach somebody you realize hes having an awful time its taking him an awful long time to learn this well then youd better get right in at rock bottom on the subject of education and the first thing youre going to find out is he knows all about it and the next thing youve got to make him find out is if he knows all about it why is he studying it and then somehow or another youve got to crack that door open if you get that door cracked open then he can learn anything from there on like shot okay i hope that will be of some help to you thank you very much
