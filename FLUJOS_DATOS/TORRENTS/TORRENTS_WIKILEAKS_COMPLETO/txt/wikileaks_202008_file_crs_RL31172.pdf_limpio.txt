httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172the changing structure of agriculture and rural america emerging opportunities and challenges summary when agricultural production and related businesses dominated rural economies policies that strengthened and improved agriculture tended to strengthen and improve the wellbeing of most of americas small communities and rural residents as the strength of this linkage declined over the past century many have felt that rural policy has been left largely fragmented and unfocused comprising patchwork of programs and initiatives rather than coherent policy yet agriculture remains the primary policy framework for congresss consideration of rural issues significant changes are occurring in the structure of the us agrofood system these changes are likely to pose important questions about the direction and coherence of current rural policy several significant trends in this evolving structure of agriculture are discussed in this report 1 continuation in the trend toward fewer and larger farms 2 potential acceleration of that trend as production shifts to more tightly integrated and vertically coordinated production through supply chains 3 greater environmental pressures on conventional agricultural production practices stemming from urban and suburban interests and 4 changing food consumption patterns conditions in rural america today are

compelling policymakers and rural areas to seek new sources of job growth innovative ways of providing public services to sparse populations as well as new ways of integrating agriculture into changing rural economies manufacturing major focus of rural economic development over the past 40 years is also threatened by increasing lowwage international competition congress has expressed its concern with rural communities most directly through periodic omnibus farm bill legislation most recently in the 1996 federal agricultural improvement and reform act pl104127 and in its current deliberations over new farm bill the farm security act of 2001 hr2646 the farm security act as recently passed by the house has rural development title questions have been raised about whether agriculture policy and rural policy are compatible given the large proportion of rural nonfarm communities there are questions about whether current rural policies tend to reinforce rural communities past competitive advantage or whether they assist the creation of entrepreneurial capacity within rural areas to generate new competitive advantage while significant debate exists over what elements might comprise comprehensive integrated rural policy continuing along past policy paths seems increasingly less likely to produce the socioeconomic conditions that will assist rural america in

resources science and industry division 2rural development federal programs that focus on rural american and its economic development gaorced8956br january 1989the changing structure of agriculture and rural america emerging opportunities and challenges1 introduction rural americas problems and opportunities appear as recurrent themes when agricultural policy is debated issues affecting the economic structure of us food and agricultural production often lead to parallel discussions about their implications for rural america this is understandable given the close connections between agriculture and rural life that for so long have characterized us rural history although that relation is considerably more complex today to speak of rural america and not immediately to appreciate the major role that agriculture has played in shaping the rural physical landscape and rural social organization is all but impossible however accurate or idealized these perceptions are rural america and its agrarian ethos continue to hold distinctive if not unique place in the minds of most citizens contemporary policy concerns about rural wellbeing and the future potential of rural america are at root concerns about the wide range of people businesses and institutions inhabiting special place in us social and economic life conditions in many parts of rural america today are quite mixed some rural areas such as those adjoining metropolitan areas or blessed with environmental amenities andor affluent retirees are thriving other rural areas locations of the businesses that more economically privileged areas can afford to forego or worse locations with little employment few public services and fewer possibilities are not doing well the significant socioeconomic development possibilities that do exist in many of these areas will be influenced by rural and agricultural policies that reflect and that build on the important capacities that rural areas might develop and expand public policy for rural development is made more difficult by the fact that rural planning and development involves multiple policy objectives targeted by multiple policy instruments the government accounting office identified 88 programs administered by 16 different federal agencies that targeted rural development2 while these programs have unquestionably benefitted many families businesses and communities significant inequality and structural disadvantag exist between different rural areas as well as among the 20 of the population currently living in rural america while many federal agencies address rural issues this attention is more often than not an adaptation of predominantly urban and suburbanbased initiatives or ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs2 3lapping mark b american

local communities substate areas and multistate regions omnibus farm bills have been among the most highly visible vehicles by which the congress has regularly addressed rural issues title vii of the 1996 federal agricultural improvement and reform act pl 104127 the 1996 farm bill contains rural development title provisions in that title reflect the congresss concern with provision of physical infrastructure creation and expansion of rural businesses and the quality and availability of housing concerns for public service and improving rural social welfare are also apparent in provisions supporting telecommunications development and the fund for rural america title vi of the proposed 2002 farm bill hr2646 recently passed by the house also deals with these issues and provides for new funding to support strategic rural development planning and innovations in valueadded agricultural businesses historical foundations the rural sector has always played vital role in us prosperity and wellbeing review of federal policy for the rural sector reveals four dominant themes over the past 200 years 1 land distribution and management 2 human resources and physical infrastructure development 3 financial support for farmers and ranchers and 4 poverty alleviation3 until the 20th century rural policy meant mostly the distribution of approximately billion acres of land from the federal government to private ownership through governmentprovided roads canals bridges and railroads the federal goal was to stimulate population expansion and settlements as rapidly as possible in 1862 the homestead act altered the existing system of fee simple purchase of acreage from the government to system of free or inexpensive land grants of 160 acres to settlers willing to live on the land for at least five years in addition the railroad grants of 1862 reinforced the dominant objective of federal policies at that time to settle people create communities establish transportation and communication capacity and develop wealth through agriculture mining and forestry4 the establishment of the department of agriculture in 1862 created within the federal system significant institution for the rural constituency the objective of the morrill act of 1862 was to build up the human capital of the frontier societies as well as the longestablished agricultural economies of the east and south through federal land sales to support what would later become the land grant universities land distribution and infrastructure development and support tended to define federal rural policy in the 19th and early 20th centuries by the end of the 19th century the number of farms was declining as cities grew in economic importance and unemployed agricultural labor migrated to urban areas the positive social values presumed to characterize small towns and agrarian livelihoods however became anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs3 5lapping op cit p 225 it must also be noted that the changes advocated by the country life commission were resisted by many rural people who did not welcome the implications of more industrialized agriculture see danbom david the resisted revolution ames ia

contain 1 core counties with one or more central cities of at least 50000 or with census bureaudefined urbanized area and total metro population of 100000 or more and 2 fringe counties that are economically tied to the core counties nonmetro counties are defined as those places outside the boundaries of metro areas that have cities with populations under 50000 rural areas comprise places with open territory and fewer than 2500 residents urban areas comprise larger places and densely settled areas around them as the relation between metro and nonmetro areas becomes more complex

precisely define rural population and areas rural development perspectives vol 11 3 pp3139 may 2001important theme of rural policy reform movement deeply suspicious of cities and urban residents and strongly committed to the jeffersonianromanticist idealization of farming emerged during the early 20th century taking its name from the country life commission established by president theodore roosevelt in 1908 the country life movement sought to speak for rural america and its interests and came to define much of the debate over rural development in the preworld war i era with clear understanding of the emerging power of the urbanindustrial system country lifers sought secure place in it for rural america they argued that the rural sector lagged behind more dynamic sectors because rural areas had failed to take advantage of advanced technologies and institutional reforms to create modern progressive rural and agricultu re sectors the country life movement placed an emphasis on improved technology specialization efficiency and modern education and training as sources for solutions to rural and agricultural problems to significant extent the country life movement established the direction and focus that rural development policy has taken into the 21th century5 from these historical underpinnings rural economic development farming modernization and rural social welfare have been regarded as inextricably linked changing relationship this view of the relations between rural development farming and rural welfare is considerably more difficult to sustain today as the structure of contemporary production and changing global agrofood markets lessen the role of agriculture in rural economies and rural social life and as urban and global systems increasingly influence virtually all areas in the 316 farming dependent counties ie where 20 or more of labor and proprietors income is derived from farming policy changes that affect farm commodity payments or credit can still have large impacts on community banks schools and local businesses that depend on farm spending but agriculture policy or more specifically farm commodity programs as

farming and agricultural services and most household income for most farm families now comes from offfarm sources while the extent of dependency as measured by jobs in the food and fiber system varies significantly by region only 2 of rural residents identify farming as their primary occupation see table 1 and net farm income today amounts to only 23 of total nonmetro personal income there is in fact now remarkable similarity in the sectoral shares of employment ie agriculture manufacturing industry and services between metro and nonmetro places6 while strong farming sector is and will remain cornerstone to rural well being in farmdependent regions most rural people have little or direct relation to agriculture emerging policy issues surround the question of whether current farm policies which rely heavily on commodity support payments and subsidies to few production sectors help or hinder the future development of economically viable rural communities research for example has suggested that larger farm program payments as share of total cash marketing receipts are associated with greater population loss from rural counties after controlling for other variables affecting population migration7 continuing socioeconomic and population decline in farming and rural areas and congressional concern over the costs of supporting the remaining farms and related businesses are

driving change in agriculture at this time and what might their implications be for rural communities and for rural policy more generally while by means an exhaustive listing four interrelated trends shaping the contemporary structure of agriculture seem especially pertinent in understanding potential changes that may affect significant parts of rural america first farm structural characteristics like size specialization and organization are likely to continue having important implications for rural areas especial ly in those areas where agriculture is significant part of the rural economy but also in areas where small mixedproduction farming enterprises exist within varied local and regional economy second vertical integration and coordination in production are accelerating certain changes in the organization of agriculture and with it how rural communities and regional economies might adapt to the effects of these new forms of production these two changes are in important ways driven by an increasingly competitive global agrofood production and trading system and underscore the importance that shifts in the macropolitical economy play in driving change in local areas third environmental concerns are assuming an important role in agricultural production decisions and may assume an even greater role in shaping agricultural policy in the future fourth while the implications remain unclear changing food consumption patterns especially in the advanced industrial economies are shaping social and technological practices in agriculture these changing consumption patterns also potentially open new development possibilities based on local innovations in agricultural production processing and marketing policy ques tions congressional interest in rural policy involves wide range of issues including agriculture forestry and mining community infrastructure natural resource conservation and management and economic development current challenges to and reform of existing federal rural policies is evolving in an environment of increasing concern about national competitiveness shift away from agriculture toward manufacturing and services new federal political strategies and the emergence of new political interests restructuring rural america is producing pressures for different policies and raising new questions about what congresss role should be in shaping rural policy among them are does rural america both require and warrant distinctive policies oriented to its particular social geographic and economic characteristics what role can federal policy play in assisting rural areas to assemble the information services infrastructure and work forces needed to attract and retain new sources of economic growth should rural policies focus largely on local economic development or on broader aspects of rural welfare and sustainability do existing rural policies reinforce older competitive advantages or are they assisting rural areas in creating new sources of competitive advantage what elements would comprise comprehensive flexible integrated rural policies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs6 8for broad overview of us agriculture

between states local communities and the federal levels in designing and implementing rural policies the structure of agricultural production background and analysis farm structure the first census 1790 showed that the us was primarily an agricultural economy by 1880 only about half the population was still farming the 1920 census found nearly third of the total population in farming and nearly two thirds of rural america in farming while the steady decline in farming has long been noted perhaps one of the most profound transformations of rural america since the 1920s has been the shift from largely independent class of farm operators and small retail businesses that serviced farming needs to mostly manufacturing and service sector and wageearning rural america today although wage labor also characterizes farming an important shift in agriculture has been in the emergence of dual farm structure one made up of large commercial farms producing the bulk of agricultural commodities and smallfarm sector that while comprising the larger number of farms contributes little proportionately to total value8 this duality in farm structure is not entirely new for example small commodity production in the bellum south existed alongside large plantation holdings and large cattle ranches in the west continue to exist alongside much smaller ranches and mixedfarming enterprises the degree of this duality however has greatly intensified in the past 25 years as the proportion of large industrialized farms has grown9 land and the policies that underlie its acquisition and use are central to the history of farming the three predominant uses of land in the contiguous 48 states are grassland pasture and range 578 million acres forest 553 million acres and cropland 455 million acres10 grassland pasture and range 31 of major land uses in the 48 states has declined since the mid1960s when it was 636 million acres cropland includes land used for crops cropland idled including land for the conservation reserve program and cropland used for pasture these components vary more than total cropland cropland used for crops has ranged from 383 million acres in 1949 and 1982 to 331 million acres in 1987 corn soybeans wheat and accounted for 80 of all crop acres harvested in 1999 11 total cropland varied about 8 between 1945 and 1997 ranging from 478 million acres in 1949 to 444 million acres in 1964 the 1997 cropland base of 455 million acres was the lowest since 1964 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs7 12ibid 13the definition of small farm was developed by the national commission on

again while total cropland has varied up and down and generally declined since 1969 greater shifts have occurred between cropland used for crops and cropland idled mostly because of federal programs cropland idled in federal programs has decreased about 25 million acres since 1995 with the elimination of annual commodity setaside requirements and changes to the conservation reserve program12 the

typology of farms in the mid 1990s box 1 based not only on sales but also on the occupational choice of the operator operator household income and farm characteristics using this typology survey data

highersales small farms at 18 and all other small farms13 at 21 account for 39 of the value of production but incorpor ate 72 of total farm asset value including land regardless of farm type the household wealth of most operators who listed farming as their major occupation came from the farm and these households also had an average net worth of 14 million considerably higher than the us average of 205900httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs8 14hoppe robert sources and levels of farm household income vary by type of farm rural conditions and trend s 9no2 1999107113a similar 1996 arm survey also revealed other important operating characteristics of farms and farm households14 while large andvery large farm operators reported farming as their major occupation household income from off farm sources was not insignificant for these farm households averaging 30 and 18 respectively by 2001 large farm households derived nearly 40 of total income from offfarm sources very large farms had household incomes averaging 193800 4 times the average us household income of 47100 according to the 1996 survey and along with large farms tended to specialize in cash grains large and very large farms account for only 8 of farms but they produce nearly 57 of total agricultural value approximately 50 of all us farms in 1996 were limited resource retirement and residentiallifestyle farms but they accounted for only about 6 of total agricultural production these farm households relied almost entirely on off farm income sources highsales farms most of which are located in the lake states corn belt and northern plains had household incomes not significantly different from the average us househo ld income and derived 57 of household income from offfarm sources as with large and very large farms highsales farms also tended to specialize in cash grains as well as dairy over onethird of retirement farms and nearly half residentiallifestyle farms specialized in beef production for another 21 of retirement farms payments from the conservation reserve program provided the sole source of farm income lowersales farms had average household incomes of 31500 significantly lower than the us average these farms also relied heavily on offfarm income sources and often specialized in beef production rather than cash grains limited resource farms are found mostly in the south 62 and over half specialized in beef most limitedresource farmers did not report farming as their main occupation nearly 49 were retired over 40 of black farmers are limited resource farmer compared to 13 of white farmers household income for limited resource farmers averaged 13600 but because they lost an average of 3000 on their farming operations their average household income was actually 10600 about fifth of the national average these data suggest that traditional farm support programs including the transition payments under the federal agricultural improvement and reform act of 1996 pl104127 may be of limited use to most farms and thus potentially make contributions to rural wellbeing only in those areas where there are largevery large and nonfamily farms specializing in crops supported by farm payments while direct payments to farmers have tripled since 1996 they represent only fraction of total federal spending in nonmetro areas averaging about 182 out of total of 4725 per capita

federal reserve bank of kansas city october 19995369 in per capita federal spending in 199815 in these counties farm payments can have important effects especially in their capacity to support other rural businesses in the past several years emergency farm payments have been significant factor in preserving farming and related businesses in regions where farmers specialize in cotton grains and dairy farms specializing in beef or fruits and vegetables are not recipients of direct farm support payments although certain commodities eg apples have been the target of emergency payments over the past several years the characteristics of farms and farm households influence and are influenced by the surrounding rural socioeconomic environment from the evidence presented above for example proximity to offfarm income sources strongly influences household income whether offfarm employment is high or lowwage seasonal parttime etc may also influence the stability or type of farming enterprise as well as the resources that can be directed to the enterprise similarly proximity to urban and suburban markets could make certain types of farming more successful in the future eg highvalue organic production fresh fruits and vegetables and nurseries as the typology in box 1 suggests the official definition of farm based only on sales lumps together groups with significantly different characteristics needs and future prospects for growth declines in bulk commodity prices for example may affect different groups of farmers differently such declines may suggest large effects on specialized grain farms but when total households income is considered the actual effects may be different depending on farm size and efficiency where the farm is located the farm operators managerial capabilities offfarm income sources etc similarly for retired farmers or residentiallifestyle farms declines in farm prices may be only modestly important if at all to changes in household income in either case broader macroeconomic changes can often have equal or greater effects on household incomes and rural areas more generally than the farm economy alone the emerging new agriculture of supply chains the longstanding trend toward fewer larger and more specialized commercial farms and ranches in the us horizontal integration is well documented not only have these trends been observed for many years recent data suggest they may be accelerating as pressures increase from global competitors and as new agricultural technologies continue to reinforce the substitution of capital for labor to create scale efficiencies rapid and increasing consolidation and coordination vertical integration in agriculture are indicators of more fundamental restructuring occurring in the food and fiber system today growing share of commodity producers mostly within animal production currently are joining supply chains16 supply chain is tightly organized production processing and marketing system formed by agribusiness firms that in its most coordinated form could potentially link each step of food production from proprietary genetic material to the grocery shelf poultry raising especially broilerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs10 17agricultural resource management study 1998 18nearly 100 of fluecured tobacco is now produced under contractproduction is almost completely conducted under producer contracts with approximately 40 firms producing 97 of all broilers distinguishing characteristic of supply chains is their reliance on contractual agreements licenses joint ventures integrated ownership and other business arrangements with different segments of the food system these alliances with producers may permit contracting firms to bypass more traditional commodity markets to better insulate themselves from price volatility and dwindling markets many commodity producers are abandoning their independent operations and adopting contract commodity production arrangements with agribusiness firms according to the usdas economic research service about 35 of the total value of us agricultural production in 1998 was produced under some form of contractual arrangement17 piglets for example raised under contract can be provided by the agribusiness firm fed on specific livestock feed provided by the firm and on schedule stipulated by the firm to be delivered at specified time and weight to the firms slaughtering plant where the meat is packaged and transported either to grocery or to processed food plant and finally retailed to the consumer depending on the degree of vertical integration food company could pass the hog to each stage along the food line perhaps never relinquishing actual ownership until the consumer purchases the product at the meat case or in frozen dinner starting perhaps with the intellectual property rights of genetically modified organism eg proprietary swine breeds with higher leantofat ratios or those less susceptible to certain diseases common to intensively raised livestock raising slaughtering and processing and ending with the retail sale of the pork product the supplychain revolution occurring in livestock production is model increasingly being looked to by other sectors eg speciality grains fruits and vegetables tobacco18 like previous agricultural changes technology will likely play key role in the evolution of supply chains in the past technology has been major force in driving the shift of farm activities off the farm and into the input industries advances in agricultural biotechnology can be expecte d to do the same but with distinct variation initial biotechnology development in agriculture focused on changes in bulk commodities eg herbicide resistant soybeans and pest resistant corn much current research in biotechnology is focused on the characteristics of farm products not just how the products are produced proprietary products lend themselves to the structure of supply chains as the contractor firms target new bioengineered products to particular market niches some farmers in some regions may choose to continue producing bulk commodities other farmers may choose to contract with an agribusiness firm to produce valueadded bioengineered product as supply chains and other forms of vertical integration become more prevalent in production sector the number of growers supplying the commodity is likely to decrease this has occurred in poultry it is currently occurring in pork production it has started in beef and niche markets are likely to make it occur in some cropshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs11 19barkema m drabenstott and n novack the new us meat industry federal reserve bank of kansas city economic review second quarter 2001 20

et op cit p37while marketing contracts may displace few resources from farms and communities production contracts under integrated ownership may have significant local effects by contracting with only few very large producers firm can achieve significant economic efficiencies in part by minimizing the transaction costs associat ed with managing many business alliances and by minimizing various marketing risks as swine production has followed supply chain arrangements for example the number of hog producers has declined from nearly 500000 in the early 1980s to approximately 85000 in 200119 this shift in commodity production through supply chains may also be reflected in decline in the number of hog slaughtering plants over the past twenty years from over 500 to about 180 some industry observers believe that under supply chain arrangement 50 or fewer pork producers and 12 stateof theart packing plants could in the near future supply the entire us pork market20 some contract producers might find themselves with decreasing power to negotiate the terms of their contracts as the relative power of large processors to determine the conditions of production increases21 although some states eg minnesota have adopted measures to better protect contract producers some observers believe that because producers negotiate individually with processor often with contract confidentiality clauses individual producers can be at disadvantage22 in 1997 approximately 42 of hogs were produced under contracts and 57 of hogs were sold under marketing contracts23 while the movement of supply chains into cattle production has been much slower than it has into swine production the consolidation trend is much stronger in the cattle feeding sector in 1980 large feedlots 32000 head accounted for less than third of market share by 2000 that share had increased to nearly half24 as agribusiness firms consolidate to more seamlessly integrate their production systems

activity reduce the ability of some farmers and independent producers to obtain fair prices andor reduce product choice other industry experts would argue that in some industries fewer firms may result in greater market efficiencies and particularly for the case of agriculture perhaps less extensive environmental implications stemming from many small dispersed producers few firms producing at high output it is argued can be more economically efficient than many firms with smaller market share26 further these researchers argue market power can be kept in check through threats by innovative competitor s eager to capitalize on the inefficiencies of certain market abuses27 what is of particular significance if still poorly understood are the implications for rural areas in the supply chain revolution in agricultural production historically agricultural production was relatively widely distributed across the rural landscape supply chains appear to be redrawing the landscape of dispersed agricultural production poultry production and swine production were once widely dispersed across the country today broiler production which is almost exclusively done under producer contracts is found mostly in the south and southeastern us and upper midwest poultry processing plants are even more concentrated within those regions similarly beef production with large feed lots and nearby meat packing plants suggests very different agricultural geography one with potentially significant social and environmental effects on rural communities where such production occurs rural areas specializing in producing bulk commodities for supply chains eg farmdependent areas in the great plains or corn belt are likely do so in local or regional environment of decreasing diversity and over time still fewer farms other rural communities however will attempt to connect themselves to the supply chains as new sources of employment the emergence of large livestock feeding operations and meat packing facilities proximate to midwestern communities may have different socioeconomic impacts than current forms of commercial agricultural organization28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs13

communities in arizona california florida and texas report prepared for the us office of technology assessment 1985even then the number of rural communities that benefit from the employment that processing and meat packing will bring is likely to be limited rural areas that become supply chain hubs may benefit but it may often occur at the expense of those other rural farming communities that do not or cannot attract supply chain hub to their regions agriculture and community some research has suggested that farm scale and other management characteristics are associated with certain community characteristics this research has been controversial since walter goldschmidts pioneering 1944 research on two california farming communities conducted for the usdas bureau of agricultural economics29 substantial body of evidence has shown that communities characterized by largescale especially industrial farm structures are often associated with adverse community socioeconomic conditions eg lower community standards of living less economic diversity fewer community services less vibrant retail trade etc than communities with other types of farming enterprises30 the direction of that statistical association however remains unclear as does the strength of the relationship and even more important the processes that underlie it moreover for policy purposes it would likely be very difficult to reliably predict the kind or degree of any positive community gains that might occur through policies to limit the growth of farm size however variety of characteristics of local and regional agricultural production as with any other industrial sector are likely to interact in different ways with the wider rural economy and to be broadly associated with the overall quality of rural life research conducted as part of the office of technology assessments ota 1986 report technology public policy and the changing structure of american agriculture supported the relationship reported by goldschmidt between industrial farming and community quality of life in its analysis of florida and several western states31 research in other regions however has cast doubt that the relations that goldschmidt and others documented are generalizeable to all regions especially regions that do not have history of industrial farming in the south for example both largescale and smallscale farms were associated with relatively low standards of living while midsize farms were associated with higher standards of living but even here scale may well not be the most

surrounding some industrial farms dominated by manager worker relations and dependent on large mostly unskilled labor forces can be associated with adverse socioeconomic effects32 largescale owneroperated farms generally show positive effects this is especially true in the midwest survey of 9000 us pork producers showed that in the total of 1530 pork farmers who returned their surveys large producers paid the highest wages to workers had more generous benefits and better working conditions than small pork firms33 as these observations might suggest any association between farm organization and various community characteristics appears to be mediated by the size and economic diversity of the community the region the kinds of agricultural commodities produced and rural areas proximity to urbansuburban areas although research on the effects of supply chains and vertical integration on rural communities is at an early stage the geographic concentration of production may be one important outcome affecting rural communities over time to compete innovations in alternative production models may hold some promise for agricultural led development for example rather than the standard economic efficiency model of maximum yield per unit of input farming operations that maximize optimal energy efficiency per unit of input or maximum nutritional efficiency per unit of input or minimal environmental impact per unit of input may have attractions to some farmers and consumers especially those in areas near metro regions equally important however the social organization of the local and regional nonfarm economy also exerts important effects on the surrounding area suggesting that newly created opportunities in the nonfarm economy may have significant impact on the farm economy and the rural economy more generally as supply chains and other forms of vertical integration and coordination come to characterize various production sectors the kinds and degree of local and regional impact may vary considerably depending on the broader characteristics of the regional economy and on the existence of local capacities for generating innovative alternatives or complements to

agricultural production decisions with rural areas now more closely integrated with suburban and urban systems environmental aspects of agricultural production may be perceived by some as intrusive and highly objectionable individuals and communities have responded not only to environmental problems stemming from existing agricultural operations but they are also resisting potential future problems over the past two decades several voluntary programs addressing the environmental effects of agricultural production have been implemented at the federal level these programs eg the conservation reserve program the wetlands reserve program and environmental quality incentives program have played significant role in reducing soil erosion protecting and restoring wetlands and creating wildlife habitat37 however these programs do not take into consideration location or urbanization in deciding where they should be applied significant environmental problems occur in most regions although their scope and severity are dispersed unevenly across the rural landscape while much of agriculture often is exempt from certain environmental regulations affecting other industries agriculture is subject to federal regulation under the food quality protection act of 1996 the clean water act the endangered species act and specific regulations under the occupational safety and health administration pertaining to farm workers the clean water act also authorizes states to control water pollution from cafos through permitting process that requires certain technologies or adherence to particular standards some problems such as odor are not federal concerns regulatory oversight of agricultures environmental impact could increase in the future especially given the strong

costs on rural and agricultural lands for example through poorly constructed septic systems that often accompany rapid housing development in rural areas with little zoning regulation to some observers the loss of agricultural land to suburban development is itself significant environmental cost41 lowdensity farming operations lying on the edge of the urban fringe are particularly vulnerable to conversion farmland owners especially those at the urban fringe often make land use decisions under pressures of suburban expansion as land values increase in rural areas adjacent to metro areas farmers that want that option can be tempted to cash out while 82 of all farmland is located in rural areas data from the 1997 census of agriculture indicated that third of all farms are

patterns are becoming important factors shaping the social organization of agricultural production especially in europe the united states and japan food safety issues have become major vehicle that critics of conventional agricultural practices use to inform the public about the global organization of the food and fiber system especially the food systems of the developed industrial economies for example widely disseminated reporting on and policy responses in europe to bovine encephalopathy mad cow disease footand mouth disease and poultry feed contamination have reinforced concern in some consumers minds that conventional production methods in agriculture can be threatening to human health continuing consumer uneasiness with genetically engineered commodities in many processed food products and increasing knowledge and concern about the environmental costs of industrial agriculture have led some consumers to seek food products they believe are superior to foods grown and raised under conventional production methods such trends point to the extent to which agrofood markets are becoming increasingly segmented and may offer new opportunities to meet these new consumption demands higher incomes and increasing urbanization are significant factors leading to demand for higher quality food for food produced in certain ways and for labor saving products44 most purchasers of organic foods and animal products eg eggs meat and dairy from creatures grown under freerange systems and slaughtered under what many consumers believe to be more humane methods tend to be wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs20 45a significant portion of organically certified produce eg carrots celery lettuce is also raised by conventional growers who set aside some of their land for

environmentally sound ways see blend jeffrey r and eileen van ravenswaay measuring consumer demand for ecolabled apples american journal of agricultural continuededucated urban and highincome earners heightened awareness of safety and health concerns have also changed us food consumption patterns over the past 20 years for example the share of red meat consumption in total meat consumption in the diet declined from 79 to 62 between 1979 and 1999 while the share of poultry consumption rose from 21 to 38 over the same period per capita fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 25 from 19791999 facilitated by changes in shipping technology trade in horticulture and highvalue produce also has grown wealthier countries whose citizens have more information about food risks tend to demand higher food safety standards in 1996 for example congress enacted the food quality protection act fqpa to overhaul the standard setting process for pesticides the fqpa among other provisions targeted children for pesticide protection and required more pesticide information on food products those with higher incomes are often also willing to pay more for perceived higher safety levels for example they are willing to pay for foods grown in particular ways eg organic sustainable lowinput while growth in organic food is fairly well publicized other labels attesting to how food is raised are also beginning to appear in th us ecolabeled food such as food raised by integrated pest management techniques or lowchem in japan and green foods in china have created new food markets in the us taste freshness and quality are among the top reasons cited for organic purchases in japan food safety is the primary reason consumers purchase organic foods in the european union retailers advertise food safety and health aspects of organic food environmental protection in food production is also major argument presented by european retailers these trends while currently small relative to the total value of global agricultural trade may suggest more fundamental changes occurring in the global food system they do not necessarily portend trend back to traditional production methods modern

shaping agricultural production presented above may be briefly summarized under current conditions the trend toward fewer larger more highly capitalized and specialized farming operations is unlikely to be reversed supplychains represent significant structural dimension of increasing scale and integration and suggest that marketing and production contracting will become an important organizational factor in conventional agricultural production supplychain expansion may further reduce the number of farms as well as perhaps geographically concentrate certain kinds of production eg livestock production speciality grains and fruits and vegetables conventional agriculture is likely to remain significant if diminished part of the rural economy if present conditions continue and deepen farm dependent counties especially those that produce mostly bulk commodities will face greater competitive pressures from globalizing agrofood system the diversity of farm household income strategies as well as the diversity of local and regional rural economies are important variables in assessing the relation between agricultural policy and rural development policies environmental concerns about

the 1980s remained while the states economy was able to create nearly 700000 service sector jobs the new employment sectors eg finance technology in the booming metro areas of charlotte and raleighdurham are not able to absorb all these losses especially as the national economy has slowed many of these rural workers who lose manufacturing jobs often lack the education and training to compete for new service sector jobs and their rural counties often lack the resources to attract new sources of higherwage employment source david firestone chief exporter and not at all pleased about

below the poverty level for family of four in 1999 17000 since the early 1990s rural earnings growth generally has outpaced urban earnings due in part to the sluggish recovery from the early 1990s recession in urban areas earnings among the lowest paid rural workers have risen more slowly than for the rest of the labor force even as their education levels have increased current low wage employment rates in rural areas remain higher than in the late 1970s despite better educated workforce and very low national unemployment rate this may suggest that public policies attending primarily to human capital issues in at least some rural areas may not be effective in and of themselves although most lowwage workers are women mens share of lowwage work in rural areas has risen over the past 20 years despite an increase in job growth in late 1998 the pace of employment growth in rural areas slowed from an average of 18 between 1990 and 1995 to about 15 in 1999 in 1997 rural areas lagged behind urban areas by at least 9000 in real per capita income this gap has widened since the late 1980s exacerbated by the loss of manufacturing jobs earnings per job also remain consistently and substantially lower in rural areas than in urban areas 35151 versus 23619 in 1998 dollars in part lower rural earnings may reflect the lower college graduation rates of rural workers even though highschool completion rates have come close to matching those of urban areas in addition the types of manufacturing operations that relocated to rural areas were predominantly nonunion and required lowerskilled workers than other manufacturing jobs eg assembly warehouse shipping54 the fact that ruralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs26 54continued prevented from locating to that state in the mid1990s 55informal work ie unrecorded labor is often an important source of income in rural areas welfare reform legislations work mandates do not recognize work in the informal sector thus rural

below the poverty level for each of four census years 19601990 most of these persistently poor counties are in the southeast and delta regions native american reservations core appalachia and the lower rio grande valley agriculture is often significant economic sector in these regions but as with national trends its role has declined large pool of poorly educated residents high proportions of minorities and mostly lowwage manufacturing and parttime service employment in persistently poor counties help explain why these areas have found it difficult to improve household incomes high unemployment poorly educated workers substandard housing and inadequate public infrastructure characterize persistent poverty counties where in addition the majority of limited resource and minority farmers also reside many poor rural areas have lowwage employment opportunities long distances to services and jobs and lower automobile access little public transportation and lack of child care options55 persistently low per capita incomes often translate into low levels of human capital investment with little growth in rural highskill employment and downward pressure on wages in lowskilled employment many persistentpoverty counties especially in the south are very badly positioned to reverse these trends56 some observers have also concluded that rural poverty in certain states eg california is actually being recreated through immigration driven in part by the expansion of lowwage immigrant intensive agriculture57 it must be emphasized that the rural experience is highly

derived from farming and 312 farming important counties 10199 of income from farming the more dependent county was on farming in 1997 the larger the decline in the number of farms and the increase in sales per farm in other words the growth in fewer and larger farms was greater in farmdependent and farmimportant counties than in other rural communities less reliant on agriculture farmingdependent counties lost an average of 12500 farms between 1987 and 1997 farmingimport ant counties lost 10600 farms over that period other nonmetro counties lost 6700 farms between 19871997 the average 1997 sales per farm in farming dependent and farming important counties however was 233900 and 161200 respectively compared to 69200 for all other nonmetro counties farmingdependent counties are concentrated primarily in the great plains western corn belt and parts of the northwest and southeast regions these counties are also geographically isolated with very low population densities 118 persons per square mile versus 363 persons for other nonmetro counties this can create barriers to new economic development especially service related development very low densities and few large metropolitan regions within commuti ng distances increase the costs of infrastructure development transpor tation and other public services many rural areas are beginning to participate more in the service sector but as was the case with many manufacturing jobs the service jobs rural areas are able tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs28 attract are often lowerwage personal services rather than higher wage producer and professional services nonmetro areas predominantly in the midwestern and southern states gained the most food manufacturing jobs in the 1990s but only 357 counties out of total of 2310 nonmetro counties gained 50 or more food processing jobs between 1990 and 1996 most of the jobs were in meat and grain mill products with their lag in creating new jobs farmdependent counties are also losing their younger and better educated residents potentially significant barrier to creating and sustaining new economic activities in the future again aggregate statistics about

nonmetro counties but inflation adjusted total personal income in farmdependent counties grew only 13 between 19901998 compared with 21 in other nonmetro counties61 this suggests that the agricultural sector while not sufficient condition for rural wellbeing today remains nonetheless an important factor in some local and regional rural economies government farm payments moreover may be morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs30 62ibidsignificant to farmdependent economies than other nonmetro areas because these payments tend to attenuate the impact of fluctuations in household incomes in areas more vulnerable to the volatility of the farm economy farmdependent counties received however only 37 of farm program payments in 1998 while 19 went to metro counties and 44 went to nonfarm dependent nonmetro areas62 in the absence of other economic opportunities the loss of such payments to farm dependent areas could hasten population loss and failure of farming related or other rural businesses the extent to which these counties might also begin developing local and regional capacity to expand into innovative valueadded agricultural production for example or to create new employment opportunities outside agriculture is likely to become an important factor in improving socioeconomic circumstances in the future summary given the diversity characterizing rural areas any generalizations should be taken with caution distance to metro areas local and regional economic mix the presence of environm ental amenities the role of agriculture and demographic characteristics can make vast differences in the socioeconomic profile of an area and any comparisons to other areas still some broad patterns do emerge in 2001 enormous diversity sparse populations and complex interdependencies with urban suburban and global geographies characterize rural areas rural america as whole held its own economically fairly well in the 1990s although many areas continue slow decline rural counties dependent on farming continued to lose population and tend to gain at best lowerwage jobs farm household incomes however tended to be higher than nonfarm households in farmingdependent counties nonmetro population growth is tied to net immigration rather than natural increase suggesting that social economic and environmental conditions in rural areas will strongly influence their future growth while it is necessary to factor in the role of agriculture in rural and regional economies current agricultu ral policy alone can longer be equated with addressing rural policy issues more generally nonmetro areas continue to lose population relative to metro areas although remote rural areas are losing the most nonmetro areas adjacent to metro areas are likely to continue to grow and become part of metro areas rural areas have on average older lesseducated and poorer residents than urban areas many farm dependent counties continue to lose college graduates nonmetro areas especially those where agriculture is significant part of the local and regional economies and where environmental amenities are scarce are likely to face formidable problems if current trends in agricultural production population growth and employment persist rural america mirrors national declines in primary sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing and growth in service sector employment although wages and real earnings per job in rural areas lag behind those of urban areas and the relative lack of economic diversity can make many rural areas vulnerablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs31 63even here appalachian regional commission funding is focused on infrastructure development particularly transportation public policy and the changing opportunity structure of rural america wide range of rural problems such as low wages declining jobs lack of infrastructure weak educational systems concentrated poverty and shrinking population has been addressed at the federal level but only in piecemeal fashion comprehensive rural policy has ever existed in the united states although limited regions have been targeted with more coherent focus such as appalachia through the appalachian regional commission63 evidence presented above suggests that rural policies based on agriculture support programs are even less likely than in the past to provide the single major policy focus around which decision makers might forge viable rural development policies for the future the dominant thrust of us agricultural policy and the policies increasingly necessary to build and strengthen rural communities coincide in general in only few agriculturedependent counties today for over forty years manufacturing has provided employment to replace lost farm jobs but for reasons discussed above its potential as an engine of sustainable future growth and development also reveals significant limitations the service sector will be important to rural areas but here as well the types of service sector jobs and related wage levels in rural areas can differ significantly from those of urban areas while agriculture remains central to rural wellbeing in many regions rural development in the future is likely to be driven more by changes in the global political economy the structure of global agrofood system itself the social and economic diversity that rural communities and regions draw upon the relations between rural urban suburban and international geographies and the particular demographics of local areas usd rural development rural policy has been an expressly identified concern of congress only since the 1972 rural development act pl92419 although the eisenhower administration did create rural development program in 1955 aimed at lowincome farmers legislation affecting rural areas however has been significant since the nations founding at least 16 federal agencies target rural areas within their program missions but the 1972 rural development act designated usda as the lead agency for coordinating federal programs that target rural areas and the 1980 rural development policy act pl96355 directed the secretary of agriculture to prepare comprehensive rural development strategy broadly speaking that strategy over the past twenty years has emphasized categorical grants and loans for community and infrastructure development business and government economic assistanc housing and credit assistance and several other programs including farm assistance programs reflecting nearly 10 years of emphasis on making more effective use of existing rural development funds and programs within governing philosophy of reduced federal role the 1990 rural economic development act title xxiii of the food agriculture

rural america competitive grants program with two purposes first rural infrastructure projects and second research with rural emphasis represented significant change in federal funding in that the program was mandatory the fund however has not been fully funded by appropriators these various directassistance programs reflect in part the search for broad federal policies that are relevant to most rural communities most of the time and that make measurable improvements in the lives of rural citizens and communities it would be difficult to minimize the importance of providing safe drinking water and solid waste management facilities where there are none or decent affordable housing or the establishment of fire department and an accessible health clinic in that sense rural development can take the form of responding to the program goals of categorical grants and loans perhaps at the expense of responding primarily to the diversity of specific community needs as local communities might define them this may help explain why attitudinal surveys find that rural development can often be rather nebulous concept to many citizens the federal programs are wellknown and supported by local officials and rural development professionals but often thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs33 connections between constructing new water and waste disposal system the loss of major employer the decline of rural downtown area and the targets of rural development policy are unclear to many rural residents this is ironic at one level because urban community development generally enjoys strong support among urban beneficiaries especially when local residents play significant role in defining and determining the direction of development creating and expanding the opportunity structure for all rural america represents significant policy challenge an appreciation of the enormous diversity of rural america need not overwhelm the justifiable effort to craft more flexible comprehensive federal rural policies on one hand asserting that the needs of rural residents may be more appropriately decided at local levels or that generally targeted rural development programs have hitormiss record does not necessarily mean an end to the federal role on the other hand simply extending current rural policies may leave many communities further behind for example only the most remote andor impoverished rural areas today lack access to central power generation clean water and sewerage and it is arguable that remoteness rather than community facilities plays the larger factor in the failure to develop it is substantially true that one sizefits all rural policy is likely to be effective everywhere it is another matter however to find agreement on policies that recognize these differences factors that may influence success in producing new competitive advantages within the diversity of rural america include more flexible policies that support development of local capacities to identify and act on local needs comprehensive programs that better integrate rural development within larger urbansuburbanrural territorial development planning integrated development policies that recognize agriculture as business sector embedded within larger business planning and support network as the discussion above noted the rural sector has often been regarded by policymakers as closely connected to if not synonymous with the agricultural sector since the 1950s rural policy also sought to make rural areas attractive to manufacturing employment by building and improving the physical infrastructure of rural areas by making improvements in the quality of housing and by programs that encouraged business to locate or expand branch plants in rural areas certainly infrastructure housing and sustainable employment generation programs will continue to be needed in any comprehensive rural policy but exactly what infrastructure is needed may vary from region to region depending on an areass socioeconomic base its demographic characteristics and communitys objectives alternative agriculture production systems andor new agriculturebased businesses may well have different infrastructure needs and different business development needs than either more traditional agriculture or traditional business development have required in the past agriculturalbased innovation in

much of this disconnection in fact agriculture lost its status as major rural growth engine many years ago an industrialized agriculture dominated by exportoriented commodity production and federal agricultural policy that directs most resources toward enhancing these sectors may seem to provide little in the way of viable base on which rural development professionals and local residents might build future development opportunities agricultural policy as it is currently constructed could become even less relevant to rural residents as other changes pull rural america into new relations with urban areas some observers have argued that farm institutions eg financial institutions political research and educational organizations are not wellequipped to become effective rural institutions65 others have argued that by continuing to absorb the majority of develop ment resources directed to rural areas and thereby making it difficult to create new areas of competitive advantages in rural america current agricultural support programs can actually hurt rural communities66 in metro farming or farming within commuting distances to metro regions diversification of the agricultural enterprise and experiments with different forms of production may offer opportunitie s to integrate agriculture more broadly into rural development planning while diversification in some ways runs counter to the logic of both horizontal and vertical integration in agriculture policies that better coordinate agriculture with other business development may produce both new opportunities for preserving and enhancing agriculture as well as new rural development possibilities through agriculture one avenue for connecting agriculture to broader rural business planning is valueadded agriculture valueadded enterprises valueadded agricultural production has become widely seen as means for creating opportunities for primary producers to capture more of the value of their commodities in june 2001 secretary veneman announced nearly 10 million in valueadded agricultural market development grants 25 for renewable energy alone the 2002 house farm bill hr2646 passed in july 2001 also would provide authorization for 60 million per year fy20022011 for valueadded agricultural production including establishment of agricultural innovation centers for technical assistance to valueadded enterprises valueadded production processing andor marketing could permit producers to increase the share of the household food dollar now captured by commodity marketers and upstream processors with increasing market segmentation highquality differentiated products hold some promise for expanding or preserving the role of agriculture in many rural areas while adding to regional economic diversity while the term is catchall phrase for variety of processes the growth areas of most valueadded agriculture are of two general types 1 valueadded food products that are perceived to offer consumers higher level of quality greater nutrition convenience or foods produced in particular ways eg organic and 2 industrial nonfood valueadded products derived from grains or oilseeds eg ethanol soy oil cornstarch thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs35 box 5 investments in valueadded agriculture study of the valueadded industry in illinois estimated that farmers growing specialty corn and soybeans

as far north as canada and west to the pacific coasttwo broad categories of valueadded agricultural products have potentially different implications for rural communities much current discussion of valueadded food products concerns either premium pricing for food products or valueadded food processing valueadded processing aims at capturing more of commoditys food value at the local level food processing is highly competitive global business requirin g constant product differentiation this type of valueadded production also tends to be labor intensive and to require more skilled workers especially in product development and marketing small innovative firms may be particularly capable of developing this type of production for both domestic and international markets for example valueadded production of genetically modified proprietary commodity or food produced through organic systems are also examples of enhanced economic value for which consumers are willing to pay premium over similar but undifferentiated products the policy question that arises for rural communities is whether valueadded food processing offers as viable development path for communities as it might offer enhance d opportunities for particular farmers industrial valueadded agricultural production uses considerably larger volume of agricultural commodities than does valueadded food production but this type of production tends to be capital intensive and may employ fewer and lowerskilled workers relative to the investment needed or the value of the output cornderived ethanol as gasoline blending ingredient is probably the best known example of an industrial value added business but variety of other products are also possible that may have industrial uses eg starch corn gluten corn starch based packaging eg packing peanuts and packing made from pulp flax straw and strawbased particle board are other examples of industrial valueadded agriculture to the extent that industrial value added plants are owned by outside firms the effects on rural development could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs36 67experience in sweden also suggests that onfarm processing strengthens the

international association of agricultural economists 182 1998 68witness statement at field hearing of the house agricultural committee sioux falls south dakota may 2 2000 69the term valueadded has historically referred to manufacturing in the sense used here however agricultural products grown in particular ways or that contain some particular characteristic that produces price premium to the grower over the standard commodity is also added value more limited than for example producerowned valueadded cooperatives these socalled new generation cooperatives are focused more on creating and supplying emerging niche markets these coops create dual contracts where farmers are obligated to deliver certain amount of commodity and the cooperative is obligated to buy the commodity new generation coops have been organized to process alfalfa bison carrots cattle and milk among other products industrial valueadded agriculture may make an excellent economic fit for some rural areas especially those farmingdependent areas with large supplies of bulk commodities67 for example in the red river valley in minnesota sugar beet growers cooperative purchased processing plants 2530 years ago that today employ 1800 unionized workers68 box 5 lists examples of other industrial valueadded agricultural businesses as the agrofood system continues to segment globally and new demands are placed on food products by consumers other opportunities for highend food products may open for innovative alternative agricultural production systems and their surrounding rural communities valueadded foods grown and processed organically regionallybranded food products and foods that can be produced and locally marketed within metro areas could provide significant new opportunities for agricultural innovatio n69 small innovative farms and valueadded agricultural business located within metro regions could find their location ideal for growing small business growing and marketing products to ethnic communities might also provide new markets for growers within commuting distances to urban markets internet marketing may also be an option for more remote farms and communities

production are likely to become more important in the future with populations becoming more clustered around urban and suburban areas agriculture is finding itself under new regulatory pressures which may also create new opportunities for valueadded agriculture in food products variety of new community and regional growth planning mechanisms in many areas of the country have recently been subsumed under the general term of smart growth planning these programs are originating at local regional and state levels regional smart growth symposia have been held in such high growth areas as atlanta and south florida and others are planned for chicago and colorado while smart growth planning can describe wide range of land use policies there are four general principles that unify this perspec tive on regional growth first smart growth legislation tends to encourage and support mixeduse land development ie integrating industrial housing and retail uses rather than zoning them into separate areas as much older growth planning advocated second smart growth policies generally favor locating new development within center cities and their older suburbs rather than spreading out into fringe areas third the emphasis on increasing density in already builtup areas has meant planning at scale capable of producing pedestrianfriendly neighborhoods with greater emphasis on public transit fourth smart growth policies place strong value on preserving and enhancing critical environmental areas especially farmland and open space preservation72 it is this latter emphasis that has most relevance to nonmetropolitan areas smart growth initiatives in many urban and suburban areas have implications for agriculture to the extent such initiatives become more widely adopted they may be expected to further influence agriculture and farmland in and near metro regions programs that help preserve farmland can help maintain viable local agriculture through purchase of development rights pdr and transfer of development rights local areas can help ensure that farmland is preserved the usdas economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs38 research service has identified 1062 counties that have land subject to some degree of urban influence many of these counties also contain significant amounts of crop and pastureland while some observers have pointed to various green payment proposals as means of both helping maintain farming preservation as well as supporting farm household income smart growth policies in conjunction with alternative agricultural production systems might also play role in producing new agriculture products to meet urban and suburban needs farmers markets are common in many urban and suburban areas other direct marketing arrangeme nts are also possible in metro areas the small farm entrepreneurial developm ent initiative was one policy recommendation in the national commission on small farms 1998 report time to act this initiative was conceived as way to preserve farming and farmland the initiative also pointed to the value of agricultural preservation in narrowing the distance between consumer and producer with growth in organic markets and concern with food safety discussed earlier direct marketing of farm products could become an important rural development strategy for many areas producing highervalue agricultural products such as lowinput or certified organic products grassfed beef and regionally branded products could stimulate development of new agricultural practices that are compatible with suburban smartgrowth policies and urban proximity by restricting state funding to those areas designated as high growth smart growth policies might lower conversion pressures on farmland by driving up the costs of development outside designated growth areas for farmdependent counties and other areas heavily reliant on the production of bulk commodi ties other environmentally related innovations could present additional growth opportunities although much research remains to be done carbon sequestration ie storing atmospheric carbon dioxide within soils or biomass has been suggested by some as valuable environmental amenity suitable for agricultural areas not only does carbon sequestration help build up the carbon content of soils it may offer new sources of income to growers as an environmental resource for reducing major greenhouse gas bioplastics and biofuels also offer some potential for agriculturallybased environmental innovations while agricultural research service research is at basic stage new agricultural crops with environmentally useful characteristics might offer growers new markets cuphe native to temperate regions of the us offers some potential to replace oils currently used in detergents and other industrial products eg coconut and palm oil vernonia oil epoxy oil has the potential to replace solvents in paints and become part of the finished coating which could reduce pollution from solvents meadowfoam limanthes alba has been modified chemically to develop new products for personal care lubricants and detergent industries crambe is currently grown in north dakota with development of new markets for its oil and meal the crop could become an important industrial crop new products for jojoba commercially raised for its oil and exported to europe and japan might have greater commercial

supplies soy oil is proving to be valuable substitute73 creating and expanding new opportunities may require reconsidering how agriculture is integrated into overall rural development trajectories and how it might become better integrated and better positioned within rural and regional economies under current structural conditions it is difficult to see how the trend toward reduced farming activities will change under different policies however it is possible to see agriculture becoming more viable part of rural development as well as source of business innovation in many parts of the us although agricultures role will differ in the overall economic mix of region if there exists social objective of maintaining farms and farming communities within larger regional economies public policies that help create and support new competitive advantages for agriculture as part of comprehensive policy for rural america are likely to be decisive current legislation the 107th congress has shown considerably interest in agricultural innovation and valueadded agricultu re hr 2402 the agricultural producers marketi ng assistance act would provide grants to assist valueadded businesses by

assistance to value added agricultural businesseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs40 conclusions perhaps central question in any discussion of rural policy is what is the rural issue about which policy makers the public and the private sector should be concerned is it that many rural communities lag behind urban areas on list of various socioeconomic indicators is it poverty is it simple economic growth in nonmetro regions or something more broadly called community development is it the conservation and preservation of rural social economic physical and environmental capital corollary question is whether existing policies reinforce current competitive advantages in rural areas or exacerbate disadvantages are rural polices helping rural areas organize and direct local resources to create new competitive advantage do current farm polices which rely heavily on commodity support help or hinder the development of economically viable communities inasmuch as rural communities will have to respond to complex social and macroeconomic issues far outside their control is developing local capacity for managing future change useful way of thinking about the goals of rural policy while such questions defy simple answers they may help frame discussion of how changing global agrofood system and rural america are altering the effectiveness of current policies and point to where public policy might assist rural communities and residents in building on their own distinctive capacities to encourage new investment and new opportunities rural policy today is not characterized by an integrated set of federal programs designed for rural people more often than not most federal rural programs have been modest extensions of programs designed for urban areas eg department of transportation environmental protection agency departmen t of interior when agriculture dominated rural economie s policies that strengthened and improved agriculture tended to strengthen and improve much of rural america although the agricultu rerural development linkage has declined significantly rural development policy has not evolved into an integrated set of programs usda is the lead agency in coordinating federal rural policy and still has the largest budget of any federal agency directed toward rural development issues even though social transfer payments eg social security medicare put more federal funds into rural areas than any program past congressional action has recognized the importance of policy integration and federal coordination but these initiatives were not fully implemented the 1996 farm bill pl104127 for example called for establishment of an interagency working group comprised of seniorlevel officials from all federal agencies providin g services in rural areas more recently the congressional rural caucus emphasiz ed the fragmentation of rural policy in their recommendations for appointment of special assistant to the president for rural affairs and for designation of rural policy leadership within each federal department these initiatives have not been fully realized for rural areas adjacent to metro regions it may not be unreasonable to consider how strengthening and improving urban and older suburban areas could be as important facto rural policy as any policy targeting rural areas specifically rural areas adjacent to urban areas where small and medium size towns exist are sites of the most dynamic nonmetro growth and diversification today little on the horizon suggests that this dynamic is likely to change significantly in the coming decade smarthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs41 growth policies could reinforce it for such territorial approach to be effective metro areas would have to integrate the nonmetro adjacent areas into their development planning decisions which raises political jurisdictional issues but thinking of rural areas in conjunction with urban and suburban planning and vice versa could offer new opportunities for rural development generally and for metro and urbanfringe agriculture particularly were agricultural to be better integrated into regional economic and environmental development strategies innovations in diversified valueadded farming operations supported by new marketing channels represent niche business opportunities that could contribute to the overall economic mix in nonmetro regions within commuting distances of urban areas the kinds of agricultural and business infrastructure and services that such agricultural production might require however may be different from that which has long supported traditional commodity agricultural production for remote rural areas the problems are more daunting sparse populations spread over wide distances make the provision of public services and the construction and maintenance of new infrastructure extremely expensive agricultural areas however even those predominantly reliant on production of bulk commodities could develop more valueadded innovati ons suggested by the structural changes noted above eg identity preserved commodities for supply chain production producer owned cooperatives have venerable history in rural america innovative business models that build on that tradition might offer new opportunities for producers in farmdependent areas rural development policy today remains focused primarily on the agricultural and manufacturing sectors while this served many rural areas well in the past it is matter of debate whether such sectoral focus provides the most effective coherent and comprehensive policy perspec tive for the future to the extent that rural revitalization is an important public objective farm policy is unlikely to be the major vehicle by which such revitalization can be accomplished such concerns however do not mean that the traditional rural economy of agriculture mining and timbering can be ignored to the contrary agriculture will remain an important economic sector in many nonmetro areas and it will be critical in farmingdependent areas restructuring and invigorating agriculture will be very much part of any comprehensive rural policy farming operations in metro regions especially smaller and moderatesized operations should also be part of any comprehensive development and planning policies however new policies that also focus on rural areas as distinctive if varied geographies containing mix of economic activity and future possibility might open different development paths and new competitive advantages comprehensive rural development policies that improve the capacities of rural areas to meet future challenges should help to strengthen the agricultural sector within these local economies successful commercial farms will most likely continue to grow in size and to supply most of the bulk commodities sold domesticall and internationally the evolution of supply chains over the next decade is likely to further change the relation between these farms and their surrounding communities if goal of public policy is to enhance the potential of agriculture throughout metro and nonmetro regions publicly funded research on alternative production systems and new marketing channels might be consideration publicly funded research to enhance farmershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs42 valueadded activities might also improve some farm household incomes how such businesses might also improve the general wellbeing of rural areas is unclear although to the extent that farmers are able to capture greater share of the value chain at the site of production the local profit picture is likely to improve other farms the vast majority of which do not make significant contributions to traditional agricultural production may benefit from assistance to become more effective producers and marketers under alternative production systems given the increased concern over the costs and distributional inequities in current farm payment programs the congress is likely to consider how farm polices might be redesigned to strengthen agriculture within the mix of rural economic activities perhaps targeting payments where they may have more important community effects rather than to areas where they have little impact on development planning regional policies that better link urban suburban and rural geographies may create new costs but also contribute to new benefits in jobs infrastructure and education in the past competitive agriculture sector and later growing manufacturing sector were seen as the way to establish and maintain rural prosperity and wellbeing rapidly changing global agrofood system and new rural realities suggest that policies more directly targeted to building new competitive advantages in rural america can only become assets to whatever forms agricultural production might assume in coming years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31172crs43 74the legislative provisions listed and briefly summarized
