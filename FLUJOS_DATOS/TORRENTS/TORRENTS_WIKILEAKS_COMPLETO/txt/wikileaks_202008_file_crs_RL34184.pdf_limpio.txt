consider variety of options including granting another extension making the incentive permanent allowing it to expire or repealing the recapture requirement until recently information on the extent of use of the brownfields tax incentive could not be determined from federal income tax returns use of new tax form schedule m3 for corporati ons and partnerships with assets over 10 million began being phased in with tax year 2004 the fi rst of those data covering the 2004 tax year became available in february 2007 they showed that section 198 environmental remediation costs of 295 million were repor ted by 110 corporations out of population of 5557965 corporate return s this information is understated because it excluded more than half of all corporations and all partnerships to take advantage of the tax break veloper has to obtain certification from the state environmental agency that the site qualifies as brownfield crs surveyed the agencies of all states in 2003 and ag ain in 2007 to ask how many certification applications they had received and appr oved in 2003 27 states reported that they had received total of 161 applications since enactme nt in 1997 of which 147 were approved in 2007 29 states reported that they had received 175 applications over the previous four years of which 170 we re approved the results were somewhat surprising before enactment in 1997 the tr easury department nd the environmental protection agency had expected it to be used as many as 10000 times per year accordingly crs also asked the state agencies four private developers and the editor of trade publication for their views on why the tax incentive was so little used there was divided opinion on the utility of the tax incentive and criticism of its stopandgo nature due to its expiration and renewal ev ery one or two years the schedule m3 data for firms with more than 10 million in assets confirm the crs survey findings of modest use of the sec tion 198 brownfields tax incentive the tax form was fully phased in with tax year 2006 and full informati on will be available in february 2009 however as discussed in this report it appears that the section 198 tax break is

first enacted in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 and has been extended f our times most recently in 2006 the provision is intended as stimulus to the development of brownfields by allowing developers to recoup some of their cleanup costs there is now more information available to the congress as it considers the future of section 198 than was available when previous extensions were enacted the 110th congress may consider another shortterm or longterm extension making the tax extension permanent or allowing it to expire another possibility is to repeal the recapture provision the brownfields problem brownfield is comme rcial or industrial site that is abandoned or underutilized and where redeve lopment has not occurred because of the presence or perception of the presence of haza rdous substances and the fear of the accompanying liability for the costs of environmental cleanup these are not traditional superfund sites wh ich are the nations worst hazardous waste locations generally though not always they are not highly contaminated and therefore present lower risks to health and cost comparatively less to clean up than superfund sites in 2004 report the environmental pr otection agency epa estimated that there are between 500000 and 1 million brownf ield sites though how many would require cleanup to make them safe for reuse is unknown based on information from epas brownfield assistance progra ms 70 of them 350000 700000 might require some degree of cleanup expenditure1 using rough estimates epa also calculated that total expenditures at state sites excluding those on the superfund national pr iorities list by both public and private entities have been about 1 billi on annually in recent years during this same period cleanup has been accomplished at about 5000 st ate and private party sites per yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs2 2 ibid pp 918 919 3 for more information see crs report rs22575 brownfield issues in the 110th congress by mark

pl 108357 it allows taxexempt investor suc h as pension fund foundation or university to invest in brownfields and not treat the gains as taxable unrelated business income provided it incurs cleanup costs of at leas t 550000 or at least 12 of the propertys fair market value whichever is greater and also meets other requirements this paper does not address that provision 6 for purposes of the tax incentive brownfield site qualified contaminated site is property held for use in trade or business for the production of income or as inventory where there has been release or threat of release or disposal of hazardous substance sites on the superfund national priorities list are excluded 26 usc 198cat this rate 150000 sites would be cleaned up at cost of 30 billion over the next 30 years which was the time horizon of the epa report2 to help address this problem congre ss enacted epas brownfields program of grants and technical assistance3 and also relaxed cer tain superfund liability provisions established brightfields monstration program fo r brownfield sites redeveloped using solar energy technolog ies authorized taxexempt facility bonds for qualified green building and sustaina

the tax incentive the section 198 brownfields6 tax incentive expires on december 31 2007 first enacted as part of the taxpayer re lief act of 1997 pl 10534 the incentive allows taxpayer to fully deduct the costs of environmental cleanups in the year the costs were incurred called expensing rather than spreading the costs over period of years capitalizing its purpose is to encourage deve lopers to rehabilitate sites where environmental c ontamination stands in the way of bringing unproductive properties back into use the provision has direct application for public sector entities such as municipalities that develop brownfields and do not pay income taxes to take advantage of the brownfields tax incentive th developer of property has to obtain statement from the state environmental agency that the parcel is qualified contaminated sit as defined in the lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs3 7 the tax incentive has been extended four times in the ticket to work and work incentives

512b19 allowing taxexempt entities to invest in brownfields without incurring unrelated business income tax significant factor concerning the tax incentive is that it is subject to recapture this means that the gain realized from the value of the property when it is later sold must be taxed as ordinary income rather than at the generally lower capital gains rate to the extent of the expensing allowance previously claimed this dilutes the benefit of the ta x break and has the effect of simply postponing certain amount of the developers ta x liability until the property is resold as stimulus to development the overall value of the brownfields tax break is dependent on number of factors including the total co st of the project the cost of cleanup how long the developer intends to hold the property before selling it and the developers individual tax situation repeal of the r ecapture provision has been favored by the real estate roundtable and its partner ssociations representing various aspects of the real estate industry architects build ing owners and managers mortgage bankers general contractors and othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs4 8 revenue ruling 9438 9 see eg

environmental law and policy review spring 2002 pp 616618 and bruce keye s brownfield transactions urban land june 2005 p 36 10 see footnote 7background of the incentive federal tax law generally requires that the cost of improvements to property must be deducted over period of years whereas other expenses such as repairs may be deducted in the same year they are incurred being able to deduct the costs in the year when they are incurred is financial benefit to the taxpayer 1994 ruling by the internal revenue service8 irs held that the costs of cleaning up contaminated land and groundwater are deductible in the current year but only for the person who contaminated the land in addition the cleanup would have to be done without any anticipation of putting th land to new use further any monitoring equipment with useful life beyond the year it was acquired would have to be capitalized on the other hand pe rson who acquired previously contaminated land such as brownfield site would have to capitalize the costs of cleanup spreading them out over number of years some have noted that this is somewhat perverse situation that works against one who would want to buy and clean up contaminated property and put it to use9 cleanup costs are major barrier to rede velopment of contaminated land the taxpayer relief act of 1997 wh ich included the brownfield s tax incentive thus had the effect of expanding benefits and llowing developers who had not caused the contamination to deduct clea nup costs from their taxable income in the current year rather than having to capitalize them as initially enacted the brownfields tax incentive was available only to property that was located in targeted area the law defined targeted area as census tract with greater than 20 povert an adjacent commercial or industrial census tract an empowerment zone or terprise community or one of the 76 brownfields to which epa had awarded brownfield grant at that time congress repealed the targeted area geographic restrictions and extended the tax break to all brownfields qualif ied contaminated sites in the consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106170 since fy2003 the administrations budg et proposals have proposed making the tax incentive permanent it has been in effect continuously since its enactment in 1997 and has been extended four times10 most recently in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 division title i 109 this extension through 2007 which was enacted on decem ber 20 2006 was made retroactive to december 31 2005 when the previous ex tension expired epa supports the permanent extension as does the real tate roundtable and its partners noted abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs5 this 2006 enactment also broadened the definition of hazar dous substances to include petroleum products i ncluding crude oil crude oil condensates and natural gasoline for purposes of the tax incentiv but not for any other part of the superfund act sources of information until recently there was official inform ation available at the federal level on the extent of use of the 198 provision it did not have its own separate line on either individual or corporat federal income tax forms which is why crs was first asked to perform the state survey in 2003 in 2004 the irs introduced new form schedule m3 which provides information for the first time on the use of the section 198 brownfields tax incentive schedule m3 only large and midsize businesses corpor ations and partners hips with total assets of 10 million or more are required to file the ne w schedule m3 with their returns use of the schedule was phased in and in the first year of use tax year 2004 for returns submitted in 2005 only some co rporations and partnerships were required to file it those corporations that did use it were not required to complete the whole form and part of the informa tion on the brownfields tax incentive was in the optional part of schedule m3 numbe r of corporations completed it anyway the results for 2004 only recently becam available and show section 198 remediation costs of 294970000 reported by 110 corporati ons out of population of 5557965 corporate returns this information is obviously limited since the response for 2004 excluded more than half the corpora tions and all the partnerships response on the brownfields tax incentive was at the corporations discretion and it was limited to those companies with assets of 10 million or more also the data show how much the 110 corporations spent on cleanup costs but do not reveal at how many brownfields the money was spent the compilation of data from tax year 2005 when reporting was mandatory for all corpora tions is ongoing and will be available to the public in february 2008 partnerships with assets over 10 million were required to use schedule m3 beginning with tax year 2006 and those results will be available in february 2009 even when fully phased i n though the form will not be applied to entities with assets under 10 million for more information on schedule m3 see appendix crs survey findings crs surveyed the appropriate environm ental agency in each state in 2003 and again in 2007 to determine the number of br ownfield certifications they had issued in 2003 27 states reported that since the enactment of the provision in august 1997 until the time of the survey in aprilj une 2003 they had received total of 161 requests for certification of which 147 were approved and 14 were denied twenty three states reported receiving formal

which 170 were granted twentyone states received requests there were four additional states that received and ap proved requests in 20032007 new mexico colorado west virginia and new hampshir and two that had received requests in the 2003 survey but none in the 2007 survey georgia and kentucky the 175 requests are equivalent to just under 44 per year for 20032007 in the earlier period august 1997 to spring 2003 th average was about 28 per year the statebystate responses are presented in table 2 while this is significant increase on percentage basis about 57 the numbers are far below what was anticipated prior to the original enactment of the tax break in 1997 according to hearing stimony epa and the treasury department expected the incentive to be used at 30000 sites over the 3year life of the incentive 10000 sites per year but as of summer 1999 it had been used at only couple dozen sites11 the conference report accompanying the 1997 bill estimated the budget effect of the provision as costing the treasury 417 million over 5 years 834 million per year12 in 1999 as congress was considering making the tax incentive permanent treasury estimated it would be used to clean up 18000 brownfields over the next 10 years 1800 per year the partment anticipated that the loss in revenue resulting from the tax incentive would be 600 million for 5 years 120 million per year and that it would induce an additional 7 billion in private investment13 the conference report in that year estimated reve nue loss of 114 million over 5 years 228 million per year14 comments of state agencies and developers because of this discrepancy between ex pectations and the apparent results crs asked the state agency repr esentatives who responded to the survey for their opinions as to why so few brownfield developers were taking advantage of the tax incentive crs also contacted four private develope rs and the editor of brownfields tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs7 15 charles bartsch vice president icf inte rnational washington dc todd davis ceo hemisphere development cleveland ohio bruce keyes partner foley lardner milwaukee wisconsin jonathan philips seni or director cherokee investment partners raleigh north carolina and john spizzirri managing editor brownfield news chicago illinoispublication to solicit their viewpoints on the subject as well15 summary of their comments follows land development is large and di verse industry there is only very limited number of developers who specialize in brownfields the size of brownfield projects ranges from one acre to about thousand acres 25 to 50 acres is typical they take longer to complete probably double the time of nonbrownfield development because environmental cleanup can be unpredictable several respondent s felt that the incentive doesnt offer that much financial benefit especially when one considers the recapture provision and particularly if the property is sold in the short term it is not driving factor that will tip the decision toward cleanup also number of states offer ta x breaks and other incentives that are more generous than the federal incentive which by comparison may not seem worth the effort on the other hand one developer observed that it was necessary to have the right circumstances to successfully use the section 198 incentive depending on the proj ect and the tax status of the different investors he indicated it might be more advantageous to employ other tax strategies anot her agreed that the benefit was meaningful especially when used at larger site it is another way to make deal incrementally successful the provision has been extended only for periods of year or two at time and twice the extensions were partially retroactive since it had expired before the extension was passed this onagain off again history creates uncertainty regarding its future availability and makes it difficult for developers to plan particularly for largescale multiyear projects even smalle r projects can encounter unforseen delays pushing them past the provisions end date and causing forfeiture of anticipated benefits for an economically marginal project this uncertainty could be enough to decide against going forward one state official mentioned that at times he was unsure of the incentives status which made him reluctant to recommend it lack of information about the incentives availability was also blamed for the level of use sometimes this was accompanied by criticism of epa for insufficient leadership although it was alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs8 16 merrill feldstein senior counsel for income tax and accounting internal revenue service telephone conversation july 24 2007acknowledged that the agency had improved in recent years some states also recognized their own shortcomings in promoting the incentive few mentioned that the new eligibility of petroleum contaminated sites might increase its use one developer observed that publicity or an outreach prog ram aimed at accountants might be what was needed another commented that even after 10 years the provision remained somewhat esoter ic and even tax advisors were not all aware of it corollary of the previous point is that it is possible that many developers especially smaller ones are unaware of both the 1994 irs ruling and the existence of the section 198 brownfields tax incentive these persons would simply claim their environmental cleanup costs on their tax returns in the same way they claimed other development costs the irs authority on section 198 said that she found this plausible and while th ere is direct information on how much it is used an indirect indicator is that she has received inquiries from irs auditors about taxpayers who use the incentive16 one state thought it was possible th at developers used the agencys milestone letters cer tifying that the developer has reached certain point in the cleanup pro cess for other purposes including supporting their income tax returns few states mentioned that llcs limited liability companies are sometimes created for brownfield projects in the first few years when the environmental cleanup w ould be carried out they would have income tax so th incentive would be useless congressional action in the 110th congress one bill has been intr oduced that addresses section 198 hr 1753 makes the brownfields tax incen tive permanent and repeals the recapture provision introduced by representatives jerry weller and xavier becerra on march 29 2007 the bill was referred to the ways and means committee there has been further actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs9 conclusion crs conducted the interviews before learning of the existence of schedule m3 none of the interviewees knew of the form either judging by the conversations the early information from the new irs form shows that the brownfields tax incentive is indeed being used by large and midsize businesses and somewhat more than the survey indicated the number of corporati ons reporting its use are likely to rise from 110 as other corporations and partners hips begin filing the m3 there w ill also continue to be an unknown num ber of smaller businesses w ith total assets of less than 10 million that will take advantage of section 198 the survey showed an average of about 44 brownfield certifications per year in 20032007 and the irs form revealed that 110 corporations repor ted deductions for cleanup costs of 295 million in 2004 an average of 268 million per company one would expect but there is way to know that the companies worked on more than one site each the schedule m3 data confirm the surv ey findings that the provision is not used as much as was expected when s ection 198 first became law nevertheless these first results show that 295 milli on was reported as deduction item on schedule m3 for tax purposes by the priv ate sector for cleaning up brownfields in 2004 and that was the goal of the provision to provide an incentive to bring contaminated lands back into produc tive use the 295 million figure is from voluntary reporting by only portion of the pertin ent taxpayer universe and it is very likely to increase now that the use of sche dule m3 is mandatory for all corporations and partnerships there is probably way to measure wh ether the tax incentive has proven to be the reason why any certain number of brownf ields have been cleaned up nor are we likely to know if repeal of the recapture provision would lead to more cleanups at economically marginal sites the best observation may be what the interviewed developers said that it can be useful tool in some circumstances in putting brownfield remediationland development deal together in that sense brownfield supporters note that it has been help in cleaning up the half million or more brownfield sites around the united states it should be remembered that there is certain unknown number of cleanups being accomplished by firms with assets under 10 million from the survey it does not seem that there are great many of them but it is also plausible that fair number are also being done by individua ls with knowledge of irss 1994 revenue ruling or the section 198 tax incentive and are simply treating their cleanup costs as normal development expenses factor that has sometimes affected the passage of the brownfields tax incentive is that it is one of number of tax credits deductions and taxpayer benefits that have all been considered together in recent years this group changes from year to year for

january 28 2004appendix brief description of schedule m317 in addition to their income tax returns corporate and partnership taxpayers are required to file fina ncial statements also called b alance sheets or books which provide an overview of businesss prof itability and financia l condition and permit comparisons both with the entitys financial statements of previous periods and with other taxpayers ideally businesss income tax return and its financial statement will agree with and be consistent with each other for variety of reasons adjustments must be made to reconcile the differences between financial accounting based books and records and the presen tation required for fe deral income tax return purposes schedule m1 reconciliation of income loss per books with income per return fulfilled this role for corporate tax returns of all sizes for over forty years18 schedule m1 is very short only 10 lines long19 as the national and international business environment evolve d and tax and financial issues became more complex over the last four decades m1 proved less and less useful the major purpose of the form is to flag which return s should be examined further and possibly audited but as more and more information was aggregated into m1s 10 lines its strength as an analytical tool declined consequently schedule m 3 was developed for use by large and midsize businesses those with total assets of 10 million or more compared to the 10 items of information collected on the m1 the new m3 collects about 300 data points on more than 75 lines20 the additional information enables the irs to more easily identify returns that may be using questionable means aggressive transactions as they are sometimes referred to to reduce their tax burden it also increases efficiency by allowing prompt identification of returns that do not require further review the increased transparency should have deterrent effect as well21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34184crs17 22 boynton defilippes and legel p 945 23 except forms 1120ric and 1120reit which will never use schedule m3on broader level the new m3 provides wealth of in formation for research and can bring to light trends that irs may wish to investigate further another feature of the m3 that irs views as particularly significant is the forms distinction between temporary nd permanent differences it has been explained as follows temporary timing differences occur because tax laws require the recognition of some items of income and expense in different periods than are required for book purposes temporary differences originate in one period and reverse or terminate in one or more subsequent periods by their very nature they involve i ssues regarding the correct year for the items inclusion in income or deduction as an expense from tax administration standpoint they concer n the time value of money purely temporary differences are generally low risk for tax administration and important in terms of the magnitude of the difference and the time before the temporary difference turns because of the time value of money in contrast to temporary differences permanent differences are adjustments that arise as result of fundamental permanent differences in financial and tax accounting rules those differences result from transactions that will not reverse in subsequent periods permanent differences have the potential to substantially influence reported earnings per share computations and in the case of public companies stock prices accordingly permanent differences of comparable size generally have greater audit risk than temporary differences22 schedule m3 was phased in for tax ear 2004 for firms reporting total assets greater than 10 million filing the regular fo rm 1120 corporation income tax return the m3 is optional for firms with total assets less than 10 million some of these firms did report an m3 it was not used for the following return types 1120s for s corporations 1120l
