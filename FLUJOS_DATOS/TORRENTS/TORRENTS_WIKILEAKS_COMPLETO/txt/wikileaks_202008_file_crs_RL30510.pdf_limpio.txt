of defense dod manages the worlds largest dedicated infrastructure covering over 40000 square miles of land and physical plant worth over 500 billion the military construction appropriations bill provides large part of the funding to maintain this infrastructure the bill funds construction projects and real property maintenance of the active army navy marine corps air force and their reserve components defensewide construction us contributions to the nato security investment program formerly called the nato infrastructure program and military family housing operations and construction the bill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure brac account which finances most base realignment and closure costs including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions and environmental cleanup at closing sites the military construction appropriations bill is only one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense other major legislation includes 1 the defense appropriations bill that provides funds for all military activities of the department of defense except for military construction 2 the national defense

defense authorization and appropriation process defense1 and 3 the energy and water development appropriations bill that provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy two other appropriations bills vahudindependent agencies and commercejusticestate also include small amounts for national defense in addition the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funds for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defense appropriation measures described above therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues including military construction can be also found in the authorization bill since issues in the defense authorization and appropriations bills intertwine this report highlights salient parts of the authorization bill along with the military construction appropriation process the separate military construction appropriations bill dates to the late 1950s when large defense buildup occurred in response to intercontinental ballistic missile threats and the soviet launch of sputnik defense construction spending soared as facilities were hardened missile silos were constructed and other infrastructure was built the appropriations committees established the military construction subcommittees to deal with this new level of activity consequently the separate military construction bill was created the first standalone military construction bill was in fy1959 pl 85852 previously military construction funding was provided through annual defense appropriations or supplemental appropriations bills military construction appropriations are the major but not the sole source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies the defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenance accounts in addition funds for construction and maintenance of morale welfare and recreationrelated facilities are partially provided through proceeds of commissaries recreation user fees and other income most funds appropriated by congress each year must be obligated in that fiscal year military construction appropriations are an exception since these funds are generally made available for obligation for five fiscal years consideration of the military construction budget starts when the presidents budget is delivered to congress early each year for fy2001 the president requested 80 billion in funding for the military construction

key policy issues ongoing congressional concerns longterm planning for military construction throughout the 1990s congress and administration have debated whether military construction funding and longterm planning are adequate members of congress have complained that poor planning and insufficient funding on the pentagons part have made it difficult for congress to insure that military construction plans meet pressing priorities the department of defense uses formal process called the planning programming and budgeting system ppbs to create its budget for congress4 the ppbs process is also used to prepare dods internal longterm financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future years defense plan fydp during the 1990s congress has criticized the pentagons longterm planning for military constructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30510crs6 in hearings on the fy2001 military construction request legislators expressed continuing concern over military construction planning and the sufficiency of funding rep joel hefley chair of the military installations and facilities subcommittee of the house armed services committee hasc argued at hearing on march 2 2000 that the fy2001 budget request like the previous fy199700 requests continues the poor planning and downward trend for military construction budgets for the fy19972001 military construction requests the administration requested fewer funds than it had programmed in its budget assumptions in the previous years fydp this mismatch between plans and funding was cited in the congressional criticism of the pentagons military construction planning since the fydp and the requested amount decreases each year for military construction mr hefley states that he is finding it difficult to take pentagon future plans for military construction seriously that sentiment was echoed by the senate appropriations military construction subcommittee chair sen conrad burns who expressed dismay at the kind of long term planning seen in the fy2001 military construction proposal at the march 2nd hasc hearing randall yim deputy under secretary of defense installations outlined new dod approach to installation management in response to the subcommittees concerns about planning yim established an installation policy board consisting of the senior service facilities leaders senior service engineers and representatives from financing and program communities this board chaired by yim meets monthly to peer review and audit installation requirements to develop common standards between services and to provide forum for dodwide installations issues yim outlined three analytical tools that the installation policy board is developing for more efficient planning the first is facilities strategic plan so dod knows what type of facilities are needed in the future the second is the facilities sustainment model which uses auditable data to model and identify the funds needed to keep facilities in good working order the final tool is an installation readiness reporting system so that installation readiness can be considered as part of operational readiness decisions reauthorization of the military housing privatization initiative dod is requesting that congress amend section 2885 title 10 usc to extend the military housing privatization initiative mhpi pilot program for an addition five years the mhpi is set to expire in february 2001 the dod believes the authorities that the mhpi provides will contribute significantly to its plan to solve its housing situation by 2010 when combined with traditional governmentfunded construction the defense authorization conference report for fy 2001 hrept 106945 approved an extension of these authorities in section 2806 for an additional 3year period from february 2001 to december 2004 background on problems in military fam ily housing in testimony to the house armed services committee on march 16 2000 the official in charge of dod installations randall yim described the continuing problem of military family housing he stated that approximately twothirds of dods nearly 300000 family housing units need extensive renovation or replacement yim also testified that fixinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30510crs7 5 for more detailed information on the authorities see the dods privatization of

venture initiative cvi navy publicprivate venture ppv and air force housing privatization program 7 for details on awarded solicited and planned privatization projects see httpwwwacqosdmilinstallationhrso0100qreporthtmthis problem using only traditional military construction methods would take 30 years and cost as much as 16 billion in his testimony yim emphasized that privatization of military family housing is just one part of three part program to fix the dod housing problem by 2010 two other important components are increasing housing allowances to eliminate out ofpocket costs for servicemembers and strong military construction program increasing the housing allowance will reduce demand for onbase housing and traditional governmentfunded construction program will continue to help fix onbase housing definition of mhpi authorities recognizing the severity of the family housing problem congress passed the military housing privatization initiative in the fy1996 defense authorization act pl 104106 this gave the pentagon new authorities to obtain private sector financing and expertise for military housing the authorities are guarantees both loan and rental conveyance or lease of existing property and facilities differential lease payments investments both limited partnerships and stockbond ownership and direct loans the legislation enabled the new authorities to be used individually or in combination5 history on use of mhpi authorities yim gave the history of dods implementation of the mhpi in the early days of using these authorities 1996 1998 the department of defenses housing revitalization support office hrso coordinated the application of the new authorities and oversaw all aspects of the process from initial site visits to final solicitation during this phase said yim significant strides were made in developing program criteria financial models legal documents and budget scoring guidelines only two onbase projects reached the solicitation stage however largely due to problems in dods centralized management structure in october 1998 the pentagon changed tactics and devolved the execution of housing privatization projects to the services6 to date there have been four projects awarded andor completed twelve projects solicited and fourteen planned using the mhpi process7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30510crs8 8 us general

continued concerns in implementing the privatization initiative gao report number nsiad0071 march 2000 this report is also available on the gao web site httpwwwgaogovevaluation of mhpi progress of the privatization initiative has been slow representative gene taylor ranking member of the military installations and facilities subcommitte of the hasc stated at the march 16 2000 hearing that congress has been disappointed with the pace of privatization implementation taylor hoped that dod will be able to find the right mix of public and private funding and that the housing privatization concept will live up to its promise of providing high quality housing for our troops and their families the general accounting office gao highlighted some concerns with the privatization initiative when it reviewed dods military housing situation in july 19988 initial evaluation of lifecycle costs of privatized housing versus traditional military housing showed potential savings of only about 10 or less the proposed longterm time horizons for some privatization projects of 50 years or more raised concerns that the housing might not be needed that far into future also the gao argued that pentagon planning for military housing remains poor gao stated that housing requirements are not integrated with particular facilities and community needs that the plans underutilize the use of local housing and that there is poor communication between offices responsible for housing allowances and military housing construction gao recommended that comprehensive better integrated plans could help maximize the privatization initiative while minimizing total housing costs march 2000 gao followup study on the privatization initiative9 reported that since projects under the initiative have been fully implemented there is little basis to evaluate whether the initiative will ultimately achieve its goals of eliminating inadequate housing more economically and faster than could be achieved through traditional military construction financing also the gao points out that the dod does not have an evaluation plan to assess the initiative the gao recommended that the dod create privatization evaluation plan to be used consistently by all the services the plan should include performance measures such as evaluation of each authority comparison of actual to estimated costs of projects assessment of developer performance collection of data on the use and satisfaction of housing by service members dod agreed with gaos recommendations and has begun to create an evaluation plan privatization initiative for utility infrastruc ture yim testified on march 16th that dod is pursuing utility privatization through the authority of section 2871 of title 10 for cost savings and recapitalization of aging infrastructure the dod would like to privatize 1700 utility systems by 2003 in order have public and private sector experts run and upgrade these systems according to best business practices httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30510crs9 this authority requires that the longterm economic benefit of utility privatization exceeds the longterm economic and utility services costs to date 12 systems at 7 installations have been privatized representing savings of more than 10 million according to dod through this authority dod divests ownership of the utility system ie wires and pipes where it is economically feasible in certain locations and markets energy management may be included in proposal in order to offer the best value to the government to give incentives to dod installations to privatize utilities the dod is asking congress to amend this utility privatization authority with the proposed change the services would be able to keep savings generated by utility privatization in their installations instead of the savings going to the general treasury history and context the funding pattern for military construction budgets in recent years congress has added significant amounts to annual administration military construct ion budget requests this has been recurring pattern in the 1990s the president proposes what congress calls an inadequate military construction budget especially for guard and reserve needs congress then adds funding for military construction with some attention to guard and reserve projects for example congress added 479 million in fy1996 850 million in fy1997 800 million in fy1998 and 875 million in fy1999 to the military construction accounts congressional additions to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s three themes explain the pattern of recurring congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcommittees have believed that military construction has been chronically underfunded this theme was echoed in hearings on the fy2001 budget and the reports from the house appropriatio ns committee and the defense authorizing committees on bills for fy19982000 second often congress has different priorities than the administration as reflected in frequent congressional cuts to overseas construction requests and contributions to the nato security investment program third other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floor debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that the pentagon counts on congress to add money to guard and reserve programs in recent years congress has added large amounts for national guard and reserve construction projects including peak amount of 4511 million in fy2000 see table 5 low military construction budgets has led to growing maintenance backlogs inadequate budgets for installation maintenance and conflict between congressional pentagon military construction priorities military construction proponents including facility advocates in the military services argue that military facilities have been systematically underfunded for many years for example gao reported its results of review of the management of real property assets by the dod and the services at march 1 2000 hearing to the house armed services subcommittee on readiness the review focused on properties that the services maintain and repair using operation and maintenance accounts the gao pointed out that congress hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30510crs10 10 sense of the senate provision is provision that requires approval by the senate but is not formally part of the bill and therefore does not have the force of law this type of provision expresses the sense of the senate on policy issues there can also be similar sense of the house and sense of the congress provisionsbeen concerned about the dods real property maintenance since the 1950s recently the backlog for deferred maintenance has grown from 89 billion in 1992 to 146 billion in 1998 also dod facility managers have not met their goal to allocate 3 of the plant replacement value of dod facilities for annual construction and maintenance called real property maintenance at the pentagon although this 3 goal is below the average for public facilities nationwide actual dod funding has typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value for example the navy testified on march 1 2000 to the house armed services subcommittee for readiness that the navy budgeted 18 for real property maintenance as result facility proponents welcome any congressional additions finally congressional military construction subcommittees authorization as well as appropriations subcommittees have frequent ly taken issue with administration military construction priorities in the early 1990s for example the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burdensharing contributions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects in addition congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements such as day care centers and barracks renovation congress has argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor of warfighting investments the debate over added projects since congress has added significant amounts to military construction budgets over the last 10 years congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize worthy additional projects in 1994 the senate debate on the military construction appropriations bill focused on the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraints on overall defense spending senator mccain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that the administration had not requested he argued that such projects largely represented pork barrel spending and came at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senate floor consideration of the military construction bill that year the managers accepted mccain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendment included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yet unbudgeted projects the mccain amendment was not incorporated into the final conference version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million for unrequested construction projects the national defense authorization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mccains criteria as sense of the senate provision10 providing that the unrequested projects should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30510crs11 1

appropriations committees have also used similar criteria in collaboration with the pentagon to add projects to the military construction budget each potential project needs to pass the following criteria similar to the mccain criteria is the project essential to the dod mission consistent with brac plans in the future years defense plan and executable in the coming fiscal year if the project can meet those criteria the military construction authorizing and appropriations committees may add the project debate over congressionallyadded projects continues in debate on the fy2000 military construction appropriations conference report senator mccain continued to discuss projects added by congress he noted that congress added nearly 975 million of extra projects senator mccain presented
