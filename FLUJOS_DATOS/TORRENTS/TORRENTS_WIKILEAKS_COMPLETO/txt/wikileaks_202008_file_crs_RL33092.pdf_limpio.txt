summary the defense base realignment and closure act of 1990 and the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 provide the basic framework for the transfer and disposal of military insta llations closed during the base realignment and closure brac process in general property at brac installations is first subjected to screening for use by the depa rtment of defense nd by other federal agencies if federal use for the property can be found or if an application for transfer is rejected the property is deemed surplus to the needs of the federal government and made available for disposal through other mechanisms at this point brac property is subj ected to two simultaneous evaluation processes the redevelopmen t planning process performed by local redevelopment authority comprised of various interested representatives of the community affected by the brac action and department of defense analysis prepared under the aegis of the national environmen tal policy act and eventually informed by the local redevelopment plan as part of this process screenin g of the property must be performed to determine if homeless assistance use would be appropriate there are also variety of public benefit transfer s under which the property may be conveyed for various specified public purposes at reduced cost it is also possible to dispose of brac property through the use of public auction or negotiated sale for which fair market value or proxy for fair market value mu st generally be obtai ned finally the law governing the brac process authoriz economic development conveyances through which local redevelopment aut hority may obtain the property for specified purposes sometimes for consideration and implement its redevelopment plan itself series of legislative and administrative changes have altered the brac property transfer process since the last round of closures in 1995 this report provides an overview of the various aut horities available under the current law and describes the planning process for the rede velopment of brac properties it also explains the provisions of recently propos ed rule for the administration of brac property transfers

brac the pr ocess by which excess military facilities are identified and as necessary tran sferred to other federal agen cies or disposed of placing ownership in nonfederal entities since the enactment of the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 base closure act transfer or disposal of former military installations has been governed by relatively consistent legal requirements on december 28 2001 new round of base closur in 2005 was authorized by congress1 subsequently the departme nt of defense dod s ubmitted its recommended brac action to the brac commission the commission reviewed and revised dods recommendations and forwarded its report to the president most recently on september 15 2005 the president submitted the list of recommended brac actions to congress the current brac law is similar to the original statute and retains many of the transfer authorities that were available in previous rounds however significant amendments in 1999 and 2001 ltered portions of the ws disposal authorities consequently dod has promulgated new pr oposed regulations to implement the property disposal authorities available for the 2005 round2 this report provides an overview of the transfer and disposal authorities available under the law for military installations that may be closed dur ing the 2005 round and indicates how r ecent amendments to the base closure act have altered the property transfer and disposal process3 it also describes dods proposed regulations implementing the amended base closure act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33092crs2 4 act

transfer or disposal of much federa l property is primarily performed by the general services administration gsa pursuant to the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 fpasa4 the base closure act directs the administrator of the gsa to delegate speci fied transfer and disposal authorities to dod for use at brac installa tions and dod has in turn delegated this authority to the various military services5 thus brac property transfer and disposal is performed generally in accordance with the fpasa and the gsa regulations implementing it in addition the base closure act authoriz dod with gsa approval to supersede gsa regulations with bracspecific regulations6 apart from the transfer and disposal authorities typically available for federal property the base closure ac t and other provisions of law authorize variety of other conveyance mechanisms in some cases the analysis and use of particular authorities must precede analysis and use of others on the other hand there are many transfer and disposal mechanisms that are given roughly equivalent prio rity thus analysis and use of them may occur simultaneously in addition to dods role in making dispos and transfer determinations the base closure act also provides substantial role for states and communities in the property redevelopment planning process thus local communities can significantly affect the brac property transfer and dis posal decisions made at the federal level the specific roles for states and communities as well as the various transfer and disposal authorities are discussed below local redevelopment authorities lras according to the base closure act an lra is any entity including an entity established by state or local government recognized by the secretary of fense as the entity responsible for developing the redevelopment pl an with respect to the installation or for directing the implementation of such plan7 briefly once the list of excess brac facilities is identified lras begin to form and conduct outreach efforts they then design comprehensive plan for reuse of brac property culminating in redevelopment plan8 this plan is not binding upon dod indeed dod is ultimately responsible forpreparing an environmental impact analys is under the national environmental policy act nepa in which it must examine all reasonable disposal alternatives and makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33092crs3 9 42 usc 4321 et seq 10 the specific requirements impacting the lra planning process and dods eventual disposal of property are discussed in the sec tions of

recognize in general only one lra per installation13 there do not appear to be formal requirements for recogn ition it should be noted however that dod may possess authority to refuse recognition of an lra indeed dods proposed regulations state that in the event there is lra recognized by dod or if the lra fails to perform the role contemplated by the base closure act dod may pro ceed with its own disposal actions after c onsultation with states gove rnor and the heads of local government14 federal screening the first step in the property transfer process begins when the military service in

for bids under terms and conditions that permit full and free competition consistent with the value and nature of the property involved62 if adequate bids are received and disposal is in the public

defense to authorize reduced or consideration economic velopment conveyances has been replaced by what is arguably more restrictive scheme among the changes the law now states the transfer of property of milita ry installation may be without consideration only when the transferee agrees to specified terms67 these terms include requirement that the recipient lra use the proceeds from certain future sales or leases of the acquired property to support ec onomic redevelopment at the former installation and accept control of the property within reasonable time after the date of the property disposal record of decision68 further under the new legislation while consideration tr ansfers remain possibility as described above it appears that the authority for reduced cost transactions has been eliminated69 the secretary is also now required to seek to obtain consideration in connection w ith any transfer in an am ount equal to the fair market value of the property as determined by the secretary70 the provision does not explicitly state what the secretary must do to fulfill this requirement however when read in conjunction with the authoriza tion for consideration transfers the requirement to seek fair market value would appear to leave open the possibility of consideration transfer so long as reas onable attempt to find or negotiate another transaction is unsuccessful concomitant change is the apparent elimination of the statutory requirement that dod justify its d ecision to use its edc authority and not public auction or negotiated sale71 under the proposed

would also be required to appraise th property and determine its fair market value prior to accepting an application76 the proposed regulations again reiterate the policy of seeking fair market value

deems appropriate78 leases in addition to the final conveyance of property contemplated by the base closure act federal law authorizes the leasing of brac property under certain circumstances the base closure act does little more than indicate that proceeds from leases are to be deposited into the brac account created by the base closure act79 the authority for such leases is instead contained in 10 usc section 2667 the same statute governing the leasing of nonbrac military property80 further dods proposed regulations like their predecessors indicate that leasin g brac properties is to be an interim measure betw een closure and final disposition81 in general brac property may be leased when the secretary of the relevant military service determines that lease would facilitate state or local economic adjustment efforts82 lessees must generally pay fair market value however reduced consideration is available if the secretary of the relevant service finds that ia public interest will be served as result of the lease and ii the fair market value of the lease is unobtainable or not compatible with such public benefit 83httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33092crs14 84 10 usc 2667f3 85 42 usc

property may be leased the law require s dod to consult with the administrator of the environm ental protection agency epa to determine whether the property is in suitable condition for leasing84 the law also curtails the application of the national environmental policy act nepa to the leasing process in general nepa requires federal agencies to anal yze the environmental impacts of proposed federal action and alternatives to that action85 the statute governing brac property leases indicates that the scope of environmental analysis required is limited to the environmental consequences of activities authorized under the proposed lease and the cumulative impacts of other past present and reasonably foreseeable future actions during the period of the proposed lease86 however this relief from full application of nepa does not apply if activities authorized under the lease would i significantly affect the quality of the human environment or ii irreversibly alter the environment in way that would preclude any reasonable disposal alternative of the property concerned87 additional regulatory and statutory pr ovisions indicate that leases of brac property are intended to be s hortterm interim measures to spur economic development pending final disposition and therefore th leases make commitment for future use or ultimate disposal88 more specifically the regulations indicate that lease terms may extend to up to five years including re newal options if the lease is entered into prior to completion of the final disposal decisions89 after completion of the final disposal decisions the lease term may be longer than five years90 the proposed regulations also indicate that leases will generally be to an lra but that leasing to other entities is permissible91 when lease is to an lra and is provided at below fair market value if the property is sublease d the lra would be required to apply the proceeds to the protection maintenance re pair improvement and costs related to the leased property 92 the law and regulations also authorize wh at has been referred to as leaseback an arrangement wherein the transferring s ecretary conveys property to an lra and the lra agrees to lease the property to federal agency93 under the proposed regulations this arrangement will only be used if the agency that would lease the property agrees to the arrangement the lra and

transferring secretary would be authorized to acquire leaseback arrangement for the secretarys own dod component only if the component certifies that such leasing arrangement is in the interest of that agency95 the transferring secretary would only be able to approve leaseback rrangement for other dod components if the transferring secretary certifies that such leasing arrangement is in the best interest of the military departme nt and is consistent with th obligation to close or realign the installation 96 these leases are to be for terms of more than fifty years subject to renewal and cannot require rental payments97 the proposed regulations would also supply the rules governing the property at the termination of the lease98 conclusion in sum the transfer and disposal process for 2005 round brac properties is primarily governed by the defense base closure and realignment act as amended and the federal property and administrative rvices act the process first requires screening to determine if other dod branches or federal agencies have need for the property in the event that property is not transferred in this manner it is deemed surplus and may be disposed of pursuant to brac and fpasa authorities compliance with these disposal authorities will generally require some form of homeless assistance screening and public benefit transfer analysis dod is directed to take into consideration multiple factors in deter mining which authority to use including consultation with lras and considerati on of their redevelopment plans but dod would appear to be ultimately res ponsible for making final determinations public auctions and negotiated sales are generally available lthough it would appear that fair market value must generally be obt ained under these authorities economic development conveyances are authorized as well which may be made for consideration contingent upon cer tain conditions of transfer
