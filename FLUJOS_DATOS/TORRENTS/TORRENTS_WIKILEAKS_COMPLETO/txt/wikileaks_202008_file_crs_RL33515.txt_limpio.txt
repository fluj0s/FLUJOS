implications july 6 2006 christopher bolkcom and richard f grimmett specialists in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division k alan kronstadt analyst in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress combat aircraft sales to south asia potential implications summary on june 28 2006 the bush administration announced its proposal to sell 36 f16 cd block 5052 falcon combat aircraft to pakistan at an estimated case value of 3 billion the f16 falcon is single engine multirole aircraft manufactured by lockheed martin corp its relatively low cost and high versatility make the f16 one of the most exported fighter aircraft in the world the f16 was first fielded in 1979 and has been upgraded significantly the capabilities of the f16 vary greatly depending on the upgrade or modification fielded the most modern f16 flown by the united states is the block 5052 three other f16 related sales to pakistan were also proposed some believe that these sales are partly an effort to reward the pakistani government for the role it has played in support of usled antiterrorism efforts and this consideration is noted in the text of the formal notification of the f16 sales some analysts however see the decision to resume f16 sales to pakistan as disruptive of regional stability and efforts to resolve disputes there combat aircraft are considered essential for conducting surprise attacks or initiating largescale offensive operations therefore the transfer of combat aircraft can be significant policy decision especially to region with known tensions and territorial disputes generally speaking arguments for foreign military sales tend to focus on advancing us industry supporting allied countries and promoting interoperability with those countries arguments against arms sales tend to focus on the negative aspects of military technology proliferation and the potential for causing regional instability the federal government approves arms sales on caseby case basis it is currently unclear what longterm effects potential sale of combat aircraft to south asia might have on us political relations with pakistan and india or the political relationship between them the reported us willingness to sell f16s or fa18s to india may mitigate that countrys disappointment with any renewed us arms sales to pakistan and neutralize any increase in pakistans military capability militarily the importance of the proposed transfer of new f16s and the upgrade of pakistans legacy f16s can be viewed in the context of pakistans conventional military confrontation with india its nuclear confrontation with that country and its struggle with terrorists and insurgents much of the commentary following the june 28th announcement centered on how potential sale of aircraft to pakistan and possibly to india would be beneficial to industry the potential benefits most frequently mentioned were extending the production life of us aircraft with limited domestic prospects and improving us industrys position visavis other rivals in an increasingly competitive military export market for broader

aircraft sales to south asia potential implications introduction on june 28 2006 the bush administration announced its proposal to sell 36 f16 cd block 5052 falcon combat aircraft to pakistan at an estimated case value of 3 billion three other f16 related sales to pakistan were also proposed on june 28 these sales include f16 ab midlife update modification kits to upgrade existing pakistani f16 aircraft bought during president reagans first term engine modifications and structural upgrades for existing f16s and various missiles munitions and associated hardware to be utilized on the pakistani f16s1 some believe that these sales are partly an effort to reward the pakistani government for the role it has played in support of usled antiterrorism efforts and this consideration is noted in the text of the formal notification of the f16 sales from the date june 28 2006 when congress was formally notified of the proposed f16 sales to pakistan congress has 30 calendar days within which to review the proposed sales and express its will in accordance with statutory procedures set out in section 36 of the arms export control act aeca should congress chose to block the pakistani sales it must act to do so within the prescribed 30 days through the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval otherwise the president is authorized to proceed with the sales2 pakistanus relations pakistanus relations are rooted in the cold war and south asia regional politics of the 1950s differing expectations of the regional security relationship have long bedeviled bilateral ties the united states viewed pakistan as valuable ally in its efforts to contain the soviet union pakistan saw the united states as powerful guarantor of its security visavis india in the mid1970s strains arose 1

pakistans efforts to respond to indias 1974 underground nuclear test by seeking its own nuclear weapons capability us aid was suspended in 1979 however only months later pakistan again took the role of frontline ally this time in the ussupported effort to push the soviet army out of afghanistan and sanctions were waived despite the renewal of us aid and close security ties many in congress remained troubled by pakistans nuclear weapons program in 1985 section 620ee the pressler amendment was added to the foreign assistance act requiring the president to certify to congress that pakistan does not possess nuclear explosive device during the fiscal year for which aid is to be provided with the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan pakistans nuclear activities again came under intensive us scrutiny and in 1990 president george hw bush again suspended aid to pakistan one result of this aid cutoff was the nondelivery of 28 f16 fighter aircraft purchased by pakistan in 1989 in 1998 the united states agreed to compensate pakistan with cash payment and goods including surplus wheat it was not until late2001 when the united states again looked to pakistan as frontline ally that major us aid including major weapons systems again flowed to pakistan3 indiaus relations the usindia relationship was for decades dictated by the politics of the cold war the soviet collapse freed indiaus relations from the constraints of global bipolarity but during the 1990s interactions continued to be affected by the indiapakistan rivalry and nuclear weapons proliferation in the region recently however bilateral relations are greatly improved with president bush calling india natural partner of the united states and his administration seeking to assist indias rise as major power in the new century despite concurrent us rapprochement with pakistan usindia security cooperation has flourished and includes regular military exercises in june 2005 the united states and india signed tenyear defense framework agreement that calls for expanding bilateral cooperation in number of securityrelated areas some laud increased usindia security ties as providing potential counterbalance to chinese influence in the region but the emergence of an overt counterweight alliance is viewed by many as both misguided and unlikely4 pakistanindia relations three fullscale wars and constant state of military friction have marked nearly six decades of rivalry between pakistan and india the acrimonious nature of the partition of british india into two successor states in 1947 and the unresolved issue of kashmiri sovereignty have been major sources of tension both countries have built large defense establishments at significant cost to economic and social development nevertheless peace initiative begun in 2003 has improved the relationship and led to january 2004 summit and an agreement to reengage in dialogue to bring about peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues including jammu 3 see also crs report rl33498 pakistanus relations 4 see also crs issue brief ib93097 indiausrelations crs3 and kashmir to the satisfaction of both sides in april 2005 the two governments released joint statement calling their current bilateral peace process irreversible although some analysts believe the process could quickly unravel following major terrorist attack or some other unforeseen development officials from both countries and the united states offer generally positive assessments of the ongoing dialogue even as progress on territorial disputes especially that involving kashmir has been minimal the pentagons june 2006 notifications to congress assert that pakistans planned purchase of new f16s and related equipment would not significantly reduce indias quantitative or qualitative military advantage nor affect the regional balance of power us combat aircraft the f16 falcon is single engine multirole aircraft manufactured by lockheed martin corp its relatively low cost and high versatility make the f16 one of the most exported fighter aircraft in the world the f16 was first fielded in 1979 and has been upgraded significantly the capabilities of the f16 vary greatly depending on the upgrade or modification fielded the most modern f16 flown by the united states is the block 5052 the aircraft being proposed for export to pakistan will incorporate highresolution radars capable of allweather precision targeting and airtoair combat at extended ranges helmetmounted cuing system will improve the aircrafts dogfighting capability as well as airtoground lethality integrated defensive electronic countermeasures will reduce the aircrafts vulnerability to enemy aircraft and air defenses and conformal fuel tanks will increase the f16s range without reducing the number of weapons carried the fa18ef super hornet is dual engine multirole aircraft manufactured by the boeing company it is the us navys most modern and capable combat aircraft the super hornet reached initial operational capability in 2001 the differences between the ef and earlier fa18 variants ab cd are so great that many consider it to be new aircraft rather than an upgrade of an existing model the super hornet has been approved for export but sales have yet been made the fa18cd models which are longer in production have been exported to eight countries potential implications political implications it is currently unclear what longterm effects potential sale of combat aircraft to south asia might have on us political relations with pakistan and india or the political relationship between them the bush administrations decision to resume f16 sales to pakistan after 16year hiatus was first announced at march 2005 press conference by unnamed senior state department officials at that conference the administration unveiled new strategy for south asia that includes an intention to help india become major world power in the 21st century administration officials also said the united states welcomes indias interest in the possible purchase of f16 or fa18 warplanes and is ready to discuss the sale of crs4 transformative systems in areas such as command and control early warning and missile defense5 two days before the state departments march 2005 statements twenty members of the house wrote to president bush urging him to not license the sale of f16 aircraft to pakistan as such sale would undermine our longterm strategic interests in south asia and squander an opportunity to continue building positive relations with india6 meanwhile indian prime minister manmohan singh expressed great disappointment at the us decision saying the move could have negative consequences for indias security environment but he later softened his criticism and welcomed an apparent us willingness to expand cooperation with india fifteen months later when the bush administration formally notified congress of potential sale of f16s to pakistan an indian external affairs ministry statement said the step is not conducive to improving ties between india and pakistan7 justifications for the decision to resume f16 sales include us interest that pakistan feel secure and perception that substantive us defense relationship with both pakistan and india will stabilize the balance between them in june 2006 the white house said the planned f16 sale demonstrates our commitment to longterm relationship with pakistan8 some believe the decision is reward to president gen musharraf and the pakistani military for their post911 cooperation with usled counterterrorism efforts and see renewed exports as potentially increasing us leverage in islamabad while eroding antiamerican sentiments there such leverage could include increased pakistani cooperation in the areas of counterterrorism and nonproliferation9 it may be that the timing of the june 2006 notification was influenced by developments in usindia relations washington and new delhi are moving forward with landmark civil nuclear cooperation initiative islamabad claims the initiative will cause power imbalance in the region and it repeatedly has requested similar arrangement with washington the bush administration rejects such requests and also has not moved to provide pakistan with defense cooperation pact similar to that made with india in 200510 5

2006 james murphy pakistan wants defense pact with us janes defense industry sep 1 2005 crs5 some analysts see the decision to resume f16 sales to pakistan as disruptive of regional stability and efforts to resolve disputes there this concern was articulated by indias external affairs minister in april 2005 military assistance particularly when unrelated to counterterrorism efforts conveys political signal both within pakistan and visavis indiapakistan relations it consequently has repercussions for our dialogue that is currently at sensitive stage11 some in congress voice similarly grounded opposition in more explicit terms at june 2005 house hearing on us south asia policy one lawmaker said f16s is how you fight india its not how you fight terrorists this is outrageous the sentiment was echoed by several other members in attendance however two nongovernmental experts appearing before the house panel approved of such sales as important symbolic gestures that would likely result in muchneeded improvement in us pakistan relations12 several critics have contended that renewed f16 sales may strengthen nondemocratic forces in islamabad though the bush administration has made spreading democracy cornerstone of its foreign policy pakistan continues to be governed by an army general who came to power through military coup and the state department has noted that pakistans democratic institutions remain weak13 in hrept 109486 june 2006 the house appropriations committee expressed concern about pakistans lack of progress on improving democratic governance and rule of law furthermore some pakistani commentators wonder why islamabad plans to spend billions of dollars on weapons of allegedly questionable utility while the countrys social services and infrastructure are in dire need of improvements14 this perspective gained additional traction in the wake of pakistans catastrophic october 2005 earthquake when islamabad chose to postpone and eventually scale down the number of f16s it would seek to purchase as noted above congressional concerns about pakistans nuclear proliferation activities are longstanding some opponents of resumed f16 sales argue that the united states should not provide sophisticated weapons to country that has been source of significant horizontal nuclear weapons proliferation legislation 11 interview of external

qadeer khan known as the founder of pakistans nuclear weapons program and national hero confessed to involvement in an illicit nuclear smuggling network that sold crucial nuclear weapons technology and uraniumenrichment materials to north korea libya and iran to date pakistan refuses to allow any direct access to khan by nonpakistani investigators and in may 2006 the islamabad government declared the khan investigation closed some in congress remain skeptical however and house panel subsequently held hearing to further discuss the issue at that hearing non governmental experts urged that us and international investigators be given direct access to khan in particular to learn more about assistance given to irans controversial nuclear program15 military implications the importance of the proposed transfer of new f16s and the upgrade of pakistans legacy f16s can be viewed in the context of pakistans conventional military confrontation with india its nuclear confrontation with that country and its struggle with terrorists and insurgents india dominated the air when it last clashed with pakistan in 1971 according to some accounts pakistani air strikes were largely ineffective and air support of ground forces was nonexistent16 india currently enjoys significant quantitative advantage over pakistans air force it has 21 more fighter squadrons than pakistan and larger number 124 of modern aircraft india operates an aircraft carrier with shorttake off and vertical landing fighters in terms of quality the f16 block 5052 aircraft appears to be roughly equivalent to indias most advanced combat aircraft the russianmade su3017 unlike pakistan however india supports its combat aircraft with aerial refueling electronic countermeasures and modern airborne warning and control aircraft18 the sale of 36 f16s to pakistan and the upgrade of existing f16s would increase that countrys number of modern combat aircraft but would still not bring 15

kimball arming dictators rewarding proliferators arms control today apr 2005 16 james smith developments in the indian air force janes intelligence review nov 1991 17 this point is debated among military analysts owing to recent exercises between the us air force and the indian air force some believe the su30 to be superior air superiority fighter to the us f15 however the f16 may compare better with the su30 than the f15 as multirole combat aircraft 18 see crs report rs20754 national security implications of airborne early warning aew aircraft crs7 it close to parity with india if india were to add f16s or fa18s to its inventory the disparity in aviation capabilities between the two countries would grow even more some express concern that pakistan could use its new f16s to deliver nuclear weapons the overall potential impact on nuclear deterrence and stability in south asia of additional pakistani f16s however appears unclear first because the 32 f16s that pakistan already fields are believed to be nuclear capable additional f16s dont appear to introduce new capabilities but may expand existing ones second pakistan also fields nuclearcapable ballistic missiles some believe that ballistic missiles add instability to the security equation because they are high priority targets and consequently the pressure to use them early in conflict can be great19 thus if additional nuclearcapable f16s were to replace existing nuclearcapable ballistic missiles in pakistans arsenal some may argue that additional f16s could reduce nuclear instability some suggest that pakistan could use f16s against terrorists and insurgents it appears that f16s could be used in such operations but they could also be considered overdesigned for these tasks the block 5052 variant that is being proposed for export is the most advanced version of the f16 flown by us military forces it incorporates advanced weapons and avionics for airtoair combat that appear unnecessary for counterinsurgency operations less expensive and less sophisticated aircraft such as attack helicopters unmanned aerial vehicles and combat search and rescue aircraft would appear to have greater utility in combating insurgents and other nonstate actors than supersonic fighter aircraft20 according to the indian defense minister the f16 and other lethal weapons are not required for fighting terrorism and are used in fullfledged wars given pakistans track record we fear that such weapons will be directed toward india21 combat aircraft proliferation combat aircraft are considered essential for conducting surprise attacks or initiating largescale offensive operations22 therefore the transfer of combat aircraft can be significant policy decision especially to region with known tensions and territorial disputes the sale of f16 block 5052 aircraft to pakistan will upgrade its inventory of this fighter but may not completely fulfill its perceived need for highly advanced current generation combat fighter while financing the purchase of two different fighter aircraft could be problematic for pakistan some in pakistan are reportedly concerned about the potential for future

state june 18 2002 crs8 history of difficulties pakistan has had with the united states over proliferation issues they argue against limiting future aircraft procurement to the united states further the proposed sale of f16s appears to offer opportunities for offsets or coproduction which limits the longterm benefit to pakistans aerospace industry consequently pakistan continues relationship with china including testing of chinas advanced j10 fighter and codevelopment with china of the jf17 fighter pakistan has been negotiating possible purchase of the swedish jas gripen multi role fighter should the united states sell the f16 to pakistan sweden would reportedly offer to sell the gripen thus it seems unlikely that the united states will become pakistans principal supplier of advanced combat aircraft23 the reported us willingness to sell f16s or fa18s to india may mitigate that countrys disappointment with any renewed us arms sales to pakistan and neutralize any increase in pakistans military capability india may also use the prospect of the purchase of us fighters as leverage in negotiations with its primary military supplier russia to obtain more sophisticated systems better financing or additional licensed production options for its domestic defense industry should india choose to purchase us fighters it may seek not just the aircraft and support services but some form of coproduction or coassembly options prospect that would raise policy questions for the united states regarding the release of military technology and how such information might be used by india this is particularly important given indias ambitions to develop significant aerospace production capability and its past and present aerospace acquisitions from russia france the united kingdom and israel24 us industrial base much of the commentary following the june 28th announcement centered on how potential sale of aircraft to pakistan and possibly to india would be beneficial to industry the potential benefits most frequently mentioned were extending the production life of us aircraft with limited domestic prospects and improving us industrys position visavis other rivals in an increasingly competitive military export market after decades of successful production the f16 production line appears to be approaching its end as currently projected the f16 production line which employs approximately 5000 workers could close in 2008 sale of 36 or more f16s to pakistan could keep the line open for another year25 23 joshua kucera ideas exhibition us offers to sell f16s to

number of combat aircraft than pakistan 126 and has much larger inventory of combat aircraft approximately 700 that it will eventually need to replace us companies are contending with competitively priced russian and european aircraft for share of the global military aircraft market penetrating the indian market and beating european competitors could many believe help us companies compete in other aircraft export markets also it is argued that aircraft sales to india could prove tip of the iceberg for all types of military exports to that country india has embarked on longterm plan to upgrade its armaments and strengthen its military and some say that high on its list are early warning and missile defense systems nuclear fuel and technologies and spacerelated technologies26 questions remain about the potential domestic us benefit from these prospective sales while preserving us jobs appears clearly beneficial the number of jobs preserved and the value of those jobs remains unclear india would likely demand that the majority of aircraft be produced in india this would increase jobs in india and reduce jobs in the united states also some say not all jobs are equal in terms of their benefit to the us industrial base producing for india and pakistan the exact same aircraft that is currently being produced in the united states would preserve assembly linetype jobs many argue this would do little to advance innovation or make us industry more competitive only if the exported aircraft require noteworthy design and engineering changes they say would these skills be developed to benefit the of industrial base 26 ibid for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33515
