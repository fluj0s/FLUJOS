on farm animals or groups eg flocks herds so that they can be more easily tracked from birth to slaughter use of animal id dates back at least to the 1800s when hot iron bra nds were used throughout the us west to indicate ownership id methods today include ear back and tail tags neck chains freeze as opposed to hot iron bra nds and leg bands some pr oducers use radio frequency id transponders with information that is read by scanners and fed into computer databases the reasons for identifying and tracking anima ls and their products also have evolved animal health animal id can help to identify the source of dangerous and costly animal diseases and to contain them in th global marketplace animal disease programs aided by traceability systems are used both to reassure buyers bout the health of us animals and to satisfy foreig n veterinary andor food sa fety requirements usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis oversees animal health in consultation with state veterinary authorities and some of its disease eradication and control efforts effectively require id and tracking for example for brucellosis highly contagious and costly disease mainly ffecting cattle bison and swine once common here uniquely numbered bruce llosis id tags were routinely attached to animals which noted that they had been vaccinated or tested because brucellosis has largely been eradicated from us commercial herds id is longer widespread examples of other official disease programs include pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep where swine and sheep respectively must be officially identified before entering interstate commercehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653crs2 1 see crs report rl32199 bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease current and proposed

in december 2003 number of trading partners that had quickly closed their borders to us beef reportedly were relu ctant to reopen them due in part to us difficulties in tracing the whereabouts of othe

on and marketing many farmers and ranchers already keep track of individual animals and how they are being raised in order to identify and exploit desirable production characteristics universal bar c odes on processed food including many meats are widely used by pr ocessors and retailers to manage inventories add value to products and mon itor consumer buying when consumers seek meat eggs or milk from animals raised according to specified organic humane treatment or environmental standards id and traceability can help firm s verify production methods governmentcoordinated progra ms also have been established for these purposes for example process verification progra m operated by usdas agricultural marketing service ams provides livestock and meat producers an opportunity to assure customers of their ability to provide consis tent quality products by having their written manufacturing processes confirmed through i ndependent third party audits according to ams usda process verified suppliers can have marketing claims such as breeds and feeding practices and so label them under this volunt ary feeforservice program after bse appeared in north amer ica in 2003 ams developed an export verification ev program for us plants seeking to meet the differing beef import specifications of various c ountries like japan once the numberone foreign market for us beef ams establishes the standards that us suppliers must follow if they want to ship beef to these countries and certifies th at the proper procedures are in place while ev is voluntary it is also prerequisite for access to the japanese korean and other foreign markets other programs employ ing varying levels and types of traceability include the domestic origin requirement for usdapurchased commodities used in domestic feeding programs nd the national organic certifi cation program which ams also oversees2 food safety federal and state food safety agencies collaborate with aphis to protect the food s upply from the introduction through animals of threats to human health such as tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses from bacteria like salmonella and

link an illness to particular product firms and their regulators have b een able to trace that product back to the processor andor slaughter facility it is more difficult and costly to determine which particular animals herds or flocks were involved some believe that more rigorous traceback and animal id system would facilita food recalls possibly contain the spread of foodborne illness and help authorities stem future incidents others particularly many within the food industry strongly disa gree countering that such system would not be based on sound science nd would be technically unwor kable and extremely costly3 development of national plan early privatepublic efforts work toward coordinated national animal id system began in earnest in the early 2000s nd evolved into joint industrygovernment professional effort whose princi pal goal was the ability to tr ace animals of interest within 48 hours of an animal disease problem draft us animal identification plan usaip published in december 2003 called fo r recording the movement of individual animals or animal groups in central data base or in seamle ssly linked database infrastructure aphis roles would be to allocate premises eg farms feedlots auction barns processing plants and animal numbers and to coordinate data collection the work plan envisioned by the usaip had first called fo r all states to have an animal premises id system by july 2004 with farm animals of all major species identified by july 2006 usda actions4 as the draft usaip was being published in december 2003 the first us bse case emerged among the initiatives usda quickly announced to shore up confidence in the beef supply was acceler ated implementation of animal id since early 2004 the department has committed nearly 128 million to its development providing many of the funds to states and tribal organizations for research database systems and startup of premises registration usda first announced framework for its national animal identification system nais in april 2004 and has b een periodically revising the outlines of the program since then it issued draft strategic plan in may 2005 announced new set of guiding principles in august 2005 and unveiled new plan in april 2006 that set timeline for full implementation by 2009 in november 2006 usda distributed draft user guide as the most current plan for the nais whi ch replaces all previously published program documents including the 2005 draft strategic plan and draft progra m standards and the 2006 implementation strategies the user gu ide sought to assure producers that usda would not require them to participate in the program and that it is bound by law to protect individuals private and confid ential business information the draft user guide described three successively greater steps toward full participation premises registra tion done throug h one of the state or tribal animal health authorities by late 2006 the goal was to register all premises by 2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653crs4 5 see footnote 2animal id accomplished by obtaining usdarecognized numbering tags or devices from representatives of authorized manufacturers selection by the producer of one of the naiscompliant animal tracking databases to which the producer can report animal movements on this last point usda continues to envisi on universal system as series of state or privately held databases wh ich the department c ould tap only in the event of an animal disease outbreak with the go of tracing animals from poi nt of origin to processing within 48 hours its user guide anticipated that the nais would cover the following species cattle and bison poultry swine sheep and goats cervids such as deer and elk horses and other equines and camelids eg llamas and alpacas household pets and other animals not listed would be exclude d from nais only animals that enter commerce or that commingle with animals at other premises like sales barns state or national fairs or exhibits would be identified also animals that typically are moved in groups such as hogs and pou ltry could be identified as part of their group rather than individually the draft business plan released in apr il 2008 attempted to fu rther clarify current implementation strategies one of seven key strategies would be to prioritize species with the primary commercial food anima ls in tier 1 along with horses that need health certificate or test when moved all other livestock and poultry would be in lower priority tier 2 one key objective would be to bring 70 of the cattle breeding herd into nais by the end of 20095 selected issues supporters assert that an animal id system is needed to maintain us competitiveness in the global marketplace where other major m eatexporting countries have been rapidly developing their own id pr ograms in part to meet importing countries demands for such traceability some livestock producers say they are not convinced that any new program mandatory or voluntary will improve animal health oversight and they fear that it will only impose costly and intr usive regulations on their operations without adding any significant value to their animals some reportedly are working within individual states to block mandatory andor voluntary programs there implementation pace some animal id progra m supporters on the other hand have criticized usda for moving too slowly andor not setting clearer path toward universal id as of midjuly 2008 ap his reported that less than 500000 animal premises had been registered in one of the available databases this compares with an estimated 14 million livestock and poultry farm s in the united stat 2002 ce nsus of agriculture data registration rates vary widely among states july 2007 report by the government accountability office concluded that number of problems had hindere d effective implementation of animal id such as prioritization among the nine animal species to be covered to focus on those of greatest disease concern plan to integrate nais into existing usda and state animal id requirements and re quirement that some types of cr itical data be provided to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653crs5 6 national animal identification system usda ne eds to resolve several key implementation issues to achieve rapid and ffective disease traceback

producers and ot her interests over many unresolved issues house and senate appropriators also ve questioned usdas progress and direction in implementing national system ov er several years through fy2007 about 1178 million went into the programs developmen t the enacted fy2008 appropriation part of the consolidated appropriations ac t 2008 pl 110161 provided 98 million more to continue implementation of nais which is well below the administrations requested appropriation of 332 million for nais for fy2008 the conference report cites concerns about the lack of information pr ovided on full costs and concerns about the use of funds to date including informati on on how aphis would reach its 48hour traceback goal and information on how the funds for the program have been used to date the report states the committees concern that more than 50 of the obligations to date in nais have been for cooperative agreements th at until very recently did not require that cooperators or grantees agree to specifi c performance goals the committees are also concerned that 25 of the funding has gone for program management administration officials seeking 24 million for the program for fy2009 were harshly criticized by the chair of the house appropriations agriculture subcommittee at hearing on april 9 2008 she indicated that she wanted more accountability regarding the spending the house appropriations committee had not marked up usdas fy2004 usda appropriation as of midjuly 2008 however the subcommittees draft bill reportedly contains incentives to encourag wider adoption of animal id notably requirement that usda purchas meats for the school lunch program starting in 2010 only from suppliers in the id system7 mandatory or voluntary according to the departments latest thinking on the nais see above participation in nais is voluntary at the federal level the nais does not need to be mandatory to be effec tive others including many state animal health officials reportedly disagree at meetings in october 2006 the national assembly of state animal health officials and the us animal health associations livestock committee each approved recommendation that as step toward national system usda make animal id mandatory for all us breeding cattle consumer advocacy groups also have pressed for mandatory national system costs and who pays an animal id system will impose variety of costs such as for tags or other identifying devices nd their application and data systems to track animals cost estimates of national system have varied broadly and are not directly comparable reflection of estimators differing assumptions and of the varying designs of proposed programs as the extent of traceability increases so do likely costs related policy question is w ho should pay the industry and ultimately consumers government or both usdas current thinking calls for expenses to be shared eg database costs funded by g overnment and the identifyi ng devices by producershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653crs6 8 meat traceability its effect on trade iowa ag review winter 2002 9 ibid 10 for more discussion of the liability and conf identiality issues see national agricultural law center animal identification an overview national aglaw center reading room at httpwwwnationalaglawcenterorgreadingroomsanimalidit has been argued that as more tracing requirements are imposed large retailers and meat packers will exercise market power to shift compliance costs backward to farms and ranches making it even more difficult for the smaller independent ones to remain in business larger more vertically integrated operations are more likely to have the resources and scale economies to survive some have argued on the other hand if traceability costs forced big meat plants to re duce line speeds smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be bette r equipped to implement traceab ility to the retail level and may find niche market opportunities8 liability and confiden tiality of records some producers are concerned they will be held liable for contamination or other problems over which they believe they have little control after the animal leaves the farm on the other hand documentation of management practices including animal hea lth programs can help to protect against liability because they can prove where anima ls came from and how they were raised9 also at issue is whether producers can nd should be protected from public scrutiny of their records the federal freedom of information act foia entitles members of the public to obtain records held by federal ag encies some producers are concerned for example that animal rights extremists might misuse information gained through foia or that the data collection might reveal propr ietary information however foia exempts access to certain types of business informa tion such as trade secrets commercial or financial information or ot her confidential material th at might harm the
