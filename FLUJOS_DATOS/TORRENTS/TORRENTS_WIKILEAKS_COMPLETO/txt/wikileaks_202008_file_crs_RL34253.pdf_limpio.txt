us foreign policy successive us administrations have explicitly identified weak or failing states as us national security concerns since 1998 the past three us national security strategy documents all point to several threats emanating from states that are variously described as weak fragile vulnerable failing pr ecarious failed in crisis or collapsed1 these threats include providing sa fe havens for terrorists organized crime and other illicit groups causing or exacerbating conf lict regional instability and humanitarian emergencie s and undermining efforts to promote democracy good governance and economic sustainab ility the president in his 2005 national security presidential directive nspd 44 asserts that the united states should work to anticipate state failure avoi d it whenever possible and respond quickly and effectively when n ecessary and appropriate to this end the administration has blished as goal the transformation of us national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century which includes strengthening weak and failing states2 however as us policy toward these states has grown in priority and cost particularly since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 some us officials and other analysts have begun to question the effectiveness of the administrations policies for dealing with these types of problem states as the debate continues into the next presidential term this is likely to continue to be contentious area with congressional involvement in us policy toward weak and failing states flowing from its funding and oversight responsibilities currently policy makers and observers are advocating competing visions for addressing state weakness which could pose significant consequences for us national security policy and us preparedness for combating 21stcentury security threats on one side of the spect rum are those who advocate wholeof government vision for strengthening weak states advocates of this approach perceive weak states to present multiple interdependent challenges to political stability military and security capabilities and development and humanitarian needs as result they recommend developing m echanisms and procedures for interagencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34253crs2 3 for description see louise andersen i nternational engagement in failed states choices and trade

supporters have discussed the potential for significant reform of congressional funding and authorizing responsib ilities as well as substantial organizational overhaul of several federal agencies at the other extreme are those who are critical of us nationbuilding activities they fundamentally question the appropriateness of state weakness as lens through which to identify national security threats instead such analysts recommend developing strategies to combat specific threats such as ungoverned territories conducive to criminal exploitation interna tional terrorism tran snational crime and nuclear weapons proliferation regardless of how strong states government is in the case of conflict or postconflict situations some critics also discourage institutionalizing potentially costly us stabilization and reconstruction capabilities some critics also claim that the concept of strengthening states inherently prescribes western model of state function that ma not be appropriate in all situations3 if us national security policy priority on w eak and failing states is not necessary or desirable the existence and funding levels of several recently created programs and strategies to combat weak states threats may be called into question us policy toward weak and failing states currently hangs in an uneasy balance between these two perspectives in recent years this has resulted in proliferation of new programs designed to address the challenges of strengthening weak and failing states the office of the coordi nator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs in the department of state st ood up in july 2004 is mandated with leading and coordinating us effort s for conflict prevention and response in failing states in this capacity scrs has sought to implement wholeofgovernment approach for addressing conflict in fa iled states since at least 20064 at the same time dod has expanded its role in conflict prevention and stability operations revising military doctrine to elevate these activities to primary missions devoting greater resources to such activities and establis hing new institutions to train dod personnel and facilitate dods i nvolvement in stability operations including phase zero or shaping operations that prior to 2004 d not been the purview of dod strategy or mission goals5 us weak states initiatives however remain limited by lack

june 2005to the new programs finally it highlights potential legislative issues that congress may be asked to consider definitions and characteristics universal definition for weak state or failing state exists some analysts describe state weakness as the erosion of state capacity condition characterized by gradations of regimes ability to govern effectively which in its most extreme form results in the complete collapse of state power and function most countries in the developing world fall along this spectrum exhibiting at least some elements of weakness failing states which are seen as including only handful of countries in the world exhibit more pronounced wea knesses than others among the universe of weak and failing states there is single pathway to failure in some cases states are characterized by gradual yet persistent institutional d ecay and political instability in other cases states rapidly tumble into failure faltering under the weight of political instability an acute natu ral disaster or econo mic crisis based on quantitative development indicators weak and failing states tend to be among the leastdeveloped and most underpe rforming states in the world notable us government and governmentaffiliated efforts to describe weak and failing states focus on four major often overlapping elements of state function factors stressed include 1 peace and st ability 2 effective governance 3 territorial control and porous borders and 4 economic sustainability peace and stability failing states are often in conflict at risk of conflict and instability or newly emerging from conflict lacking physical security other state functions are often compromised frequently cited examples of such states today include sudan and iraq effective governance countries can also be hampered by poor governance corruption and inade quate provisions of fundamental public services to its citizens in some cases as in north korea or zimbabwe this may occur because leaders have limited interest or political will to provide core state functions to all its citizens governments perceived unwillingn ess to provide adequate public services can incite destabilizing elements within state6 territorial control and porous borders weak and failing states may lack effective control of their territory military or law enforcement providing space wh ere instability can fester

conditions to achieve lasting economic development such countries include bangladesh nd many in subsaharan africa links to us national security threats failed states have appeared as matter of concern in us national security strategy documents ce 1998 t hough the term had long been the topic of significant academic debate and implicitly informed us national security policy since at least the end of world war ii8 as the cold war concluded in the early 1990s analysts became aware of an emerging internationa l security environment in which weak and failing states became vehi cles for transnational organized crime nuclear proliferation path ways and hot spots for ci vil conflict and humanitarian emergencies the potential us national security threats weak and failing states pose became further apparent with qaed as september 11 2001 attack on the united states which osama bin laden masterminde d from the safe haven that afghanistan provided the events of 911 prompted president george w bush to claim in the 2002 us national security strategy that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great danger to our national in terests as strong states9 in 2005 secretary of state condoleezza rice further emphasized how weak and failing states pose unparalleleddanger to the united states serving as global pa thways that facilitate the movement of criminals and terrorists and proliferation of the worlds most dangerous weapons10 many national security observers highlight such administration language to indicate that us interest in weak and failing states has become more substantial since

oliferation and 4 regional instability other analysts caution however that despite anecdotal evidence supporting potential nexus between state weakness and todays security threats weak states may not necessarily harbor us national security threats furthermore the weakest states may not necessarily be th most significant threats to us national security relatively functional states characterized by some elements of weakness rather than complete state collapse may so be sites from which threats can emerge terrorism according to several analyses weak and failing states are perceived as primary bases of operations for most us designated foreign terrorist organizations including qaeda hama s hezbollah islamic jihad and jaishi mohammed11 terrorists can benefit from lax or nonexistent law enforcement in these states to participate in illicit economic activities to finance their operations and ease their access to weapons and other equipment12 as with afghanistan in 2001 weak and failing states can also be ideal settings for terrorist training grounds when the host countrys government is unable to control or govern pa rts of its territory states mired in conflict so provide terrorists with opportunities to gain onthe ground paramilitary experience13 researchers find however that not all w eak states serve as safe havens for international terrorists14 terrorists have been known to exploit safe havens in non weak as well as weak states the political instability task force research group commissioned by the central intelligen ce agency f ound in 2003 report that

interagency work ing group report on international crime weak states can be useful sites through which criminals can move illicit contraband and launder their proceeds due to unenfor ced laws and high levels of official corruption16 since the cold war the international community has seen surge in the number of transnational crime groups emer ging in safe havens of weak conflict prone states especially in the balkans central asia and west africa criminal groups can thrive off the illicit needs of failing states especially those subject to international sactions re gimes and rebel groups have been known to solicit the services of vast illicit arms tr afficking networks to fuel deadly conflicts in countries such as afghanistan angola liberia sie rra leone and sudan when arms embargoes had been imposed by the united nations and other members of the international community17 links between transnational crime and terrorists groups are also apparent qaeda and hezbollah have worked with

security strategy elevated in priority to be equivalent to us policy on defense and diplomacy according to so us officials the primary programs to support development are ina ppropriate for fragile states for example weak and failing states have greater difficulty achieving the millennium development goals and qualifying for us assistance programs under the millennium challenge act 22 usc 7701

guidelines for dealing with weak and failing states however several notable programs and initiatives have been created since 911 that aim to help prevent state failure strengthen weak states and counter exis ting threats emanating from weak and failing states these programs span all aspects of state weakness issues to include 1 identifying threats and monitoring weak states 2 engaging weak states through diplomacy 3 directing fore ign assistance toward the alleviation of state weakness symptoms and 4 implementing onthe ground civilian and military stabilization operations depending on th level of state weakness available resources and political considerations us policy makers may decide to apply one or more of these programming areas to weak states so analysts rema in critical of r ecent us programs designed to address issues of state weakness the following sections describe new us programs and initiatives and highlight existing criticism and concerns conflict and threat early warning the us government uses conflict and threat early warning systems to predict which states are likely to fail and to identify which nearterm emerging conflict situations require us engagement these include quantitative measures and subjective government analyses of state fragility early warning systems are used to assist us agencies to prepare for intern ational crises and identify areas in which assistance can be provided before state s lides further into failure the overarching goal behind the implementation and use of these early warning systems is to help identify in advance weak states so that th us government can plan and prepare for likely crisis situation and possibly pr eemptively react to developments the national intelligence council department of states ffice of early warning and prevention located within scrs us agency for international development usaid and department of defense dod have roles in identifying and monitoring potential threats emanating from weak and failing states one us government warning list of weak and failing states has been prepared by the national intelligence council twice pe r year since 2005 using classified and unclassified sources according to governme nt officials this assessment is based at least in part on analysis of the central intelligence agencycommissioned political instability task force which boasts more than an 80

others30 however the extent to which the us government can respond to multiple crises let alone mobilize to prevent crisis from occurring based on early warning assessments remains unclear among some analysts the value of effective early warning assessments can often be undermined by lack of political will to mobilize in time for an emerging crisis as well as the lack of sufficient resources and capabilities to deploy to the potentially numerous states that present early signs of potential state failure at any given time31 in the case of scrs for example which is mandated with leading and coordinating us effo rts for conflict prevention and response in failing states many observers have suggested that the offices small size and limited resources hamper its ability to address the full range of todays weak states instead scrs has been able to focus only on small handful of weak states international diplomacy international diplomacy is one way in which the united states can engage countries on issues that weak the state and pose threats to us national security by working in cooperation with internati onal actors on weak states issues including democracy promotion the united
