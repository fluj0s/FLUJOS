agencies to consult with either the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries service the services to determine whether their actions may jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat of listed species in august 2008 fws and nmfs proposed changes to the regulations that address the consultation process final regulations were published december 16 2008 and took effect on january 15 2009 the revisions are intended to do three things acco rding to the services clarify when consultation is applicable clarify certain definitions and establish time frames for consultation the services argue that the new regulations show the does not require consultation on greenhouse gas emissions contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species the regulations give federal agencies greater discretion to determine when and how their actions may affect listed species they also address issues of causationwhen an agency action truly affects the wellbeing of listed species or critical habitat the changes modify definitions and alter the process for consultations the definitions that are modified include cumulative effects effects of an action and biological assessment the changes add criteria for determining when consultations do not apply the action agency continues to determine whether consultation is required the processes for formal and informal consultations were revised to include 60day deadline which may be increased to 120 days for the appropriate service to concur in writing with an action agencys finding during informal consultation if the service fails to respond in writing the project could continue without further consultation at the discretion of the action

which endangered and threatened species depend to provide program to protect those species and to take steps to achieve the purposes of related treaties and conventions1 section 7 of the requires all federal agencies to carry out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species in furtherance of those purposes2 the statute says that the federal agencies shall work toward those goals in consultation with and with the assistance of the two agencies that supervise the program the fish and wildlife service fws of the department of the interior and the national marine fisheries service nmfs of the department of comm erce together the services the prohibits taking endangered wildlife species defining take as harass harm pursue hunt shoot wound kill trap capture or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct3 the purpose of the section 7 consultation is to make sure that federal agencies known as action agencies avoid jeopardizing listed species or adversely modifying their designated critical habitat if federal agency action causes some unavoidable taking incidental to an otherwise lawful purpose the allows the services to issue an incidental take statement to the action agency meaning the harm will not be prosecuted the action agency must also minimize the effects of the taking acting without section 7 consultation leaves federal agency at risk of violating the because it would not have the incidental take statement excusing its conduct section 7 also prohibits federal agency from making irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources that would prevent the effectivene ss of any alternative measures suggested by the service 4 g22g145g142g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g496g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g149g162g561 comparison of the versions of the regulations is in table 1 at the end of this report while not stated in the statute as practical matter not every federal action requires consultation it has long been within the discretion of the action agencies to determine whether proposed action requires consultation this option was provided in the regulations of 19865 the 1986 regulations in place until the 2009 revision established informal and formal consultation procedures when an action agency realizes its project may affect listed species or critical habitat it must consult with the service6 this decision must be made at the earliest possible 1 16 usc 1531b 2 16 usc 1536a1 section 7 refers to where the consultation requirement appears in the public law establishing the endangered species act pl 93205 the cita

action agency will submit an initiation package described in 50 cfr 40214c this information must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available8 the initiation package starts the formal consultation process consultation is an ongoing conversation between the action agency and the service biologists9 few phone calls may suffice to reassure the action agency that there are listed species in the action area or if there are that they will not be affected fws or nmfs may ask for relatively minor amounts of additional written documentation an d then conclude still fairly quickly that neither jeopardy to the species nor adverse modification of its habitat will occur alternatively the services may conclude that more information is needed and ask the agency to carry out biological assessment ba for formal consultation this process may proceed in days weeks or sometimes months 10 there was deadline for the service to respond to request for concurrence in the previous regulations the statute requires the services to respond to consultation initiation within 90 days or on mutually agreed upon date11 the services mark initiation of the consultation from when the service receives complete ba ie one that has sufficient information to assess the effects of the proposed action the action agencies perception of when formal consultation begins is often earlier and likely source of the frustration noted below for those agencies that consult regularly eg forest service bureau of land management environmental protection agency consultation is welltrodden path but for others consultation may be an extremely rare event and difficult for the action agency to manage repeated requests for additional data have lead to great frustration among action agencies and the nonfederal parties relying on them for permits loans sales licenses etc some see consultation as needless delay of weeks months or even year or more even if the result of the consultation is jeopardy biological opinion biop which finds the action will not jeopardize the species nor adversely modify designated critical habitat according to the services the workload associat ed with consultations has grown since 1996 with fws reporting double the consultations 12 the fws reports that in 2006 there were 39346 requests for technical assistance 26762 requests for informal consultations and 1936 requests for formal consultations13 7 50 cfr 40214 8 50 cfr 40214d 9 for detailed discussion of consultation practices see consultation handbook cited above 10 the authors are not aware of any

environmental assessment was prepared under the national environmental policy act finding that the changes would not have significant impact on the environment15 the final version was published december 16 2008 and took effect january 15 200916 lawsuit was filed to set aside the changed regulations claiming they violated federal law17 the regulations revise the consultation process by 1 allowing already prepared documents to be used as ba 2 allowing action agencies greater discretion to determine whether consultation applies 3 clarifying certain definitions and 4 making procedural changes to informal consultations18 stated goal of the revised regulations relates to climate change the services said that the modifications would reinforce the services current view that there is requirement to consult on greenhouse gas emissions contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species19 some believe that the is not the appropriate statutory vehicle for regulating greenhouse gas emissions as it was not implemente d to analyze air quality others note that the has exceptions for types of projects and therefore regulations cannot create one still others suggest that the existing causation requirements linking an agency action to particular harm already limit the s use as tool in regulating global warming the suit against the changes argues that the revisions will not achieve these goals contrary to the services characterization the proposed changes would severely limit the kinds of direct indirect and cumulative effects that must be addressed in section 7 consultations and would also result in plet hora of actions harmful to listed species proceeding without the services input or invo lvement merely because the services lacked adequate time or resources to respond within the mandatory time frames imposed by the regulations 20 six substantive changes were made to the regu lations the alterations included the following changing the definition of biological assessment21 changing the definition of cumulative effects22 14 73 fed reg 76272 dec 16 2008 15 73 fed reg 63667 oct 27 2008 the final ea was announced with the final

the change to the definition of ba added two sentences to allow other documents to serve as formal ba with stated goal of promoting efficiency see table 1 action agencies would not have to create special document when that information was already available in another form although the action agency would have to indicate where the relevant material appeared if another document were used this appears consistent with the statute which already allows the ba to be part of review under the national environmental policy act nepa27 additionally the former regulations already provided that the contents of ba were at the discretion of the action agency 28 therefore this addition appears to have little legal or policy impact on the operation of the consultation process

the revised regulations added sentence to the existing definition of cumulative effects see table 1 the 1986 regulations defined cumulative effects as those effects of future state or private activities not involving federal activities that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area the amendment added this sentence cumulative effects do not include future federal activities that are physically located within the action area of the particular federal action under consultation the concept of cumulative effects was created by regulation not by statute in 1986 when this regulation was established the service justified using the term by saying that since federal agencies were required to investigate environmental impacts of proposed action in compliance with nepa and nepa required cumulative effects analysis it was already the action agencys continued 22 50 cfr 40202 23 50 cfr 40202 24 50 cfr 40203 25 50 cfr 40213 26 50 cfr 40214 27 42 usc 4321 et seq see

regulations the services stated that the context of cumulative effects under nepa is broader than that under the noting that the does not require consideration of future federal actions30 action agencies are required to consider cumulative effects in their bas31 and to provide written analysis of cumulative effects in the request for formal consultation32 the services are also required to consider cumulative effects during formal consultation service must review cumulative effects 33 and its biop must be based on whether the action together with cumulative effects of the action will jeopardize species or adversely modify critical habitat34 it is not clear what the language added to the definition provides the added language reiterates that federal activities are not factor in cumulative effects cumulative effects do not include future federal activities and refines the definition only to state that the effects do not include federal activities physically located within the action area 35 since federal activities are already excluded it is not clear why it is necessary to say federal activities that are physically located near the project are also excluded

the concept of cumulative effects is clearer when read together with the regulation addressing effects of the action while cumulative effects analysis excludes federal actions the definition of effects of the action requires action agencies and the services to consider the past and present impacts of federal actions and the anticipated impacts of all proposed federal projects in the action area that have already undergone consultation36 see table 1 note that neither term requires consideration of future federal actions the action agencies and the services must consider the effects of an action during the consultation process the regulations require the action agency to discuss the effects of an action as part of its ba 37 the service must include detailed discussion of the effects of an action in its biop38 the revised regulation modifies term nested within the definition of effects of an action indirect effects indirect effects are included within the regulation in response to

consultation39 when the regulation was being drafted in 1986 the services refused to narrow the definition to omit these effects stating the service declines to narrow the scope of its review as requested by one commenter in light of existing case law40 the revised regulation has two changes to the definition of indirect effects altered only slightly between the proposed and the final versions the services stated that these changes would simplify the consultation process and make it less burdensome and timeconsuming 41 the first change requires the proposed action to be an essential cause of those indirect effects according to the services an essential cause is cause that is necessary for that effect to occur42 the regulation continues if an effect will occur whether or not the action takes place the action is not an essential cause of the indirect effect this suggests that when multiple stressors affect species an action agency might not have to consider what harm an action was doing to species if other harms were just as severe or if the same consequences would occur without the action similar interpretation of effects of the action was rejected by at least one federal court specifically the ninth circuit rejected an argument that an agency action would not jeopardize species because the species was in jeopardy already even where baseline conditions already jeopardize species an agency may not take action that deepens the jeopardy by causing additional harm 43 inclusion of essential cause seems to take the position rejected by the court by saying that if species is already in jeopardy an agency action that adds to that harm is not an essential part of the effect of the action this appears contradictory to the fundamental purpose of the to conserve threatened and endangered sp ecies the act does more than require agencies to avoid jeopardizing listed species they have an affirmative responsibility to conserve species44 according to the us supreme court federal agencies have the obligation to afford first priority to the declared national policy of saving endangered species emphasis added45 the second change to indirect effects requires that reasonably certain to occur must be based on clear and substantial information this is appears to be new legal standard not used in other statutes it is not the standard of information used throughout the statute and regulations which instead use the best scientific and commercial data available standard with significant judicial analysis to define it species become threatened endangered or extinct for variety of reasons habitat loss or degradation is the most commonly cited cause but is rarely the sole cause moreover habitat may be lost in combination with many threats both foraging habitat and competition from invasive species eg in the case of the spotted owl both foraging habitat and bioaccumulation of toxins 39 national wildlife federation v coleman 529 f2d 359

loss of nesting habitat eg in the case of sea turtles in these three examples any one of the threats if left uncontrolled might be sufficient to jeopardize the continued existence of the species and ultimately lead to its extinction would an action that exacerbates just one threat and not another be eliminated from considerations of the effects of the action in both the ba and the biop the changes appear to permit this outcome specifically the revised rule states that if the action has an effect that will occur whether or not the action takes place the action is not an essential cause of the indirect effect46 in practice it may be extremely difficult for the services to determine whether an effect will occur regardless of an agency action the changed definition of effects of the action might take some actions and their effects off the consultation table when species faces multiple severe threats as the following examples illustrate is lower basin of watershed going to receive less water for endangered fish because of an upstream damor also because of increasing frequency of drought will mountaintop species suffer popul ation reductions due to global warming and therefore the effects of upwind power plants can be ignored

subsection b consultation is needed w hen the direct and indirect effects of that action are not anticipated to result in take49 the addition of take as criterion for when consultation is required appears to be significant change the previous standards for consultation turned on questions of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species and modifying its critical habitat that review considered effects that could be at species or landscape level and applied equally to plants and animals take on the other hand is more immediate action focusing on individual organisms and taking of plants is not prohibited50 the result could be that projects that are unlikely to result in killing an animal but might have more marginal effects small decrease in the number of eggs laid lower availability of spawning degraded habitat etc might escape the need for consultation even if the longterm effects of the action might eventually result in jeopardy the take requirement might reduce the number of consultations the additional criteria also seem targeted at eliminating consultations those criteria are the action has effect on listed species or critical habitat 51 the effects of an action are manifested in global processes and cannot be reliably predicted or measured at the local scale52 the effects of an action are manifested in global processes and would result in only an extremely small insignificant local impact53 the effects of an action are manifested in global processes and pose remote potential risk of harm to species or habitat54 the effects of an action are not capable of being meaningfully identified or detected in manner that permits evaluation55 or the effects of an action are wholly beneficial56 if the action agency determines that any one of these

licensing pesticides federal district court found that the regulations amounted to the services abdicating their role in consulting to reach the jeopardy decision57 the regulations in that case would have allowed epa to determine that its own action was not likely to adversely affect nlaa species and end the section 7 process there the court found the regulation flawed unilaterallymade nlaa determination cannot be converted into section 7a2 finding of not likely to jeopardize without consultation with the relevant service 58 on the other hand different federal court found the regulations for the national fire plan were not contrary to the because the services still played an oversight role in that case the regulations allowed agency personnel to make nlaa determinations without concurrence decision by service the court held that the additional procedures in which the services would monitor the program and train the personnel making the determinations adequately served the section 7 consultation mandates 59 the national fire plan is discussed in appendix below in practice action agencies decide when to consult however the changed regulations could be seen as giving more discretion to the agencies and posing the risk of putting the jeopardy evaluation into the hands of the action agency without input from the services as the statute makes clear the jeopardy decision is required to be result of the consultation and not to precede it on the other hand it is difficult to see the conservation purpose in requiring consultations that have effects on species or have wholly beneficial ones ultimately however it is the action agency that decides whether to consult so any consultation is due to initiation of the process by the action agency the changes would provide clearer regulatory justification for when they choose not to consult according to the federal register notice of the final version many commenters asserted the services cannot allow action agencies to make applicability determinations as set out in the rule that is they asserted that action agencies cannot decide without formal or informal consultation with the services that their action has effect or is essentially not likely to adversely aff ect listed species or critical habitat 60 the services addressed comments challenging the revisions to section 4023 in two ways first the services noted that the statute did not define consultation or assistance second the services asserted that shall in the statute at 16 usc 1536a2 did not modify consultation and assistance but modified the portion of the sentence addressing jeopardy of the species and protection of habitat section 1536a2 says in relevant part each federal agency shall in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary insure that any action authorized funded or car ried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endanger ed species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species the services first assertion appears to defy th plain meaning of the two words the services correctly note are undefined in the statute

define consultation and assistance in this provision61 while congress may have provided discretion to define how these terms are applied as basic premise of statutory interpretation in the absence of definition the ordinary meaning will prevail62 in this case under their common meanings neither consultation nor assistance can be defined as unilateral action both require interaction with another party that other party is established by the as one of the services the second assertion is that shall does not pertain the phrase directly following itin consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary the services said we believe the mandatory term shall in section 7a2 refers to the obligation of the action agency to avoid jeopardy or destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat not to requirement to consult on each and every action63 the services new interpretation would mean that the statute requires action agencies to ensure their actions do not jeopardize species or harm critical habitat but that the consultation and assistance section is optional to certain extent this is the way section 7 consultations have been conductedthat action agencies do not consult on apparently ecologically trivial actions with effect on species or habitat however many commenters expressed concern that the revised regulations go too far in excusing consultations the services also refer to dc district court decision as support of their argument that action agencies may opt out of consultations in certain circumstances the services refer to defenders of wildlife v kempthorne64 saying that the court rejected broad interpretation of section 7 requiring action agencies to consult on each and every action this may be an overly broad interpretation of that holding while the court did not require consultations on every action the court stated that if there were possibility of an effect on species or habitat the action agency must proceed to informal consultation 65 consultations were not required only if there were effect congress intended to allow action agencies to initially evaluate the potential environmental consequences of federal actions and to move forward on many of them without first consulting the services if they concluded that they had effect on listed species and their critical habitat66 it is not clear whether the court would consider small insignificant remote or local impacts the language within revised section 4023b2 the same as effect or more similar to the possibility of an effect and thus requiring informal consultation 61 73

the first subpart of b of the revised regulation allows the action agency to decide that its action has effect on listed species or designated critical habitat without any consultation this has the practical effect of eliminating consultations where species will not be impacted which seems consistent with the goal of the statute and is likely to promote efficiency for that reason there has always been tension between the plain language of section 7 and its practical application section 7a2 requires action agencies to ensure that any action is not likely to jeopardize protected species or adversely affect their critical habitats logic dictates that not all actionsordering office supplies for examplerequire consultation the statute requires agencies to determine that their actions will not commit the harm described with the assistance of the secretary and in consultation with the secretary however the consultation handbook of the services provides that if an action agency determines that its action will have effect on species it does not need to initiate consultation 67 on the other hand by allowing an action agency to decide initially that its project will have effect the regulations read more like nepa which requires agencies to act if project would have significant impacts on the environment68 that may be more realistic approach to consultations but it is arguably outside the services authority to create such regulatory scheme

species or critical habitat that language is completely eliminated from the final version instead the final version refers to global processes which is not defined in the regulations in the notice of the final version the services suggested that global processes could be synonymous with climate change the most topical example of effects that would be manifested only through global process is the effects of individual sources of greenhouse gas emissions and their contribution to global climate change and warming 69 the revised regulations state that if effects of an agency action are evidenced only by global processes and one of three conditions occur consultation does not apply to that action the regulations state that consultation is not necessary if those effects cannot be reliably predicted or measured at the local scale or would result in an extremely small insignificant local impact or have remote potential risk of harm to species or habitat70 67 fws and nmfs final section 7

attempt to limit the application of section 4023b71 because this change is more than mere semantics this final version is exposed to the claim that it lacked public notice and comment while final regulations are expected to have some changes from the draft versionnotably improvements based on commentsthe final rule must be the logical outgrowth of the proposed rule72 if change is so different from the draft it is considered unforeseeable court could find the change violated the apa requirements of giving the public notice and the opportunity to comment on regulatory changes 73 this subsection appears to require certain analyses to occur before consultation is determined to apply this appears in the requirement that an action agency should evaluate the effects of an action to decide whether consultation is applicable based on the definition of effects of an action this evaluation requires an agency to consider an environmental baseline and indirect and direct effects of its proposed action and forms significant portion of the consultation review before the regulatory changes that evaluation would have occurred during consultation as part of ba and biop section 40203b brings that phrase into different part of the section 7 process if the revised regulation is taken at face value the effects of an action would have to be scrutinized in the context of global processes this means the new regulations would require action agencies to perform much of the work of consultation before even determining one was required another potential result of the final version is that more actions could advance to consultation than under the proposed version the services indicated that the revision was designed to create very narrow exception to consultation 74 under the proposed version which rejected consultations when effects were insignificant contributors to an effect on species it would have been difficult to argue that single title v permit issued under the clean air act was responsible for the global warming that put endangered coral at risk however under the final version it is possible to argue that the effects of the permitting process are manifested through global processes and are predictable at local level warmer oceans mean weaker coral however the services argue that the effects must be considered only for those global processes produced by the one action and that the result of one power plants emissions cannot be measured at the local scale 75 second way in which the final version appears to advance more actions to consultation than would have occurred under the draft is under subsection b2iii the proposed version read that if the effects of an action on listed species or critical habitat were such that potential risk of jeopardy to the listed species or adverse modification or destruction of the critical habitat is remote consultation was required the services revised this due to public comment the final version reads that if the effects are manifested only through global processes and are such that the potential risk of harm to species or habitat is remote then consultation is required 76 the

listed species and adversely modifying or destroying critical habitat versus harming habitat these terms have precise meaning in practice jeopardizing species means the action is likely to cause the species to become extinct77 harming species on the other hand suggests injuring or killing specific creature78 the same disparity occurs regarding habitat in that destroying critical habitat is not as severe as harming habitat especially when this appears to apply to all habitat and not merely that area specifically designated as critical accordingly the final version may require consultation for less harmful actions than the proposed version thereby increasing the number of consultations

between the agencys action and the specific harm consultation is required if the effects of the action are not capable of being meaningfully identified or detected in manner that permits evaluation this determination is made by the action agency before the consultation process starts and it is not clear what scientific standards will be used to make this determination according to the services the consultation handbook indicates best judgment will be used79 because section 40203b clearly addresses both direct and indirect effects it may be presumed that the reference to effects means both this suggests that the action agency would perform some form of an effects analysis prior to deciding whether consultation is required

this revision allows an action agency to decide consultation is not necessary if the action would be wholly beneficial to the species it would promote efficiency in the section 7 process by

eliminate the services oversight under strict reading of the statute but when taken in light of the purposes of the statute appears consistent with the s goals

performing complicated effects analysis determining that they must consult with the services it seems subsection c could allow agencies to segment their projects and initiate consultation only for those parts that may have an effect that is significant identifiable and poses more than remote risk of jeopardy the services use power plant emissions as an example saying that the immediate local effect of the emissions may require consultation but the climate change aspects would not81 because these determinations appear to be made by an action agency without the consultation or assistance of the services they are arguably contrary to the there appears to be an inconsistency between the revisions in subsection c and those in section 40213 subsection c permits an agency to consult for only part of project however the changes to section 40213informal consultationsrequire an action agency to consider the effects of the action as whole in that case whatever aspects of the action that were not advanced to consultation could be considered during the consultation anyway when the agency considered the effects of the action as whole

formal consultations making practical distinction based on the likely severity of an actions impacts the informal consultation regulation was designed to provide more efficient way of evaluating effects by stopping the consultation process for projects that upon further informal review are found not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat 82 if it agrees the service is required to concur with the action agencys determination of not likely to adversely affect in writing the revised regulations make procedural changes and substantive additions to the informal consultation process

the first change modifies the scope of what is reviewed in an informal consultation the previous regulations stated if during informal consultation it is determined by the federal agency that the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat the consultation process is terminated and further action is necessary83 the revised regulation increases the scope beyond the agency action to include other relevant projects section 40213a reads if during informal consultation it is determined by the federal agency that the action or number of similar actions an agency program or segment of comprehensive plan is not likely to adversely affect listed species the consultation process is terminated if the service concurs in writing this appears to allow one informal consultation for related projects which could promote efficiency by allowing one review and one concurrence by the service determining when actions are in fact similar however could be controversial it is also not clear whether the action agency would determine unilaterally whether consultation would occur on one action or similar actions or whether the decision to aggregate actions requires the written concurrence of the service it appears that the concurrence refers to the not 81 see 73 fed reg at 7628283 82 51 fed reg at 19948 june 3 1986 83 50 cfr 40213a

and could mean the service has to agree as to the relatedness of the actions too another significant issue is whether considering only segment of comprehensive plan could obscure the full agency

previous regulatory language alters the substance of the informal consultation review that addition states for all requests for informal consultation the federal agency shall consider the effects of the action as whole on all listed species and critical habitats85 as discussed earlier effects of the action appears in the context of an action agencys ba in formal consultations this would add that evaluation to informal consultations as well this appears to increase the burden of informal consul tations without necessarily offering relief from the formal consultation process

service to provide written response with the action agencys determination of not likely to adversely affect if service has not responded within 60 days of the action agencys notification of its nlaa determination the consultation may be terminated without the services concurrence 86 the services may extend the deadline by an additional 60 days and consultation may continue beyond this term if all the parties agree section 40213b states that this termination means that section 7a is satisfied while the deadline may spur efficiency by forcing response from the service it also could violate the statutes purpose of having the service and the action agency determine projects potential harms using the best scientific and commercial data available additionally as pointed out in gao report referred to by the services having adequate staff to address consultations is problem 87 the time limit could allow projects that may pose jeopardy to move forward due to default or lead to hasty

formal consultation process is link to the deadline imposed by the informal consultation the revised regulation states that formal consultation is not required under two circumstances 1 if the service agrees in writing that the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or 2 if informal consultation has been completed without written concurrence from the service within the appropriate time 88 overall the potential effects of the changes include blurring the distinction between informal and formal consultation both would presumably be gin with written requests both would involve analyses of effects of the action and both would have time limits for completion89 informal consultation could become more formalized also action agencies could be relieved from official formal consultations in the case of default by the services regardless of the impact of their projects the revised processes for informal and formal consultation raise number of questions the regulations might create perverse incentive to provide inadequate information because an agency could submit incomplete data in hopes that an already overburdened service would miss its deadline and the project could proceed this would involve the action agencys assuming the risk of potentially taking listed species without an incidental take statement its if the services must judge whether project may affect species or critical habitat in very limited time would the services issue fewer concurrences and require more projects to advance to formal consultation if so rather than decreasing the services responsibilities the changes might increase their work load

listed species and their habitatsnot the effects of climate change on listed species there are few agency actions that produce ghgs directly most actions result in permits or licenses for others to produce the gases therefore arguably agency actions would have only indirect effects on producing ghgs which 88 proposed 50 cfr 40214b 89 under current regulations the deadline for formal consultation

lack of causation is the reason actions authorizing ghg emissions do not require consultation there is currently way to determine how the emissions from specific project under consultation both influence climate change and then subsequently affect specific listed species or critical habitat including polar bears as we now understand them the best scientific data currently available does not draw causal connection between ghg emissions resulting from specific federal action and effects on listed species or critical habitat by climate change nor are there sufficient data to establish the required causal connection to the level of reasonable certainty between an actions resulting emissions and effect on species or critical habitat 91 the revised regulations advance the services position that an consultation should not consider the effects of ghg emissions the services gave these reasons for why ghg emissions from project are not part of consultation impacts associated with global warming do not constitute effects of the action because they are not an essential cause of the effects 40202 ghg emissions may be an insignificant contributor to any adverse impacts proposed 40203b2 this was eliminated in the final version ghg emissions may not be capable of being meaningfully identified or detected in manner that permits evaluation 40203b3i and the potential risk of harm to species or habitat from those ghg emissions is remote 40203b3iii this was moved to 40203b2iii and revised in the final version92 the revised regulations however do not expressly refer to ghgs but instead use the term global processes which is undefined the services indicated they chose global processes as way to limit application of the revised section of when consultation is needed to exclude only those evaluations involving climate change93 it is not clear why they did not do so directly by referring to climate change rather than using what could be found to be vague term global processes could include such other interrelated factors as niño changing drought patterns and rising sea levels most scientists agree that countless sources of ghg emissions are driving climate change under the revised regulations however ghg emissions from particular or narrowly defined agency action may not be considered an essential cause of any climate change effects on species under the revised regulations an agency action must be an essential cause of an effect on species for it to be considered after the consultation process has begun the services described essential cause as meaning the effect would not occur but for the action under consultation there must be close causal connection between the action under consultation and the effect that is being evaluated 94 the causal link to

which then must affect species the remaining changes in the rule influence how the action agency decides whether consultation applies to an action actions that manifest themselves in global processes which presumably would include increased ghgs would require cons ultation under certain circumstances such as if the local impacts could be reliably predicted or the local impacts were more than extremely small insignificant here in the context of ghgs the aggregation of actions could be key according to the services epa modeling indicated that the emissions of very large coalfired power plant would likely result in rise in the maximum global mean temperature of less than onethousandth of degree95 however an agency action that consists of permitting process involving hundreds of ghg sources may be significant projects leading to ghg emissions may not require consultation if the effects of the action cannot be meaningfully identified or detected in manner that permits evaluation it is not clear what might constitute an evaluation for example there may be enough data to determine whether an effect will be positive or negative but not the magnitude of the effect the standard for this evaluation may be the best available scientific information in which case such an evaluation may suffice the services said the decision would be based on best judgment96 another change to the current regulations that the services have indicated will exclude some consultations on projects with ghg emissions is the provision that the effects of the action must be such that the potential risk of harm to species or habitat is remote remote has many meanings noting that the provision containing the term had been modified the services indicated that remote could apply to time space probability of occurrence or other things97 the complexities of global climate modeling make such an assessment on an individual project problematic in the context of ghg emissions and global climate change the question of aggregation of actions upon which to consult appears to be pivotal the revised regulations allow agencies to consider not just an agency action but number of similar actions an agency program or segment of comprehensive plan 98 this seems targeted toward efficiency but consolidated agency actions could have much bigger impact than would be measurable for an individual action and arguably constitute an essential cause of an indirect harm however it is not clear from the revision whether the decision to submit just one action or combined program for review is at the discretion of the action agency or requires the concurrence of the service proponents of the changes contend that ghg emissions from most agency actions do not have causal effect on species and that the should not be used to regulate ghg emissions others argue that climate change has an impact on species and should be considered under consultations though proponents maintain that the number of federal agency actions with the potential to affect climate change may be so large as to overwhelm the services99 in the lawsuit 95 73 fed reg at 76283 96 73 fed reg at 76284 referring to the

regulations is the imposition of deadline on informal consultation and the subsequent effect of that deadline on formal consultation this section will examine one projects request for consultation with fws and relate it to the proposed regulations the desert rock energy project concerns the construction of coalfired power plant on navajo land in northwestern new mexico110 the bureau of indian affairs bia was the action agency it is not clear when the phone calls and emails that often begin informal consultation first occurred but on april 30 2007 the bia sent fws its ba concerning the effects of the proposed project on five endangered species one threatened species and designated critical habitat for two of the endangered species the ba determined that the project was not likely to adversely affect the five endangered species nor the two critical habitats but was likely to adversely affect the threatened species on july 2 2007 fws asked the bia to submit additional information that was not included in the first ba since an adequate ba had not yet been supplied consultation was still considered informal the bia submitted revised ba on october 26 2007 on january 7 2008 fws replied noting that number of the questions contained in its earlier response had not been answered and that all of the species might be adversely affected as might the designated critical habitats among the issues not addressed in the revised ba according to fws were the ba assumed that the plant would be fired by coal that was different in chemical composition in concentrati ons of mercury selenium and other contaminants from the nearby coal that was likely to be used and which according to the us geological survey had higher concentrations of these contaminants than the coal assumed in the bia analysis fws could not analyze species impacts until the ba included an analysis of the coal actually to be used heavy metals can accumulate in organisms if the coal that is actually used has more heavy metals than bia models assumed then new analysis of this risk would be necessary the cumulative effects of three existing plants plus the new plant plus global climate change were not fully analyzed the desert rock memorandum from fws conclude d that formal consultation would begin when it had received the requested information or an explanation why the information was not made available additional documents have been exchanged between the agencies although discussion between them continues 110 it is not clear whether this timeline is typical of secti on 7 consultations it was chosen for the ready availability of relevant documents and the record of protracted discussions between an action agency and fwsa scenario that may be affected by the deadlines proposed in the new regulations for information on consultation on the desert rock energy project see fws memorandum to regional director navajo regional office bureau of indian affairs gallup new mexico subject

changes in the process might have occurred first there might have been some effort on the part of bia to document the date on which informal consultation began second if one assumes that the april 20 2007 memo started informal consultation then the proposed regulations would have allowed bia to terminate consultation 120 days later on august 28 2007 without the concurrence of fws due to incomplete information however bia chose to continue the consultation process for several reasons first considerable opposition to the desert rock energy project exists making citizen suit likely and bia would not have an its excusing incidental takes second fws continues to work with bia to address the problems in the second amended ba if jeopardy or adverse modification of critical habitat could occur it may be possible to develop reasonable and prudent alternatives through the consultation process that would avoid jeopardy adverse modification of critical habitat and citizen suits if action agencies were to choose to terminate informal consultation and rely on that termination to avoid formal consultation the focus of action would likely shift from the consultation process to the courtroom where quick resolution is major goal the courts might not be an action agencys preferred choice more importantly the action agency would not have an its that would excuse incidental takes of species leaving it vulnerable to charges alleging violations g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 kristina alexander legislative attorney
