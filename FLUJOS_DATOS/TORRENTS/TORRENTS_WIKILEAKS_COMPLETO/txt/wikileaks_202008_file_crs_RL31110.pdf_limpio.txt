insurance are key element of the us economy with international trade in services generally rising financial services have become critical element of new and proposed multilateral regional and bilateral trade agreements as well as source of some disputes with major trading partners congress not only oversees this critical industry but it also has very substantial responsibilities with regard to us trade trade policy and trade agreements of which financial services are today an important part us policy has been to extend national treatment to foreign financial firms operating within the united states and to seek national treatment for us firms operating abroad in addition the united states has sought to improve market access by seeking the reduction of various barriers including for example limits on types of products that may be sold ceilings on the level of activity or limitations on the right to establish commercial presence within country the world trade organization wto provides the first multilateral framework for trade in financial services the financial services agreement fsa of the general agreement on trade in services gats the fsa went into effect on march 1 1999 after difficult and drawn out negotiations its impact has largely been to bind current practices but it is workinprogress under article xix of the gats new set of negotiations on services including financial services commenced in february 2000 financial services will also likely be part of new round of wto negotiations that might be launched although the completed but still pending agreements with vietnam and jordan do not open up financial markets of any significant size they may provide opportunities for some us firms the united states is negotiating free trade agreements with chile and singapore the financial sectors of these two countries are largely open but financial services issues nevertheless are important aspects of these negotiations the united states is also in the midst of negotiating the proposed free trade area of the americas ftaa with the 34 countries of the western hemisphere excluding cuba an area with which the united states already enjoys healthy surplus in financial services the ftaa is to be implemented by december 2005 financia l services trade remains an important element of established us regional and bilateral trade arrangements and relationships the north american free trade agreement nafta historically the first trade agreement to address financial services trade issues fully opened the financial markets of our two nafta partners canada and mexico resulting in financial services trade surplus for the united states the european union eu is fully open without bilateral accord financial services trade with japan is modest it has not grown appreciably in recent years and the united states has been pressing japan to open up its financial services market to more trade wto access for china is likely to open few

have active financial sectors such as switzerland and bermuda nevertheless the category designated other accounts for nearly half 458 of combined us financial services and insurance exports moreover it includes some significant markets such as mexico argentina and brazil which are not known particularly for being offshore financial centers delivery channel two foreign affiliates of multinational corporations services are also delivered through affiliates of us corporations operating abroad and foreign corporations operating in the united states affiliates of multinational companies are regarded as residents of the countries in which they are located sales by foreign affiliates of us companies to foreign buyers are therefore considered transactions between foreign persons similarly sales by the us affiliates of foreign companies to us persons are transactions between us residents since sales and purchases by affiliates largely occur within the same country neither type of sale is an international transaction their value is not therefore captured by the international transactions data that are reported quarterly by the doc instead estimates for the services transactions of affiliates are developed separately as part of larger doc studies of direct investment details on services trade of affiliates are presented annually in articles published in the docs survey of current business 6 in 1998 the latest year for which data onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs5 6continued also available online it should be noted that the quarterly international transactions data do include data on the crossborder trade of affiliates both the foreign affiliates of us firms and the us affiliates of foreign firms 7 ibid p 119 8 ibid p 120 9 ibid 10 department of the treasury national treatment study1998 washington 1998 p 28the services transactions of affiliates are available sales of services to foreigners by the foreign affiliates of us firms amounted to 3090 billion while purchases by us persons from the us affiliates of foreign firms amounted to 2551 billion7 services delivered by us affiliates operating abroad have exceeded crossborder service exports since 1996 services delivered by the affiliates of foreign companies operating in the united states have exceeded crossborder service imports since 19898 thus the largest channel of delivery for services entering international trade is through direct investment the doc notes however that for specific types of services the relative importance of the two channels is difficult to gauge because the available data on us crossborder trade are generally classified by type of service whereas the data on sales of services through affiliates are classified by primary industry of the affiliate 9 underlining added moreover the industry classification of affiliates has been shifted from the 1987 sicbased standard industrial classification system to the 1997 naicsbased north american industry classification system system this has made for some discontinuity in the data series notably under the sicbased classification system services did not include finance and insurance us policy the united states employs policy of national treatment for foreign financial institutions that operate in the united states that is the united states endeavors to provide equality of competitive opportunity to foreignowned banks and securities firms operating in the united states to that afforded domesticallyowned firms10 at the same time the united states promotes the role of us financial services firms abroad by encouraging other countries to apply national treatment to foreign firms in their markets the national treatment of foreign financial services firms is ensconced in us law for example the international banking act of 1978 provides for national treatment of foreign banks in the united states subsequent changes to us banking laws and regulations have taken into account national treatment of foreign banks in addition under the financial reports act of 1988 the secretary of the treasury must provide to congress quadrennial study of changes in laws that

united states trade representative national trade estimate report 2000 p 20national treatment of foreign banks and securities firms in the united states the study also provides information on the treatment of us banks and securities firms in other countries indicating whether or not they are accorded national treatment in addition to the reporting requirements the statute states that the president or his designee when advantageous should conduct discussions with governments of major financial centers to ensure that they provide national treatment to us financial services firms and that they allow us firms to offer as wide range of products as possible comparable to what they offer in the united states the statute provides authority to impose sanctions or other means to enforce national treatment of banks and securities firms in other countries proposals to strengthen this provision have been offered in the congress but have not been enacted during the 103rd congress for example the fair trade in international services act of 1994 s 1527 hr 3248 was incorporated into broader bill but dropped during conferen ce among other things the bill would have required the secretary of the treasury to identify and report to congress every two years on countries which do not provide national treatment to us banks and securities firms and to apply sanctions if negotiations fail to get the countries to apply national treatment the united states has been pressing other countries to open their markets to us financial services firms in bilateral agreements regional arrangements such as nafta and in multilateral fora including the oecd and the wtogats general agreement on trade in services in addition the us department of commerce promotes exports of insurance by providing firms with information on opportunities and on foreign government regulations regarding insurance the treasury department assists banks and securities firms barriers to financial services trade financial services firms confront several types of barriers for example some countries impose restrictions on the types of products service providers may sell until recently for example japan heavily restricted sales of life and nonlife insurance by foreign insurance companies limiting them to sales of specialty or thirdsector insurance market in which japanese companies were not very competitive other countries impose ceilings on the amount of products that foreign firms may sell11 the government of brazil denies foreign marine cargo insurers the opportunity to compete for business and requires state companies doing business with insurance brokerage firms to use 100 brazilianowned brokerages12 most indian banks are governmentowned and entry of foreign banks remains highly regulated foreign bank branches and representative offices are permitted based upon reciprocity andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs7 13 ibid p 164 14 brief discussion of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the bank for international settlements bis is contained in annex ii indias estimated or perceived need for financial services as result access for foreign banks has traditionally been limited13 most services require direct contact between buyer and seller it is important therefore for many us financial services firms to establish physical presence in the foreign market in order to sell its services the presence could be in the form of whollyowned subsidiary branch of usbased firm or jointventure with local firm one category of barriers faced by us financial services is foreign government restrictions on foreign direct investment some foreign governments for example limit or completely restrict foreign ownership of banks and securities firms or require the employment of homebased personnel it should be kept in mind that these restrictions aside the overall trend is one of worldwide liberalization of financial services markets many countries in asia and latin america for example have reduced capital controls foreign investment restrictions and other limits some observers have suggested that the rapidity of liberalization in east asia in the early and mid1990s might have contributed to the asian financial crisis in 19971998 multilateral agreements and organizations the world trade organization wto and the gats the wto provides the first and only multilateral framework of principles and rules for government policies and regulations affecting trade in financial services banking securities and insurance among more than 100 countries representing many levels of economic development the wto coverage of trade in financial services is contained in the general agreement on trade in services gats which was agreed to during the uruguay round although broad in scope the gats remains workinprogress as services including financial services will be part of any new round of wto negotiations that its members may launch14 background the seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted more than quarter century ago in the trade act of 1974 the congress instructed the administration to push for an agreement on trade in services under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt during the tokyo round negotiations while the tokyo round concluded in 1979 without services agreement the industrialized countries led by the united states continued to press for their inclusion in later negotiations developing countries whose service sectors are less advanced than those of the industrialized countries were reluctant to have services includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs8 15 feketekuty geza international trade in services an overview and blueprint for negotiations

httpwwwwtoorg eventuall services were included as negotiating objectives in the 1986 declaration that launched the uruguay round agenda15 the general agreement on trade in services gats the basic characteristics of goods and services are fundamentally different goods are tangible while services are not furthermore the trade barriers that service providers face are much different than those faced by sellers of merchandise many of the barriers merchandise vendors confront are at the border for example tariffs and other customs measures service providers in contrast are faced largely with government rules and regulations that operate inside the country rather than at the border because of these differences many of the rules established under the gatt for merchandise trade are not applicable to trade in services without modifications uruguay round negotiators created the general agreeme nt on trade in services gats as parallel framework to the goodsoriented gatt to accommodate the differences negotiations and agreements on financial services trade come under the gats the united states and the european union eu were the predominant promoters of including services trade in the uruguay round their efforts mirror the strong position of the service sector in the us and eu economies and their global competitiveness the gats agreement most of which was completed by december 1993 is divided into six parts16 part i article i defines the scope of the gats it provides that the gats applies to all services except those supplied in the routine exercise of government authority to all government barriers to trade in services at all levels of government national regional and local and to all four modes of delivery of services crossborder consumption abroad that is consumption of service by the resident of one country in the territory of the supplier country temporary movement of foreign supplier to the country of the consumer and permanent commercial presence of foreign supplier in the country of the consumer part ii articles iixv presents the principles and obligations some of which mirror those in the gatt for trade in goods while others are specific to services these principles and obligations include httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs9 17 the gats differs from the gatt in that it has allowed members to take temporary exemptions to mfn treatment the exemptions are listed in special annex to the gats the gats allows only these onetime exemptions the gats as is the case of the gatt also allows mfn exemptions in the cases of regional agreementsunconditional mostfavorednation mfn nondiscriminatory treatment that is services imported from one member country cannot be treated any less favorably than the services imported from another member country 17 transparency that is governments must publish rules and regulations reasonable impartial and objective administration of government rules and regulations that apply to covered services monopoly suppliers must act consistently with obligations under the gats in covered services member incurring balance of payments difficulties may temporarily restrict trade in services covered by the agreement and member may circumvent gats obligations for national security purposes part iii articles xvixviii of the gats establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members the gats binds each member to its commitments once it has made them that is member country may not impose less favorable treatment than what it has committed to prohibits memberc ountry governments from placing limits on suppliers of services from other member countries regarding the number of foreign service suppliers the total value of service transactions or assets the number of transactions or value of output the type of legal entity or joint venture through which services may be supplied and the share of foreign capital or total value of foreign direct investment requires that member governments accord service suppliers from other member countries national treatment that is foreign service or service provider may not be treated any less favorably than domestic provider of the service and allows members to negotiate further reductions in barriers to trade in services importantly unlike mfn treatment and the other principles listed in part ii which apply to all service providers more or less unconditionally the obligations under part iii are restricted they apply only to those services and modes of delivery listed in each members schedule of commitments thus unless member country has specifically committed to open up its market to service suppliers in particular service that is provided via one of the four modes of delivery the national treatment and

of commitments are in essence the core of the gats parts ivvi articles xixxxix are technical but important elements of the agreement among other things they include the requirement that later than 2000 the gats members start new negotiations to expand coverage of the agreement and establish the requirement that conflicts between members involving implementation of the gats be handled in the wtos dispute settlement mechanism the gats also includes eight annexes including one on mfn exemptions another annex provides prudential carve out that is recognition that governments take prudent actions to protect investors or otherwise maintain the integrity of the national financial system these prudent actions are allowed even if they conflict with obligations under the gats financial services under the gats the negotiations on financial services proved to be among the most difficult of the uruguay round negotiations on services in fact by the time the uruguay round negotiations formally concluded at the end of 1993 critical differences remained among participants in gats on financial services and prevented them from reaching final agreement19 final agreement was not reached until 1997 the 1995 interim agreement the united states in particular argued that many of the developing countries had not made strong enough commitments to liberalize their financial services sectors and refused to finalize an agreement negotiators agreed to extend the talks until july 1 1995 but the united states and other developed countries were dissatisfied with the results largely at the initiative of the eu negotiators brokered an interim agreement on july 28 1995 which locked in the commitments made by members up to that time and committed participants to continue to negotiate through 1997 fortythree countries the eu15 counted as one signed on to the agreement although the united states registered strong reservations the us contention was that since the financial sectors of the united states and many of the industrialized countries were already quite open the developing countries would be getting free ride if they were not more forthcoming in making commitments20 the

member to provide market access and national treatment to foreign providers in range of financial services according to one estimate the fsa covers 95 of the worlds financial services market about 18 trillion in global securities 38 trillion in international bank lendings and 25 trillion in gross insurance premiums23 summarizing or evaluating the fsa is challenge at best to do so requires the examination of the commitment schedules for each of the members each schedule contains commitments on the various types of services that are included within banking insurance and securities services and for each of these services there are commitme nts according to the four modes of distribution there are few commonal ities across commitment schedules other than obligations to subscribe to mfn transparency and the other basic principles some experts have attempted to make generalizations about the results of the fsa number of the experts have concluded that in general the members commitments consist largely of lockingin or binding current practices24 this finding may reflect the fact that the financial sectors in the united states and the other industrialized countries which account for the bulk of trade in financial services had been comparatively open even before the gats negotiations their current practices are already among the most liberal and cover all sectors of financial services25 concerning the nonindustrialized countries some studies concluded that there was clear correlation between the level of countrys economic development or the development of its financial services sector on the one hand and the level of its commitments under the gats on the other some of the least developed countries made commitments to open markets for services while some more developed countries made commitments that were at or below their current practices26 regarding commitments in specific types of sectors one study found that member countries made the largest number of commitments in life and nonlife directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs12 27 das p113 dobson and jacquet p 90 28 office of the united states trade representative 1999 ustr annual report march 2000 washington online version at httpwwwustrgov insurance and in services pertaining to bank lending and acceptances however in terms of the actual level of liberalization more was accomplished in insurance than in banking27 in its own evaluati on of the fsa the office of the ustr concluded that 52 countries guaranteed broad market access terms across all insurance sectors life nonlife reinsurance brokerage and auxiliary services and 14 additional countries have made commitments to open their markets in some sectors of insurance it also concluded that 59 countries have committed to permit 100 foreign ownership of subsidiaries or branches in banking and 44 countries have guaranteed to allow 100 foreign ownership of subsidiaries or branches in the securities sector28 evaluating the accomplishments and shortcomings of the fsa the fsa is landmark agreement in number of respects it is the first multilateral agreement on financial services binding its membergovernments to set of principles and rules on their treatment of foreign financial services and financial service providers its signatories include range of economies from highly industrialized countries to less developed countries from the perspective of the united states and the us financial services sector the gats and the fsa can be considered to have made some important positive gains they require many countries to maintain at minimum established government practices that affect the treatment of providers of selected services and prohibit them from imposing more restrictive practices without facing possible challenges from the united states or other wto members under the wto dispute mechanism in addition some countries have made commitments to move beyond current practices and liberalize their markets in selected services they commit gats members to afford mfn treatment transparency and other disciplines in sector that many developing countries and some developed countries have been very reluctant to expose to international rules the us financial services sector will likely benefit from more open foreign markets as member countries pursue negotiations on services as mandated under the gats the fsa binds japans commitments made under the bilateral agreements with the united states to the multilateral wto rules and dispute settlement mechanism the gats and the fsa also have shortcomings that will probably limit the benefits that us financial service providers enjoy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs13 the positive list approach to members commitments makes not offering national treatment and market access the default position rather than the exception as would be the case under negative list approach the positive list approach also makes negotiating and drawing up commitments to liberalize the financial services sectors more cumbersome and arduous task the separation of negotiations in financial and other services from negotiations in goods prevents negotiators from making crosssectoral concessions which might limit the types of concessions us negotiators can make in order to obtain concessions from developing countries in so doing the separate negotiating regimes might be retarding progress in financial services negotiations current and future wto negotiations article xix of the gats required wto members to begin new set of negotiations on services in 2000 in so doing it guaranteed that wto members would pursue negotiations on services even if they were not able to begin new full round article xix requires that during the negotiations participants work to resolve some conceptual and procedural issues how to give negotiating credit to governments that had unilaterally liberalized their services sectors since the conclusion of the first set of negotiations and whether to provide special treatment to least developed countries the new set of gats negotiations began in february 2000 and during the remainder of the year the members reviewed the status of commitments already made and developed set of guidelines in addition to the issues mandated by article xix the guidelines stipulate among other things that negotiators will continue to use the servicespecific modespecific positive list approach deadline has been set for the completion of the negotiations the united states had proposed that they be completed by 2002 gats members are now forming negotiating agenda by submitting proposals on each of the different services to date the united states canada and australia have submitted initial proposals for financial services negotiations the united states has proposed that wto members work toward removing restrictions on the establishmen t by foreign suppliers of commercial presence in their markets for example governments should allow greater flexibility in choosing the mode of presence eg branch joint venture or whollyowned subsidiary the united states also proposed working to remove restrictions on crossborder trade in financial services at this point it is not clear how the negotiations will proceed or how long they will take however if history is an indicator they are likely to be drawn out and complicated the tension between developed countries and developing countries over the pace and depth of financial service markets liberalization remainshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs14 29 us department of state

total us trade deficit for 2000 us official data on services trade do not disaggregate services trade with vietnam however one can assume that these trade flows are small as well the small volume of trade reflects the size of the vietnamese economy which had gdp of 29 billion in 1999 equal to about 310 of 1 of the 9299 billion us economy in the same year29 the legacy of the war between the two countries the central planned structure of the vietnamese economy and the relative mix of trade barriers that each country imposes on the other the purpose of the usvietnam agreement which was finalized on july 13 2000 but has not yet been approved by congress is to establish conditional normal trade relations between the united states and vietnam in accord with title iv of the trade act of 1974 the socalled the jacksonvanik amendment30 the agreement cannot go into effect until congress passes joint resolution of approval the agreement establishes conditions under which the two countries are to conduct trade one major condition is that the two countries extend mutual mostfavorednation treatment mfn sometimes called normal trade relations ntr status which in practice means applying the lowest nonpreferential tariffs on each others imports second condition is the application of national treatment to the products of the other country the vietnamese government has undertaken some reforms to introduce private sector participation in the economy but these reforms have been in fits and starts and more than half the economy remains under state control under the bilateral agreement vietnam has pledged to take specific measures to open its markets including services to us trade and investment vietnams commitments toward services are sectorspecific and delineated in an annex to the agreeme nt for those sectors covered by the agreement the agreement lays outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31110crs15 governing principles although even for these sectors the application of the principles may be restricted vietnam agrees to apply mfn and national treatment to us supplied services in addition the vietnamese government is to implement regulations in reasonable objective and impartial manner furthermore those vietnamese enterprise s that operate as monopolies and that also provide services outside of their monopolized sector must do so in accordance with conditions of the agreement vietnam has made specific commitments in opening trade and investment in financial services to usbased providers regarding insurance the agreement distinguishes between insurance required by law such as motorvehicle insurance or constructionrelated insurance and insurance not mandated such as life insurance after the agreement has been in effect three years vietnam will permit us firms providing nonmandatory insurance to invest in joint ventures with vietnameseowned firms up to level up to 50 ownership after the agreement has been in effect five years us insurance firms can establish 100 whollyowned firms in vietnam regarding mandatory insurance us firms may invest in joint ventures to unspecified level of equity three years after the agreement enters into force and can establish 100 whollyowned firms in vietnam six years after the agreement enters into force during the first three years after the agreement has gone into effect vietnam will permit us nonbank financial firms to establish joint ventures with vietnamese firms to unspecified levels of equity ownership and to establish 100owned firms after three years in effect securities brokerage firms are limited to establishing representative offices in vietnam in the area of banking services the agreement allows us banks to establish branches in vietnam in the form of joint ventures with vietnamese banks with 30 49 ownership during the first nine years of the agreements effective period and 100owned branches after nine years us banks may also invest in privatized vietnamese banks to the same level as vietnamese investors after the agreement enters into force us banks may accept deposits in vietnamese currency dong on graduated basis until full national treatment is reached furthermore after the agreement has been in effect three years the central bank of vietnam will provide us banks with access to discounting swap and forward facilities on full national treatment basis usjordan

schedule to annex 31 of the agreement the jordan fta is also the first bilateral treaty in which the united states has incorporated provisions on ecommerce the fta would not have major impact on the us economy or on us exports and imports because the bilateral commercial relationship is relatively small the jordanian economy had gdp of 8 billion31 in 1999 compared to us gdp of 9299 billion in the same year that is to say the measured size of the jordanian econom equaled less than 110th of 1 of the us economy us exports to jordan amounted to 312 million in 2000 our 75th largest export market imports customs basis amounted to 73 million our 123rd largest source of imports the resulting bilateral us trade surplus of 239 million was negligible in terms of the us external merchandise trade deficit of 4343 billion in 2000 trade with the united states is also not major factor in jordans external trade picture accounting in 1999 for 84 of jordans imports but only 17 of its exports the fta might nevertheless prove to be valuable to jordan as it attempts to modernize and energize its domestic economy by opening jordan up to the influences of the global economy indeed the fta is part of broad effort to connect jordan to the global economy an effort that for example led jordan to join the world trade organization wto in april 2000 data on us services trade with jordan are not disaggregated from the data on us services trade with other middle eastern countries given the size of the trading relationship however it is safe to say that jordan is not currently significant market for us service industries including financial and insurance services nevertheless some individual us companies might well benefit from reduction in jordans trade barriers shift that might contribute to an altered perception of market potential the jordanian banking system has 13 commercial banks five investment banks two islamic banks one industrial development bank and number of specialized credit institutions32 five of the commercial banks are branches of foreign banks in practice there are significant differences between the operations of the commercial banks and those of the investment banks many of the banks are small and family owned unofficial estimates place nonperforming loans at about 30 of outstanding loans33 the opening up of jordans banking sector to

move toward ever greater economic integration has brought two tectonic shifts of importance to financial markets the implementation of common currency the euro on january 1 1999 by 11 of the member

of us financial firms to operate within the european union eu rules now permit banks operating in one eu country to have branches in another country and to operate across member state borders without impediment banks are regulated by homecountry regulators products permitted in the home country may be marketed elsewhere in the eu eu banking directives set community wide minimum standards additionally eu law grants foreign bank subsidiaries national treatment this is superseded and reinforced by eu commitments to provide mostfavorednation treatment to both subsidiaries and branches

2001 p 1314the attempt to create an integrated market also applies to the securities markets stocks and bonds but has apparently been less successful than the consolidation of an euwide banking market recent economist notes that the eu securities market remains fragmented governed by colourful patchwork of regulation with some forty different regulatory authorities71 this fragmentation diminishes the depth and liquidity of the markets and makes the cost of capital in europe persistently higher than it is in america it also makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs to find startup funds72 the eu endorsed financial services action plan fsap at its lisbon summit in march 2000 the plan would accelerate the lagging efforts toward securities market integration in addition the eu also set up committee the lamfalussey committee to study securities market regulation the committee issued its final report in february 2001 dispute between eu finance ministers and the eu commission over the lamfalussey report was settled at the march 2324 2001 eu summit held in stockholm this should allow the eu to move ahead toward full integration of the securities market by 2005 if the agreement is not scuttled by the european parliament while securitiesmarket regulatory structure lags the market itself continues moving toward greater integration recent study by the bank for international settlements bis suggests that as macroeconomic conditions are becoming more synchronized in europe due to the introduction of the euro the pricing of equity risk is focusing increasingly on industrial sectors viewed from paneuropean perspective rather than on countryspecific factors73 these trends may present challenges and opportunities for us securities firms operating in europe they are not

the united states with around 450 billion in direct insurance premiums in 2000 however foreign insurers account for only small portion of the japanese insurance market after years of negotiations the united states got japan to agree in october 1994 to take measures to open its market for life insurance and nonlife insurance fire and auto insurance at the same time japan agreed to delay deregulation of the socalled thirdsector insurance market which encompasses specialty insurance coverage such as cancer hospitalization nursing care and personal accident so as not to reduce the competitive advantages foreign firms particularly us firms had built in this market at the end of 1995 and early 1996 us officials and the american insurance industry were becoming concerned that japan was reducing regulations on the third sector as well as the others contrary to the agreement after many months us and japanese negotiators reached second agreement on december 15 1996 under this agreement japan would open life and nonlife insurance markets to foreign competition and limit domestic company entry into the third sector until thirty months after it has made substantial progress in deregulating the life and nonlife sectors but the united states has protested that japan has already allowed domestic companies to enter the third sector japan has argued that it has already made

liberalization were adopted in 1961 the oecd current invisibles code promote s the nondiscriminatory liberalization of current payments and transactions88 similarly the oecd code on capital movements seeks to liberalize crossborder capital flows additions have been made to the codes on several occasions including the addition of financial services in 1992 as previously noted the codes are legally binding both codes provide framework of notification examination and consultation that allows for effective monitoring the goal of removing restrictions on invisibles and capital movements is thus achieved through peer pressure that is exercised by means of policy reviews and country examinations the codes are reference points from which countries move toward greater liberalization at varying speeds according to their differing circumstances liberalization is thus achieved by the unilateral action of individual oecd members rather through multilateral negotiations such as characterize the wto the codes are also reinforced by other multilateral agreeme nts the oecd code on current invisibles for example is complimented by the imfs role as promoter and protector of the freedom of current transactions at present the oecd is working on liberalizing insurance services and professional services the committee on financial markets cfm is the primary oecd body for dealing with issues
