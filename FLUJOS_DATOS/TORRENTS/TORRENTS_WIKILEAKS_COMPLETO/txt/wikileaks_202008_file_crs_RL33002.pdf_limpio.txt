cking industry began to move from large urban centers to small communities scattered throughout the midwest by centurys end this migration had effected major changes within the industry the old packing firms that had established their dominance during the late 1800s had largely disapp eared or been restructured as part of new breed of packers joining with the poultry processors who had emerged in the wake of world war ii they quickly became major force in american and later global industry the urbantorural migration some suggest had at least two major motivations one was to locate packing facilities in areas where animals we re raised rather than transporting the stock to urban packinghouses as had been the tradition more economical arrangement the other was quest for lower labor costs to leave behind the urban unions and their collective bargaining agreements and to operate as nearly as possible in unionfree environment this initiative involved lowwage strategy allowing for empl oyment of lower skilled and lowwage workers the aftermath of this migration was complex the urban unionized workforce by and large did not follow the migrating plants since most local communities could not provide an adequate supply of labor the relocation process implied recruitment of workers from outside the area of production in practice packers and processors came increasingly to rely upon recent immigrants or allegedly in some instances upon workers not authorized for employment in the united states gradually the new breed packers and their poultry counterparts began to dominate the market through various business arrangements consolidating the industry into small number of large firms this corporate churning impacted the trade union movement and its relations with the industry the unions too were restructured the labormanagement relationship largely set during the 1940s was gradually replaced with new patterns of bargaining further the demographics of the workforce changed with the introduction of new racialethnic and gender mixture distances between the rural plants made union organization difficult as did the new linguistic and cultural differences among workers gradually the workforce was transformed from highwage stable and union to lowerwage and often nonunion and came to be characterized by high turnover rate from time to time the congressional research service crs has received requests for information on labor standards and labormanagement relations in the meat packing industry often these queries have been associated with the fair labor standards act and the national labor relations act but there has been concern with other legislation and issues as well some of these areas have been and continue to be the subject of litigation this report is intended as an introduction to the meat packingprocessing industry the unions that have been active in that field and labormanagement practices among the packers and their employees it will not likely be updated

protective labor standards that apply to persons employed in the industry the last half of the 20th century witnessed relocation of major firms move from predominantly urban to more heavily rural production and shift in the demographics of the industrys workforce the dispersal of the industry some argue has also affected the manner in which employmentrelated law is enforced clearly it has impacted the trade unionization of the workforce at issue are number of federal statutes and their administration the fair labor standards act the national labor relations act the occupational safety and health act and potentially the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act similarly both the industry and its workforce have been affected by federal immigration policy these general areas have been continuing focus of department of labor dol action and of litigation 2 this report provides an introduction to labor issues in meat packing and poultry processing it sketches the evolution of the industry and of the related trade union movement stressing development of corporate and trade union cultures and the shifting demographics of the workforce it notes areas of tension and confli ct within and between both labor and management and it points to considerations of public policy that affect the continuing labormanagement relationship 3

animals collected from throughout the great plains were shipped to facilities normally located in major rail centers such as chicago kansas city or omaha dressed beef was then shipped to branch houses for final processing and sale pork was treated somewhat differently some being cured or later canned the packing plants were enormous multistory facilities animals entered at an upper level and the carcass moved along disassembly line until dressed meat and byproducts emerged at ground level refrigerated rail cars appeared in the 1870s and 1880s while this made shipment of dressed meat less difficult it appears not to have diminished the dominance of the great midwestern packing companies early in the 20 th century five firms became dominant swift armour morris wilson and cudahy by 1916 the big five slaughtered the great bulk of cattle calves hogs and sheep moving in interstate commerce5 the stock yards were capital intensive but with rapidly expanding workforce the workers and cattlemenfarmers found themselves at disadvantage when dealing with the packers who were highly organized with an eye for efficiency and profitability with the introduction of labor saving equipment and careful structuring of the work process the packers were increasingly able to employ largely lowwage workers with few skills 6 such work came to be associated with the most recent round of immigrant labor immigrants flooded the labor market and accepted the commonlabor earnings offered by industry simultaneously notes david brody an increasing number of women found place in the packing houses at wages well below the unskilled male rate7 gradually if sporadically the workforce became unionized wages increased worker protections were introduced and work processes became institutionalized g5g152g151g156g152g149g146g141g138g157g146g152g151g497g561g20g152g158g151g141g561g22g160g152g561 in the late 1950s two veteran packinghouse ex ecutives currier holman and andy anderson reassessed conditions in the beef packing industry why should meat companies they queried remain wagelocked in heavily unionized cities when unorganized workers could be hired at far lower

plants had become dated and in some measure inefficient further the continuing supply of cheap unskilled labor had begun to dry up9 and since the late 1930s the industry had become increasingly unionized led by ibp among others packers migrated to rural areas where land was cheaper and local communities pressed for economic development were willing to provide tax and other incentives to relocating firms10 but there were other elements as well growers found it more economical to move livestock to localregional center rath er than shipping animals to omaha or chicago the new 1950s interstate highway system provided easy access to national markets rather than ship sides of beef to markets for onsite cutting the packers introduced system of boxed beef in which meat deboned and trimmed was sealed in vacuum bags and shipped directly to supermarkets easier to handle boxed beef was quickly accepted by retailersand had the added advantage of largely eliminating the need for retail butchers 11 reduced labor costs were significant aspect of the move relocation altered the wage structure within which the industry operated12 the new workers were said to have been accustomed to low wages and to countrystyle nonunion work environment13 further automated facilities allowed the new breed14 of packers to organize line operations in manner that diminished the need for skilled workers permitting employment of inexperienced and lowwage personnel15 finally formation of new corporate entities with new plants in new locations permitted change from established labormanagement relationships 16 this migration involved fierce competition between firms for market share some older established firms went out of business or were taken over by new breed packers sometimes associated with conglomerates others adjusted to the new strategies but in the process changed their corporate cultureadopting more contentious labormanagement relationship by 1990 new big three had

industry with the restructuring of the 1960s such distinctions came increasingly to be blurred single corporation might have interests in each lineand in other areas as well until the early 1940s poultry raising was largely small farm type operation its transformation began with wartime demand initially large numbers of relatively small growers entered the field but at least by the 1950s some consolidation had begun by the late 20 th century five or six major concerns had come to dominate poultry productionwith about 250000 persons employed in the industry17 before the 1960s suggests bob hall of the institute for southern studies nearly all birds were shipped whole from the slaughterhouse to the grocery store where butchers cut them up or packaged them wholesometimes w ith the store label today 1989 he states poultry giants have replaced the neighborhood butcher with huge processing units attached to their slaughterhouses by 1990 the industry expected to produce 55 billion broilers year 18 more recently there has been transition to valueadded products such as chicken fajitas and nuggets several patterns quickly developed the industry increasingly came to be centered in the delmarva region and the south in structure with growth it became vertically integrated with corporate control of the birds from egg to market sequentially two groups of workers are involved

grow out farmers usually the processor or integrator provides the chicks feed any necessary medication etc to the grower the grower provides the buildings in which the birds are raised and the labor involved in caring for themreceiving four or five batches of chicks each year when the boilers are ready for slaughter the integrator dispatches crew of chicken catchers to retrieve the birds and haul them to the processing plant ordinarily the farmer does not actually own the chickens that are raised for the processor for the growout farmer several patterns have developed first starting from marginal agricultural operation the farmer may take out loan to construct his growing facilities in the 1990s reasonable structure may well have cost about 100000perhaps more several such chicken

industry early developed in the rural south where land was relatively cheap and water prime requirement for meat packing and poultry processing was relatively plentiful as with beef packing lowwage labor with unionfree environment seems to have been an important consideration in the 1960s many rural workers lacked marketable skills more traditional family farming for many longer offered significant employment and thus the superfluous labor of farming communities became available for processing plants and for parttime labor on the growout farms 27 some suggest that the industry had concentrated in righttowork states in an effort to minimize labor costs and had systematically developed lowwage strategy 28 plants are described as operating on twotier labor system on top are core workers trained stable with strong labor market attachment who keep the plants operating they are supplemented by body of unskilled lowwage workers with high turnover rate the latter it appears have low expectations both with respect to living and working conditions and may view their employment as shortterm they are unlikely to complain or to join union especially if they are not authorized residents the twotier system reportedly allows integration of new line workers with little disruption 29 the new breed packers and processors appear to have developed workforce the demographics of which are somewhat different from that of the older urban packers there are fewer african american males and more hispanic and southeast asian workers often but not always transient lowskilled but hardworking less assertive of their workplace rights than experienced workers and willing to work for low wages under conditions that may be adverse but conditions vary from planttoplant and from one location to another 30

attempts by workers in the packing industries to organize generally their efforts were without success in 1894 during the pullman american railway union strike packinghouse workers engaged in sympathetic walkout31 when the rail strike was broken the packinghouse workers were replaced from among the thousands of unemployed workers who crowded the yards an xious to take any job they could get32 other strikes would follow at first the packers had hired recent immigrants from eastern europebut then they began to use africanamericansat first as strikebreakers and less often as regular workers33 in so doing explains alma herbst the packers tapped an almost inexhaustible supply of cheap labor and secured workforce more resistant to union ization than were the european immigrants34 while the majority of the strikebreakers were white the negro because of his color attracted more than his share of hostility and was associated by many packinghouse workers with the collapse of the strikes35 the labor force was divided roughly into two groups retail butchers and packinghouse workers among the latter was hierarchy of subcrafts workers in the packing houses where unions were formed had invariably unionized along narrow craft lines in the 1880s and 1890s36 but skill was coming to count for less and less and specialization was making the employment of cheaper labor possible

of packinghouse workers still demoralized from the strikes of the 1890s the union faced number of challenges the companies had adopted systematic approach of deskilling packing jobs segmenting the work process so that less expensive workers could be hired given partial training and engaged when needed as replacement workers for those with somewhat greater skills though rational policy from the perspective of industry it complicated the efforts of the union to recruit and hold members 40 at the same time by careful recruitment the packers were able to shift dominance from one racialethnic faction to anotherand to stir tensions between male and female workers41 these managementenhanced divisions within the workforce convinced some workers of the need for industrial crosscraft

numbers could be organized in one swift stroke at the turn of the century little over 25000 workers were employed in chicagos stock yards about third of those employed in the industry nationally donnelly set out to organize the workers and to instruct them in trade union strategy the skilled craft workers were the first organized and remained the core of the union the union sought out the immigrant worker and actively courted africanamerican workers about 500 then employed in the yardsand the latter hesitantly joined the ranks of organized labor 43 organization alone did not erase the

strikebreakers frequently the object of attack with the union financially strapped donnelly sought accommodationand was rebuffed intervention by jane addams chicago social worker and her associates brought an end to the strike but the men were granted concessions from the packers 45 the union was largely fragmented and in 1907 donnelly resigned and left the movement46 for decade few victories appear to have been achieved by the amalgamated in 1917 the united states entered the european war immigration the traditional source of packinghouse labor declined the draft further reduced manpower availability labor shortages were accompanied by heightened demand for meatand the amalgamated reboundedbut under federal wartime regulation the war years also sparked northward migration of southern blacks who in significantly increased numbers took jobs in the packing plants brody states that by some estimates 90 percent of the northern negroes in the chicago yards carried union cards italics added but the newcomers like immigrant groups before them proved difficult to organize and once in the union to retain by the end of the war late in 1918 some 10000 black workers were employed in the yardsover 20 percent of the labor force 47 the postwar period however did not bode well for unions the chicago race riots 1919 added to tensions between black and white workers48 then internal union discord broke out by 1921 the treasury of the amalgamated was depleted wartime restraints vanished unemployment became widespread union membership shrank so in the dead of winter in an effort to rebuild and regain its strength the amalgamated called nationwide strike49 within weeks on february 1 1922 the strike was called off again failed effort the amalgamated reverted largely to

suffered defeats in series of strikes in 1894 1904 and 19211922 the conflicts had been demoralizing and had left the packinghouse side of the union in shambles the depression of 1929 hit the packinghouse industry hard and opened period of social ferment in which radical ideas received wide and sympathetic hearing51 with hundreds at the gate begging for jobs managers could select whom to employ as their whims or prejudices dictated and some managers it appears exacted retribution against workers who had been engaged in strike activity or now attempted to organize52 ethnicracial diversity still prevailed in the plan ts but now these were often workers of second generation see table 1 in their continuing search for cheap labor the packers looked to chicagos expanding afroamerican community53 but these were people who had migrated north during world war i had become acculturated to the industrial workplace and were more supportive of unionization54 by the 1930s

member of the iww the industrial workers of the world organization began59 soon the independent union of all workers iuaw emergedand organization spread throughout austin well beyond the packing plant60 in september 1933 with ellis at its head the iuaw won the right to bargain for the hormel wo rkers after brief lockoutstrike settlement was reached laying the foundation for labormanagement cooperation at the austinbased firm the iuaw then organized network of affili ated unions and supporters in the midwestern meatpacking industry under the banner of industri unionism gradually its influence spread through the upper midwest61 but to sustain its position in austin the iuaw found that it would need to organize the entire industrya task beyond its strength thus it reached out to other independent unions such as the cedar rapidsbased midwest union of all packinghouse workers in early 1936 these groups combined to form the committee for industrial organization in the packing industry still independent but oriented toward the national cio 62

was further complicated by hostilities between the pwoc and the amalgamated only in february 1940 did the pwoc secure its first major contract in 1943 in the context of world war ii the pwoc became the united packinghouse workers of america upwa65 cio organization of the packinghouse workers proved contentious first the emergence of the upwa out of the amalgamated was not entirely clearly drawn some packinghouse workers remained in the amalgamated and more broadly there was the continuing clash often bitter between the afl and the cio second the iuaw had been of the local rankandfile joining the cio jeopardized that tradition and entailed horowitz suggests an alliance with men and women who were sociologically very different 66 the top leadership of the pwoc appointed not elected was from outside the industry while meat packers would come to play leadership role some still viewed the national pwoccio as too far removed from the line and perhaps too preoccupied with nonpackinghouse matters 67 third there was cultural shift ellis out of the iww believed in union democracy shop floor organization direct action an industrial structure and solidarity among all workers recalls peter rachleff68 he states the iuaw had demonstrated how to build lively democratic m ilitant labor movement rooted in local control committed to horizontal solidarity but had not found way to keep this

states failed to achieve the oneparty rule characteristic of american trade unionsa failure some might view as positive under ralph helstein an attorney first upwa general counsel and after 1946 president and ellis the union would be politically liberal and protective of the rights of various racialethnic and political minorities 70 the new labor legislation of the 1930s and 1940s some argue tended to convert unions from bodies of militants to part of the regulatory structure weakening the role of the rankandfile and widening the gulf between workers and the union hierarchy this thesis suggests that unions came to act less as advocates for their members than as buffers mediating between capital and labor the upwa some argue may have been an exception first its origins were strongly of the rank andfile second there was growing africanamerican component within the upwa concerned with civil rights and social justice third acceptance of racial diversity translated easily into

an alliance of black workers and white progressives that allowed the union to expand its program of social unionism into cooperation with the emerging civil rights movement72 as world war ii commenced many afroamericans urged double v campaign for victory over fascism abroad and jim crow at home73 meanwhile many white workers held that interracial solidarity was essential if wages and working conditions were to be improved74 the upwa attacked discrimination both in the shop and in the community and consciously worked with and influenced communitybased organizations especially local branches of the naacp75 after 1943 the upwa negotiated antidiscriminatory provisions in its new national agreements during the war controls had kept wage rates relatively stable even in the face of inflation since the upwa was party to national nostrike pledge there was little opportunity for more direct labormanagement activity with the end of the war however pressure mounted in late 1945 the upwa began to map strategy for wage increasewith some measure of cooperation from the amalgamated when in january 1946 the packers refused the unions wage demands strike was called that was immediately effective 76 ten days into the strike president truman still operating under wartime emergency procedures seized the plants and ordered work to resume the union declined demanding that government guarantee enforcement of any settlement reached through board of inquiry the admini stration agreed and while the locals were not wholly satisfied the settlement provided wage increase77 from across the industrial spectrum management turned to congress and in 1947 the taft hartley act was passed it imposed significant new restraints upon trade union activity and inter alia required union officials to file noncommunist affidavits if their unions were to avail themselves of the services of the national bor relations board for some of the cio unions like the upwa with leftofcenter leadership component the requirement had serious impact78 first in effect it placed the government on the side of the more conservative factions within the union second it deprived these unions it was argued of some of their most talented leaders third where the affidavit requirements were not complied with and the upwa initially refused to do so the nlrb refused to certify the union for collective

some thought ill timed and illadvised although hardfought it lacked the unity and purpose which could keep men out on the streets indefinitely80 in midmay 1948 the union capitulated financially weakened its membership having dropped from about 100000 to about 60000 it faced dozens of legal cases arising out of picket line viol ence as well as the danger of losing nlrb certification at many plants because of election petitions filed by competing unions the debate over noncompliance with tafthartley had come to an end81

amalgamated and the upwa like the afl and the cioto which they were respectively affiliated had remained at odds the unions were divided by philosophy craft versus industrial unionism they had different approaches to the new regulatory structure notably to alleged bias of the nlrb there was disagreement concerning the political role of unions and where along the political spectrum the unions should stand most difficult however may have been conflicts rooted in personal hostilities dating from pwoc days while the upwa was advancing the cause of social unionism new element was emerging on the scene the decline of the old packing firms and emergence of the new breed of packers slowly brody states it became apparent to bo th unions the upwa and the amalgamated that cooperation would be mutually beneficial 82 but he suggests the past was not easy to exorcise83 the new firms emerging during the 1950s and 1960s took large chunks of the market away from the old dominant companies84 technology changed as well and with it what the packinghouse workers actually did where employment once had been stable the new breed firms accepted rapid employee turnover and stru ctured to accommodate it urbantorural transition also meant that fewer africanamerican workers major segment of upwa membership would remain in the industrys workforce85 with its base shrinking

six times its size gorman remained at the helm helstein became titular vice president but without any responsibilities service units regarded as vital within the upwa were disbanded new units subsumed into larger bodies some sugge sted were underfunded and unable to pursue normalprior responsibilities some from the upwa found it difficult to work within the new structure lines of communication were broken up much of the freedom and rankandfile democracy to which the upwa locals had been accustomed was said to have disappeared perhaps most important the merger had occurred in the context of the restructuring of the industry new breed packers were assembling workforce quite different from that associated either with the upwa or with the amalgamatedand one increasingly devoid perhaps by careful personnel selection of trade union consciousness the merged union had to reach out to workforce neither accustomed to trade unionization nor predisposed toward organized labor 87

by the afl in 1890 was neither activist nor especially successful by 1933 it had membership of about 5000 the rciu was hampered by timid conservative leadership either unwilling or unable to take

the ufcw horowitz notes the packinghouse workers became dwindling minority in large multiunit locals covering entire states and headed by local union leaders who came from completely different

america changed during the reaganbush era horowitz suggests with the presidents dismissal of striking air traffic controllers in 1982 which he states encouraged employers to resist the demands of labor organizations it was time of concession bargaining givebacks and the hiring of permanent replacements for workers who struck coupled with steadily declining union strength the period he argues would end in catastrophe for americans packinghouse workers100 by 1980 with ibp and other new breed packers in control of significant segment of the industry old firms argued that production and employment at their plants would decline or cease altogether unless local unions agreed to various cost concessions to help firms deal with the lowcost competition 101 others hinted that work might be shifted to newer plants in remote areasthat happened to be nonunion clearly future bargaining would be fierce potentially involving strikes or lockoutscertainly loss of wages and possibly loss of employment two options were at least theoretically available to the union organize the nonunion firms and bring their labor standards up to the level of those under the old master agreements or grant

upon process of controlled retreat that quickly disintegrated into rout that not only lowered wage rates but also shredded the master agreements and deunionized the core firms of the industry104 the industry side however was even more complex while the union may have tended to react it was management that led some older familyowned and managed firms changed policy with generational shifts in management some sold out others merged or retaining their corporate identity were subsumed into larger entities in some cases corporate officers promoted splits and spinoffs with new more focused firms emerging from older enterprises some even very large firms were acquired by conglomeratesonly to be sold again or simply closed as conditions warranted with each change of corporate control there were usually changes in labormanagement policyoften with demands for concessions and in some cases with closings and relocations of plants consolidation of redundant facilities and dismissal of superfluous workers some observers believed this churning was purposeful beyond immediate profitability management was able to dispose of union agreements restructure work processes and hire less skilled and cheaper workers it bargained with employmentdesperate communities for concessions tax reductions subsidies and exemptions from local ordinances 105

of business strategy both industry and the union had moved in some measure from the world of the creators to that of the managers albeit in somewhat different contexts certain mutual distrust

elements of conflict between labor and management remained the same while the workers sought higher wages and improved condit ions of work industry was pursuing enhanced profitability through lower wage strategy consolidation would be paramount108 contesting with hormel the hormel case perhaps was the most dramatic of the packinghouse conflicts of the late 20th century it was at hormel that the independent union of all workers iuaw had been organized the iuaw had in some respects provided the philosophical core for the pwoc and later the upwa strong labor tradition it appears remained among the hormel workers although relative labormanagement peace seems to have prevailed after the initial confrontation of the early 1930s jay hormel of the companys founder had negotiated the initial agreement with the iuaw but hormel who enjoyed reputation for enlightened labormanagement relations died in 1954 gradually through attrition new management had come to control the company which then encompassed number of plants spread over several states similarly new leadership had emerged within the union by the mid1970s the original austin minnesota plant was old and in need of replacement and after negotiations between management and the union it was agreed that new facility would be built in austin the workers would make number of concessions in order to assure its economic viability certain work rules and production standards would be altered and the union accepted nostrike provision to last through thr ee years from completion of the new plant 109 various factors led to collapse of the agreement protracted negotiations between hormel the local union local p9 and the ufcw seem to have resulted in disagreement between local p9 and the international union ultimately with the aflcioand in contentious strike the latter commencing in august 1985 in may 1986 the ufcws executive committee imposed trusteeship on local p9 and settled the strike the provisions accepted by the national ufcw were reportedly very close to the terms hormel demanded prior to the strike it made provision for reemployment of workers still out when the strike ended 110 with the end of the strike at hormel the mid1980s new officers took control of the local and the labormanagement relationship was resumed but the tone of that relationship appears to have been quite different from that which preceded the strike and some noticed bitterness would linger 111 108 data on wage rates profitability and related elements in this section are drawn from the cited published sources further

opened in storm lake iowa for nearly 20 years it served the local community becoming hygrade food products in 1953 in 1978 in the context of restructuring hygrade nnounced the plant would close permanently if the ufcw did not accept contract concessions the workers refused but the plant remained open two years later hygrade again demanded concessions once more plant management and the union worked out compromise but this time hygrades parent company hanson industries demurred negotiations continued with the city heavily dependent on the packing plant offering concessions in october 1981 hygrade demanded 300 per hour pay cut in all hygrade plants as prerequisite for keeping the storm lake plant open the ufcw refused and the plant closed as result some 500 relatively highwage unionized jobs that formed the backbone of stable local workforce were lost along with 50 management jobs in april 1982 ibp bought the storm lake facility reopening it with what was allegedly substantially reduced wage structure the new ibp plant was said to have operated with about 10 monthly turnover 121 some diverse impacts relocation sites associated with restructuring varied most often they were small towns where the economic impact of plant closing would be severely felt in 1992 for example morrell had closed its beef packing plant in sioux falls south dakota eliminating 400 jobs thus when it threatened to close its pork processing plant in sioux city iowa in fall 1993 with 1300 jobs at issue the threat was taken seriously as closure neared december 1993 morrell received combination of state and local incentives and new fiveyear labor agreement with the unionthe plant remained open 122 again in the early 1980s general host which had bought cudahy packing decade earlier announced its decision to get out of the meat processing business closure was averted and potentially the loss of 1500 jobs when general host sold four plants to management group however during an interim closure and reop ening under new name unionized production workers were terminated and new wage structure imposed123 the practice extended into other segments of the industryand to other regionsas well124 if

terms of efficiency it also affects the communities from which facility moves and into which it relocates the emergence of ibp among the new breed packers iowa beef processors may have had the greatest impact upon the industryand thus upon workers from its beginnings in the early 1960s ibp appears to have made clear that it intended to operate as nearly as possible in non union environment and it developed lowwage strategy if we paid the base rate the union wants an ibp official reportedly stated our whole program would fail 126 the first clash between ibp and the upwa appears to have been at its fort dodge iowa plant in 1965 the contest was relatively brief ending with the intercession of iowas governor127 more critical was 1969 contest soon after the upwaamalgamated merger the union had won certification to represent workers at the ibp flagship plant at dakota city nebraska128 contract would be more difficult to secure with the plant structured to accommodate lessskilled workers the company claimed the union was trying to force skilled rates for relatively unskilled jobs 129 strike was called ibp imported strikebreakers some it appears of mexican descent recruited from the southwestern united states violence erupted130 ultimately the amalgamated secured contract that allowed ibp to keep its pay rates far beneath the master agreement levels131 ibp may have been aware of philosophical and policy divisions within the union following the upwaamalgamated merger and it may have utilized them to its advantage132 then in 1979 the second merger occurred producing the ufcw by the 1980s ibp then owned by occidental petroleum had become the pattern setter in the industry both for operations in general and for wages and working conditions it still operated

initiatives possibly going private leveraged buyout or another business arrangement instead in 2001 tyson acquired ibp reportedly for 47 billion and became the largest meat and poultry company in the world142 by spring 2002 tyson foods had proforma revenues of about 25 billion and more than 300 facilities and offices in 32 states and 22 countries143 the combined company it was said would provide an estimated 23 percent of the us meat and poultry supply while employing 120000 people but it would also have total debt of approximately 5 billion in 2002144 and it would be necessary to integrate two very large companies and the component parts of each labor problems and profit margins despite sizeable expenditures by both ibp and tyson foods and perhaps because of them the firms would be concerned with savings put simply observed analyst nicholas stein tyson is struggling to find enough cheap unskilled labor to staff its processing plants stein pointed to employee turnover between 40 and 100 annually meaning each of the companys 83 plants needs between 400 and 2000 new workers every year 145 ibps bob peterson considered automation ibp will save more than 50 million because of automation this year 2001 he stated but he conceded we will always have to have people146 but which people the industry had been characterized as difficult dirty and dangerous with employees struggling to keep up with the production line the new breed restructuring had brought with it workforce that was paid relatively low wages and was subject to high rates of turnover increasingly stein states both tyson and ibp came to rely on immigrantsmainly from mexico and central america southeast asia was another source of lowwage labor for the industry by the late 1990s the tyson work force

be tough and ornery but if you want to be the best and we are going to be the best you need to have quality and consistency and be the lowcost producer148 labormanagement policy in the meat and poultry industry has not evolved by chance149 for the most part it has been successful from industrys perspectivebut success has not been without costs because of competition firms have tended to seek the cheapest labor available that could meet their needs often racialethnic minorities early in the century employers pitted workers against each other separating them by nationality religion and culture in an apparent effort to keep the cost of labor low and to prevent trade unionization 150 through recent decades waves of hispanics vietnamese laotians and refugees from the balkans have taken jobs in packing and processing plants151 because of their social economic and in some cases immigration status they have willingly accepted hard dirty and sometimes dangerous work at low wagesat least

anderson explained to newsweek reporter in early 1965 we wanted to be able to take boys right off the farm and weve done it153 relocation and recruitment of boys and girls right off the farm however could have collateral benefits for companies ie escape from unionized urban labor markets with collective bargaining high wages and existing work rules but local recruitmenteven for firms disposed to recruit locallyproved difficult new plant requiring hundreds of workers could quickly exhaust the local labor supply thus outside recruitment was almost inevitable154 for an employer hiring locally may not have been desirable successor firm retaining predecessors workforce could be inviting troubleespecially where the old firm had operated under union contract since some new breed firms sought to operate nonunion and to pay low wages clash would be almost assured experienced employees would likely resist change workforce of newcomers new to the area and perhaps to the world of work would allow greater flexibility155 the demographics and character of the post1960s meatpacking workforce seem to have differed from that of midcentury with unionization the old workforce prior to the 1960s had shifted from transient largely immigrant to greater stability permanent residents with roots in the community there was also shift from mainly white workforce to one more heavily africanamerican women had always worked in the pa cking industry but with new technology and systematic deskilling they would come to be more widely employed 156 several changes in the relocated industry poult ry presents some exceptions seem evident from the literature dealing with the post1960s era first the packinghouse workforce seems to have become less black there were few africanamer icans in the rural midwestern communities to which the industry migrated few urban workerse ither whites or africanamericansappear to have followed the migrating industry157 second increasingly packers and later poultry processors began recruitment from outside the area of production largely southeast asians and hispanicsbut other immigrants as well these recruits often unfamiliar with american labor law lacked personal resources and community ties and if unauthorized to be employed were vulnerable to exploitation third where these newcomers were from preindustrial societies 153 newsweek mar 8 1965 p 76 154

africanamericans have continued to be employed in poultry processing value added work and the seafood industry they have tended to be working women the urbantorural shift seems frequently to have been

and highly competitive industry high turnover may not be accidental some would argue that worker retention may be neither desirablenor profitable ultimately their concern is not about stable work force states mark grey of the university of northern iowa but maintaining transient work force169 since both poultry and beef processing have become extremely competitive it may not be surprising that

recruit mexicans and southeast asians and supplement them with growing numbers of single mothers from rural areas such practices it is argued have impeded unionization and promoted workforce instability170 firms may cut costs with low wages minimum benefits and critics argue high turnover some companies offer yearly bonuses but these are often not paid until employees have worked for full calendar year the same can be said of paid vacations with the reportedly high turnover rate some workers do not make it long enough to qualify 171 healthcare may pose similar problem some workers cannot enroll until four to six months depending on the plant after they are employed with high turnover some may never qualify to avoid employee insurance claims companies commonly find excuses to fire workers who show signs of debilitating injury according to critic janet benson172 with high turnover some assert responsibility for workrelated disability can be shifted to the workers home country since the workers may have left the united states before serious conditions develop173 some conditions may simply go unreported and untreated174 union avoidance may also result from high turnover with rotating workforce many employers acquire continuing obligation to their employee s but workers some suggest may be similarly affected they may view their work as temporar not as career their immediate concern is economic survival and if possible capital accumulation175 mexican workers observes arthur campa are not only isolated from mainstream anglo american life but they are separate from the native mexican american community as well when they lose their jobs they move on sometimes returning to mexico176 their awareness of their rights may be slight and contacts with

counsel why not mr walker we found very little correlation between turnover and profitability an employee leaves for whatever reason generally were able to have replacement employee and i might add that the way fringe benefits have been negotiated or installed they favor longterm employees for instance insurance as you know is very costly insurance is not available to new employees until theyve worked there for period of year or in some cases six months vacations dont accrue until the second year there are some economies frankly that result from hiring new employees 179 but some industry

secretary and i are the only americans the only white folk and the only english speakers in the room spanish predominates but is not the only foreign language lao is heard from couple in the corner and threesome from the marshall islands are speaking polynesian language striffler would later observe about threequarters of plant labor force are latin american with southeast asians and marshallese accounting for large percentage of the remaining workers usborn workers he adds are few and far between186 when operating laborintensive facility in sparsely populated area labor scarcity might be anticipated187 if an employer has determined in so far as possible to work unionfree and to avoid hiring workers with trade union backgrounds that might further reduce the pool from which firm can recruit the recruiting process may be further limited and focused by policy of payment of low wages for work that is unpleasant dirty and dangerous if recruitment for such jobs is directed toward persons of limited work experience few marketable skills and slight english language proficiency then demographic shift may not be unexpected in pursuit of such strategy critics suggest firms deliberately recruit immigrants who almost universally lack any knowledge of us working conditions labor practices or of their legal rights 188 at the same time some suggest that with active recruitment and serious retention efforts american workers could be found189 the issue may have been one of definition of distinguishing between shortages that are absolute and those that may be

the united states with the intention of working191 even adverse working conditions and low wages may be better than those offered in the immigrants country of origin as result new arrivals may have low expectations and be willing to endure conditions both at work and of home life that american workers would not willingly tolerate192 the presence of hispanics in the meat processing workforce according to griffith is correlated with lower wage rates and lower numbers of africanamerican workers while asians occupy small place in most work forces he observes they occupy revered position in many processors minds as embodying the quintessential wo rk ethic but he states asians are more upwardly mobile taking advantage of refugee services to improve english skills and move into better paying jobs193 from interviews with plant managers and personnel officers griffith found the clearest theme was the belief that hispanics and asians have superior work habits while those of blacks and whites have been deteriorating it may be that white and africanamerican workers from experience in the industrial workforce are less willing to adhere to managerial preferences conversely those less familiar with american work practices and labor law may be less demanding as immigrants become acclimated they can be expected to move on to better jobs creating continuing demand for replacements some assert that this provides an incentive for employers to hire unauthorized immigrants who may more willingly cooperate with employers because they cannot legally work in the united states 194

involving blood unpleasant odors and repetitive tasks is not attractive to us workers197 but other factors including low wages high line speeds little job security ruralsited facilities and diminished union protection may also make domestic recruitment difficult decline in wage levels together with other workplace considerations broadway says has served to make meatpacking an unattractive employment option for many americans198 the issue may not be reluctance of americans to work at these jobs clearly many are so employed rather it may be the terms of employment if the job were decent some critics argue they would willingly do it199 some employers agree joe luter ceo of smithfield foods inc suggests that solution to industrys recruitment problem may be higher wages which would make processing jobs more attractive to american workers200 in practice immigrants and aliens unauthorized to work in the united states constitute an almost inexhaustible supply of lowwage labor201 in this view once employers become accustomed to the flow of new immigrants202 they may continue to recruit themoften at the expense of native workersand of less recent immigrants of whatever ethnicracial background203 bonacich concludes that availability of cheap labor alternative has enabled employers to avoid improving the job and raising wages204 what really needs to be addressed argues joe berra of the mexicanamerican legal defense and education fund is our immigration policy on one hand and workers rights on the other 205 meanwhile employers have organized in order to procure more workers

with the prosperity of the 1990s according to ibp historian rodengen the economy entered one of its strongest periods on record and unemploym ent dropped drasticallyto below 3 in iowa and nebraska for some packers he states this apparently meant dealing with illegal immigrants who were seeking to fill the many open positions in company plants employing such workers while attempting to secure an adequate supply of labor he suggests may have been inadvertent further he states ibp had been prohibited by law from asking too many questions about background which meant it often couldnt get the information it needed to prevent an illegal immigrant from getting hired 208 during the 1990s by estimates of former immigration and naturalization service ins officer209 about 25 of packingprocessing workers may have been persons unauthorized to work in the united states and employed in violation of us immigration law210 some have suggested that the largest concentration of illegally employed persons in the us work in the meatpacking industry211 according to stull et this reflects both targeted recruitment and the character and enforcement of immigration laws212 but even were immigration laws enforced more strictly compliance would be difficult with high employee turnover rates varying roughly from 40 and 100 per year effective enforcement would require continuing federal presence even small measure of collusion between an empl oyer and worker employed illegally could arguably defeat such efforts213 206 see the website of the essential worker immigration co alition

the illegal employment of foreign workers should not adversely impact us citizen s or others authorized to work in the united states214 thus some packing plants may have had to walk fine line during

the department had longterm goal of increasing compliance with labor laws italics added it would focus he affirmed on the low wage industries because they have historically high level of noncompliance and employ vulnerable workers who often wont complain about violation of their workplace rights217 coping with such concerns continues to be department goal although its achievement may not be easy and may involve prodding from sources outside the department it may also involve extended litigation the problem is at least twofold defining precisely what the law provides and thereafter determining

the late 1980s the treatment of chicken catchers has been focus of labor management dispute and of litigation as the century closed the issue was still before the courts but gradually the status of the workers has become clearer judge william nickerson the us district court for the district of maryland found that the processor controls every significant aspect of the chicken catching operation dlr summarized the company owns the chickens it owns the trucks on which they are transported and it determines from which farm and how many chickens are to be brought in each day 232 judge nickerson found although geographically their work takes them outside the processing plants the catchers function in real sense is simply part of the production line 233 with time some firms have settled disputed claims with respect to flsa and related coverage others continued to challenge the departments interpretation of the law the contests in varying forms and jurisdictions have moved slowly through the courtsand new issues have been raised the question of fair labor standards for meat and poultry workers however has not yet been fully resolved234

through domestic recruitment and employment of authorized immigrant workers control of the workplace rests essentially with managementeven where there is effective collective bargaining however even without formal union presence workers can be expected to demand reforms where such reforms are not fo rthcoming workers may turn to the trade union movement for assistance and redress at the same time it is possible that industry will undertake changesif only to prevent trade union initiatives and to stave off government action if voluntary change is not forthcoming given the results of the
