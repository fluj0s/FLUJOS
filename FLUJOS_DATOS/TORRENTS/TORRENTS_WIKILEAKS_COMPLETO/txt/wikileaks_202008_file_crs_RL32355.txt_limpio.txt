adjustments summary federal whitecollar employees are to receive an annual pay adjustment and localitybased comparability payment effective in january of each year under section 529 of pl 101509 the federal employees pay comparability act fepca of 1990 the law has never been implemented as originally enacted annual and locality payments have been reduced in january 2005 they received 25 annual pay adjustment and 10 localitybased comparability payment under executive order 13368 issued by president george w bush on december 30 2004 although the federal pay adjustments are sometimes referred to as costofliving adjustments neither the annual adjustment nor the locality payment is based on measures of the cost of living the annual pay adjustment is based on the employment cost index eci which measures change in privatesector wages and salaries the index showed that the annual acrosstheboard increase would be 25 in january 2005 the size of the locality payment is determined by the president and is based on comparison of nonfederal and general schedule gs salaries in 32 pay areas nationwide by law the disparity between nonfederal and federal salaries was to be gradually reduced to 5 over the years 1994 through 2002 fepca requires that amounts payable may not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5 in january 2005 the federal salary council and the pay agent recommended that to carry out fepca the 2005 locality payments range from 1814 in the rest of the united states rus pay area to 4796 in the san josesan francisco pay area the payment recommended for the washington dc pay area was 2966 because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the change in locality rates is derived by comparing 2004 locality payments with those recommended for 2005 this comparison results in recommended net increases for 2005 if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as required by law of 919 in the rus pay area to 2210 in the san josesan francisco pay area and 1594 in the washington dc pay area the nationwide average net pay increase if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as

pay would be considered as basic pay in computing danger pay allowances and post differentials for certain employees who are temporarily assigned to foreign areas and for whom the department of state has established allowances for danger14 the localitybased comparability payments procedure was established by fepca it provides that payments are to be made within each locality determined to have nonfederalfederal pay disparity greater than 5 when uniformly applied to gs employees within locality the adjustment is intended to make their pay rates substantially equal in the aggregate to those of nonfederal workers for the same levels of work in the same locality fepca authorizes the president to fix an alternative level of localitybased comparability payments if because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare he considers the level that would otherwise be payable to be inappropriate at least one month before these comparability payments would be payable by november 30 2004 he would have to prepare and transmit to congress report describing the alternative level of payments he intended to provide including the reasons why this alternative level would be necessary15 president bush issued an alternative plan on november 29 2004 stating that the locality pay percentages authorized in 2004 would remain in effect in 200516 see the discussion under the presidents recommendation below bureau of labor statistics bls surveys under the law the bls conducts surveys that document nonfederal rates of pay in each pay area in january 2005 there will be 32 pay areas nationwide until october 1996 the surveys were conducted under the occupational compensation survey program ocsp which had been approved by the federal salary council

locality payments phasein of ncs survey data was approved and this phasein will continue for january 2005 by applying weight of 75 to ncs results and weight of 25 to ocsp results the survey results are submitted to the office of personnel management opm which serves as the staff to the federal salary council and the pay agent opm documents federal rates of pay in each of the pay areas and compares nonfederal and gs salaries by grade for each pay area the average salaries at each grade both federal and nonfederal are then aggregated and compared to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area by law the disparity between nonfederal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5 therefore the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to this level each year by opm this adjusted gap is called the target gap fepca also stipulates that certain percentage of the target gap between gs average salaries and nonfederal average salaries in each pay area is to be closed each year twenty percent of the gap was closed in 1994 the first year of locality pay as authorized by fepca an additional 10 of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter meaning that 30 of the gap was to be closed in 1995 40 in 1996 50 in 1997 60 in 1998 70 in 1999 80 in 2000 and 90 in 2001 in each of these years the locality pay increase has been implemented at much lower percentage reducing the gap slowly 235 of the gap was closed in 1995 259 in 1996 283 in 1997 292 in 1998 31 in 1999 335 in 2000 381 in 2001 423 in 2002 44 in 2003 and 537 in 2004 these percentages represent the gap as recalculated after each adjustment by january 2002 and continuing each year thereafter fepca specified that amounts payable could not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5 this percentage is applied to the target gap in each pay area to determine the locality rates recommended by the pay agent to the president after receiving advice from the federal salary council17 the pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adjustment thus march 2003 gaps determine the january 2005 locality payments due to the fact that the ncs surveys were not approved for use in determining the january 2000 january 2001 january 2002 and january 2003 locality payments that the ncs surveys were being phased in for the january 2004 locality payments and that the phasein continues for the january 2005 locality payments the gaps were determined by the following means the march 2003 gaps were determined by using the most recent ocsp survey data and ncs survey data which ranged from december 2001 through october 2002 for each pay area since 17 the council comprises nine members members generally recognized for their impartiality knowledge and experience in labor relations and pay policy are terri lacy chair mary mcnally rose vicechair and rudy joseph maestas the other members represent the american federation of government employees vacant pending appointment expected to be national president john gage the national treasury employees union colleen m kelley the national federation of federal employees richard n brown the american federation of government employees aflcio vacant pending appointment the association of civilian technicians thomas g bastas and the fraternal order of police james pasco crs6 the bls had discontinued the ocsp program in october 1996 the ocsp pay survey data for some of the largest pay areas were about eight years old specifically the new york data were as of july 1995 the washington dc data were as of october 1995 and the angeles data were as of november 1995 survey data for each of the other pay areas varied from january 1996 to november 1996 the data for the rest of the united states pay area were as of november 1996 in its report on the 2005 locality payments the pay agent explained how the pay gaps were determined stating that to ensure that local pay disparities are measured as of one common date it is necessary to age the bls survey data using the eci based on wages and salaries for whitecollar civilian workers excluding those in sales to common reference date march 2003 before comparing them to gs pay data of the same date18 report of the federal salary council the council reported the following results from the application of this methodology as of march 2003 the overall gap between gs average salaries excluding existing locality payments special rates and certain other payments and nonfederal average salaries was 3182 the amount needed to reduce this disparity to 5 as mandated by fepca averages 2554 for 2005 the calculation of the pay gaps excludes existing locality payments after considering the 1212 average locality rate paid in 2003 the overall average pay gap in 2003 was 175719 locality payments in order to meet the target for closing the pay gap the council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 1814 in the rest of the united states rus pay area to 4796 in the san josesan francisco pay area the payment recommended for the washington dc pay area is 2966 because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the change in locality rates is derived by comparing 2004 locality payments with those recommended for 2005 this comparison results in recommended net increases for 2005 if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as required by law of 919 in the rus pay area to 2210 in the san josesan francisco pay area and 1594 in the washington dc pay area the nationwide average net pay increase if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as required by law would have been 1306 in 2005 locality pay areas and boundaries for 2005 the council recommended continuation of 29 of the 32 locality pay areas that existed in 2004 the kansas city orlando and st louis locality pay areas were recommended to become part of the rest of the united states pay area as discussed below under the section on locations with pay gaps below rus the council also recommended that the new office of management and budget omb definitions for metropolitan statistical areas be used to define locality pay area boundaries under this recommendation the 18 report on localitybased comparability payments

combined statistical areas csas would be used the new micropolitan statistical areas would be used only when part of larger csas and the omb definitions for counties in new england would be used20 locations with pay gaps below the rest of the united states pay area in previous years the council recommended that areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in rus receive the same adjustment as rus under the methodology which has been used since locality pay was first implemented in 1994 areas with little data available in bls surveys and pay gaps that were twotenths of percentage point 02 or more below rus or below the rus pay area for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas and the resources used to conduct these surveys were to be redirected to survey new locations under the ocsp surveys pay gaps in four areas huntsville indianapolis kansas city and orlando are below rus in 2003 and have been below or close to rus for several years under the ncs surveys pay gaps in five areas columbus dayton kansas city orlando and st louis are below rus in 2003 kansas city orlando and st louis are below rus under the weighted averages of both the ocsp and ncs surveys for 2005 the council recommended that salary surveys in these areas be discontinued and that the three areas become part of rus the resources previously used to conduct surveys in kansas city orlando and st louis would be used to carry out surveys in as many of the following locations as possible phoenixmesascottsdale az msa memphis tnmsar msa austinround rock tx msa louisvilleelizabethtownscottsberg kyin csa buffalocheektowagatonawanda ny msa and raleighdurhamcary nc csa these six areas have more than 2500 general schedule gs employees nonfarm workforce of more than 375000 and bls pay differential of greater than five percent when compared to the rus pay differential the additional areas listed above are ranked by gs employment totals the council recommended that the additional areas be surveyed in the order in which they are listed21 evaluating areas in the vicinity of locality pay areas to evaluate areas currently in the rest of the united states pay area for possible inclusion in adjacent locality pay areas the council recommended the following criteria for adjacent msas and csas to be included in an adjacent locality pay area an adjacent msa or csa currently in the rus locality pay area must have at 20 since the implementation of locality pay in 1994 the definitions of metropolitan statistical areas msas established by the office of management and budget have been used by the pay agent to establish the boundaries for locality pay areas in june 2003 omb published new definitions for msas based on the 2000 census and newly revised criteria for discussion of the councils and the pay agents consideration of the new omb definitions see crs report rl31823 federal whitecollar pay fy2004 salary adjustments by barbara l schwemle 21 2005 federal salary council report pp 34 crs8 least 1500 gs employees and an employment interchange measure22 of at least 75 percent for adjacent counties that are not part of multicounty msa or csa to be included in an adjacent locality pay area an adjacent county that is currently in the rus locality pay area must have at least 400 gs employees and an employment interchange measure of at least 75 percent for federal facilities that cross locality pay area boundaries to be included in an adjacent locality pay area that portion of federal facility outside of higherpaying locality pay area must have at least 750 gs employees the duty stations of the majority of these employees must be within 10 miles of the separate locality pay area and significant number of these employees must commute to work from the higherpaying locality pay area23 for counties currently included in an msabased locality pay area that would be excluded under the new msa and csa definitions to continue to be included in the locality pay area any county or portion of county in the case of york county where the full county was never in the adjacent locality pay area must have an employment interchange rate of at least 15 24 the council also recommended that areas already included in locality pay area as result of the new criteria should not be subject to further review25 requests for changes in locality pay area boundaries under another council recommendation requests for changes in the boundaries of locality pay areas to be considered by the council would have to include the following information the credentials of the requesting group establishing how the group represents gs employees in the area identification of the geographic area covered by the proposal the number of gs employees in the area by agency detailed explanation of why the area should be added to the adjacent locality pay area current job vacancy rates in the area for gs positions documentation of recruitment or retention problems for gs employees in the area 22 the council recommended that commuting rates be calculated using the employment interchange measure which is defined by the census as measure of the ties between two adjacent entities it is the sum of the percentage of employed residents of the smaller entity who work in the larger entity and the percentage of the employment in the smaller entity that is accounted for by workers who reside in the larger entity 2005 federal salary council report p 7 23 2005 federal salary council report p 7 24 report on localitybased

recommended that five improvements be made in the bls national compensation survey program the council provided progress report on the improvements in its memorandum to the pay agent on the 2005 locality payments the improvements and progress to date are the following use three factors rather than nine to assign the correct federal grade levels to the nonfederal jobs surveyed and provide grade level guides for occupational families opm has completed development of fourfactor evaluation system for use in the surveys and bls has successfully used the new approach in field tests and has already begun to use the knowledge factor guide bls will begin to phase the new approach into bls surveys in the next survey cycle develop model to estimate missing data bls has designed and implemented an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in the surveys the model is derived from survey data and estimates pay for missing jobs as function of location occupation and grade level improve the matching of federal survey jobs with nonfederal survey jobs and provide subcategories for occupations which are not elsewhere classified opm formed an interagency working group that developed crosswalk between federal job classifications and the new standard occupational classification system bls used the new crosswalk for data delivered this year for supervisory occupations grade the highest level of work supervised adjust the grade level based on the level of supervision instead of grading the supervisory job itself bls and pay agent staffs have designed new approach based on grading the highest level of work supervised and adding one two or three grades based 26 2005 federal salary council report p 10 crs10 on the level of supervision bls will begin to phase in the new approach in surveys conducted in the next survey cycle develop criteria to identify and exclude jobs that would be classified above gs15 in government bls has developed methods for identifying and excluding nonfederal jobs that would be classified above gs15 these data were excluded from the data delivered to the pay agent in 200327 pay agent report after considering the councils recommendations the pay agent endorsed them in its december 4 2003 annual report to the president on the 2005 locality payments the pay agent stated that it would be unwise to allow the locality pay increases shown in its report to take effect in january 2005 because of the current national emergency28 the endorsement of the councils recommendations on defining locality pay areas was tentatively approved according to the pay agent opm on the agents behalf will publish notice in the federal register in 2004 to explain the proposed changes to the locality pay area boundaries and solicit public comments the final rule will be published in time for implementation in january 200529 on september 22 2004 opm published proposed regulations in the federal register to link the definitions of general schedule locality pay area boundaries to the geographic scope of metropolitan area definitions established by omb this proposal makes use of new criteria for evaluating areas adjacent to locality pay areas the proposed regulations would retain all of the existing locality pay areas which would be expanded to include number of additional locations30 according to opm under the proposed changes about 1500031 general schedule gs employees would move from the rest of the united states pay area to metropolitan locality pay areas and about 16000 gs employees would be retained in metropolitan locality pay areas that would have been excluded if only the new msa definitions were used32 opm accepted comments on the proposed regulations through november 8 2004 27 the

opm noted that on october 21 2004 the federal salary council recommended to the pay agent that the yorkhanovergettysburg pa csa having met the criteria for inclusion be added to the washingtonbaltimore locality pay area the pay agent endorsed this recommendation and it was incorporated into the final rule33 the pay agent estimated that the cost of the january 2005 localitybased comparability payments would be about 8 billion if the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5 were provided in january 2005 as required by fepca34 table 1 shows the councils and the pay agents recommended locality payments for january 2005 as for the recommended improvements in the bls national compensation survey program the pay agent reiterated that those focused on matching federal and nonfederal jobs excluding randomly selected nonfederal jobs that would be classified above gs15 in the government and problems associated with random selection of survey jobs have been implemented improvements focused on assigning gs grades to randomly selected survey jobs and to randomly selected survey jobs with supervisory duties will be phasedin beginning in 200435 in endorsing the councils recommendation that kansas city orlando and st louis become part of the rest of the united states pay area the pay agent asked the bls to discontinue salary surveys

crs12 opm on behalf of the pay agent will publish proposed regulations to implement this recommendation in 200538 the pay agent stated that while it supported updating the boundaries of locality pay areas such changes were an interim measure pending fundamental reforms in the federal whitecollar pay system the agent has serious concerns about the utility of process that requires single percentage adjustment in the pay of all whitecollar civilian federal employees in each locality pay area without regard to the differing labor markets for major occupational groups or the performance of individual employees39 the methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since fepcas enactment in 1993 draft memorandum from the pay agent to the federal salary council concluded that the current methodology is flawed because the completeness of the data varies greatly among survey areas because the gaps are not credible in light of other labor market indicators and because the single percentage adjustment for all jobs in locality is poor reflection of market realities40 despite these concerns opm has never submitted legislative proposal to congress to amend fepca white paper on compensation issued by opm in april 2002 reviewed current policies and the need for more flexibility in setting general schedule pay but did not include any recommendations41 in august 2004 the coalition for effective change42 released paper which strongly endorsed implementation of payforperformance system in the federal government among the factors the group identified as essential to establishing such system are that it be flexible reviewable periodically evaluated and adjusted and adequately funded43 reform of the federal governments pay and performance management

general schedule gs is increased by the annual adjustment percentage resulting in new gs schedule these new basic gs rates are then increased by the locality payment the resulting pay rates annual locality are compared with the 2004 pay rates annual locality to derive the net increase in pay for 2005 the presidents recommendation for fy2005 president george w bush issued his administrations fy2005 budget on february 2 2004 the budget proposed 15 federal civilian pay adjustment but did not state how the increase would be allocated between the annual and locality adjustments required by fepca in january 200545 the statutory annual pay adjustment required in january 2005 is 25 if the president wanted to change the required rate of the annual adjustment he would have had to submit an alternative plan for the annual adjustment to congress by september 1 2004 he did not issue an alternative plan to change the amount of localitybased comparability payments he had to submit an alternative plan for the locality payments to congress by november 30 2004 otherwise the doubledigit percentages stated in the pay agent report for the locality payments would have become effective the president issued such an alternative plan on november 29 2004 which stated that the locality pay percentages in effect for 2004 would continue for 2005 according to the president he issued the plan because the nation is in the midst of national emergency which includes operations in afghanistan and iraq and the locality pay adjustments required by law would divert resources from and interfere with our nations ability to fight the war on terror he stated that the locality payments would average 106 percent would cost about 98 billion in fy2005 and when coupled with the 25 annual adjustment would result in an overall average pay increase of some 131 this increase said the president would far exceed the 15 pay adjustment that he proposed in the fy2005 budget and since the additional amount would have to be absorbed could result in agencies having to freeze hiring the alternative plan notes that the quit rate for the federal government is at an all time low of 16 percent per year well below the overall average quit rate in private enterprise and that recruitment and retention bonuses and special salary rates are available to address any staffing difficulties46

targeted to meet specific recruitment or retention needs as an eventuality for the federal workforce according to him today we have targeted not widespread recruitment and retention problems in our civilian workforce and pay surveys reveal that we are currently overpaying employees in some occupational groups in some locations we certainly should not grant all civilian employees the same increase matter what the need because that wouldnt be focusing on the desired result that would be providing too small an increase where we do have recruitment and retention problems and too large an
